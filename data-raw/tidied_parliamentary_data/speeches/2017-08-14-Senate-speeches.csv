Senator McALLISTER

 (
New South Wales
—
Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate
) (
10:48
):  Australia faces evolving national security threats to our critical infrastructure in an increasingly uncertain international environment. This includes the risk of espionage, sabotage and foreign interference with our telecommunications infrastructure, and this is the subject of this bill.


As stated in the explanatory memorandum, telecommunications networks, systems and facilities are critical infrastructure, and they are vital to the delivery and support of other critical infrastructure and services such as power, water and health. The telecommunications sector also forms the backbone of other sectors such as energy, banking and finance. To quote the explanatory memorandum:


A serious compromise of the telecommunications sector would have a cascading effect on other critical infrastructure sectors and significantly impact the Australian economy.


Our telecommunications companies are already voluntarily working with the government to ensure that Australia's critical infrastructure is safe from foreign interference, threats or espionage. This bill puts a framework around that working relationship to ensure that both government and industry know what is required to keep Australians safe and what is expected of them to ensure that these measures are taken. It also protects against the possibility that such goodwill may not be voluntarily forthcoming from all telecommunication companies at some future point. The explanatory memorandum is explicit about the regulatory approach. The proposed regulatory framework recognises the value of a formal relationship between government and industry but, importantly, it aims to achieve national security outcomes on a cooperative basis rather than through the formal exercise of regulatory powers.


This bill is the result of several years of negotiation and cooperation between the government and the telecommunications industry, arising from a broader review of national security issues by the previous Labor government in 2012. It implements the recommendations of two separate inquiries by the PJCIS in 2013 and 2015. In 2013, the PJCIS examined telecommunications security as part of its inquiry into potential reforms of Australia's national security legislation. It was recommended that the government create a telecommunications security framework in recognition of threats to Australia's national security that can be effected through the telecommunications system. In 2015, as part of its inquiry into the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill, the PJCIS again supported telecommunications sector security reforms and recommended that the government ensure that a framework be enacted prior to the implementation of the data retention regime. That was in April this year. These reforms were also subject to two rounds of public consultation on exposure draft legislation.


This bill seeks to provide a proportionate and escalating framework for addressing national security risks. It seeks to strengthen existing arrangements, including information sharing between government and industry. It seeks to provide increased visibility to government of national security risks and to provide greater certainty for industry about government expectations with respect to protecting networks and facilities from unauthorised interference and unauthorised access. The key elements of the bill include establishing a security obligation applicable to all carriers and carriage service providers and intermediaries, requiring them to do their best to protect their networks and facilities from unauthorised access and interference. It requires carriers and nominated carriage service providers to notify the communications access coordinator of planned key changes to telecommunications services or systems that could compromise their ability to comply with this security obligation, and notifications may be provided in the form of either an individual notification or an annual security capability plan. It provides the Attorney-General with the power to issue carriers or carriage service providers with a direction requiring them to do, or refrain from doing, a specified thing in order to manage security risks. It empowers the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to request information from carriers and carriage service providers to monitor their compliance with the security obligation, and it expands the operation of existing civil enforcement mechanisms in the Telecommunications Act 1997 to address noncompliance with the obligations set out in the bill.


As I noted earlier, the bill is the result of a process that was commenced by the former Labor government in 2012, and Labor has worked consistently with government to ensure our security agencies have the powers they need to keep Australians safe. This bill will provide our security agencies with the powers and tools they need to ensure that our telecommunications networks are protected from malicious actors. We take a bipartisan stance on national security legislation. In this context, we closely scrutinise all national security legislation through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


The bill was introduced to the Senate on 9 November 2016 and was referred to the PJCIS for scrutiny and review. The committee received eight submissions and four supplementary submissions from industry, government and academia. The PJCIS held two public hearings on 16 February 2017 and one public hearing on 23 March 2017 as well as receiving private briefings from relevant agencies in Canberra. The committee has also recently visited Telstra's Global Operations Centre in Melbourne.


The PJCIS's report on this bill made 12 substantive recommendations for improvements to the bill, to the explanatory memorandum and to the administrative guidelines that accompany the bill. Subject to these 12 recommendations being implemented, the committee recommended that the bill be passed. Labor supports the PJCIS recommendations, as we believe they improve the operation of the bill. We note that the government has also agreed to all of these recommendations.


I'd like to briefly discuss the recommendations and their effect on certain elements of the bill. Under existing legislation, the Attorney-General has the power to direct a carrier or a carriage service provider to cease its services on security grounds. This power has never been exercised. As acknowledged in the bill's explanatory memorandum, the use of this power as presently drafted may have a severe impact on innocent users of non-complying telecommunications companies as well as on Australia's economy and telecommunications infrastructure. Appropriately, this bill increases the safeguards around the use of that power. It adds a requirement that ASIO must have issued an adverse security assessment before it can be exercised and it ensures that a decision to issue a direction can be subject to judicial review.


To provide the possibility of a more proportionate response, the bill also grants the Attorney-General the power to direct a carrier or a carriage service provider to do or to refrain from doing a specified act or thing within a specified period to eliminate or reduce risks that are prejudicial to security. The types of things that the Attorney-General can direct a carrier or a carriage service provider to do must be reasonably necessary to reduce or eliminate the risk of unauthorised access or interference. There are also a number of safeguards around the use of this power. It cannot be exercised without an adverse security assessment, and the Attorney-General must be satisfied before issuing a direction that all reasonable steps have been taken to reach agreement between the government and the provider and to consult the affected carrier or carriage service provider in good faith. At recommendation 8 of its report, the PJCIS recommended that it be made clear that the Attorney-General will take into account whether the Communications Access Coordinator has complied with the applicable statutory time frame prior to issuing a direction. And, as I indicated earlier, the government has accepted that recommendation.


During the PJCIS inquiry, industry stakeholders raised concerns that the bill did not place an obligation on the government to proactively brief industry about possible threats and attacks. In their submission, Optus noticed that it would be challenging for industry to notify the government about possible vulnerabilities in their networks or infrastructure when industry may not be aware of specific threat or risk information. While noting that government already has a range of mechanisms to collaborate with industry, the PJCIS recommended that the Attorney-General's Department work collaboratively with industry to further develop this and to ensure effective and regular information sharing—in particular, sharing threat information with industry.


A key issue that was raised through the PJCIS hearings relates to the security of retained telecommunications data that is stored offshore. The Attorney-General's Department advised that the law does not currently compel telecommunications providers to tell the government where retained data is stored. The draft administrative guidelines for the bill note:


Offshoring raises security concerns because it enables access and control to critical parts of major Australian telecommunications networks outside of Australia, this can facilitate foreign intelligence collection (espionage) and disrupt the network itself (sabotage). Risks arise where control and supervision arrangements have the potential to allow unauthorised actions by third parties, such as theft of customer data or sabotage of the network.


The PJCIS expressed concern in its report on the bill that existing laws do not provide government with visibility about where and how data is being stored and emphasised that it is critical that the Australian community can have confidence in the telecommunications sector, especially the security of stored data. Pleasingly, the government has accepted the associated recommendation, specifically recommendation 10, where the PJCIS recommended that their review of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act be expanded to include consideration of the security of offshore telecommunications data that is retained by a service provider for the purpose of the data-retention regime.


I note also recommendation 11, which recommends the bill be amended to include, in relation to that retained data, a specific obligation within the notification requirement in proposed section 314A to require carriers and carriage service providers to notify the communications access coordinator of any new or amended offshoring arrangements.


During the course of the PJCIS inquiry, the committee heard feedback from stakeholders about the scope and application of the bill, including concerns regarding which provisions, if any, should apply to providers of over-the-top services. At recommendations 1, 2, 4 and 5 of its report, the committee suggested amendments that address these questions around scope and application, including to make clear what a company's security obligations are in circumstances where a company is providing or selling an over-the-top service, where telecommunications infrastructure is used but not necessarily owned or operated by the company, where a company's infrastructure is located in a foreign country and uses its services to carry or store information from Australian customers or where a company provides cloud computing and cloud storage solutions. The recommendations also seek to put in place arrangements to make clear that the bill does not apply to certain broadcasters, to clarify the sorts of changes that require notifications to the communications access coordinator and to outline the application process for exemptions from notification requirements. These have been accepted by the government. 


Finally, at recommendation 6, 7, 9 and 12 of its report, the committee recommended a number of accountability measures. These recommendations include making it clear that the bill does not affect the operation of existing legislated privacy; clarifying the reporting requirement to parliament, including those matters which must be addressed in the report; outlining the avenues available for industry to recover reasonable costs in certain circumstances; expanding the scope of PJCIS's review of the data retention regime; and introducing a new requirement that PJCIS review the operation, effectiveness and implications of these reforms within three years. These recommendations, which again have been accepted by the government, supplement the measures already enabled by the bill, including the ability for carriers and carriage service providers to seek merits review before the Administration Appeals Tribunal, where an ASIO adverse security assessment has been made. 


Labor is pleased that the government has accepted all the recommendations of the PJCIS for improvements to this bill and commends the bill to the Senate. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,4,1
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-08-14,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:02):  The Greens have been standing firmly against the government's agenda of warrantless, mass surveillance of Australian people for over five years. We have been standing up for basic human rights of Australian citizens—rights like privacy and correspondence without arbitrary or unlawful interference. Throughout this time, both the coalition and Labor governments, locked in zombie lock step, have engaged in a continual barrage of attacks against the rights of the Australian people. Both the establishment parties have stood united in their disregard for human rights, using fearmongering about national security as an excuse to continually strip back the rights of ordinary Australian people. The telecommunications sector security reforms, the TSSR, proposed in Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 require telecommunications carriers and carriage service providers to detect telecommunications infrastructure in the national interest. 


The office of the Attorney-General have the power to collect any type of information from telcos and, in turn, share this information with the AFP and third parties. Without clear guidelines as to the types of data that constitute any information, this legislation extends beyond the existing metadata creation, retention and disclosure regime. Even with the addition of clear guidelines, this legislation still represents duplication of the data retention scheme and for the same purpose. The Greens do not support this dragnet surveillance of Australians under either scheme. 


A key difference under this new legislation is the government's attempt at having no defined reporting obligations. While the Attorney-General will be able to choose to collect and access private communications metadata under the TSSR, he had no intention of being held accountable to the same checks and balances, such as they are, that are in place for the metadata creation, retention and disclosure regime. Metadata collection under the TSSR does not require authorisation or notification, and the Commonwealth Ombudsman is not granted oversight powers. But, even with the clarifications of these reporting obligations under today's amendments, what guarantee do we have in this place that the Attorney-General will choose to honour them?


Today I was going to give notice of a motion for the Attorney-General to produce the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act annual report for 2015-16. This is the report in which the Attorney-General sets out the extent and circumstances in which eligible Commonwealth, state and territory government agencies have used the powers available under TIA Act. This is the report in which the Attorney-General tells us about the government's data retention activities for the first time. So imagine my surprise when this report was tabled this morning—at one minute to midnight: only minutes before the start of this debate in the Senate. I have seen attorneys-general in the Tasmanian parliament and the Commonwealth parliament treat parliaments with contempt on a number of occasions, but I tell you what: this one just about takes the cake. This is a ridiculous and insulting action for the Attorney-General to take, in withholding this report until, as I said, one minute to midnight—just minutes before the start of this debate today. I want to place on the record that the timing of the Attorney-General tabling this report in the Senate this morning was clearly designed to prevent this Senate from having the opportunity to analyse the information and data in that report and use that information and data to inform our position on this legislation and our contributions on this legislation—an utter disgrace from the Attorney-General.


As the new data retention obligations came into effect on October 2015, that report is the first report from the Attorney-General that includes the new obligations under the data retention act. He has deliberately held back on fulfilling his reporting obligations in a timely way, and yet here he is asking for more open-ended, obligation-free access to the private communications of the Australian people. There had been two whole years of telecommunications interception and access with zero reporting and, therefore, zero government accountability until today. The Attorney-General has held back the vital reporting on the new data retention obligations until, as I say, one minute to midnight, in an attempt to ensure that this Senate remains in ignorance about the matters contained in that report.


We have, however, had time to review the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report on monitoring of agency access to stored communications and telecommunications data for 2015-16. And what a concerning picture that report paints. It is a picture of non-compliance in record-keeping provisions and warrant conditions and restrictions from several agencies, the worst being from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, as they then were. Customs were found to be non-compliant or were unable to demonstrate compliance across each of the Ombudsman's inspection criteria. Customs did not have processes in place to demonstrate that they were following regulations relating to lawfully accessing, managing and keeping records of access to communications data, and the ombudsman's report indicated that they were not cooperative or frank for the inspection. That is yet another damning indictment of the now Department of Immigration and Border Protection under the bumbling, incompetent minister for immigration, Mr Dutton. Customs did not have processes in place to demonstrate, as I said, that they were lawfully accessing communications data. There were also a number of instances of warrants being exercised by a person who was not authorised across other departments, including the AFP.


This legislation that we are currently debating also gives power to the Attorney-General to direct telcos to do or to not do something to their networks in the name of national security. It is easy to understand why this is making carriers and service providers uncomfortable. The Attorney-General and the coalition government have proven time and time again that they are digitally illiterate. We have seen their ridiculous demands for access to encrypted communications, and when you add that to their long list of spectacular government system failures—the census fail, the robo-debt fail, the Centrelink and Medicare data links fail and, of course, the rollout of a substandard NBN—it paints a very concerning picture about this government's digital literacy. Let's be clear, just about every computer system the government touch turns to hashtag #fail. This government have shown that, without a doubt, they cannot be trusted to keep government networks and systems safe and secure, so why on earth would we in this place give them the power to dictate network security to the private sector as well?


The industry associations are also concerned that they could face very high costs to rebuild existing networks without limitations on the requirement for carriers and service providers to retrofit or remove existing facilities. The legislation also forces telcos to inform the government of changes to their networks. The joint submission from the telecommunications industry associations to the PJCIS warned:


… the onerous nature of the compliance requirements will act to hamper the responsiveness of … cyber threats—


as well as:


… divert scarce resources away from investing directly in addressing cyber security threats …


They also highlight the prescriptive and one-sided nature of this legislation, and point to more collaborative approaches used in places like the US, the UK and Canada. The US's cyber security act creates a framework for the voluntary sharing of cyber threat information between private entities and the federal government, with the goal of exchanging cyber threat information rapidly and responsibly. It also contains measures to protect privacy by ensuring personal information is not unnecessarily divulged. The UK's National Cyber Security Strategy also employs a far more collaborative approach, in which the government shares threat information with industry and provides advice and guidance to industry on managing risks. 


The industry associations note:


… policy makers and Government should give considerable weight to the expertise of network providers in designing and safeguarding their networks and the clear commercial incentive that exists in a highly competitive sector to drive security by design in network architecture to ensure operational reliability and customer trust and loyalty.


'Trust' and 'loyalty': these are not terms that can be attributed to customers of the NBN or of online government systems at the moment, due to the government's epic fails in a range of areas that I have pointed out in this speech.


Industry associations describe this legislation as 'onerous', 'excessive' and 'one-sided'. They warn that the TSSR regime will not be adaptable or flexible enough to tackle risks that will emerge. Much like this government, it will not be agile enough to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Much like this government, it is out of step and, at the same time, it is a massive overreach. It places excessive and onerous demands and obligations on telecommunications companies, demands which are likely to put infrastructure at greater risk. It puts Australians in a position where they will have their rights to privacy stripped away without their knowledge and to no benefit in terms of the public good. It does all this with no obligations for the government to share information of threats with companies or to provide transparency of their actions to Australians.


The Australian Greens have been opposing this government's flagrant disregard for human rights to privacy and its agenda of warrantless mass surveillance of Australian citizens for more than five years, and we have been opposing it no matter what the political stripe of the government of the day. As we have done, we will continue to do by opposing this legislation. We oppose the Attorney-General collecting, storing and accessing Australians' private communications information under any scheme. We oppose the Attorney-General having a choice of schemes whereby he can pick or choose the rules and guidelines under which he accesses this private information. We oppose the Attorney-General, who has more than proven his digital illiteracy on a number of occasions, being in a position to tell telcos and ISPs how to make their networks 'more secure', likely, we point out, actually making them less secure in the process. We oppose these privileges being granted to the Attorney-General when he has already been shown to be prepared to deliberately hold back on fulfilling his reporting obligations under the existing metadata creation, retention and disclosure regime.


We oppose the government's onerous, excessive, one-sided plan to put Australian telecommunications infrastructure at risk by further imposing their incompetence on the Australian telecommunications industry. And we once again urge Australians to stand up and protect their rights to privacy as the government has shown it is not prepared to do and, in fact, that the government has demonstrated it has utter disregard for.


Why is the Attorney-General tabling the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 report only minutes prior to this bill being debated? Just as pertinent, when can we expect the report for the year 2016-17 to be tabled? The 2015-16 one was over a year overdue, so when are we going to get the 2016-17 report? How does the government respond to the industry associations' concerns that the underlying approach of this bill is flawed and that it is more likely to make Australian telecommunications networks less secure due to the one-sided, onerous and excessive nature of obligations for carriers and carrier service providers that constitute the massive overreach contained in this legislation? And why is the government seeking to duplicate data retention under this scheme and how will the overlapping and duplicated schemes and data be handled?


In conclusion, we have zero confidence in this government's capacity to oversee the scheme that this legislation proposes to create, because the government has shown, time after time, that they are digitally illiterate, that they treat their reporting requirements to this parliament with utter contempt and that they simply cannot be trusted to run computer systems and networks securely and to protect the private data of Australians in the 21st century.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,4,1
"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (11:18):  I rise to make a few brief comments about the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 and I do so as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security which considered this bill in detail and, indeed, engaged with not only the industry players that Senator McKim has just referred to but also the government agencies that came before the government highlighting the requirement for this legislation.


The first thing I would like to point out, particularly following Senator McKim's points which go very much to the ideology of the Greens in opposing any attempt by the government to make sure that our community continues to be safe, is his conflation of two issues. He mentions, on a number of occasions, data retention as though this bill is intending to extend or somehow change the data retention requirements. In actual fact, the intent of this bill is to better manage national security risks to the telecommunications networks from espionage, sabotage and foreign interference. What the bill is looking to do is extend the work that Australia has been doing with industry over a number of years on the systems that we rely on, whether it be industry in their own business, the general public, government or security agencies. All of us now are enabled through data, whether it is on your mobile phone or on computer networks in your office. Data and telecommunications are essential, and, if we are to remain both secure economically in terms of espionage and secure from a national security perspective in terms of espionage against the state, as in government information and secrets, then we need to make sure that the system that transports that information is secure. The one reference in this bill to data retention is not about expanding and duplicating the scheme. The intent of it is saying, 'If, in your data retention obligations, you have offshored or you plan to make changes, you need to advise the government of the fact that you're making changes to a regime which is a critical part of our national security infrastructure.' There's a deliberate attempt by the Greens in this debate today to conflate these two issues. This bill is about making sure that the whole network that we all rely on is and remains secure.


In fact, the evidence taken by the PJCIS and consequently our recommendations go to address some of the concerns that have been raised around things like the transparency of information and the degree of communication from government to industry. Our recommendations say: if government becomes aware of a particular threat that industry should be taking cognisance of and where they should be acting to prevent an intrusion or a weakness in our telecommunications system, then government needs to be sharing that information more transparently with industry. In fact, this bill is about increasing the amount of cooperation and transparency between government and industry to make sure that, when we see threats, we work with industry to address them and that, when industry make changes to their networks, to the physical architecture or the contractual arrangements, which might expose Australians' information to threat, they advise government of that so that we can collaboratively work on keeping Australians safe.


My colleague Senator McAllister has stepped through a number of the details of the bill, so I'm not going to repeat all of that. There has been a bipartisan position reached on this. I just want to highlight the fact that there are two key elements where this government has been working, by and large in bipartisan cooperation with the opposition, to make sure that Australians remain safe. That's in terms of national security and countering the terrorist threat in particular but also from the economic perspective. I will start with the latter: Lloyd's, one of the world's largest insurance companies, estimates that the threat to the Australian economy is in the order of $16 billion over the next decade from cyberattack and espionage. We are under constant cyberattack, particularly from international players—and also, potentially, some domestically. Sydney actually ranks 12th of the world's major financial centres in terms of the degree of risk. Around $4.8 billion is the potential loss if cybersecurity is not taken seriously. 


Whilst companies can take individual steps, the network upon which data is passed is key in terms of making sure that that data is safe. The particular company can take all the measures they like, but, if the pathways upon which that data is transmitted are not secure, then all the efforts an individual company may have made come to naught. That is why we are focused on making sure from an economic perspective that the networks are secure; hence this bill to increase the security framework of our telecommunications networks. The recommendations made by the committee were particularly to address some of the concerns that were raised by industry during the hearings. The government has chosen to accept all of the recommendations from the committee, and they form the basis of what is before the Senate today.


On the national security side, the integrity of our telecommunications system is important not only to stop intrusion but also for things like the data retention provisions. Data retention has been used for many years in Australia. It doesn't matter whether you are dealing with child pornography, organised crime or, indeed, terrorism, it is one of the most important tools that our law enforcement agencies have. So as we look back and congratulate our agencies on their 13 significant disruptions of plots to conduct terror, as we look at the fact that since 2014 more than 70 people have been charged as a result of 31 counter-terrorism operations around the country, it comes down to the fact that the government, in cooperation with the opposition, has passed eight major tranches of legislation to give our law enforcement agencies the tools they need to respond in a timely manner to a rapidly evolving threat.


You can see that threat evolving globally and even here in Australia. Over the last four or five years, we have gone from a period where terrorist plots were largely a network of people with a coordinated and complex plot that our agencies could engage with over a period of months in terms of surveillance and collecting evidence before acting to what we now see globally and even in Australia, which is that terrorist plots can be very simple, very quick and low-technology. The laws the agencies require to obtain intelligence and also to act to keep Australians safe have changed.


So this government has passed eight significant tranches of legislation, including the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016, which was passed to allow the continued detention of high-risk terrorist offenders. A reasonable person in the street would agree that, if somebody has not renounced the ideology that made them a risk in the first place, we would be foolish to be releasing them back onto the streets while they still pose a risk.


The Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes Act) 2016 was passed to enable the ADF to legally target members of armed groups such as ISIL in Syria and Iraq. We had the situation where some domestic law was preventing the effective engagement and disruption of an enemy that is sworn to Australia's destruction, that has been committing genocide in parts of the world. So we have passed legislation to make it possible for the ADF to be effective.


The Counter-Terrorist Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016 lowered to 14 years the age limit on control orders. Why? Because we are seeing people as young as that involved in both the preparation and the actual conduct of terrorist acts and our community rightly expects that we will give our agencies the powers they need to deal with a threat that is evident, that is here today.


The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Bill was passed, providing for the revocation or renunciation of citizenship of dual nationals convicted of or engaged in terrorism-related conduct. When I go to various functions in the community in Australia probably the most frequent comment I get from men and women is: 'If somebody is engaged in terrorist acts against Australia, why do we allow them back into the country? Why do we keep them here?' This bill made it clear that, where somebody has dual citizenship and has essentially renounced their Australian citizenship by taking terrorist action against Australia, their Australian citizenship will be removed; and that has occurred. 


The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015 is not a new power; there has been data retention for many years. But with the changing commercial environment people no longer needed to retain for billing purposes the kind of information that shows person A picked up a phone and rang for 15 minutes. That is how telcos used to bill. They would look at your telephone record and charge you for the calls you made. Now that the world has moved on—through much more internet based protocols to packages where you buy up front, they have no commercial need to retain much of that information. Yet that information—whether it is child sex offences, organised crime and drugs, or terrorism—is critical to our law enforcement agencies. That bill was not about creating new powers; it was largely about preserving one of the most effective tools that our agency has. In 2014, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) was passed enabling ASIS to assist the ADF in relation to terrorists and updating and expanding the regime to apply to enablers. Commonsense measures say that if an Australian citizen is overseas and doing something to the detriment of Australia, our interests or our allies then ASIS can help the ADF. And that people here who are enabling and preparing for an act are people we should be able to engage with as opposed to those who are actually in the act of committing a terrorist offence. The Counter‑Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Act 2014 was passed to respond to the threat of Australians engaging in and returning from conflicts. And, finally, there is the National Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2014. 


The reason I have run through those bills is that they have been passed on a bipartisan basis in the parliament in the interests of the Australian public, and I make no apologies for those bills. The government's first priority is keeping Australians safe. This most recent bill, whilst not directly a counterterrorist bill or directly a counterespionage bill, goes to the integrity of our telecommunications and data systems which provide a vulnerability if we do not keep them secure. That vulnerability goes to both terrorism-type offences and national security as well as to our economic security through cyberattacks. 


I encourage people who are interested to download the PJCIS report, where we go through both the submissions and the government's submission in detail as to why this bill is required. This piece of legislation is implementing the recommendations of the PJCIS. I particularly want to highlight that the ideological objection of the Greens is misplaced specifically in regard to this bill because it is not about increasing data retention powers. It is about saying that if a telco has an obligation under the data retention regime and they choose to change the nature of their network then they need to advise the Commonwealth so that we can have a sensible discussion about the implications. I am very happy to support this bill and commend it to the Senate.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:32):  The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 will amend the Telecommunications Act 1997 and related legislation with the aim of strengthening the security of Australia's telecommunications networks. Australia's telecommunications networks are an absolutely vital part of our national infrastructure, enabling us to conduct business and go about our everyday lives online. Our economic prosperity, our wellbeing and, indeed, our national security are dependent on telecommunications networks and the data that flows across them. 


I don't think anyone can question the scale and seriousness of the potential cyberthreats to Australia from serious to highly organised crime, often operating on an industrial scale, to clandestine activity by foreign governments. All the publicly available advice from our security and intelligence agencies suggests— and I quote from the minister's second reading speech:


Espionage and clandestine foreign interference activity against Australian interests is extensive. 


This legislation has been developed over a lengthy period of time with extensive consultation with industry and other stakeholders with exposure drafts available for public consultation and, more recently, by an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The bill proposes amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997 to place an obligation on all carriers, carriage service providers and carriage service intermediaries to do their best to protect telecommunications networks and facilities from unauthorised interference and unauthorised access for the purposes of security. Companies will have to consider national security risks such as espionage, sabotage and foreign interference threats, and the confidentiality of information and communications as well as the availability and integrity of telecommunications network facilities. This obligation will be supported by new notification obligations. Carriers and nominated carriage service providers will be required to notify changes to systems and services if the carrier or the nominated carriage service provider becomes aware that a proposed change is likely to have a materially adverse effect on their ability to meet their security obligations to protect networks and facilities from unauthorised access and interference. Early notification to security agencies should allow those agencies to provide advice at the planning stage and ensure security considerations are factored into the proposed design as early as possible in a cost-effective manner. As the minister put it in introducing the bill:


The scheme relies on a 'light touch' approach to regulation to allow for meaningful collaboration and cooperation with industry to manage risks in a way that is satisfactory to both industry and government, without the government being too prescriptive and retaining flexibility for industry.


Clearly, a close and effective dialogue between our national security agencies—especially ASIO and the Australian Signals Directorate—and industry will be essential if the legislation is to deliver the enhanced security we all seek.


The bill has now been the subject of an extensive inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, a process that has allowed further comment and input from industry. The joint committee has made a number of recommendations that are broadly reflected in the amendments now proposed by the government. I won't go through all those amendments and recommendations. Suffice to say they all significantly improve the legislation.


I will, however, focus on one matter examined by the joint committee, and that is the question of the location of stored data. This is a very important issue. As the draft administrative guidelines accompanying the bill note, offshore data storage raises significant security issues relating both to the storage of personal information, financial and other sensitive data and, indeed, to national security. The draft administrative guidelines note:


Offshoring raises security concerns because it enables access and control to critical parts of major Australian telecommunications networks outside of Australia, this can facilitate foreign intelligence collection (espionage) and disrupt the network itself (sabotage). Risks arise where control and supervision arrangements have the potential to allow unauthorised actions by third parties, such as theft of customer data or sabotage of the network.


The Attorney-General's Department noted that the bill does not specify where or how data must be stored, but instead supports a risk based approach where companies 'can retain flexibility to support their changing business needs and to minimise any regulatory burden on their ability to conduct business internationally'. The law, as it stands and as is proposed, does not currently compel telecommunications providers to tell the government where data retained is stored. That is something I have concerns about, and I propose to raise them in my usual respected manner with the Attorney because I am concerned about the data being stored overseas. I don't think a risk based approach is adequate here, given the potential for espionage or sabotage.


The joint committee rightly observes:


It is critical that the Australian community can have confidence in the telecommunications sector and especially the security of stored data.


Australia's existing legal framework for the protection of information includes requirements under the Privacy Act and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, including mandatory encryption for retained telecommunications data as well as a recently introduced mandatory data breach notification scheme. The joint committee notes that the telecommunications sector security framework would apply to carriers and carriage service providers—C/CSPs—irrespective of whether certain parts of a C/CSP's operation are located in Australia or overseas. The location of data is not necessarily determinant of its security, but there are clear risks associated with offshore data storage. The joint committee rightly expressed itself 'greatly concerned that existing laws do not provide government with visibility about where and how data is being stored'. We need that visibility. The notification requirements proposed for the bill will require telecommunications companies to notify the government of any changes they propose to make that are likely to have a material adverse effect on their ability to comply with their security obligations. This requirement must include any decisions to store critical data offshore.


The bill does contain information-gathering powers that could be used, if necessary, to compel companies to provide information that is relevant to assessing compliance with their security obligations. The joint committee has recommended:


… that at the time of the review required to be undertaken by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security under section 187N of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, the scope of the review be expanded to include consideration of the security of off-shored telecommunications data that is retained by a service provider for the purpose of the data retention regime.


The joint committee has further recommended:


… the Bill should be amended to include, in relation to data retained under Part 5-1A of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, a specific obligation within the notification requirement in proposed section 314A to require—


carriers and nominated carriage service providers to notify the department—


of any new or amended offshoring arrangements.


This seems to be an essential provision, as a minimum, to ensure the security considerations are properly taken into account in any arrangements to store Australians' personal, financial or other sensitive data overseas.


My view is that I don't like it. This, to me, is putting Australians' data at too much risk. Why risk it when we should ensure that the data is stored here, onshore rather than offshore? While recognising the significant costs involved in ensuring adequate data security, I would also raise the likelihood that the so-called light-touch approach of this bill will need to be revisited in the future. Recent revelations in the banking sector suggest that very large and well-resourced companies—yes, Which bank?—can still prove shamefully negligent in failing to comply with regulatory regimes, even those relating to money laundering and terrorist financing. All too often, the pursuit of super profits and directors' bonuses can lead corporations to skate over important regulatory obligations. I suspect that this legislation will be the first in building much stronger measures to ensure the security of our telecommunications infrastructure and the protection of Australians' personal data. For the moment, I and my colleagues will support the bill and the associated proposed amendments, but we do have serious concerns in relation to the offshoring of Australians' data.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-08-14,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:41):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016. The bill purports to improve national security at the cost of more government control over private telecommunications companies. The bill will introduce a new regulatory framework, supposedly to better manage national security risks of espionage, sabotage and foreign interference to Australia's telecommunications networks and facilities.


Specifically, the bill imposes a new security obligation on telecommunication carriers, carriage service providers and intermediaries. They will now be obliged to do their best to manage the risk of unauthorised access and interference, even where such access or interference does not involve committing an offence. They will also have to notify the government of planned changes to their networks and services that could risk unauthorised access and interference, even where the changes do not increase the risk of offences being committed. Of course, they will have to give information to government so compliance with these obligations can be monitored. In fairness, the directions power is limited to instances where ASIO has given an adverse security assessment and the Attorney-General is satisfied that using the power is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce a risk to security. Consideration will supposedly be given to the costs and impacts on competition and consumers. However, fundamentally, the greatest weight is required to be given to the ASIO security assessment.


The net effect of this bill is that consumers will get worse service at a higher cost. This is because this bill will (1) increase compliance costs on industry; (2) restrict competition, as only big established companies would put up with the red tape; and (3) distort investment away from what consumers want, as bureaucrats will make directions without knowing the trade-offs between security, cost and other features for each option and without knowing or caring what sort of trade-off consumers prefer. Government can secure its own data just by choosing ICT businesses that offer gold-standard security. With respect to private data, the government, arguably, has a role to prevent crimes—like hacking into a bank—that could hurt more than those directly involved. But the current law covers this, and there is no case to go further.


What there is no doubt about is that this bill increases regulation and costs to telecommunication service providers to the detriment of consumers and to the dubious benefit of central government. It gives ASIO additional telecommunication oversight powers and obliges telecommunication service providers to both maintain enhanced security and report breaches. Is this a vital piece of legislation to enhance our national security? The Liberal Democrats don't think so.


In a free society, intrusions into individual privacy in the interests of national security and law enforcement are based on probable cause. However, more and more we see measures taken by governments which curtail the freedom of all in an effort to monitor and prevent unlawful efforts by a tiny few. Logically, in doing this both Liberal and Labor seem increasingly to think that everyone is equally likely to be a threat. If this were true, then the fundamental basis of a democratic liberal society is called into question, and the first ideological step has been taken towards creating a police state.


We believe the current laws, effectively policed, provide more than enough powers. I will consequently be opposing this bill.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:45):  May I close the second reading debate by thanking honourable senators for their contributions. Let me start with Senator McAllister.


Might I acknowledge and thank the opposition for its support for this bill, the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016. Like all of the tranches of national-security-related legislation that I have introduced into this chamber, this bill has been the subject of extensive consideration by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The PJCIS has recommended a number of amendments, which the government has agreed to, and I want to thank the opposition both for its support for the bill and for its contribution to the deliberative process through the PJCIS.


Speaking of which, can I also thank Senator Fawcett, who is a member of the PJCIS, for his characteristically thoughtful and well-informed contribution. I also want to acknowledge and thank Senator Xenophon for his thoughtful contribution and his support for the bill. 


Senator Leyonhjelm, who has just spoken, has indicated that, effectively on libertarian grounds, he will oppose the bill. This is a position, as we know, that Senator Leyonhjelm characteristically takes. I am glad that on legislation of this kind, where government and opposition—the alternative parties of government in this place—agree that we have a contradictor; that we hear the other side of the argument from a libertarian point of view. If I may say so, there is always a crystalline elegance about Senator Leyonhjelm's contributions to this debate. He is very much a purist. But can I say to you, Senator Leyonhjelm, that in the government's view your concerns on a libertarian basis are misplaced. Your warnings about the creation of a police state are vastly wrongheaded, with respect. And, might I point out, Senator Leyonhjelm, that, if not always, then typically, you have opposed the government's national security legislation reforms.


And, might I point out to you, with respect, Senator Leyonhjelm—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—that when on Thursday of the week before last the Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Deputy Commissioner Phelan, announced the charging of two people following an alleged attempt to bring down an aircraft in consequence of a plot, which it will be alleged was being conducted on Australian soil, Deputy Commissioner Phelan, who runs the counterterrorism operation, went out of his way to point out that it was because of powers given to the Australian Federal Police by this parliament in the eight tranches of national security legislation which have been introduced by this government over the last three years that the AFP was able to make those arrests and conduct that investigation so successfully, thus saving potentially hundreds and hundreds of lives.


I am not making a debating point, Senator Leyonhjelm; that was the view of the operational officer in charge of Australia's counterterrorism efforts. But it does, I think, make the point that, on occasions and only where there is a clear need to do so, it is sometimes necessary to give the police additional power in order to protect public safety. We have the endorsement of Deputy Commissioner Phelan that that has been the very effect of some of the laws that this Senate has passed after deliberation, including the contributions which you have made.


I can't say that Senator McKim's contribution had the same crystalline elegance as yours, Senator Leyonhjelm. It was a confused contribution because, with respect, Senator McKim confused the bill. He said that this was about mass government surveillance. It has absolutely nothing to do with mass government surveillance whatsoever. As a matter of fact, what this bill is to do with is protecting systems. 



Senator McKim interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  I think, Senator McKim—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—you are thinking of another bill. It's always good counsel, if you participate in these debates, to work out which bill you're talking about.


Nevertheless, let me—having responded to those who contributed—make some closing remarks. I've already thanked the PJCIS for its contribution to the process. May I repeat that since 2014 this government, first under the leadership of Mr Abbott and now under the leadership of Mr Turnbull, has led the most significant program of national security legislation reform in a generation. The bill currently before the chamber is the ninth tranche of significant national security legislation which this government has introduced—which I have introduced—in the past three years.


The bill is a critically important piece of national security legislation, because telecommunications networks form part of Australia's critical infrastructure and also support other critical sectors such as health, finance, transport, water and power. Cyberthreats to Australia are persistent, whether they arise from sabotage, espionage, serious and organised crime or other technology enabled crime. The existing framework for managing these risks in the telecommunications industry is inadequate, and I think that fact is widely acknowledged. It relies on voluntary cooperation and goodwill, which is not always sufficient given the nature of the risks to national security and the gravity of those risks.


So this bill will address that shortcoming in the protection of the telecommunications system at the moment. It will amend the Telecommunications Act to place an obligation on all carriers, carriage service providers and carriage service intermediaries to do their best to protect telecommunications networks and facilities from unauthorised interference and unauthorised access. This obligation will be supported by new notification requirements to encourage early engagement to allow risks to be assessed and mitigated. Carriers and nominated carriage service providers will be required to notify changes to systems and services if a carrier or nominated carriage service provider becomes aware that a proposed change is likely to have a material adverse effect on their ability to meet the security obligation to protect networks and facilities from unauthorised access and interference. 


Companies will also be given the opportunity to forecast changes to telecommunications systems in annual security capability plans. In line with the risk based nature of these reforms, the notification regime includes an exemptions process. This will reduce the regulatory burden on some companies and ensure that the resources of security agencies are targeted. The bill also prescribes annual reporting requirements on the operation of the legislation in an effort to improve the transparency of the regime.


Following introduction of the bill on 9 November last year, I referred it to the PJCIS for inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr Andrew Hastie MP. The committee recognised that protecting telecommunications infrastructure requires a joint partnership between government and industry. The recommendations of the committee provide great clarity and certainty for industry, encourage information sharing and enhance the transparency of the regime's operation.


In addition to the committee's inquiries, these reforms have been the subject of extensive industry consultation, beginning as long ago as 2012. Senator Leyonhjelm—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—your observations about the burden to industry overlook the fact that this proposal has been developed collaboratively with industry through very extensive consultations that took into account industry's views. As a result, a number of changes were made to improve the operation of the proposed legislation in response to that feedback, including providing additional safeguards to govern the use of the proposed regulatory powers, clarifying the intended scope and application of requirements to be imposed on telecommunications providers, and other measures. I want to take this opportunity to thank those from industry who contributed so constructively to what has been, on any view, a very thorough consultation process.


In conclusion: the bill will establish a regulatory framework to better manage national security risks of espionage, sabotage and foreign interference and to better protect networks and the confidentiality of information stored on and carried across them from unauthorised interference and access—not surveillance, Senator McKim, but protection. There will be a set of government amendments to give effect to the recommendations of the PJCIS, subject to the committee stage. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:07):  Thank you, Senator Xenophon. I am glad you asked, because I'm able to give you an answer in some detail. The government is committed to ensuring that all Australians can have confidence in the security of telecommunications data irrespective of where the data is located or stored, and that is one of the most important policy values underlying this legislation.


The key risk in relation to data holdings is the extent to which they are appropriately secured. Unsecured data holdings in Australia are as vulnerable to attack or unauthorised access as data holdings held overseas. Focusing on offshoring disproportionately emphasises the risk proposed by offshoring arrangements above other types of security risks such as outsourcing arrangements, network access arrangements by persons located outside of Australia or the location of equipment. So the offshoring of data is merely one of the variety of considerations to be borne in mind in ensuring the security of data. The assessment of security risks for individual providers should be based on the full suite of risks and information available on a case-by-case basis. Australia's existing legal framework provides strong protections for information, including requirements under the Privacy Act and requirements under the data retention legislation to protect and encrypt data. Any proposal to mandate reporting of all offshoring arrangements would place a significantly greater regulatory burden on the telecommunications industry. There are approximately 280 carriers and nominated carriage service providers.


In addition to the regulatory burden on industry, assessing large datasets of baseline information would divert departmental and agency resources and focus from the more significant national security risks targeted by the reforms, including espionage, sabotage and unauthorised access and interference. This would undermine the intent of the reforms to enable greater collaboration between industry and government to identify national security risks, having regard to the particular circumstances of a provider. Where there are concerns about the extent to which an individual provider was compliant with its protection obligations, the department can use its information-gathering powers to compel the provider to provide information about the location of its data holdings, including on a retrospective basis.


The government has in any event agreed to implement all of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which includes recommendation 10, which is a recommendation that the bill specify annual reporting requirements including the number of times directions powers have been exercised, the number of industry notifications and security capability plans that have been received, regulatory performance measures, details of the government's information-sharing arrangements with industry and a summary of feedback or complaints, and which also recommended that the annual report indicate any trends or issues. And it includes recommendation 11, which will expand the scope of the review of the data retention regime commencing in 2019 to include examination of security of data that is stored outside Australia.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:11):  I am grateful to the Attorney for his response, but it still leaves me unclear—perhaps it is my muddle-headedness from the cold I have. Is there a requirement to notify consumers? If I am with a telecommunications provider, I'd like to know whether that telecommunications provider is storing data offshore. I'd imagine that that may be a marketing point of difference for some telecommunications providers—saying, 'We store our data here, only in Australia, not somewhere else.' I think it's a reasonable proposition that consumers and businesses ought to have a right to know where their telecommunications provider stores their data, because I imagine there would be many consumers and many businesses that would feel more comfortable about their data being stored here rather than overseas. My question to the Attorney is: does this legislative framework make it clear whether data is being stored overseas or not, with a particular telecommunications provider? How can consumers establish that fact?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:12):  Senator Xenophon, the legislation does not provide for a mandatory obligation on telecommunications service providers to provide that information to consumers. They may, of course, if they choose to do so, and I sought to explain in answer to your initial question the reasons why there are no such mandatory obligations. There are—and I pointed this out a moment ago—very extensive oversight and reporting requirements not merely in relation to data stored offshore but in relation to all data, whether stored offshore or onshore, to protect the security of all data.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:13):  I think the Attorney has been quite open in the way he has answered this, but it still doesn't deal with the potential problem—that is, whether consumers and businesses ought to have a right to know whether their data is being stored overseas or not. Whilst this is not before the chamber now in the committee stage, is the government sympathetic to, or open to, a future amendment to the bill that would simply require information to be provided as to whether data is being stored overseas or not? I think that is a growing issue that concerns an increasing number of Australians and Australian businesses in that regard. I can foreshadow that, if the government is not interested in that, it is something that I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the chamber to try and bring about.


It would not be an onerous requirement. It doesn't actually mandate the data being here, but it simply mandates details of where that data is being stored, which I don't think, on any reasonable stretch of imagination, would be onerous on telecommunication providers. Surely they either know whether their data is going overseas or not. If it is, they ought to have an obligation to tell consumers that it is, which may, in turn, change the behaviour of some companies to think, 'You know, this is something, from a consumers' point of view, where most Australians would like us storing our data here rather than somewhere else.'

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:14):  Just to make it perfectly clear: as I said before, there is no such mandatory obligation imposed upon industry or telecommunications providers by the bill. I'm advised that the matter was considered by the PJCIS. The PJCIS did not make a recommendation to that effect, but what it did recommend—and what the government has accepted among the PJCIS recommendations—is to re-look at the overall issue of offshoring, in 2019. That is recommendation 11 of the PJCIS report, which the government has adopted. Evidently there was not a sufficient level of concern about this issue by the PJCIS to recommend that the bill be amended to stipulate for a mandatory obligation initially. But in the early stages of the operation of the legislation the matter will be kept under review by the government, of course, and, as I said, we have adopted the PJCIS's recommendation to look at the matter again in 2019 with the operational experience of the legislation in operation.


I always welcome your suggestions and if you want to approach me by correspondence perhaps to ask for this matter to be revisited earlier than the PJCIS recommendation of 2019 I, of course, would always consider very carefully and with great respect any recommendation you may wish to make.

Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (12:17):  Given the Attorney responded in detail to precisely none of the questions that I asked in my speech in the second reading debate, we will have to deal with them one by one in the committee stage. I do want to say, given the Attorney's taken his chance on the second reading to personally criticise my understanding of the legislation—a claim, I hasten to add, I rebut and reject entirely—that the Attorney's response to my speech was supercilious and condescending in the extreme. If they didn't invent the word 'supercilious' just for the Attorney, they could have.


Attorney: with regard to whether or not this is a dragnet surveillance of Australians—a claim that you have rejected—I am going to put some information on the record:


The Bill grants the Office of the Attorney-General (AGD), specifically the Attorney General’s Secretary (AGS), the power to collect any type of information from the TelCo:


a. This power is only overseen in terms of an annual report submitted by the AGD to Parliament.


b. This power may be delegated to the Director-General of the ASIO.


c. The ASIO may in turn share the information gathered with the AFP and third parties.


That's actually not an assertion that I am standing here making off my own bat today. What I've just done is read from a submission from the Australian Centre for Cyber Security at the University of New South Wales to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the closed shop in this place that the crossbench is not represented on.


It is dated 3 February and entitled Submission: review of the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016. Attorney, in the view of the experts at the Australian Centre for Cyber Security this bill grants, in effect, you the power to collect any type of information from the telco. It is clearly a surveillance dragnet. That is an entirely reasonable description of what you are standing in this place today proposing that we agree to. So I stand by my comments I made in my second reading speech. I stand by my assertion that this government is rampantly stripping away from the Australian people fundamental rights, including the right of privacy and the right to be forgotten—key digital rights. As well, a plethora of legislation has come through this parliament in recent years designed to allow security agencies in this country to deprive Australians of their freedom, of their liberty and of their right to make choices about how they live their lives, all whilst epically failing to make any kind of case for change. I can assure the Australian people that the Australian Greens will stand up for their rights in this place. We will stand up for their right to privacy. We will stand up for the basic human rights that both the coalition and Labor members work together to strip away on a regular basis. 


I will put again the first question I asked in my second reading speech that wasn't responded to by the Attorney. Attorney, why did you table the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 2015-16 annual report only minutes prior to this debate commencing today? When can we expect the report for the year 2016-17 to be tabled?

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:22):  I will turn to that, Senator McKim, but first I will address the broader observation you made. I'm afraid, Senator McKim, once again you've completely misunderstood the nature of the bill. You seem to be intending to refer to section 315C of the bill. What section 315C does is create not a scheme of surveillance but a scheme of compliance. It provides a mechanism whereby the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department or his delegate may be satisfied that telecommunication service providers are compliant with their obligations under the bill. That is what section 315C is all about. Senator McKim, because you've so fundamentally misunderstood what this is about, I'm going to read it to you. Section 315C says:


(1) This section applies to a carrier, carriage service provider or carriage service intermediary if the Attorney-General's Secretary has reason to believe that the carrier, provider or intermediary has information or a document that is relevant to assessing compliance with the duty imposed by subsection 313(1A) or (2A).


The obligations, by the way, Senator McKim, imposed by subsections 313(1A) and 313(2A) are obligations upon carriage service providers. This isn't about the surveillance of citizens. It's about the surveillance of carriage service providers. We have often heard posed rhetorically the question: who will watch the watchers? This is a provision that ensures that there is oversight of the carriage service provider—the bearers of this information—in their compliance with their obligations under the legislation. That is not at all what you suggested it was about, so either you have not read it or, if you have, you have misunderstood it. And then the section goes on to set out the way in which that is to be done.


In relation to your second question: the report was tabled this morning because it was received in time to be tabled this morning. The tabling of the 2016-17 report is some time away because there is a large amount of information to be assessed in preparing the report. When that information is assessed, the report will be tabled in a timely manner.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-08-14,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (12:25):  Firstly, I want to place on the record the frustration of the Australian Greens in having to wait well over a year past the end of the 2015-16 year for the tabling of the 2015-16 report. Having acted for many years as a minister of the crown in Tasmania, I am well aware that annual reports do take some time to compile and to be provided to a minister's office. But I have to say that a delay of some 13 or 14 months is not acceptable to the Australian Greens and ought not to be acceptable to this Senate. This report has been tabled at just a couple of seconds to midnight, a few short minutes before the start of this debate. The timing is highly suspicious. If you want to assuage a small number of the Australian Greens' concerns, you could place on the record, in response to this speech, exactly when that report was received by your office. Either your office has sat on that report or the people compiling the report have taken too long to do so. One or the other of those things must be true. Thirteen to 14 months is too long to wait for a report like that.


In a supercilious and condescending way you have suggested that I either haven't read the bill or don't understand it—neither of which is true. You have again taken exception to my categorisation of this legislation. I will quote again for you from a different section of the Australian Centre for Cyber Security's submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's review of the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016. This quote is from page 3 




Session Metadata as ‘any information’.



The metadata includes IP (Internet Protocol) source and destination addresses; source and destination port addresses; and protocol numbers. It therefore includes URLs / web browsing history. … This is the session metadata.


Attorney, I stand by my categorisation and the Australian Greens' categorisation of this bill as a surveillance dragnet. I make the point again that your government has got form on surveillance dragnets, specifically the metadata retention scheme.


Attorney, I also wanted to take the opportunity to give you an opportunity to respond to the industry association's explicit concerns that the underlying approach of this bill is flawed and that it is more likely to make Australian telecommunications networks less secure, due to the one-sided, onerous and excessive nature of the obligations contained in this legislation to be imposed on carriers and carrier service providers. Just so that we are clear, I would categorise the submission from the industry association that you are running a very high risk of not only an unintended consequence or unintended consequences that may flow from this legislation but, in fact, that it will be totally counterproductive—that is, it will achieve the very thing that it purports but is failing to address.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (12:31):  Turning to the three observations that have fallen from Senator McKim, first of all, the report was tabled within the time stipulated by the standing orders, which, I understand, is 15 sitting days. So there has been in fact no delay in the tabling of the report at all, so that statement was wrong.




Senator McKim:
  It was a question, not a statement.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Well, the answer is there has been no delay. Secondly, Senator McKim, once again, I thought by reading the actual provision to you, we would put an end to the false issue that you keep raising that this is about surveillance. The powers in section 315C—just to repeat—are not about surveillance. That is not their purpose and it is their effect. Their purpose and effect is to impose a compliance obligation on carriage service providers. 


Senator McKim, you quote from evidence before the PJCIS, which I might say, parenthetically, didn't persuade any members of the PJCIS on either side of politics as to its cogency. But leaving that to one side, what you disregard is that the meaning of the word 'information' in the relevant section, section 315C, which, if you have read, you certainly haven't understood, is qualified, and you made no reference to the qualification. So we are not merely talking about any information or document, but:


… information or a document that is relevant to assessing compliance with the duty imposed by subsection 313(1A) or (2A).


So the information or documents to which section 315C is directed are only information or documents by which compliance with an obligation imposed on the carriage service providers is to be evidenced.


It is absolutely commonplace for there to be a supervisory authority which determines whether or not a compliance obligation imposed on a company, in this case, a telecommunications company, has been met. And the way in this which bill goes about that is to provide a power in the secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, not obviously a political official, to require the provision of documents of the telecommunications company, which will indicate whether or not there has been compliance with their obligations under this bill—nothing whatsoever to do with surveillance of content. That is the answer to the second observation, Senator McKim.


In relation to the third observation, may I merely say, as I said in introducing the amendments and in winding up the second reading debate, there has been a long period of discussion and consultation with industry. You would be familiar, Senator McKim, having been in public life yourself for a long time, that when new obligations are imposed upon industry, sometimes industry resists. I think it is fair to say that in the initial stages of this process—which began, by the way, under the previous government, the Labor government, in 2012—there was some resistance from some parts of the industry. However, through a very long process of consultation and discussion with industry, we have landed at a point at which the government is comfortable that the legitimate interests of industry have been accommodated. Senator McKim, I am surprised to hear you mounting an argument that could have fallen from the lips of Senator Leyonhjelm. You may feel that telecommunications service providers should live in a regulation-free environment. That has never been the case and it's not the government's view. The regulatory burden has been mitigated by the government as a result of those discussions with industry and we are now, I think it's fair to say, on the same page.


I have been given some further information, Senator McKim, on this other false issue you raise about the tabling of the annual report under the TIA Act. It was sent to my office after parliament rose for the winter recess on 29 June. The obligation under the standing orders for the tabling of the report meant that the report was required to be tabled by 14 September—that is, 15 sitting days later. Today is 14 August. So, Senator McKim, perhaps your paranoid fantasies might try to accommodate why, if the government were trying to conceal this report, it tabled the report in advance of the debate on the bill when, in fact, the government would have been entirely within its obligations to withhold the tabling of the report for another month.

 (Tasmania) (12:37):  I ask the Attorney-General: why didn't you table it last week so we could have had a reasonable opportunity to go through that report before the start of this debate? Attorney, you just confessed to the Senate that, in fact, you've had this report for somewhere in the region of six weeks. So why wasn't it tabled last week so we could have had a good look through it and an opportunity to use the information and the data in that report to inform this debate? Instead, it was tabled today, two seconds to midnight, just before this debate started. I stand by the criticisms I have made around the timing of this report.


Let's go back to the substantive issue with regard to 315C. We could bat this backwards and forwards all day and the likelihood is, as is so often the case, we would not agree. So I am going to try to shortcut that and ask you a very simple question: is it the case that the secretary of your department can obtain from carriers and carriage service providers, should this legislation pass through the parliament and receive royal assent, information that includes an Australian person's web browsing history?

Senator McKim, the purpose of the metadata retention legislation was to impose an obligation to retain metadata for a period and for the purposes set out in that legislation. This legislation, as I have pointed out to you several times now, is concerned with something completely different—that is, creating a system for creating a framework for the protection of telecommunications systems. In order to better protect the security of information carried by telecommunications systems and by carriage service providers, it imposes obligations upon those companies and carriage service providers of the kind that I have described in the second reading speech and in summing up the second reading debate. The issues are completely different.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (12:47):  I indicate that the opposition will be supporting the government's amendments. As I indicated in my second reading remarks, they do implement the recommendations made by the PJCIS, and it is our view that they will improve the operation of the legislation. 


I also indicate, in response to some of the remarks made through the course of the second reading debate and the committee's proceedings, that the opposition does recognise there are grave risks and new risks that arise from having a society so intimately and integrally dependent on digital and that managing telecommunications risks is at the heart of managing against those more general risks. There have been remarks through the course of the debate that indicate that we could expect telecommunications service providers to manage these risks as a commercial imperative. I would submit to the Senate that that I think misunderstands the nature of the risk and the commercial imperative as it applies to these businesses. It is true that in most instances it will be in the commercial interests of a telecommunications service provider to meet national security objectives. Indeed, the experience so far has been that these service providers have engaged constructively with government. However, it is possible to imagine a circumstance where national security objectives do not align with the commercial imperatives of a business. Under those circumstances, the directors of that company would find themselves in a difficult situation. At least one impact of this legislation would be to create comfort for directors who now have an active obligation to manage, as best they can, national security in the operation of their business. 


I also wish to remark briefly on the debate that has taken place around offshoring and, in doing so, to note that there is a distinction between security risks to data that is voluntarily provided by a consumer of telecommunications services and security risks to data that is held as a result of government legislation—specifically, retained metadata. That distinction was recognised by the committee and in part is reflected in the recommendations made by the committee that there ought to be special consideration given to security obligations around retained metadata. The government amendments now provide that, where changes to the handling of retained metadata are being contemplated by a telecommunications service provider, they need to notify government that that is the case, and the opposition believes that that is appropriate.


As previously, I indicate that we're supportive of these amendments and commend the bill overall to the chamber.

10:48
):  Australia faces evolving national security threats to our critical infrastructure in an increasingly uncertain international environment. This includes the risk of espionage, sabotage and foreign interference with our telecommunications infrastructure, and this is the subject of this bill.


As stated in the explanatory memorandum, telecommunications networks, systems and facilities are critical infrastructure, and they are vital to the delivery and support of other critical infrastructure and services such as power, water and health. The telecommunications sector also forms the backbone of other sectors such as energy, banking and finance. To quote the explanatory memorandum:


A serious compromise of the telecommunications sector would have a cascading effect on other critical infrastructure sectors and significantly impact the Australian economy.


Our telecommunications companies are already voluntarily working with the government to ensure that Australia's critical infrastructure is safe from foreign interference, threats or espionage. This bill puts a framework around that working relationship to ensure that both government and industry know what is required to keep Australians safe and what is expected of them to ensure that these measures are taken. It also protects against the possibility that such goodwill may not be voluntarily forthcoming from all telecommunication companies at some future point. The explanatory memorandum is explicit about the regulatory approach. The proposed regulatory framework recognises the value of a formal relationship between government and industry but, importantly, it aims to achieve national security outcomes on a cooperative basis rather than through the formal exercise of regulatory powers.


This bill is the result of several years of negotiation and cooperation between the government and the telecommunications industry, arising from a broader review of national security issues by the previous Labor government in 2012. It implements the recommendations of two separate inquiries by the PJCIS in 2013 and 2015. In 2013, the PJCIS examined telecommunications security as part of its inquiry into potential reforms of Australia's national security legislation. It was recommended that the government create a telecommunications security framework in recognition of threats to Australia's national security that can be effected through the telecommunications system. In 2015, as part of its inquiry into the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill, the PJCIS again supported telecommunications sector security reforms and recommended that the government ensure that a framework be enacted prior to the implementation of the data retention regime. That was in April this year. These reforms were also subject to two rounds of public consultation on exposure draft legislation.


This bill seeks to provide a proportionate and escalating framework for addressing national security risks. It seeks to strengthen existing arrangements, including information sharing between government and industry. It seeks to provide increased visibility to government of national security risks and to provide greater certainty for industry about government expectations with respect to protecting networks and facilities from unauthorised interference and unauthorised access. The key elements of the bill include establishing a security obligation applicable to all carriers and carriage service providers and intermediaries, requiring them to do their best to protect their networks and facilities from unauthorised access and interference. It requires carriers and nominated carriage service providers to notify the communications access coordinator of planned key changes to telecommunications services or systems that could compromise their ability to comply with this security obligation, and notifications may be provided in the form of either an individual notification or an annual security capability plan. It provides the Attorney-General with the power to issue carriers or carriage service providers with a direction requiring them to do, or refrain from doing, a specified thing in order to manage security risks. It empowers the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to request information from carriers and carriage service providers to monitor their compliance with the security obligation, and it expands the operation of existing civil enforcement mechanisms in the Telecommunications Act 1997 to address noncompliance with the obligations set out in the bill.


As I noted earlier, the bill is the result of a process that was commenced by the former Labor government in 2012, and Labor has worked consistently with government to ensure our security agencies have the powers they need to keep Australians safe. This bill will provide our security agencies with the powers and tools they need to ensure that our telecommunications networks are protected from malicious actors. We take a bipartisan stance on national security legislation. In this context, we closely scrutinise all national security legislation through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.


The bill was introduced to the Senate on 9 November 2016 and was referred to the PJCIS for scrutiny and review. The committee received eight submissions and four supplementary submissions from industry, government and academia. The PJCIS held two public hearings on 16 February 2017 and one public hearing on 23 March 2017 as well as receiving private briefings from relevant agencies in Canberra. The committee has also recently visited Telstra's Global Operations Centre in Melbourne.


The PJCIS's report on this bill made 12 substantive recommendations for improvements to the bill, to the explanatory memorandum and to the administrative guidelines that accompany the bill. Subject to these 12 recommendations being implemented, the committee recommended that the bill be passed. Labor supports the PJCIS recommendations, as we believe they improve the operation of the bill. We note that the government has also agreed to all of these recommendations.


I'd like to briefly discuss the recommendations and their effect on certain elements of the bill. Under existing legislation, the Attorney-General has the power to direct a carrier or a carriage service provider to cease its services on security grounds. This power has never been exercised. As acknowledged in the bill's explanatory memorandum, the use of this power as presently drafted may have a severe impact on innocent users of non-complying telecommunications companies as well as on Australia's economy and telecommunications infrastructure. Appropriately, this bill increases the safeguards around the use of that power. It adds a requirement that ASIO must have issued an adverse security assessment before it can be exercised and it ensures that a decision to issue a direction can be subject to judicial review.


To provide the possibility of a more proportionate response, the bill also grants the Attorney-General the power to direct a carrier or a carriage service provider to do or to refrain from doing a specified act or thing within a specified period to eliminate or reduce risks that are prejudicial to security. The types of things that the Attorney-General can direct a carrier or a carriage service provider to do must be reasonably necessary to reduce or eliminate the risk of unauthorised access or interference. There are also a number of safeguards around the use of this power. It cannot be exercised without an adverse security assessment, and the Attorney-General must be satisfied before issuing a direction that all reasonable steps have been taken to reach agreement between the government and the provider and to consult the affected carrier or carriage service provider in good faith. At recommendation 8 of its report, the PJCIS recommended that it be made clear that the Attorney-General will take into account whether the Communications Access Coordinator has complied with the applicable statutory time frame prior to issuing a direction. And, as I indicated earlier, the government has accepted that recommendation.


During the PJCIS inquiry, industry stakeholders raised concerns that the bill did not place an obligation on the government to proactively brief industry about possible threats and attacks. In their submission, Optus noticed that it would be challenging for industry to notify the government about possible vulnerabilities in their networks or infrastructure when industry may not be aware of specific threat or risk information. While noting that government already has a range of mechanisms to collaborate with industry, the PJCIS recommended that the Attorney-General's Department work collaboratively with industry to further develop this and to ensure effective and regular information sharing—in particular, sharing threat information with industry.


A key issue that was raised through the PJCIS hearings relates to the security of retained telecommunications data that is stored offshore. The Attorney-General's Department advised that the law does not currently compel telecommunications providers to tell the government where retained data is stored. The draft administrative guidelines for the bill note:


Offshoring raises security concerns because it enables access and control to critical parts of major Australian telecommunications networks outside of Australia, this can facilitate foreign intelligence collection (espionage) and disrupt the network itself (sabotage). Risks arise where control and supervision arrangements have the potential to allow unauthorised actions by third parties, such as theft of customer data or sabotage of the network.


The PJCIS expressed concern in its report on the bill that existing laws do not provide government with visibility about where and how data is being stored and emphasised that it is critical that the Australian community can have confidence in the telecommunications sector, especially the security of stored data. Pleasingly, the government has accepted the associated recommendation, specifically recommendation 10, where the PJCIS recommended that their review of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act be expanded to include consideration of the security of offshore telecommunications data that is retained by a service provider for the purpose of the data-retention regime.


I note also recommendation 11, which recommends the bill be amended to include, in relation to that retained data, a specific obligation within the notification requirement in proposed section 314A to require carriers and carriage service providers to notify the communications access coordinator of any new or amended offshoring arrangements.


During the course of the PJCIS inquiry, the committee heard feedback from stakeholders about the scope and application of the bill, including concerns regarding which provisions, if any, should apply to providers of over-the-top services. At recommendations 1, 2, 4 and 5 of its report, the committee suggested amendments that address these questions around scope and application, including to make clear what a company's security obligations are in circumstances where a company is providing or selling an over-the-top service, where telecommunications infrastructure is used but not necessarily owned or operated by the company, where a company's infrastructure is located in a foreign country and uses its services to carry or store information from Australian customers or where a company provides cloud computing and cloud storage solutions. The recommendations also seek to put in place arrangements to make clear that the bill does not apply to certain broadcasters, to clarify the sorts of changes that require notifications to the communications access coordinator and to outline the application process for exemptions from notification requirements. These have been accepted by the government. 


Finally, at recommendation 6, 7, 9 and 12 of its report, the committee recommended a number of accountability measures. These recommendations include making it clear that the bill does not affect the operation of existing legislated privacy; clarifying the reporting requirement to parliament, including those matters which must be addressed in the report; outlining the avenues available for industry to recover reasonable costs in certain circumstances; expanding the scope of PJCIS's review of the data retention regime; and introducing a new requirement that PJCIS review the operation, effectiveness and implications of these reforms within three years. These recommendations, which again have been accepted by the government, supplement the measures already enabled by the bill, including the ability for carriers and carriage service providers to seek merits review before the Administration Appeals Tribunal, where an ASIO adverse security assessment has been made. 


Labor is pleased that the government has accepted all the recommendations of the PJCIS for improvements to this bill and commends the bill to the Senate.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-08-14,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (11:02):  The Greens have been standing firmly against the government's agenda of warrantless, mass surveillance of Australian people for over five years. We have been standing up for basic human rights of Australian citizens—rights like privacy and correspondence without arbitrary or unlawful interference. Throughout this time, both the coalition and Labor governments, locked in zombie lock step, have engaged in a continual barrage of attacks against the rights of the Australian people. Both the establishment parties have stood united in their disregard for human rights, using fearmongering about national security as an excuse to continually strip back the rights of ordinary Australian people. The telecommunications sector security reforms, the TSSR, proposed in Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 require telecommunications carriers and carriage service providers to detect telecommunications infrastructure in the national interest. 


The office of the Attorney-General have the power to collect any type of information from telcos and, in turn, share this information with the AFP and third parties. Without clear guidelines as to the types of data that constitute any information, this legislation extends beyond the existing metadata creation, retention and disclosure regime. Even with the addition of clear guidelines, this legislation still represents duplication of the data retention scheme and for the same purpose. The Greens do not support this dragnet surveillance of Australians under either scheme. 


A key difference under this new legislation is the government's attempt at having no defined reporting obligations. While the Attorney-General will be able to choose to collect and access private communications metadata under the TSSR, he had no intention of being held accountable to the same checks and balances, such as they are, that are in place for the metadata creation, retention and disclosure regime. Metadata collection under the TSSR does not require authorisation or notification, and the Commonwealth Ombudsman is not granted oversight powers. But, even with the clarifications of these reporting obligations under today's amendments, what guarantee do we have in this place that the Attorney-General will choose to honour them?


Today I was going to give notice of a motion for the Attorney-General to produce the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act annual report for 2015-16. This is the report in which the Attorney-General sets out the extent and circumstances in which eligible Commonwealth, state and territory government agencies have used the powers available under TIA Act. This is the report in which the Attorney-General tells us about the government's data retention activities for the first time. So imagine my surprise when this report was tabled this morning—at one minute to midnight: only minutes before the start of this debate in the Senate. I have seen attorneys-general in the Tasmanian parliament and the Commonwealth parliament treat parliaments with contempt on a number of occasions, but I tell you what: this one just about takes the cake. This is a ridiculous and insulting action for the Attorney-General to take, in withholding this report until, as I said, one minute to midnight—just minutes before the start of this debate today. I want to place on the record that the timing of the Attorney-General tabling this report in the Senate this morning was clearly designed to prevent this Senate from having the opportunity to analyse the information and data in that report and use that information and data to inform our position on this legislation and our contributions on this legislation—an utter disgrace from the Attorney-General.


As the new data retention obligations came into effect on October 2015, that report is the first report from the Attorney-General that includes the new obligations under the data retention act. He has deliberately held back on fulfilling his reporting obligations in a timely way, and yet here he is asking for more open-ended, obligation-free access to the private communications of the Australian people. There had been two whole years of telecommunications interception and access with zero reporting and, therefore, zero government accountability until today. The Attorney-General has held back the vital reporting on the new data retention obligations until, as I say, one minute to midnight, in an attempt to ensure that this Senate remains in ignorance about the matters contained in that report.


We have, however, had time to review the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report on monitoring of agency access to stored communications and telecommunications data for 2015-16. And what a concerning picture that report paints. It is a picture of non-compliance in record-keeping provisions and warrant conditions and restrictions from several agencies, the worst being from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, as they then were. Customs were found to be non-compliant or were unable to demonstrate compliance across each of the Ombudsman's inspection criteria. Customs did not have processes in place to demonstrate that they were following regulations relating to lawfully accessing, managing and keeping records of access to communications data, and the ombudsman's report indicated that they were not cooperative or frank for the inspection. That is yet another damning indictment of the now Department of Immigration and Border Protection under the bumbling, incompetent minister for immigration, Mr Dutton. Customs did not have processes in place to demonstrate, as I said, that they were lawfully accessing communications data. There were also a number of instances of warrants being exercised by a person who was not authorised across other departments, including the AFP.


This legislation that we are currently debating also gives power to the Attorney-General to direct telcos to do or to not do something to their networks in the name of national security. It is easy to understand why this is making carriers and service providers uncomfortable. The Attorney-General and the coalition government have proven time and time again that they are digitally illiterate. We have seen their ridiculous demands for access to encrypted communications, and when you add that to their long list of spectacular government system failures—the census fail, the robo-debt fail, the Centrelink and Medicare data links fail and, of course, the rollout of a substandard NBN—it paints a very concerning picture about this government's digital literacy. Let's be clear, just about every computer system the government touch turns to hashtag #fail. This government have shown that, without a doubt, they cannot be trusted to keep government networks and systems safe and secure, so why on earth would we in this place give them the power to dictate network security to the private sector as well?


The industry associations are also concerned that they could face very high costs to rebuild existing networks without limitations on the requirement for carriers and service providers to retrofit or remove existing facilities. The legislation also forces telcos to inform the government of changes to their networks. The joint submission from the telecommunications industry associations to the PJCIS warned:


… the onerous nature of the compliance requirements will act to hamper the responsiveness of … cyber threats—


as well as:


… divert scarce resources away from investing directly in addressing cyber security threats …


They also highlight the prescriptive and one-sided nature of this legislation, and point to more collaborative approaches used in places like the US, the UK and Canada. The US's cyber security act creates a framework for the voluntary sharing of cyber threat information between private entities and the federal government, with the goal of exchanging cyber threat information rapidly and responsibly. It also contains measures to protect privacy by ensuring personal information is not unnecessarily divulged. The UK's National Cyber Security Strategy also employs a far more collaborative approach, in which the government shares threat information with industry and provides advice and guidance to industry on managing risks. 


The industry associations note:


… policy makers and Government should give considerable weight to the expertise of network providers in designing and safeguarding their networks and the clear commercial incentive that exists in a highly competitive sector to drive security by design in network architecture to ensure operational reliability and customer trust and loyalty.


'Trust' and 'loyalty': these are not terms that can be attributed to customers of the NBN or of online government systems at the moment, due to the government's epic fails in a range of areas that I have pointed out in this speech.


Industry associations describe this legislation as 'onerous', 'excessive' and 'one-sided'. They warn that the TSSR regime will not be adaptable or flexible enough to tackle risks that will emerge. Much like this government, it will not be agile enough to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Much like this government, it is out of step and, at the same time, it is a massive overreach. It places excessive and onerous demands and obligations on telecommunications companies, demands which are likely to put infrastructure at greater risk. It puts Australians in a position where they will have their rights to privacy stripped away without their knowledge and to no benefit in terms of the public good. It does all this with no obligations for the government to share information of threats with companies or to provide transparency of their actions to Australians.


The Australian Greens have been opposing this government's flagrant disregard for human rights to privacy and its agenda of warrantless mass surveillance of Australian citizens for more than five years, and we have been opposing it no matter what the political stripe of the government of the day. As we have done, we will continue to do by opposing this legislation. We oppose the Attorney-General collecting, storing and accessing Australians' private communications information under any scheme. We oppose the Attorney-General having a choice of schemes whereby he can pick or choose the rules and guidelines under which he accesses this private information. We oppose the Attorney-General, who has more than proven his digital illiteracy on a number of occasions, being in a position to tell telcos and ISPs how to make their networks 'more secure', likely, we point out, actually making them less secure in the process. We oppose these privileges being granted to the Attorney-General when he has already been shown to be prepared to deliberately hold back on fulfilling his reporting obligations under the existing metadata creation, retention and disclosure regime.


We oppose the government's onerous, excessive, one-sided plan to put Australian telecommunications infrastructure at risk by further imposing their incompetence on the Australian telecommunications industry. And we once again urge Australians to stand up and protect their rights to privacy as the government has shown it is not prepared to do and, in fact, that the government has demonstrated it has utter disregard for.


Why is the Attorney-General tabling the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 report only minutes prior to this bill being debated? Just as pertinent, when can we expect the report for the year 2016-17 to be tabled? The 2015-16 one was over a year overdue, so when are we going to get the 2016-17 report? How does the government respond to the industry associations' concerns that the underlying approach of this bill is flawed and that it is more likely to make Australian telecommunications networks less secure due to the one-sided, onerous and excessive nature of obligations for carriers and carrier service providers that constitute the massive overreach contained in this legislation? And why is the government seeking to duplicate data retention under this scheme and how will the overlapping and duplicated schemes and data be handled?


In conclusion, we have zero confidence in this government's capacity to oversee the scheme that this legislation proposes to create, because the government has shown, time after time, that they are digitally illiterate, that they treat their reporting requirements to this parliament with utter contempt and that they simply cannot be trusted to run computer systems and networks securely and to protect the private data of Australians in the 21st century.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (11:18):  I rise to make a few brief comments about the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 and I do so as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security which considered this bill in detail and, indeed, engaged with not only the industry players that Senator McKim has just referred to but also the government agencies that came before the government highlighting the requirement for this legislation.


The first thing I would like to point out, particularly following Senator McKim's points which go very much to the ideology of the Greens in opposing any attempt by the government to make sure that our community continues to be safe, is his conflation of two issues. He mentions, on a number of occasions, data retention as though this bill is intending to extend or somehow change the data retention requirements. In actual fact, the intent of this bill is to better manage national security risks to the telecommunications networks from espionage, sabotage and foreign interference. What the bill is looking to do is extend the work that Australia has been doing with industry over a number of years on the systems that we rely on, whether it be industry in their own business, the general public, government or security agencies. All of us now are enabled through data, whether it is on your mobile phone or on computer networks in your office. Data and telecommunications are essential, and, if we are to remain both secure economically in terms of espionage and secure from a national security perspective in terms of espionage against the state, as in government information and secrets, then we need to make sure that the system that transports that information is secure. The one reference in this bill to data retention is not about expanding and duplicating the scheme. The intent of it is saying, 'If, in your data retention obligations, you have offshored or you plan to make changes, you need to advise the government of the fact that you're making changes to a regime which is a critical part of our national security infrastructure.' There's a deliberate attempt by the Greens in this debate today to conflate these two issues. This bill is about making sure that the whole network that we all rely on is and remains secure.


In fact, the evidence taken by the PJCIS and consequently our recommendations go to address some of the concerns that have been raised around things like the transparency of information and the degree of communication from government to industry. Our recommendations say: if government becomes aware of a particular threat that industry should be taking cognisance of and where they should be acting to prevent an intrusion or a weakness in our telecommunications system, then government needs to be sharing that information more transparently with industry. In fact, this bill is about increasing the amount of cooperation and transparency between government and industry to make sure that, when we see threats, we work with industry to address them and that, when industry make changes to their networks, to the physical architecture or the contractual arrangements, which might expose Australians' information to threat, they advise government of that so that we can collaboratively work on keeping Australians safe.


My colleague Senator McAllister has stepped through a number of the details of the bill, so I'm not going to repeat all of that. There has been a bipartisan position reached on this. I just want to highlight the fact that there are two key elements where this government has been working, by and large in bipartisan cooperation with the opposition, to make sure that Australians remain safe. That's in terms of national security and countering the terrorist threat in particular but also from the economic perspective. I will start with the latter: Lloyd's, one of the world's largest insurance companies, estimates that the threat to the Australian economy is in the order of $16 billion over the next decade from cyberattack and espionage. We are under constant cyberattack, particularly from international players—and also, potentially, some domestically. Sydney actually ranks 12th of the world's major financial centres in terms of the degree of risk. Around $4.8 billion is the potential loss if cybersecurity is not taken seriously. 


Whilst companies can take individual steps, the network upon which data is passed is key in terms of making sure that that data is safe. The particular company can take all the measures they like, but, if the pathways upon which that data is transmitted are not secure, then all the efforts an individual company may have made come to naught. That is why we are focused on making sure from an economic perspective that the networks are secure; hence this bill to increase the security framework of our telecommunications networks. The recommendations made by the committee were particularly to address some of the concerns that were raised by industry during the hearings. The government has chosen to accept all of the recommendations from the committee, and they form the basis of what is before the Senate today.


On the national security side, the integrity of our telecommunications system is important not only to stop intrusion but also for things like the data retention provisions. Data retention has been used for many years in Australia. It doesn't matter whether you are dealing with child pornography, organised crime or, indeed, terrorism, it is one of the most important tools that our law enforcement agencies have. So as we look back and congratulate our agencies on their 13 significant disruptions of plots to conduct terror, as we look at the fact that since 2014 more than 70 people have been charged as a result of 31 counter-terrorism operations around the country, it comes down to the fact that the government, in cooperation with the opposition, has passed eight major tranches of legislation to give our law enforcement agencies the tools they need to respond in a timely manner to a rapidly evolving threat.


You can see that threat evolving globally and even here in Australia. Over the last four or five years, we have gone from a period where terrorist plots were largely a network of people with a coordinated and complex plot that our agencies could engage with over a period of months in terms of surveillance and collecting evidence before acting to what we now see globally and even in Australia, which is that terrorist plots can be very simple, very quick and low-technology. The laws the agencies require to obtain intelligence and also to act to keep Australians safe have changed.


So this government has passed eight significant tranches of legislation, including the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016, which was passed to allow the continued detention of high-risk terrorist offenders. A reasonable person in the street would agree that, if somebody has not renounced the ideology that made them a risk in the first place, we would be foolish to be releasing them back onto the streets while they still pose a risk.


The Criminal Code Amendment (War Crimes Act) 2016 was passed to enable the ADF to legally target members of armed groups such as ISIL in Syria and Iraq. We had the situation where some domestic law was preventing the effective engagement and disruption of an enemy that is sworn to Australia's destruction, that has been committing genocide in parts of the world. So we have passed legislation to make it possible for the ADF to be effective.


The Counter-Terrorist Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2016 lowered to 14 years the age limit on control orders. Why? Because we are seeing people as young as that involved in both the preparation and the actual conduct of terrorist acts and our community rightly expects that we will give our agencies the powers they need to deal with a threat that is evident, that is here today.


The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Bill was passed, providing for the revocation or renunciation of citizenship of dual nationals convicted of or engaged in terrorism-related conduct. When I go to various functions in the community in Australia probably the most frequent comment I get from men and women is: 'If somebody is engaged in terrorist acts against Australia, why do we allow them back into the country? Why do we keep them here?' This bill made it clear that, where somebody has dual citizenship and has essentially renounced their Australian citizenship by taking terrorist action against Australia, their Australian citizenship will be removed; and that has occurred. 


The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Bill 2015 is not a new power; there has been data retention for many years. But with the changing commercial environment people no longer needed to retain for billing purposes the kind of information that shows person A picked up a phone and rang for 15 minutes. That is how telcos used to bill. They would look at your telephone record and charge you for the calls you made. Now that the world has moved on—through much more internet based protocols to packages where you buy up front, they have no commercial need to retain much of that information. Yet that information—whether it is child sex offences, organised crime and drugs, or terrorism—is critical to our law enforcement agencies. That bill was not about creating new powers; it was largely about preserving one of the most effective tools that our agency has. In 2014, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) was passed enabling ASIS to assist the ADF in relation to terrorists and updating and expanding the regime to apply to enablers. Commonsense measures say that if an Australian citizen is overseas and doing something to the detriment of Australia, our interests or our allies then ASIS can help the ADF. And that people here who are enabling and preparing for an act are people we should be able to engage with as opposed to those who are actually in the act of committing a terrorist offence. The Counter‑Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Act 2014 was passed to respond to the threat of Australians engaging in and returning from conflicts. And, finally, there is the National Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2014. 


The reason I have run through those bills is that they have been passed on a bipartisan basis in the parliament in the interests of the Australian public, and I make no apologies for those bills. The government's first priority is keeping Australians safe. This most recent bill, whilst not directly a counterterrorist bill or directly a counterespionage bill, goes to the integrity of our telecommunications and data systems which provide a vulnerability if we do not keep them secure. That vulnerability goes to both terrorism-type offences and national security as well as to our economic security through cyberattacks. 


I encourage people who are interested to download the PJCIS report, where we go through both the submissions and the government's submission in detail as to why this bill is required. This piece of legislation is implementing the recommendations of the PJCIS. I particularly want to highlight that the ideological objection of the Greens is misplaced specifically in regard to this bill because it is not about increasing data retention powers. It is about saying that if a telco has an obligation under the data retention regime and they choose to change the nature of their network then they need to advise the Commonwealth so that we can have a sensible discussion about the implications. I am very happy to support this bill and commend it to the Senate.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-08-14,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:32):  The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016 will amend the Telecommunications Act 1997 and related legislation with the aim of strengthening the security of Australia's telecommunications networks. Australia's telecommunications networks are an absolutely vital part of our national infrastructure, enabling us to conduct business and go about our everyday lives online. Our economic prosperity, our wellbeing and, indeed, our national security are dependent on telecommunications networks and the data that flows across them. 


I don't think anyone can question the scale and seriousness of the potential cyberthreats to Australia from serious to highly organised crime, often operating on an industrial scale, to clandestine activity by foreign governments. All the publicly available advice from our security and intelligence agencies suggests— and I quote from the minister's second reading speech:


Espionage and clandestine foreign interference activity against Australian interests is extensive. 


This legislation has been developed over a lengthy period of time with extensive consultation with industry and other stakeholders with exposure drafts available for public consultation and, more recently, by an inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The bill proposes amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997 to place an obligation on all carriers, carriage service providers and carriage service intermediaries to do their best to protect telecommunications networks and facilities from unauthorised interference and unauthorised access for the purposes of security. Companies will have to consider national security risks such as espionage, sabotage and foreign interference threats, and the confidentiality of information and communications as well as the availability and integrity of telecommunications network facilities. This obligation will be supported by new notification obligations. Carriers and nominated carriage service providers will be required to notify changes to systems and services if the carrier or the nominated carriage service provider becomes aware that a proposed change is likely to have a materially adverse effect on their ability to meet their security obligations to protect networks and facilities from unauthorised access and interference. Early notification to security agencies should allow those agencies to provide advice at the planning stage and ensure security considerations are factored into the proposed design as early as possible in a cost-effective manner. As the minister put it in introducing the bill:


The scheme relies on a 'light touch' approach to regulation to allow for meaningful collaboration and cooperation with industry to manage risks in a way that is satisfactory to both industry and government, without the government being too prescriptive and retaining flexibility for industry.


Clearly, a close and effective dialogue between our national security agencies—especially ASIO and the Australian Signals Directorate—and industry will be essential if the legislation is to deliver the enhanced security we all seek.


The bill has now been the subject of an extensive inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, a process that has allowed further comment and input from industry. The joint committee has made a number of recommendations that are broadly reflected in the amendments now proposed by the government. I won't go through all those amendments and recommendations. Suffice to say they all significantly improve the legislation.


I will, however, focus on one matter examined by the joint committee, and that is the question of the location of stored data. This is a very important issue. As the draft administrative guidelines accompanying the bill note, offshore data storage raises significant security issues relating both to the storage of personal information, financial and other sensitive data and, indeed, to national security. The draft administrative guidelines note:


Offshoring raises security concerns because it enables access and control to critical parts of major Australian telecommunications networks outside of Australia, this can facilitate foreign intelligence collection (espionage) and disrupt the network itself (sabotage). Risks arise where control and supervision arrangements have the potential to allow unauthorised actions by third parties, such as theft of customer data or sabotage of the network.


The Attorney-General's Department noted that the bill does not specify where or how data must be stored, but instead supports a risk based approach where companies 'can retain flexibility to support their changing business needs and to minimise any regulatory burden on their ability to conduct business internationally'. The law, as it stands and as is proposed, does not currently compel telecommunications providers to tell the government where data retained is stored. That is something I have concerns about, and I propose to raise them in my usual respected manner with the Attorney because I am concerned about the data being stored overseas. I don't think a risk based approach is adequate here, given the potential for espionage or sabotage.


The joint committee rightly observes:


It is critical that the Australian community can have confidence in the telecommunications sector and especially the security of stored data.


Australia's existing legal framework for the protection of information includes requirements under the Privacy Act and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, including mandatory encryption for retained telecommunications data as well as a recently introduced mandatory data breach notification scheme. The joint committee notes that the telecommunications sector security framework would apply to carriers and carriage service providers—C/CSPs—irrespective of whether certain parts of a C/CSP's operation are located in Australia or overseas. The location of data is not necessarily determinant of its security, but there are clear risks associated with offshore data storage. The joint committee rightly expressed itself 'greatly concerned that existing laws do not provide government with visibility about where and how data is being stored'. We need that visibility. The notification requirements proposed for the bill will require telecommunications companies to notify the government of any changes they propose to make that are likely to have a material adverse effect on their ability to comply with their security obligations. This requirement must include any decisions to store critical data offshore.


The bill does contain information-gathering powers that could be used, if necessary, to compel companies to provide information that is relevant to assessing compliance with their security obligations. The joint committee has recommended:


… that at the time of the review required to be undertaken by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security under section 187N of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, the scope of the review be expanded to include consideration of the security of off-shored telecommunications data that is retained by a service provider for the purpose of the data retention regime.


The joint committee has further recommended:


… the Bill should be amended to include, in relation to data retained under Part 5-1A of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, a specific obligation within the notification requirement in proposed section 314A to require—


carriers and nominated carriage service providers to notify the department—


of any new or amended offshoring arrangements.


This seems to be an essential provision, as a minimum, to ensure the security considerations are properly taken into account in any arrangements to store Australians' personal, financial or other sensitive data overseas.


My view is that I don't like it. This, to me, is putting Australians' data at too much risk. Why risk it when we should ensure that the data is stored here, onshore rather than offshore? While recognising the significant costs involved in ensuring adequate data security, I would also raise the likelihood that the so-called light-touch approach of this bill will need to be revisited in the future. Recent revelations in the banking sector suggest that very large and well-resourced companies—yes, Which bank?—can still prove shamefully negligent in failing to comply with regulatory regimes, even those relating to money laundering and terrorist financing. All too often, the pursuit of super profits and directors' bonuses can lead corporations to skate over important regulatory obligations. I suspect that this legislation will be the first in building much stronger measures to ensure the security of our telecommunications infrastructure and the protection of Australians' personal data. For the moment, I and my colleagues will support the bill and the associated proposed amendments, but we do have serious concerns in relation to the offshoring of Australians' data.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-08-14,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (11:41):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016. The bill purports to improve national security at the cost of more government control over private telecommunications companies. The bill will introduce a new regulatory framework, supposedly to better manage national security risks of espionage, sabotage and foreign interference to Australia's telecommunications networks and facilities.


Specifically, the bill imposes a new security obligation on telecommunication carriers, carriage service providers and intermediaries. They will now be obliged to do their best to manage the risk of unauthorised access and interference, even where such access or interference does not involve committing an offence. They will also have to notify the government of planned changes to their networks and services that could risk unauthorised access and interference, even where the changes do not increase the risk of offences being committed. Of course, they will have to give information to government so compliance with these obligations can be monitored. In fairness, the directions power is limited to instances where ASIO has given an adverse security assessment and the Attorney-General is satisfied that using the power is reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce a risk to security. Consideration will supposedly be given to the costs and impacts on competition and consumers. However, fundamentally, the greatest weight is required to be given to the ASIO security assessment.


The net effect of this bill is that consumers will get worse service at a higher cost. This is because this bill will (1) increase compliance costs on industry; (2) restrict competition, as only big established companies would put up with the red tape; and (3) distort investment away from what consumers want, as bureaucrats will make directions without knowing the trade-offs between security, cost and other features for each option and without knowing or caring what sort of trade-off consumers prefer. Government can secure its own data just by choosing ICT businesses that offer gold-standard security. With respect to private data, the government, arguably, has a role to prevent crimes—like hacking into a bank—that could hurt more than those directly involved. But the current law covers this, and there is no case to go further.


What there is no doubt about is that this bill increases regulation and costs to telecommunication service providers to the detriment of consumers and to the dubious benefit of central government. It gives ASIO additional telecommunication oversight powers and obliges telecommunication service providers to both maintain enhanced security and report breaches. Is this a vital piece of legislation to enhance our national security? The Liberal Democrats don't think so.


In a free society, intrusions into individual privacy in the interests of national security and law enforcement are based on probable cause. However, more and more we see measures taken by governments which curtail the freedom of all in an effort to monitor and prevent unlawful efforts by a tiny few. Logically, in doing this both Liberal and Labor seem increasingly to think that everyone is equally likely to be a threat. If this were true, then the fundamental basis of a democratic liberal society is called into question, and the first ideological step has been taken towards creating a police state.


We believe the current laws, effectively policed, provide more than enough powers. I will consequently be opposing this bill.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (11:45):  May I close the second reading debate by thanking honourable senators for their contributions. Let me start with Senator McAllister.


Might I acknowledge and thank the opposition for its support for this bill, the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2016. Like all of the tranches of national-security-related legislation that I have introduced into this chamber, this bill has been the subject of extensive consideration by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The PJCIS has recommended a number of amendments, which the government has agreed to, and I want to thank the opposition both for its support for the bill and for its contribution to the deliberative process through the PJCIS.


Speaking of which, can I also thank Senator Fawcett, who is a member of the PJCIS, for his characteristically thoughtful and well-informed contribution. I also want to acknowledge and thank Senator Xenophon for his thoughtful contribution and his support for the bill. 


Senator Leyonhjelm, who has just spoken, has indicated that, effectively on libertarian grounds, he will oppose the bill. This is a position, as we know, that Senator Leyonhjelm characteristically takes. I am glad that on legislation of this kind, where government and opposition—the alternative parties of government in this place—agree that we have a contradictor; that we hear the other side of the argument from a libertarian point of view. If I may say so, there is always a crystalline elegance about Senator Leyonhjelm's contributions to this debate. He is very much a purist. But can I say to you, Senator Leyonhjelm, that in the government's view your concerns on a libertarian basis are misplaced. Your warnings about the creation of a police state are vastly wrongheaded, with respect. And, might I point out, Senator Leyonhjelm, that, if not always, then typically, you have opposed the government's national security legislation reforms.


And, might I point out to you, with respect, Senator Leyonhjelm—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—that when on Thursday of the week before last the Deputy Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Deputy Commissioner Phelan, announced the charging of two people following an alleged attempt to bring down an aircraft in consequence of a plot, which it will be alleged was being conducted on Australian soil, Deputy Commissioner Phelan, who runs the counterterrorism operation, went out of his way to point out that it was because of powers given to the Australian Federal Police by this parliament in the eight tranches of national security legislation which have been introduced by this government over the last three years that the AFP was able to make those arrests and conduct that investigation so successfully, thus saving potentially hundreds and hundreds of lives.


I am not making a debating point, Senator Leyonhjelm; that was the view of the operational officer in charge of Australia's counterterrorism efforts. But it does, I think, make the point that, on occasions and only where there is a clear need to do so, it is sometimes necessary to give the police additional power in order to protect public safety. We have the endorsement of Deputy Commissioner Phelan that that has been the very effect of some of the laws that this Senate has passed after deliberation, including the contributions which you have made.


I can't say that Senator McKim's contribution had the same crystalline elegance as yours, Senator Leyonhjelm. It was a confused contribution because, with respect, Senator McKim confused the bill. He said that this was about mass government surveillance. It has absolutely nothing to do with mass government surveillance whatsoever. As a matter of fact, what this bill is to do with is protecting systems. 



Senator McKim interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  I think, Senator McKim—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—you are thinking of another bill. It's always good counsel, if you participate in these debates, to work out which bill you're talking about.


Nevertheless, let me—having responded to those who contributed—make some closing remarks. I've already thanked the PJCIS for its contribution to the process. May I repeat that since 2014 this government, first under the leadership of Mr Abbott and now under the leadership of Mr Turnbull, has led the most significant program of national security legislation reform in a generation. The bill currently before the chamber is the ninth tranche of significant national security legislation which this government has introduced—which I have introduced—in the past three years.


The bill is a critically important piece of national security legislation, because telecommunications networks form part of Australia's critical infrastructure and also support other critical sectors such as health, finance, transport, water and power. Cyberthreats to Australia are persistent, whether they arise from sabotage, espionage, serious and organised crime or other technology enabled crime. The existing framework for managing these risks in the telecommunications industry is inadequate, and I think that fact is widely acknowledged. It relies on voluntary cooperation and goodwill, which is not always sufficient given the nature of the risks to national security and the gravity of those risks.


So this bill will address that shortcoming in the protection of the telecommunications system at the moment. It will amend the Telecommunications Act to place an obligation on all carriers, carriage service providers and carriage service intermediaries to do their best to protect telecommunications networks and facilities from unauthorised interference and unauthorised access. This obligation will be supported by new notification requirements to encourage early engagement to allow risks to be assessed and mitigated. Carriers and nominated carriage service providers will be required to notify changes to systems and services if a carrier or nominated carriage service provider becomes aware that a proposed change is likely to have a material adverse effect on their ability to meet the security obligation to protect networks and facilities from unauthorised access and interference. 


Companies will also be given the opportunity to forecast changes to telecommunications systems in annual security capability plans. In line with the risk based nature of these reforms, the notification regime includes an exemptions process. This will reduce the regulatory burden on some companies and ensure that the resources of security agencies are targeted. The bill also prescribes annual reporting requirements on the operation of the legislation in an effort to improve the transparency of the regime.


Following introduction of the bill on 9 November last year, I referred it to the PJCIS for inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr Andrew Hastie MP. The committee recognised that protecting telecommunications infrastructure requires a joint partnership between government and industry. The recommendations of the committee provide great clarity and certainty for industry, encourage information sharing and enhance the transparency of the regime's operation.


In addition to the committee's inquiries, these reforms have been the subject of extensive industry consultation, beginning as long ago as 2012. Senator Leyonhjelm—through you, Mr Acting Deputy President—your observations about the burden to industry overlook the fact that this proposal has been developed collaboratively with industry through very extensive consultations that took into account industry's views. As a result, a number of changes were made to improve the operation of the proposed legislation in response to that feedback, including providing additional safeguards to govern the use of the proposed regulatory powers, clarifying the intended scope and application of requirements to be imposed on telecommunications providers, and other measures. I want to take this opportunity to thank those from industry who contributed so constructively to what has been, on any view, a very thorough consultation process.


In conclusion: the bill will establish a regulatory framework to better manage national security risks of espionage, sabotage and foreign interference and to better protect networks and the confidentiality of information stored on and carried across them from unauthorised interference and access—not surveillance, Senator McKim, but protection. There will be a set of government amendments to give effect to the recommendations of the PJCIS, subject to the committee stage. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (15:03):  Under standing order 74(5)(b), I move:


That the Senate take note of the explanation.


The catchcry of this government has been, 'We want to be doing things with, not to, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities,' yet the introduction of the CDP, in regard to consultation, would be rated as a failure. Despite the government's stated intention of wanting to engage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander individuals, families and communities, no such consultation has indeed occurred. The CDP, as we have heard through our own visits to communities, through our own investigations and, indeed, through Senate estimates, has absolutely impacted, in an extremely negative way, on the lives of individuals, families and communities.


From the range of questions Labor senators put during the estimates process and, indeed, these unanswered questions on notice to the minister, we can see that the CDP is not transparent. We have spoken to organisations on the ground and to affected Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and they don't understand the process which has been imposed upon them. But that's about all we do know for certain. There is little evidence, if any, that the CDP has been successful in getting people into sustainable jobs, which surely must be the intent of this program or, indeed, any program. Its forerunner, the Remote Jobs and Community Program, known as the RJCP, was just in its infancy when the government declared it to be a 'disaster'. There was no long-term investigation into how it was operating; it was just stopped and cut. Then, seemingly without consultation, the CDP was rolled out.


One of the claims the government makes is that there are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations running the CDP program—and there are. But many of those organisations were simply transferred over from the abandoned RJCP scheme. They don't have any power to change or apply local circumstances to the CDP. They are merely a conduit for the government's harsh CDP agenda. As one of the submitters to the current CDP inquiry suggests:


It is therefore a government choice as to whether the largely government provided economy is a welfare or an employment based economy.


When we look at remote communities, we can see that they rely on governments for infrastructure delivery, for houses, for medical centres and, indeed, for service provision. The government is a large potential employer in communities. But it is their choice whether they provide an economy to remote communities or create further welfare dependency. It comes as no surprise to me that that submitter was none other than the Liberal former Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander minister, Mr Fred Chaney, who has been the lone Liberal voice on injustice after injustice to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and in particular to those in remote communities. 


I've only had a short amount of time to have a look at the answers provided to me today, but certainly one of the concerns that all Labor senators expressed after the last Senate estimates was the number of compliance investigations. In just eight months there were nearly half a million. When we raised those questions at Senate estimates, the minister, Senator Scullion, offered us a briefing. Certainly he said that to me privately. Well, we called his office to organise that briefing—and guess what? We're still waiting. It never came. We waited several weeks for this offered briefing to materialise. I can certainly, outside of the chamber, provide the name of the individual that we spoke to in his office about the briefing, if the minister is interested. I certainly don't think it's appropriate to put it on the record publicly in this place. We were still waiting, so we submitted our questions on notice, and we waited and we waited, and we waited. And I think to have to wait a full month after the due date is tardy to say the least. 


And so at 10 past 12 today, we informed the minister's office that we would be using the standing order after question time, and we were told that the minister had signed off on the questions, but they were 'floating around' in the department somewhere. Again, that is extremely tardy. This issue of CDP is a very, very important issue. I was up at the Ng Lands last year, in a very remote community—I'm sure the minister knows it well—and I know that Senator Dodson, too, visited that community to see firsthand the devastation that CDP is creating in those very small communities. English is not widely spoken there. Most people speak language across those communities. Indeed, wherever we went we were expected to have an interpreter, because, as I say, not only is English not widely spoken, it's not widely known. And I saw in that community breach letter after breach letter after breach letter.


There's a story out of Warburton on that. One of the questions we asked the minister today is: what sorts of records are kept? We were informed that participants are not given breach letters—aren't advised when their payments are breached. Well, that completely flies in the face of a four-page, extremely technical letter that was sent to a young woman in the Warburton community. As to her circumstances: again, if organisations on the ground had one iota of flexibility, she would never have been breached. She had served some time in a detention facility and had been released on orders, and those orders prohibited her from attending the Warburton community. As we also know from comments that Senator Malarndirri McCarthy made in this place last week, people in these communities don't have addresses. They don't live at '10 Smith Street, Warburton'. All of the mail is collected centrally. So she got a letter from the department that was just addressed to 'Miss So-and-so, Warburton'. She wasn't there, because she had an order against her which said that she wasn't allowed to go back, for the time the order prevailed, to the Warburton community. So she was in an adjoining community. The community knew that, and no doubt the CDP provider knew that, but somehow that message didn't make its way through to Centrelink.


Another interesting thing that happened was this. Again, local knowledge is really what we want to be applied in these situations. Anyone who visits the Ng Lands knows that they operate, for the most part, on central desert time. But Warburton doesn't; Warburton operates on Western Australian time. So when the required phone call was organised, the officer from the department residing in Queensland just assumed that Warburton was on central desert time, which it isn't. So she never got the phone call. But that was a strike against her. There was simply no investigation made; she was just told: 'You didn't show up for your appointment.' Even though the officer had arranged that appointment on central desert time, and Warburton is on Western Australian time, that was a black mark against her name. Again, if we'd been able to have that input of local knowledge, that would not have occurred, because someone could've told the Queensland officer: 'Hang on a minute—unlike the rest of the communities in the Ng Lands, Warburton is on Western Australian time.'


As I said, what's well known about that community—potentially not well known by an officer in Queensland, but certainly by those of us in this place who have visited—is that English, for most of the people in that community, is not spoken, and indeed is not well known. Her letter is four pages—four pages of technical jargon that she wouldn't have been able to understand in any event. But that flies in the face of the information that I've waited a whole month for, which tells me that those letters are not even sent. So not only do communities not understand the CDP and its implications; apparently, the government does not either. They told me in questions delivered to my office today at 1:41 that somehow no breach letters are given out, and yet I have a breach letter addressed to a young woman in Warburton. What's going on there?


So the CDP is a mess. We are having an inquiry into the CDP because, clearly, people are doing it really tough. The other evidence I heard in Warburton, and indeed saw with my own eyes, is that children are going hungry when a person is breached. Children are going hungry because there's no money in the community. They are relying on the person in the home who maybe has an age pension to provide for the whole community.


Indeed, this is not just about the Ng Lands. Last week, Twiggy Forrest came here and said the answer to the problem is to roll out the BasicsCard. We on this side know that there is no single answer to the generations of dispossession that have been foisted upon our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. And, from speaking to agencies firsthand in Kununurra, I can tell you that there is a problem with the BasicsCard. It is being cashed out by the local taxi drivers. Taxis are allowed to be used on the BasicsCard, so the drivers are exploiting the community. They give out cash but keep most of the money for themselves. And I'm told it's children that are doing this. I'm also told that burglaries have gone up in Kununurra. Why? Well, we know what young kids do when they're hungry: they break in. The BasicsCard is not creating all of the problems, it's CDP as well. So Mr Forrest needs to look a little further than his one-size-fits-all. He needs to speak to people in Kununurra and see what's happening. If it's widely known that that's what taxi drivers are doing there, and seemingly it is, then how come Mr Forrest missed that basic truth?


I'm told that the CDP and the BasicsCard are strongly contributing to what's happening in Kununurra. So I'm disappointed that the minister chose to ignore our questions for a whole month. And there are processes in this place to get information. I didn't necessarily want to go down the questions on notice route. By contrast, when I asked the Attorney-General for a briefing on the McGlade matter, I very quickly got a very thorough briefing by one of his staff. I was able to ask lots of questions. It was a very thorough briefing. I asked for it and I received it. Unfortunately, when the minister offered the briefing, we waited and waited and nothing happened. I put on notice questions about my very serious concerns about the CDP program. Those questions had remained unanswered until, at 10 past 12 today, I did the minister the courtesy of letting him know we would be doing that—and suddenly the answers are forthcoming. I haven't had a proper opportunity to give close scrutiny to those answers, but my first reading of them is that they fly in the face of other information we got from Senate estimates. I will leave my remarks there.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2017-08-14,"



Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:18):  I thank the senator but I would like to correct some significant inaccuracies in her contribution. First of all, I did apologise for both the briefing and the lateness of this. I know that at least one member opposite, Senator Dodson—and I hope he'll have something to say about this—was in fact at Garma when I made an announcement of significant changes to this. Because we were making sure that the announcement was going to be able to be made absolutely accurately with the significant change in the policy, we wanted to delay briefing anyone until that happened—and that is just the way it went.


In terms of some other inaccuracies in your presentation of how this has all gone, in my view that is somewhat in fantasy land. You say the RJCP was in its infancy, that it had hardly had a go. Well, it had had a decline of 60 per cent in the number of people who were even attending. I'm not sure what those opposite would want it to decrease by. Maybe we have to get down to 100 per cent of people returning to passive welfare, complete misery and danger to themselves that goes with that, so we did intervene.


You said, 'Seemingly, without consultation.' Now, if anyone was listening to that, they might think that actually meant without consultation, but, of course, it doesn't. It's one of those slim little words you put in there when you wish to confuse people. There was consultation, and I can tell you people said, 'We want to go back to CDEP.' We decided to, as much as we could at the time, move in that direction, and there has been remarkable success: 92 per cent of eligible jobseekers are now placed in work-life activities; and active participation, instead of seven per cent, has actually increased by 62 per cent. These are actual facts, and should be regarded as such by all those listening.


We put strong protections in place to make sure the penalties are only applied where they're warranted. These protections are the same for all jobseekers across Australia. These protections ensure that jobseekers don't suffer financial hardship. It's okay to say, 'Well, there were miles and miles of people who were breached,' but then you don't go on and say what I'm assuming you know, because you are a part of that process under which submissions were made by government to indicate that 90 per cent of those breaches were waived. It's interesting that, when making a contribution in this place to inform people, you would leave such important facts aside.


You've also talked to a couple of facts I can't let go. You paint a picture of a child having someone else's BasicsCard, getting into a taxi, apparently with not much language but managing to be able to calculate quite comprehensive fraud. I've heard some of these rumours, particularly about the taxi industry—that's probably the only one. In South Australia, there was a significant fraud. I congratulate Kyam Maher and the Premier in South Australia for prosecuting those individuals who owned stores there in that regard.


The other notion is that somehow somebody on aged care is somehow subject to CDEP. Perhaps I should send you another brief, Deputy President, Senator Lines; they're not even a part of this program; they're part of a completely separate program and are not subject to any CDEP activities or, in fact, any of those processes.


You talk about these large potential employers. We are working, wherever we can, to ensure that we're providing leadership in that area. The Commonwealth are, in fact, quite large employers in the community. You mentioned Mr Fred Chaney, a previous Liberal minister. Well, if you'd also followed the processes at Garma, he was quite complimentary—not of mine—of the government's initiatives and the new changes to move to CDEP. In fact, I think he suggested he was going to build an extremely small statue in his garden to commemorate the changes.


We've relied on more than letters in Warburton. In fact, the response we gave you today actually itemised around 15 points on communication. Yes, you've got a letter but, as you said: we send a letter in these cases, but we don't rely on that at all. What we do rely on is people knocking on doors. We rely on using local people, because they have that local knowledge. It is very, very important that we continue to rely on that local knowledge. That's why we're able to, in 90 per cent of circumstances, ensure the breach is avoided.


You also mentioned, Madam Deputy President, that we have substantially used the employment of providers. It's those providers who need to depend on local knowledge. You may not be aware, but it was only 2½ months ago that I stood in Cairns and told all the employment providers in this space that, if they were not an Indigenous organisation by 30 June 2018, they would not have a contract with the Commonwealth. I know that that has had a significant impact in that they are out there now, making sure they have a joint venture with local Indigenous people who have that network and can offer the jobs to local Indigenous people, as it was in the original CDEP days.


Can I complete my remarks by simply saying that we are moving to a new model, and that model is not a government model. It is a model that has been put forward by the communities, and it is going to be a wage-based model. This wage-based model will ensure that we move from poverty in these communities and increase the amount of money that people are actually getting. It's going to move to ensuring that an economy and the synergies of investment by the Commonwealth and states and territories can be acted upon and we can use those synergies for benefit. Again, in closing, Madam Deputy President, I just wanted to correct all of those errors in your contribution.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-08-14,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:25):  I wanted to make a contribution to this debate—I'll keep it short. I am going to talk about some of these matters at a later time in the chamber. Firstly, I want to pick up on the comment that around 90 per cent of these penalties were waived. If that is true, all I can say is that I cannot imagine what impact the community would have felt if none of them were. I also was in Warburton during the winter break, and I saw and talked to people firsthand about the devastation—it's true to say 'devastation'—that has occurred in the community in terms of the penalties that have been applied. What the minister conveniently forgets to add is that it was 90 per cent of the eight-week breaches. I have not had the answer, but I have asked this question: what percentage of the breach does someone serve before they are then waived? They don't waive the no-show, no-pay rule. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds—in fact, thousands—of no-show, no-pay people. So that means that people lose money every day, and that is having a devastating impact on community. I've been in the community and I've talked to people about it, and the impact it is having is showing in the shops—in the stores, I should say. It's not fair to say, as the minister also implied, that there's a great move to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups as providers. I haven't seen a lot of evidence of that to date, and there are certainly still a lot of non-Aboriginal providers.


The minister made comments around moving to wages. I was really pleased when I heard at Garma about moving to community based wages, but there's no meat on the bones of the comments at this stage. The minister made the comment at the time they moved from RJCP. There are some issues around RJCP about which I agree with the minister; there certainly needed to be changes, and the communities were very clear about that. They all thought that they were getting CDP—that they were moving to community based wages, when in fact that clearly was not the case. The government have now said they are in fact going to move to that, and I will be very pleased to see that. We've got to take them at their word that they're going to be doing that, but at the moment we just can't judge that because we just don't know what that's going to look like. So I'm not getting too excited until I do actually see directly what exactly CDP is going to look like.


I have, in fact, seen the piles of letters that are turning up—just the Centrelink letters—in Warburton. I have actually seen with my own eyes the letters that are turning up—not necessarily the breach letters, but the letters with which Centrelink is communicating with income support recipients. That's an example of what is happening in other communities. It's terrifying. It's terrifying how Centrelink are communicating with Aboriginal people who are on income support. I have another example in Warburton. In fact, I suspect that Centrelink, when ringing in from Queensland into Western Australia, don't just forget about Australian Central Standard Time; I actually think they're ringing on Queensland time. I think they forget that they're in fact talking to different time zones, because when I myself was in Warburton—and I'll talk about this a bit later as well—twice while I was there they made appointments to ring people and did not ring at the right time. So who knows? Sometimes it might be Central Australian time. Sometimes it might be Queensland time. Who knows? All I know is that it has direct impacts for those on the ground who, if they don't turn up to their interviews, can get cut off. It's appalling.


Addressing CDP, I think we need to get on the record really clearly—which the Senate inquiry will do—the impacts that it is having in real life on people's lives. A lot of people have said to me: 'What happens now with all the damage that's been caused? Do we just forget that? Do we just forget what damage has been caused in these communities from CDP?' I tell you what: Aboriginal communities won't be forgetting the damage that's been caused by CDP.


I will be pursuing the issues that have been raised in Warburton a bit later, but in the meantime I think we urgently need to find out what is happening with CDP and when we can expect to see the meat on the bones of that particular program.

Senator DODSON
 (Western Australia) (15:31):  I rise also to speak to question on notice No. 477 in support of the statements by you, Madam Deputy President. It seems to me that the minister should not hide his talent under a bushel. He obviously has many things on his plate and he has great intentions, but in this place you actually have to translate that into written form by way of legislation or by way of policy and written documentation. So I would encourage the minister, with his best intentions—and I've had several discussions with him, and I know that he has the best intentions—to translate that into writing so that the rest of us can be privy to what we cannot perceive without him putting things in writing.


The issue of breaching rates and the way the CDP has been rolled out in these communities is a hugely significant one. Let us just look at what's happening in my state of Western Australia, as has been mentioned, particularly in the Ngaanyatjarra lands. The Ngaanyatjarra Council and Aboriginal Corporation represents the interests of around 2,000 Ngaanyatjarra, Pitjantjatjara and Pintupi traditional owners who reside in the 12 member communities of the Ngaanyatjarra Council, the largest of which is Warburton. We've heard about Warburton today.


I've seen the impact of CDP and the way it has been rolled out on my visit to Warburton, and I know when the committee visits Kalgoorlie for the hearings we'll learn more. Warburton, the largest community in the Ngaanyatjarra lands, was established as a Christian community in 1934. Warburton is located 1,000 kilometres from the two nearest regional centres, Alice Springs in the Northern Territory and Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. Warburton has approximately 500 Aboriginal residents and more than 50 agency staff.


In a very clear submission from the Ngaanyatjarra Council to the Senate committee investigating the CDP they've said:


… the work done through the CDEP has been replaced by 'work for the dole'. This is not paid work but serves to establish and maintain entitlements to welfare benefits. The required number of hours has increased from 17 to 25, and the penalties for any breach of conditions (usually absences) can lead to a suspension of benefits lasting nearly two months.


The design of the CDP is explicitly based on an assumption that a regime of incentives and disincentives, if sufficiently punitive and applied over an extended period of time, will eventually teach Ngaanyatjarra people the value of regular work. History suggests there is no basis for this assumption. In practice, CDP requires adults to meet their income support obligations by undertaking work-like activities, often relatively meaningless tasks and under strict compliance arrangements. This is a hopeless vision of life on the Lands.


The chairman of the council, Mr Dereck Harris, wrote in his covering letter:


We now find ourselves in a situation where desert people cannot feed their families. People don't know what they can do to fix this problem. They feel frustrated and helpless. This is bad because people move to places that have a Centrelink office and many get into trouble when they're away from their own country. 


The predecessor to the CDP program, the CDEP, was introduced into Warburton in 1979. It was not perfect, but it was adapted to the needs, interests and concerns of the community, as Ngaanyatjarra Council described it. The main advantage of CDEP was the flexibility it gave to community administrators. It was relatively easy to fill vacancies in the CDEP workforce, respond to emergencies, reprioritise jobs and so on. The strengths generally outweighed the weaknesses. In addition to funding municipal services, CDEP programs focused on housing renovations and maintenance that often occurred under the supervision of a non-Aboriginal tradesman that not only kept housing stock in order but provided practical on-the-job training. Workers were paid to assist in the development of outstations and infrastructure and work on restarting the cattle industry. Thus, five decades after the foundation of the mission, the CDEP program offered, for the first time, the possibility of full employment, albeit in circumstances and on terms that took account of some of the powerful cultural dynamics that characterise Ngaanyatjarra cultural and social relations. 


The contrast of the present situation with the CDP program is stark and worrying. As Ngaanyatjarra Council again puts it: 


Now, the communities in the Lands are forced to fit into a centralised welfare system where the administration of income support is the responsibility of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Human Services and Centrelink. It is dependent on the use of the telephone and internet, unreliable technologies in remote locations, the failures of which place huge pressures on participants and the staff attempting to support them. The CDP and the Ngaanyajtarra Lands are a bad fit.


Not only has CDP destroyed the sense of agency among Ngaanyatjarras that had been fostered over decades, CDP threatens the very viability of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands communities.


These are extremely worrying concerns. The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee is undertaking a hearing into the CDP program. We'll be hearing from community members and providers in Kalgoorlie, Alice Springs, Papunya, Townsville and Palm Island. We'll also be hearing from academics who have studied the ways in which this program has been rolled out across Australia. The submissions we have received are tending to emphasise the points that have been made already about the program by Ngaanyatjarra Council. This goes to the heart of what meaningful work looks like in our remote communities.


While the CDEP scheme of the past was not a perfect program, it provided some sense of meaningful work and contributed to local communities' development. It allowed for community access to surplus funds. This is sadly lacking in the way that the CDP was designed and is now being delivered. I'm hoping that the committee hearing process can point to a new direction for the rollout of work programs in remote communities. I'm hoping that any such reform program can deliver meaningful work, award-wages equivalence and the promotion of work entitlements such as superannuation and annual leave. I hope these are in the minds of the minister. The sooner we get clearly from the minister what he intends to do about this particular space we'll be better off, and those people who rely upon the services will also be better off.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:39):  I rise this afternoon to speak on the failure of the minister to answer this question in a timely manner, noting that he has now answered it. If you look at the minister's answer, you see it falls into the category of 'if you don't ask exactly the right technical question then the department will use every opportunity to deprive you of the actual data that you're looking for,' when you know full well that they know exactly the information you are looking for. So I hope that much of this information does in fact come to light through the Senate inquiry that is now underway, because what's going on is this failed CDP is failing thousands of people in remote communities with devastating consequences on them at a personal level. It seems extraordinary to me that, confirmed at estimates, last year from July to just September, some 54,000 penalty notices were issued. And there have been more than 200,000 breach notices handed out since the new version of CDP began back in July 2015. What's amazing about this is that there are only 35,000 people in this program. So the idea that you could have 200,000 breach notices for a program that has just 35,000 people in it just shows what a heinous, overly bureaucratic, heavy handed program this actually is.


If the government were looking at where they really want to put their energy, where they really want to put their investment, it's not in punitive programs like this. Just think about the effort that it takes to regulate, control and send 200,000 breach notices. If the government were to reinvest that level of energy into supporting activities that are culturally determined by people locally on the ground, that would be meaningful for people to participate in. There are proposals that, frankly, have been about for some time about what these kinds of CDP programs could alternatively look like. We must go down the path of making those changes.


Senator Scullion, like me, was up in Senator Dodson's neighbourhood a couple of weeks ago for the Kimberley  Land Council's Kimberley Ranger Forum. It's such a wonderful program that engages people in caring for country, caring for culture, and with meaningful economic and social outcomes. They are the kinds of programs that we should be investing in. We see communities desperately trying to cobble together resources to expand programs like the ranger program and they're being denied the opportunity to do that. A really good example of this were some wonderful women rangers that I met who are using Green Army funding to become rangers, and they've been monumentally successful. But the problem is that the money is about to run out, and they will be without jobs.


So what we see is the failure of the government to engage in the creation of meaningful opportunities, while they've got this heavy handed punitive approach to CDP. What we can see is that suspending people's welfare does not resolve the shortage of remote jobs. We need to see real engagement with these communities to create jobs. Nor indeed does this punitive approach encourage people to move off country in search of work elsewhere. The warnings in the ANU report that closing CDP would increase welfare dependency and impoverishment were indeed warranted. So the closure of the old CDEP and the creation of the CDP has indeed seen increased welfare dependency and impoverishment as a feature of the program. That was a finding of the ANU.


Indeed, they also said that there's a vastly disproportionate application of income penalties to CDP participants as compared to the equivalent program, such as the jobactive program, in non-remote areas. We have just 35,000 people engaged in this program, yet the statistics that were shown to me from APO NT demonstrated that those 35,000 people were subject to just about double the number of breaches compared to the general population involved in jobactive breaches, when in fact there are tens of thousands more people involved in jobactive programs than in CDP. The implications of this, according to the ANU, are profound. What you can see is that participants are incurring multiple penalties in a very short period of time. Again, I reflect back on the statistics I gave before, which were that we had some 54,000 penalty notices in just three months. This includes high rates of serious penalties that result in people being cut off welfare payments for eight weeks.


We know that job outcomes in remote areas are complicated and limited by a range of factors and that this is slow to resolve, but we can't resolve it through these punitive kinds of programs. We've got to resolve it through buy-in from the local community about the kinds of activities that are meaningful to their social and economic development—just as the ranger program does—and that are determined by people themselves, not through this very punitive process that we have with CDP. What we see with the program as it exists currently is increased harm, including poverty, a reported drop in food sales, increasing debt and a greater risk of incarceration when the suspension of welfare payments limits people's ability to make payments towards things like fines. We know that too many people in remote communities are locked up simply because they have fallen behind on fine repayments or can't pay them.


I've spoken to CDP participants whose confusion, frustration and anger about these issues is absolutely palpable. I'm pleased that there are an increasing number of Indigenous organisations and CDP providers mounting challenges against the scheme. I note that the Human Rights Commission have been asked to investigate whether the program is discriminatory, given that it is mostly affecting Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I also commend the ACTU for examining the scheme on the basis that it doesn't provide the kinds of benefits that standard employment should provide.


Behind the scenes, happily, there's a flurry of activity, as Aboriginal organisations concerned about these detrimental effects get organised, and I wish them well for the Senate inquiry that is underway. But, I have to say, it's no thanks to the work of this government and indeed our own Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Nigel Scullion, who've seen fit to put this heinous, punitive approach to Indigenous participation in employment in place.


Question agreed to.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:49):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications (Senator Fifield) to a question without notice asked by Senator O'Neill today.


It's a long time now since we heard the answer to the question, because we had some very important questions that were raised by you, Senator Lines, and by those who participated in the recent debate. In that ensuing period of time, the minister's absolutely forgettable answer is another example of how detached this government is from the real and pressing problem that is confronting Australians, who are getting sold an absolute dud of an NBN.


The first part of my question was about complaints that were put on record by TPG who said: 'With fibre to the node'—which sadly has been now inflicted on 4.5 million Australians and delivered the inferior technology decided for them by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull—'we're not allowed to lodge a fault with the NBN, unless the line performs at less than 12 megabits per second'. In response to that concern, which is of such significance to Australians right across this country, we got the equivalent of buffering from Minister Fifield—the wait for a proper answer while it just goes around and around in a circle. We keep hearing the same thing over and over again. That's the experience that people are having across the country. It's not just that circle of watching the buffering going on; it's the dance where you get sent from NBN to the retail service provider. Now let's add the fact that it could be your modem, so you get sent to the shop to spend a few hundred dollars on a modem that you don't need, because the problem isn't your modem. The problem is that your government is inflicting this disaster on you, and your experience as a business is absolutely devastatingly bad. 


We've heard evidence in the last several weeks, in the north of Tasmania and also on the Central Coast, where I come from, which reveals how taxing this experience is. The minister's says in his most reasonable voice: 'Look, if you're having a problem, just talk to your retail service provider. They'll fix it up. Or, if that isn't good, talk to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. In all sincerity, I'm sure you'll have your problem fixed.' The problem isn't getting fixed. The minister is not on the job. He doesn't give a damn. He doesn't care about the fact that we're getting evidence like this from Belinda Mabbott, who runs a fantastic small landscape supply business on the Central Coast, who says: 'Over 12 months nearly to the day, we managed to rack up 17 case managers; at least eight technicians' appointments—only two came into our yard—a full folder of emails with thickness of two centimetres; countless phone calls and messages to my mobile; paperwork; submissions to the ombudsman; and finally a call to our local member, Emma McBride, who subsequently got us the assistance that we needed.' 


That's what's happening across this country. The Liberal members are like the minister; denying the problem, ignoring the reality, cruelling people's businesses and cruelling people's access to essential services. There's a wonderful gentleman by the name of Mr Barry Egan, who gave me an absolute wad of paperwork in which he had documented his experience. He's really concerned that older people, who haven't got as much energy and capacity as he has, are actually suffering in silence. They are being rejected by the TIO, rejected by their retail service provider. They are spending money on modems that don't work and, all the while, this minister ignores the reality. 


We heard evidence in Tasmania—and Senator Urquhart is whipping here for us on the opposition benches. She was absolutely on a unity ticket with the CEO of the copper mine in north-west Tasmania. A copper mine—remember, we're getting our telecoms down the copper, the technology from last century. The CEO, Mr Peter Walker, said and agreed with Senator Urquhart, that copper won't cut it. Everyone knows it. Even the man who is an advocate for the copper mine knows it. He knows he has to have fibre to do the job that he needs to do to get the efficiencies in and create jobs for people in north-west Tasmania. 


We heard from Virginia Bower, a podiatrist from the St Johns Foot Clinic. This is how she described her experience of trying to get the NBN on, and the cuts to services that she's experienced in her business: 'Effectively, we were electronically handcuffed.' I wish I had a dollar for every time I've heard: 'Oh my God. I just wish I had my ADSL back.' 


The NBN has been a wasteful rollout of $49 billion by people who should have known better. Instead of listening to the experts, they delivered and inflicted Malcolm Turnbull's mess on us. Thank you.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:54):  In Senator O'Neill's interesting contribution, there was one fairly major omission—one major fact in this debate that went unremarked upon—that I think is worth repeating and placing on the record as a matter of history. 


How did we get to where we are today with the NBN? We didn't get here because the coalition proposed and suggested that it was a good idea for the government to build a national network of communications. We didn't get here because we commenced during our time in government a multibillion-dollar scheme to push aside the private sector and institute a government intervention on a national scale. We didn't get here even because the private sector embarked on this and were not successful. We got to where we are today because a government which she was part of, the Rudd government, decided that it knew best. The Rudd government knew best. The Rudd government would be able to build a national broadband network, it would be able to build it better than the private sector and it would be able to build it with no costs, no consequences, no faults and no issues.


Well, look what's happened. Look what's happened, first on their watch, and then look at the effort that we've gone to to fix up the mess that they left us. On their watch, by 2013 Labor fell short of 83 per cent of their rollout targets—83 per cent! It was a dismal failure on their watch. What has this government had to do? This government has had to make the tough decisions necessary to deliver this program, to deliver it on time, to deliver it on budget and to deliver it in a meaningful way for the Australian people.


It was the Labor Party which was dismally failing to achieve these targets when they were in office. By contrast, in just a few short years upon coming to government and by making some tough decisions about the best way to roll out this program, the Turnbull government has delivered. The Turnbull government has ensured that the NBN is in fact being rolled out, that it is in fact being connected to people's homes in a way that it never would have been under the previous government. We could have had no guarantees that it would have been done under the previous Prime Minister.


We know that, because when it was on their watch, when it was under their stewardship, they failed time and time again. They met none of their financial targets and they met none of their rollout targets. It was a failure that had to be fixed. That's the contrast. This government, upon taking over this program, took it over with a pretty dismal statistic in place: 51,000 fixed and wireless premises had been rolled out by the previous government—51,000! By contrast, each week under this government 32,000 connections are rolled out for a total of 5.8 million addresses that are today NBN ready and 2.6 million customers that are connected.


Senator O'Neill described it as being 'inflicted' upon these people. I doubt that's how they feel about the NBN service that they are now able to access, and are able to access in a more affordable way than they would have been able to under the previous government. They have it all, when there was no promise that it would ever actually get there under the previous government and under their method of delivery. More than 11,000 premises have been made ready for service on the NBN every working day in the past year. We achieve in a week what the Rudd government was not able to achieve in years under their program.


The Turnbull government takes very seriously the complaints and concerns that some consumers have raised about their transition to the NBN, and we have a number of initiatives in place to respond to those concerns. In April, the government announced funding for the ACCC to conduct a broadband performance monitoring and reporting program. The ACCC is currently seeking 4,000 volunteer customers of retail service providers across the country to participate in the monitoring program. The BPMR program will enable consumers to compare speeds delivered in peak periods by independent reporting of broadband speeds. Performance information is a key factor for consumers when purchasing their plans from their retailer.


As the minister outlined in his answer to the senator's questions in question time, there are a number of factors that can lead to slower-than-expected performance, and many of those factors are of course in the hands of retail service providers, not the NBN. In addition to the ACCC program that I mentioned, the Turnbull government is empowering ACMA to conduct research and collect data on the NBN customer experience. ACMA is commissioning this research to obtain information directly from customers about their experience before, during and also after migration to the NBN. The research will span the range of technologies that are used to connect households and businesses to the network. ACMA will be using its formal powers under the Telecommunications Act to collect information from businesses across the NBN supply chain.


This is a government which is fixing Labor's mess on the NBN. This is a government which is delivering the NBN in a way they never could.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:59):  Once again, Senator Paterson is just putting government spin on something that is completely untrue. The minister's answer has revealed just another chapter in the saga of the delays, the cost blowouts and the broken promises in the rollout of Malcolm Turnbull's second-rate copper NBN.


When Mr Turnbull changed the method of delivery for fixed line premises, he called it the 'multitechnology mix'. My constituents in Tasmania are calling it 'Malcolm Turnbull's mess'. They're blatantly calling it that. They have no regard for what the government has done to what the Labor Party initially started as a great process. We all remember, before the 2013 election, when 'Mr Broadband' himself stood before the then Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, hoping to be the leader once again—we know that—and promised that the NBN would be delivered by the end of 2016. Well, can I tell you he missed that target by 7 million homes. 


Mr Turnbull also promised that the NBN would cost $29.5 billion. That cost has now blown out to $49 billion. And, because private investors don't want to go anywhere near Mr Turnbull's second-rate copper network, the government has had to bail out the project with a $19.5 billion loan. In 2013, Mr Turnbull promised NBN users of his second-rate copper network that they could upgrade to full fibre for $2,250. Well, the average cost to date is $15,800, and some individuals have been quoted as much as $149,000. It's no wonder that NBN customers on the second-rate copper network want to upgrade to full fibre, because the copper network is a mess. A recent Choice survey found that NBN users are experiencing slow speeds and dropouts 76 per cent of the time. 


The NBN Co's chief, Bill Morrow, might like to blame customers or the retail service provider—in fact, anyone but his own company—but Australians aren't buying it. They know that under the instructions of Mr Turnbull, Senator Cormann and Senator Fifield, that NBN Co are rolling out an outdated network using last century's technology. And we know on this side that the overwhelming majority of complaints about service dropouts and slow speeds relate to the second-rate, copper based NBN. Figures from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman show that an NBN user is five times more likely to complain than users of other telecommunications services. And seven out of 10 of the postcodes that the TIO receives complaints from are served by fibre to the node. 


I know personally about these complaints, as do my Tasmanian colleagues in the House—Julie Collins, the member for Franklin, and Brian Mitchell, the member for Lyons—because, along with Michelle Rowlands, our shadow communications minister, we held a public meeting. We had over 100 southern Tasmanian residents in a room that was packed. We held this meeting a few weeks ago. We heard those residents talk about the delays, the dropouts, the multivisits by technicians and being sent two or three modems. Almost all of these related to Mr Turnbull's outdated copper network. 


And, just while we're talking about Tasmania, I still have to remind people—I've talked about it a few times—that there's a little area about 17 minutes south of Hobart called Howden, with 600-odd households. They were completely left off the map continually until I started asking questions in estimates about why they kept being left off the map. They couldn't get anything. They are 17 minutes from a capital city and they couldn't get access to anything. As I've said before in this place, a full fibre rollout for fixed-line connections is inevitable, because it's the technology that Australians not only need but they're actually demanding for today. 


Fibre to the premises is the technology we need if we are to compete in the global digital economy. It's the technology, let me remind people, that is being rolled out by competing nations overseas, including in the UK, where British Telecom is considering building a full fibre network. That's right. That is the same British Telecom that Mr Turnbull pointed to as an example of the success of his flawed copper based approach. They're now considering plans to deliver— (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-08-14,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:04):  I'd like to contribute to this debate. It's quite amazing: where's Senator Conroy? Senator Conroy ran in the 2 July election last year. He was elected for six years, I believe, but he's done a runner; we can't find him. Let's go back to Senator Conroy. What did he do? He hopped into the plane with then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and pulled out an envelope with the original plan of the Labor NBN. What a way to plan to spend billions and billions of dollars—riding around with an envelope in a VIP jet with the then Prime Minister, Mr Rudd. So, away went the Conroy plan for the NBN! 


I remember when they came into Armidale. I was there about to catch a plane from Sydney to Canberra—I believe Senator Conroy was actually on the plane back with me—when the VIP jet came. There was a big stage, a chart and an electronic board. They were there, with the cameras, to pull the switch to turn on the NBN in Armidale. There it was: the flashy political show put on by the then Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, and former senator Stephen Conroy. They pulled the switch down and said, 'It's on. Now Armidale has the NBN.' There was only one problem: there was nothing hooked to the back of the switch. There were no wires there. It was a big show piece. How proud they were about the NBN going into Armidale! But then the problems started. That's what happened: we inherited a mess from Senator Conroy and former Prime Minister Rudd's back-of-the-envelope planning of the NBN


I would remind the Senate that the NBN has met its milestones over the last three financial years, as we've tried to clean this mess up. It remains on track and on budget, with more than half of all households now being able to access an NBN service. Let's look back a bit. Let's not forget that Labor's NBN fell 83 per cent short of its 2013 rollout targets. That means just 17 per cent of the targets were met. That's not a very good record. So much for serving the interests of broadband consumers! Only 51,000 fixed and wireless premises were ever connected to the NBN under Labor, whereas under the coalition government the rollout has now reached a new peak of more than 32,000 connections in a single week.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  There are now 32,000 connections in a single week, and you had 51,000 over how many years? It's a big difference. The peak funding target of $49 billion announced almost two years ago has stayed the same, as has the completion date of 2020. Sure, it's taking longer to roll out the NBN. It's a big country.


I'm very pleased to see so many of the wireless NBN towers being constructed in rural and regional areas. I was talking to my wife, who runs a small newspaper, just recently. She told me that previously, when another of the few independent newspapers left in northern New South Wales had finished putting their paper together and sent it off to the printers, it would take 1½ hours to email a 12-page newspaper to the printer. Now, with the NBN, it takes them 45 seconds. That's a big difference—1½ hours to 45 seconds. That's the improvement. 


Sure there are some gremlins. I'm aware of that. I've had people ring me and say: 'We've established a new business. We've notified Telstra and other carriers, who'll be hooking us up, and we'll be starting the business next week.' They've given a month's notice to Telstra, but, when they open their business, there's no phone and no NBN. We've got a bit of a blame game going on. Some of the telcos are blaming NBN Co, while NBN Co are saying: 'It's not our fault. We've hooked it up. The telcos are not doing their job.' I hope that blame game stops, and we get it rolled out and completed as soon as possible. But it is a big country, and I commend Minister Fifield for the work he's done with the NBN after inheriting a mess from Senator Conroy. I wonder why he left? Never mind. He packed up and did the bolt. 


NBN Co has hit every rollout target in every quarter for more than three years, and the company is now transitioning from building the network to also being an operator of critical national infrastructure that is serving millions of homes and businesses across the nation. Over the past year the number of premises able to access the NBN has doubled, so it's getting there. It's rolling the NBN out quicker than it ever did under Labor, and I think it's very cheeky for Labor, through Senator O'Neill, to even raise this topic, given the mess they made of this organisation.

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (16:09):  I think the problem for those opposite that they fail to grasp here is that they've now been in power for four years. Yes, more people are connecting to the NBN. And that is effectively the problem: more people are connecting and realising what a dud this NBN is. And there are many customers out there disappointed with the lacklustre response they get from the NBN. Today, I think what we saw from Senator Fifield was a lacklustre response to our question that was put to him. Every day, you see another disappointed NBN customer, whether it be through the work that the NBN committee has been doing or whether through the series of NBN crisis forums that have been held throughout Australia over recent months. I know that there was one, as Senator Bilyk mentioned, in Tasmania. I hosted one in the northern suburbs of Mackay. The member for Oxley hosted one as well. I know that they've also been happening in South Australia. I commend the work that Michelle Rowland, as the shadow minister, and Stephen Jones, as the shadow minister for regional communications, have been putting in, listening to the concerns of people particularly in regional Queensland.


There is a consistent message coming through from people: they're disappointed with the NBN. It's causing frustrations, it's costing jobs and it's denying Australians opportunities, particularly for those in regional Queensland. For many years, regional Queenslanders and regional Australians looked upon the NBN as a great opportunity. They thought that it would provide economic opportunity. They thought that it would provide educational opportunity. And they thought it would provide health opportunities, particularly for those in regional and remote areas. But the reality is hitting home, and the people of regional areas, in particular, are very disappointed.


As I mentioned, every day there is another media report about how inferior this product is and the frustrations that it is causing. I mentioned the NBN crisis forums that have been held across Australia in recent months. And there was a consistency of views that came through. One was around NBN technicians not turning up for appointments when they were scheduled, or failure to match advertised speed once they had been connected. More than half Australians have had disconnections or dropouts and speed slowdowns in the last six months. The service is notoriously unreliable. And I think those opposite are believing the constant spin from the NBN Co themselves and their ever-growing number of PR officers to believe that this is actually functioning effectively for them. But the problem is: no-one is willing to take ownership of the problem. Even though they've been in government for four years, they're continuing to blame Labor. But the punters are working them out. They're connecting, they're the ones who are frustrated and they're the ones who will hold this government to account.


As I mentioned, I was in my duty electorate of Dawson a couple of weeks ago and we held an NBN crisis forum. It was interesting that the member for Dawson, George Christensen, ordered a couple of NBN staff to go along to hear the complaints firsthand. I think it shows you how concerned they are about the impact this is having on the community. We heard a number of reports from businesspeople in the community about the negative impact that the NBN is having. This was consistent. We heard from Lyn, who had to extend her eight-hour work day to 16 hours so that she could operate at speed outside of normal working hours. We heard from Mark, a small business owner. His business is redoing floorboards. You could imagine that in the aftermath of Cyclone Debbie it was a really important business. The phone number he got given six months ago was still not connected. Although he was advertising his services, when you actually rang to repair your floor after the damage of Cyclone Debbie you couldn't actually get through. So this was costing jobs and economic opportunity but also the ability of people to rebuild in those cyclone-affected communities.


We also heard from a family who said that their daughter, to use the internet, had to go to the local Macca's to use the wi-fi to do her homework because it was more reliable than the service offered from the NBN. I heard numerous stories throughout regional Queensland. When I was at Annandale State School I heard about the failure to connect with the School of Distance Education to do coding training. There was a series of problems in regional Queensland that were identified with the NBN that is being delivered by this government. They have had a lame duck as minister—the previous minister responsible, who is the current PM. They've seen the same under Minister Fifield as well. (Time expired)

Leave granted.




Senator CORMANN:
  I thank the chamber. This is in response to a question from Senator Rice earlier today, in relation to the marriage law survey. I was asked a question in relation to, among other things, the closure of the electoral rolls, and I indicated to the chamber that the electoral rolls, for the purposes of the marriage law survey, would close at 6 pm on 24 August. In fact, the rolls will close at midnight on 24 August, local time, and I thought it was important to correct the record at the earliest opportunity. The initial advice was that it would be 6 pm, but the decision was subsequently made to extend that to midnight.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-08-14,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:15):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Minister Cormann) to questions without notice asked by Senator Rice today relating to marriage.


I seek to take note of the answer from Minister Cormann to my question about the marriage equality postal plebiscite. The totally unsatisfactory answers that we got from the minister are really what we've come to expect from a government that is willing to use lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer people as pawns in the sick game that they are playing. This is from a government that is being led by a Prime Minister who tells us that he supports marriage equality but is clearly just a husk of Tony Abbott. It is just so that he can show the right-wing troglodytes in his party that he is conservative enough.


Minister Cormann claimed, in response to my question about disenfranchising young people, that they are giving every Australian the opportunity to have their say on marriage equality. It is every Australian, they claim—except, however, for the more than 50,000 18-year-olds who won't be able to vote. These are the people who will turn 18 between 24 August and 7 November. This is unlike other elections, where you can set the roll so that 16- and 17-year-olds can pre-register, so that—right up until the day of the election; right up until the very last minute of them turning 18—they can vote. In this postal plebiscite, 2½ months will go by where people will turn 18 and they won't be able to vote—let alone the 16- and 17-year-olds that the Greens think should be able to vote in such a postal plebiscite or in any vote about marriage equality, because, if 16- and 17-year-olds are old enough to get married, as they are, surely they are old enough to vote. So we in the Greens are going to continue to pursue this. We say that 16- and 17-year-olds, young Australians who are old enough to get married, should be old enough to vote in any public vote about marriage equality.


We know that having this shonky postal plebiscite is going to disenfranchise young people in general. Young people are much less likely to be on the electoral roll. Young people are more likely to have changed address. And yet we know that it's young people in our society who are most passionate overall about marriage equality, because they know that love is love. They've grown up, as my children have, to know that people are same-sex-attracted and to know that people are gender diverse, and they just accept people for who they are. And they are the people that can't understand why we are taking so long and why we can't just move to have a free vote in this parliament and achieve marriage equality, so that any two people, regardless of their sexuality or their gender identity, are able to marry.


If this shonky postal plebiscite ends up going ahead, if the High Court challenge against it isn't successful, we, as Greens, are going to be campaigning strongly, just as we are advocating strongly in this parliament for us to be voting yes, so that people can marry the person they love. If this plebiscite goes ahead, we will be campaigning very strongly for people to be choosing love and voting yes.


We'd already begun this campaigning over the weekend. And we know that the number of people—particularly young people again—who have enrolled to vote in the last four days has been amazing. They would prefer the parliament to just get on and do its job, but, if it comes to a postal vote, they want to be on the roll. The problem, though, as I say, with this postal plebiscite and the reason why it would be much better for this parliament just to do its job is the reason that I'm in the High Court, that we have a High Court challenge against this postal plebiscite, and it's all the reasons that I outlined in my question to Minister Cormann today. This postal plebiscite is disenfranchising of young people, as we've already discussed. And then, in terms of privacy, it's either going to be fatally subject to fraud or fatally undermining our privacy. You can't have it both ways. These are the problems with having a postal vote on this issue, and it has such potential to cause harm and division.



But we know that in the end love is going to win. We know that in the end we are going to have a vote in this parliament that's going to legislate for marriage equality. It may be a vote in this parliament immediately after the High Court challenge knocks off this plebiscite and throws it in the bin, or it may be that we've got to go through this tortuous course of a postal vote, but in the end there will be a vote in this parliament and love will win. People will choose love and love will win. (Time expired)

Senator GALLAGHER:
  I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



Today, Labor introduces the Taxation Administration Amendment (Corporate Tax Entity Information) Bill 2017. This Private Senators' Bill amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953. 


Section 3C of the Act details the type of income and tax information the Commissioner of Taxation is required to make publicly available annually for corporate entities.


This Bill amends Section 3C(1) to align the threshold for private corporate entities with that of public corporate entities by lowering the threshold from $200 million to $100 million.


This restores the public reporting of corporate tax entity to its original intent as introduced by the former Labor Government in 2013 in the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013.


This Bill addresses a prominent deficiency in the tax transparency regime that arose after amendments were made to the Act in 2015, and brings approximately 600 large companies into the tax transparency regime.


Tax Transparency Information


In 2013, the Australian Government introduced and the Parliament passed the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 2) Bill 2013. Among the amendments, the Bill introduced Section 3C Reporting of information for corporate tax entities with reported total income of $100 million or more.


The measure was a significant advance in tax transparency that accompanied and complemented other significant reforms to close tax loopholes used by large companies.


Since then, two years of tax data on corporate tax entities has been publicly released, 2013-14 and 2014-15. It has facilitated constructive discussion about corporate taxation in Australia. Civil society and advocacy groups argue that tax transparency data is a vital tool for oversight, scrutiny, and policy debate.


Tax transparency improves behaviour. Large private companies know that they will be held to account for the amount of tax they pay and that will change behaviour.


As originally passed, Section 3C was a tax transparency measure that aligned the thresholds for public reporting of public and private corporate entities' basic tax and income information at $100 million.


Section 3C was amended in October 2015 to completely remove private companies from public reporting by the new government in the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Act 2015. 


My colleague in the House of Representatives, the Shadow Assistant Treasurer, said at the time that the Coalition did so after ""an astro-turf campaign, following really, what might have just have been an idea dreamed up after the second cherry in the Melbourne Club"". 


The Senate had begun the task of restoring the previous tax transparency laws. 


However, in December 2015, section 3C was amended again to include private companies (as part of the debate Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015), however the threshold for reporting was set at $200 million.


No genuine policy rationale was given for either the removal of the public reporting requirement for public companies, nor the restoration of the requirement with a significantly higher threshold. 


The $200 million threshold results in approximately 600 large private companies (about two-thirds of those affected by the original measure) not having high-level tax information scrutinised, unlike comparably sized public companies.


As noted in a Senate Economics Legislation Committee report Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (Better Targeting the Income Tax Transparency Laws) Bill 2015[provisions], the Australian Taxation Office ""gave evidence during this inquiry that one in five private companies earning over $100 million do not pay any tax"".


How did we get here? During the Senate debate about the Government's Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015, the Liberals and the Greens engaged in a backroom deal to let Australia's large private companies continue to avoid tax transparency.


The Coalition found a new partner in Senator Di Natalie's Australian Greens. The Labor Party stood firm, and the Labor Party held to its position to protect tax transparency. We took the pledge to restore the original threshold to the 2016 election. If the Government will not fix this, we will aim to from Opposition.


That is an important point. The Turnbull Government is shielding some of Australia's largest companies from scrutiny at the same time as handing banks and multinationals a $65 billion tax cut.


The Government is also tearing itself apart over an internal culture war. Labor is developing serious policy. Where we can, we will try and implement from Opposition, just as we have sought to do with the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Small Business Access to Justice) Bill 2017.


In a context where aggressive tax minimisation by large companies and high net worth individuals are under intense public scrutiny, this measure will restore the original public reporting threshold for large private companies.


Detail in the Bill


Schedule 1 of this Bill amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 ('the Act'). Section 3C details the type of income and tax information the Commissioner of Taxation is required to make publicly available annually for corporate entities.


This Bill amends section 3C(1) to align the threshold for private corporate entities with that of public corporate entities by lowering the threshold from $200 million to $100 million.


This Bill would repeal the current wording of subsection 3C(1), and substitute it with language that ensures corporate tax entities (including private companies) with total income equal to or exceeding $100 million are subject to the public reporting requirements of section 3C.


The amendment made in Schedule 1 would apply to the 2017-18 income year onwards.


Labor is the party of tax transparency


This policy complements the suite of tax transparency measures Labor has announced and intends to implement should we form Government.


Labor's comprehensive measures will massively increase transparency on the use of tax havens by corporations and high net-worth individuals and add more civil society voices to official tax deliberations.


Tax havens threaten Australia's tax base. When tax revenue gets lost to tax havens, Australians ultimately have to pay higher taxes or suffer cuts to vital services. For example, the Cayman Islands have been criticised by the OECD and by tax commissioner Chris Jordan for their excessive secrecy. They have more companies than people. A single building in the Caymans – Ugland House – is home to over 18,000 companies.


As Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan recently said in a speech to the Tax Institute: 'Many of these [tax] matters involve deliberate tax evasion, often using overseas tax havens or complex corporate structures to avoid detection and recovery.'


The shockwaves from the Panama Papers and similar scandals involving corporations and high net-worth individuals aggressively minimising their tax are being felt around the world. Other governments have been jolted into action on transparency measures since the public outcry over the Panama Papers. 


The Turnbull Government has done virtually nothing. With rising inequality and rising government debt, the time for acting on tax havens and tax transparency has come.


Labor proposes to introduce a series transparency measures that I will briefly outline.


Labor will introduce public reporting of country-by-country reports. High-level tax information about where and how much tax was paid by large corporations (over $1 billion in global revenue) will be released publicly.


Labor will introduce whistle-blower protection and incentive/rewards; to provide protection for whistleblowers who report on entities evading tax to the Australian Taxation Office. Individuals who highlight tax evasion would collect a share of the penalty collected.


Labor will introduce mandatory reporting of 'material tax risk' (tax haven exposure) to shareholders. Companies would be required to disclose to shareholders as a 'Material Tax Risk' if the company is doing business in an international material tax risk jurisdiction (i.e. a known or suspected tax haven). There is no current legal requirement to do so currently.


Labor will introduce public reporting of AUSTRAC data; that is, we would require AUSTRAC to publicly release International Funds Transfer Instructions (IFTI) data for every calendar year (or, if more practical, financial year).


Labor will introduce disclosure of 'material tax risk' for government tenders. We would amend Government procurement process requirements such that the Australian Government tender process requires all companies to state their country of domicile for tax purposes.


Labor will develop guidelines for tax haven investment by superannuation funds – task the ATO (in collaboration with ASIC, and APRA re: self-managed super funds) to create/review guidelines for responsible investment for superannuation funds.


Labor will introduce a publicly accessible registry of the beneficial ownership of Australian legal entities. We would fully implement the G20 principles Australia signed in 2014 and ensure transparency over how ultimately owns a company, rather than just who is listed on company paper-work.


Labor will introduce an ATO disclosure of settlements and reporting of aggressive tax minimisation; high-level reporting in the ATO's annual report on how many settlements were achieved per financial year and associated data.


This Bill, and the policies I've just mentioned, all build on Labor's proud policy legacy.


This Bill is the first step to restoring tax transparency to where the previous Labor Government left it. It is the foundation upon which we build our further measures.


Conclusion


I encourage all those who consider themselves friends of transparency to support this Bill and help us deliver one of the vital tools for public discussion about the integrity of our tax system.

They also experience lumpy income. There is no rationale for this referral, which will only add strain to the existing workloads of Senate committees and the committee secretariats in particular.

Under this lacklustre Liberal government, more and more people are finding it harder to put dinner on the table each night and it's becoming impossible for people to find secure work. People are getting sicker because they're skipping seeing the doctor because they just can't afford it. People are struggling to access quality education from primary school through to higher education. Households are being absolutely crippled by the rising living costs in this country, and home the ownership rate is now at a six-decade low.


I was shocked and appalled by comments from those opposite, who came out banging their drums saying that inequality had actually gotten better under this government. What a joke! That just shows how out of touch they really are. The facts have been laid bare: inequality is on the rise; Australians are struggling on all fronts. Something has to stop. This government needs to stop this. We need to see this reversed. What the Liberals are doing isn't working. Instead of denying the hardship that everyday people are facing, the least that those opposite could do was to pretend they had a plan to deal with it. But this government is bereft of any vision or any plan to reverse the inequality in this country. At a time where wages have flatlined and bills are going through the roof, the government's only plan is to cut payments to pensioners and support cuts to wages while giving tax cuts to millionaires and the biggest businesses. Why should the top end pay less and the rest of Australia pay more? When will the Turnbull government see sense and for once back the battlers over the billionaires? An economy that only benefits the Prime Minister's mates isn't just unfair, it's likely to be unstable, too. If those opposite spent half the time developing a vision and policies to benefit every Australian that they do talking about Labor and making things up, then Australia would be a better place to live.


Mr Malcolm Turnbull is under enormous leadership pressure. He needs to tell us he's a strong leader, like he did last week. If you really are a strong leader, Mr Turnbull, you shouldn't need to tell us, but it's probably more about telling yourself. If the Prime Minister were really that strong, he would have asked his Deputy Prime Minister to step aside until the High Court makes its ruling. Mr Turnbull, if you were as strong as you are telling us you are, you would be fighting as hard for all Australians to have secure jobs as you are fighting to save Mr Barnaby Joyce's job and your own. Instead of wasting your breath telling us what a strong leader you are, perhaps you could get to work and tell us what you're going to do to create a stronger and a fairer Australia.


The people who elected the Prime Minister to represent them and to have a vision, a plan and policies going forward are in fact looking to Mr Bill Shorten, the leader of the Labor Party, because we're the party of ideas, we're the party of policies and we're the party of vision and we're about ensuring that there is a change in the inequality in this country. But we have a Prime Minister whose only mantra is to give the top end of town a tax cut, to support big business, while at the same time cutting supplements to pensioners. We have an underemployment problem in this country that this government is failing to address.


This is a Prime Minister who is so out of touch, who is so arrogant and who is a leader of a dysfunctional and chaotic government, and that's going to be what is going to be written about this Prime Minister in the pages of history, because he lacks leadership. (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:37):  I'm not sure that I'm in the right debate. I read that the debate is about secure jobs and fairer wages, tackling rising power prices and investing in education and health, and that's a great description of the Turnbull Liberal-National government. It is a government which is focused on secure jobs and fairer wages, that tackles power prices, that invests in education and health and that is addressing housing affordability. So I wonder if I'm in the right debate. I also just heard the previous speaker, Senator Polley, who seemed to spend all of her time talking about Mr Turnbull. I just ask Senator Polley whether she might have a look at the latest opinion polls. Mr Turnbull's rating continues to rise whereas that of her leader, Mr Shorten, continues to fall. When we find that Mr Shorten, who, when head of the AWU, used $100,000 of AWU members' money to give to the Labor Party, you can understand why Mr Shorten's polls continue to fall. I think it won't be too long before Mr Albanese and—I see Senator Cameron here—the Sydney cohort of the ALP will be looking, sharpening the knives to get rid of Mr Shorten and put in Mr Albanese. I hope they don't because—not that I have a great regard for any leader of the ALP—I do think that Mr Albanese would be a far better leader for the ALP and would perhaps provide better competition for Mr Turnbull at the next election. As I say, the opinion polls show Mr Turnbull to be so far ahead as a leader that it's not even a comparison at the present time.


So what Senator Polley was doing, talking about Mr Turnbull and lack of leadership, I can't quite understand. She really should, if I might say through you, Mr Acting Deputy President Ketter, have a look at Mr Shorten, the guy, as I said, who used $100,000 of members' money to donate to a political party. He's also the guy that used to knock around with the captains of Australian industry, the very wealthy ones, and got their private plane to slip down to Tasmania at the time of what was to be a tragedy. He had left, he saw that it wasn't a tragedy and that there was good news there. He hired a magnate's plane—not hired it; got it for free—and slipped down in time for the early morning television. No wonder Mr Shorten's polls are going down. I think the Australian public are waking up very, very quickly to Mr Shorten, and well they should.


We know Mr Shorten gave that money out as a union leader. That's another reason why membership of the unions in the private sector has fallen to 10 per cent of the total private sector workforce. That means 90 per cent of workers in the private sector choose not to join a union. And yet it's the union that controls the Labor Party and directs what could be the alternative government of Australia. But I digress, because Senator Polley spent most of her speech talking about Mr Shorten and Mr Turnbull.


Can I just say that in the coalition ranks we are very, very concerned for jobs. I'm pleased to say—and credit where credit is due—that half of the Labor Party in Queensland—the faction led by the Premier, Ms Palaszczuk—understands the importance of coalmining in the Galilee Basin and of the jobs that will be created. There were $38 billion in royalties and taxes paid between 2007 and 2013-14, and a recent study showed that the Queensland coal industry contributed $23.7 billion in 2015-16 to the Queensland economy and supported 180,000 jobs. And yet the great workers' party, the union party, continues to denigrate the Adani proposal.


Just last Friday at the Senate committee hearing, we had Labor Party politicians raising all of the reasons why that coalmine and that new infrastructure should not go ahead. And I certainly hope that the North Australian Infrastructure Facility will help jobs in Central and North Queensland by providing some money for common user infrastructure. Not for coalmines—I understand those are fully funded by the particular proponents, whoever they might be. But NAIF, set up by the Turnbull government, is there for common user infrastructure, to provide a bit of assistance from the Commonwealth taxpayer as a loan—I emphasise that—to be repaid where there is a gap in the funding.


And we do that supported by the Palaszczuk section of the Labor Party in Queensland by helping out with Adani. For as much as Palaszczuk and the total 100 per cent of the Liberal National Party support these job creation activities, there are people within the Trad section of the Queensland Labor Party and many down here that we hear of at Senate committee hearings and elsewhere who want to do everything possible to undermine that job creation project for Central and North Queensland and that money-making project for the Queensland government and the Queensland economy generally.


This motion by Senator Wong talks about jobs and fairer wages. Fairer wages and all wages, including penalty rates in this country, are by legislation dealt with not by the parliament, not by the government but by the independent Fair Work Commission set up by Bill Shorten and the Labor Party. Its members comprise many, many union heads of times gone by. We believe in fairer wages and fairer conditions, and that's why we let the independent umpire, set up by Labor, deal with that job.


The Turnbull government is the only federal government in the political history of Australia that's taken any steps to deal with rising power prices. Rising power prices are matters for state governments. In Queensland, of course, the state government gouges the profits and puts up the prices, so they can get more money, because they own the generators, and the profits they make go in to prop up a pretty awful state budget. But the federal government—they are state government issues—is the first one in history to take a national approach to reducing power prices, and we're doing it. Senator Carr whinges at question time, but when he was the minister for industry for six years, what happened? Absolutely nothing—not a thing. It takes a coalition government to deal with that. 


Time prevents me from talking about the massive new investment in education. And just today I've got some updated figures of how much more every school in the state of Queensland will get as a result of the Turnbull government's recently announced education initiative. This is more money for every school. I've written to every school. They've acknowledged how grateful they are for the additional funding coming through as a result of this government's activities. So I thank Senator Wong for raising this for discussion today. I'm surprised it was her that raised it, not us, because it's all about what the Turnbull government is doing.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-08-14,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:46):  In the very limited time available, I want to speak to this motion. Of course, we need a stronger and fairer Australia. It needs to be centred on secure jobs, but we need to have those jobs in the first place—well-paying jobs. There is great news coming out of South Australia today that the South Australian government has secured an arrangement with SolarReserve to build the $650 million solar thermal power plant at Port Augusta—something I negotiated with the federal government, and in particular Senator Cormann, to ensure the $110 million concession equity loan was in place for that, and that is a key pillar. I acknowledge Sam Johnson, the mayor of Port Augusta, who's in Canberra today, where he acknowledged the importance of that concessional loan to make sure the project can get off the ground—to underpin it. That's 4,000 jobs in regional South Australia, direct and indirect, that will come about as a result of this groundbreaking project. 


The key to having jobs is to make sure that energy prices come down—whether it's in gas or electricity overall. We are facing an existential crisis in this country because gas prices are simply too high. Unless we deal with those gas prices, unless we have policies to tackle it head on, you can expect to see tens of thousands of jobs leave our shores in the coming months and years, and that's something we can't afford as a nation. Some of the measures by the federal government seem to be having a downward pressure on gas prices—things I negotiated with my colleagues in making the gas market more transparent in the first place. 


But we need to go further. We need to tackle the decline in manufacturing. Six per cent of Australia's economy or GDP is based on manufacturing, compared to 12 per cent a decade ago. That is a shocking figure. I know that Senator Carr and others who have been champions of manufacturing in this country would be very alarmed at that. Contrast that with Germany, where 22 per cent of their GDP is based on manufacturing. Why? Because governments, private industry and unions work together in a collaborative way to build manufacturing. They have the Fraunhofer Institute, which has been a great success in getting synergy between industry, unions, the university sector and government to drive those good outcomes in manufacturing. 


We need a procurement policy that must be implemented. Those changes at the end of last year were significant changes. They could be better, but they are significant changes. We need to tackle dumping laws and to be tougher on free trade agreements; we need to invest in education, trades and skills. When it comes to health, for goodness sake let's put an emphasis on preventive health so we can prevent people going to hospital in the first place. There are so many other issues to traverse, but I hope this gives a flavour of what the Nick Xenophon Team stands for.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (16:49):  I rise to support the proposition that has been put forward by the leader of Labor in the Senate, Penny Wong. Labor is absolutely committed to building a better society and to building a better community in this country. We do want secure jobs, and that's why we have said that you need to resolve the issue of climate change so that we can get investment in this country into renewable energy and create jobs for these young kids that are listening to this debate today, because that's the issue. We don't go back to coal. We don't go back to the era where coal drove everything in Australia. We need the opportunity to bring this country into the 21st century.


We do need fairer wages in this country. Under this rabble of a government that we have, under that weak Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, we've seen wage stagnation to the extent that the Reserve Bank is saying that we need some process to lift wages in this country. And what was the first thing this government did? It actually cut the wages of the parliamentary cleaners, the people that clean the toilets after this rabble of a government. They had their wages cut under this government.


We want to make sure that we tackle rising power prices, but you need certainty. You need investment. You need new investments in this country to deal with that. We want to invest in education. Seventeen billion dollars is what you lot have cut from the Gonski agreements around the country. We want to make sure that there is not only a school system that we can be proud of but a TAFE system that we can be proud of. And what we see around the country is the National Party standing back, watching austerity budgets cut back on TAFE around the country. We want more apprentices. We want more opportunities for young people and we want opportunities for older people in regional and rural communities to access TAFE. These are the issues that we see as important.


We want more health care. We want better health care. We want a focus on health care. We don't need more $7 fees added to people who are going to see the doctor, as this lot did in their first budget. We want to deal with housing affordability. We want these young people that are here listening in today to be able to afford their home in the future. But, while this mob defend capital gains tax exemptions and negative gearing for their rich mates who put their money in their back pockets for their election campaigns, we are always going to have a problem with capital gains tax exemptions, negative gearing and the use of self-managed super funds to push young people out of housing affordability in this country. We will deal with that.


I want to finish on this issue. The coalition are obsessed by the Leader of the Labor Party, Bill Shorten, and I know why: because it's the 16th or 17th poll—they raised the issue of the polls—that we've seen the coalition way behind Labor in the polls. And then you get Senator Macdonald come up here, again with that obsession, and talk about Beaconsfield. He has not got a clue, obviously from what he said, about Beaconsfield and Bill Shorten's involvement there. He hasn't got a clue what happened. He should come here and apologise to the people of Tasmania, who watched one of their fellows down there die at Beaconsfield, trapped in a mine, dead. And we had this nonsense from Senator Macdonald. We had miner Larry Knight dead at 44 years old, and we get that nonsense from Senator Macdonald. We had Brant Webb and Todd Russell trapped, and the public knew that Bill Shorten was down there supporting those workers and those families—more than this mob would ever do for a worker in their lives. You're a rabble of a government and an absolute disgrace.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-08-14,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (16:54):  I want to thank Senator Wong for the opportunity to make a contribution on issues such as secure jobs, rising power prices, investment in education and health care, and addressing housing affordability. I think it is fair to say that most people who have a basic understanding of economic principles understand that most of the generation of wealth in a nation happens from the private sector. We know that the public sector, governments, can borrow more money, and my colleagues on the other side of the chamber know all about that; cut services, and nobody in this country wants to see an unnecessary reduction in services; or we can increase the receipts of the nation by higher taxes and charges. Of course, it is two out of three for my colleagues in the Labor Party and the Greens, who support those anti-economic measures in terms of their management of the economy. It's well known that whilst the Labor Party, historically, has made great contributions to this nation over many decades, it cannot manage an economy. It mismanages every economic opportunity that it has. It's also well known that it has no interest in rural, what I refer to as provincial, Australia. 


This government, the Turnbull-Joyce government, has created some 240,000 new jobs—a quarter of a billion new jobs—since it come to power. I don't know how many more jobs the Labor Party think there are to be had, but this is an outstanding record. As you all know, when people have the dignity of a job, it creates a much fairer Australia. The missions we've created with reductions in taxation create opportunities for private sector businesses to go ahead and employ more people and give people the dignity of employment. It creates these opportunities. Investment creates opportunities, and opportunities come in the form of jobs, which see a reduction in the impacts on the social security net in our nation. It gives us improved living standards, and Australians, generally—not all; I don't think it matters at what stage in life we look, there are some people who find themselves left behind—have first-class living standards and education compared to anywhere in the world and have some of the best health care in the world. When you get people into jobs, all of this impacts on the economy and, amongst other things, results in a reduction in the cost of social security and an increase in receipts for the Commonwealth. And what does the Commonwealth do when it is in good economic circumstances? It invests that money, mainly in infrastructure projects and the provision of services for the nation. That is regarded as an investment in those economies. That turns to creating opportunities and jobs and in the wonderful economic cycle, the circle joins and goes on forever. 


I find it difficult that the Labor Party would talk about creating a stronger and fairer Australia when their current tax policy is to increase taxes. This is a well known 101 of economics. Increasing taxes simply stifles investment. It reduces investment, and, therefore, these opportunities that I spoke of, these jobs that are created, don't appear. In fact, jobs are lost. 


Let's just link that to what they're talking about: to tackle rising power prices. It is well known that the Labor Party—it almost defied logic for me as I watched them over the last decade—abandoned blue-collar workers in provincial Australia and particularly those who were involved in our coal industry up in central Queensland. There were 14,000 jobs gone. There were 14,000 real jobs gone in Central Queensland between Townsville and Gladstone. The Turnbull-Joyce government has compensated with the creation of 240,000 new jobs, but, nonetheless, 14,000 jobs are gone.


Let's talk about how the Labor Party might support us in dealing with this. It's no surprise that my speech concentrates on Queensland, my home state, and on projects that will lift the economic fortunes of all the people in Central Queensland. We've got the Adani Carmichael project, with 2½ thousand direct jobs and nearly 4,000 indirect jobs once that goes into operation. We're talking about a total employment impact of 11,800 jobs when the secondary jobs are taken into account—those businesses and industries that will support the development of the Carmichael project. With GVK there are almost 3½ thousand jobs in construction, along with 3,200 when it's in operation. We haven't even touched on some of the ancillary stuff that happens here. We haven't even touched on the $1 billion rail line that has to be built and the increase in the port facilities in Central Queensland.


I have invited colleagues from across the chamber more than once—to save having to do it every time I speak, the invitation stands open—to make contact with my office. I'm happy to meet the costs of travel. We'll go up into Central Queensland, into the public bar of the Black Nugget Hotel, into the town square at Blackwater or into the main street of Emerald and you can meet the people who will be directly affected by your policies that you continue to espouse. You can meet these people. You can meet the small-to-medium-sized businesses for whom you resisted a tax cut that would provide them with some surplus that they—most of them at least—would inevitably reinvest in employment opportunities. Going back to my cycle: employment creates opportunities, increases the receipts of the nation, puts the Commonwealth in the stronger economic position and allows us to invest in projects like the development of northern Australia, a $5 billion fund.


I cannot believe that Senator Wong selected some of these issues for the debate under standing order 75 today. She forgot to mention or wasn't aware of the $2 billion dams package that will be invested in infrastructure in so many of our states. She forgot about the $1.7 billion invested in the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing to get our commodities from provincial Australia, particularly the central west and the south-west of my home state. There is $1.5 billion already invested in the Inland Rail, with a further $9 billion committed to be invested in that project. There is $10 billion invested in upgrading the Bruce Highway to make it flood-proof. There are all those commodities in the north. Hundreds of thousands of people are employed in the banana industry and the sugarcane industry, and they can all have secure jobs, knowing their commodities can make their way down to port.


I want to finish where I opened. The Australian Labor Party has a long tradition of poor economic management. It's reflected in their policies today and the fact that these policies will impact on rural Australia. Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-08-14,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (17:03):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I am astounded by the words of Labor's MPI which, at its core, is about cost of living. In November 2009, the then ALP Senator Mark Furner and I exchanged correspondence. He relied on written advice from Senator Wong. Her comments falsely blamed carbon dioxide from human activity for natural climate cycles and weather. On these Labor-Greens misrepresentations of climate are based Labor energy policy, killing jobs and raising cost of living.


Today the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, a South Australian, continues to severely hurt Australia's strength as her party destroys fairness, kills job security and turbocharges energy price rises, closing factories and shutting mines and businesses. Instead, a stronger and fairer Australia will come from policies based objectively and honestly on hard, measured data—scientific data—physical observation and empirical evidence. This is all we ask for in economic policy. Such evidence, according to NASA satellites, shows that atmospheric temperatures have shown a flat trend for the last 22 years despite record amounts of carbon dioxide from human activity—no warming. The Global Historical Climatology Network's records show that the longest temperature trend of the last 120 years was 40 years of cooling, from the 1930s to 1976, when carbon dioxide from human activity increased dramatically during World War II and the postwar economic boom. Bureau of Meteorology data show that Australian temperatures in the 1880s and 1890s were warmer than today.


The way to a new vision for a stronger and fairer Australia, secure jobs, fairer wages and reducing energy prices is to eliminate the anti-science and destructive climate policies initiated by the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd, in 2007 and meekly adopted and promoted by then Prime Minister, John Howard, fearfully trailing in the polls and media. The ALP-Greens climate fraud has much to answer for. And the antidote is easy: tell the truth and restore scientific integrity. Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party stands for fairness and integrity, a fair go for all Australians together. A vision for a stronger and fairer Australia with secure jobs and fairer wages must be based not on which way the wind blows but on solid facts, hard evidence.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (17:06):  Unfortunately, we do have a need for a new vision for a stronger and fairer Australia. And that's because this government has not got the ability to lead our nation. There is no leadership. Added to that, they fundamentally lack vision and a sense of what is fair. It's as if they're stuck in a time warp. They espouse policies from the 1950s without realising that the world has actually moved on, that the world has changed. And the policies the Australian government enacts for the Australian people need to change, too; they need to keep up-to-date.


Labor, on the other hand, has a vision for a stronger and fairer nation. Only Labor will fight for secure jobs and fair wages. Only Labor will tackle rising power prices, invest in education and health and address housing affordability. And why is that? It's because those opposite lack the courage, willingness or ability to fight for a better Australia. They're content to keep on eroding workers' rights and conditions because it suits them and their big-business mates. But we on this side believe Australia will be a stronger nation when we are a fairer nation, when everyone believes that they have opportunities, when everyone has potential to succeed and when loopholes in the law aren't used by some to not pay their fair share.


Sadly, fairness has gone backwards. Since the mid-1970s, real wages have grown by 72 per cent for the top 10 per cent of workers but by just 23 per cent for the bottom 10 per cent. If I was still an early childhood educator, or a cleaner, and had received the same wage gains as financiers and solicitors, then I would be about $16,000 better off a year. Unfortunately, early childhood educators and cleaners do not receive the same wage gains as financiers and solicitors, so they're not $16,000 better off a year. We know rising inequality has direct costs. And in an economy that benefits only the fortunate few it isn't just unfair; it's likely to be quite unstable and even unhappy.


The rules shouldn't be rigged for one group of people over another. Labor wants to see changes in a number of areas. One of those areas is discretionary trusts, which are overwhelmingly held by the most affluent households. Taxing discretionary trust distributions to mature-age beneficiaries at 30 per cent is a similar approach to what John Howard did as Treasurer in 1980 when he stopped the rort of distributing tax-free trust income to toddlers. Charitable trusts, deceased estates and people who work in or run a small business and receive a salary won't be affected. But high-income professionals who are splitting their income with their adult children and parents will have to go back to just one tax-free threshold, just like the rest of the workforce. That is fairness.


While the Turnbull government has led cuts to penalty rates and let them sail through, Labor will continue to fight these cuts. It's just unfair to cut the wages of our lowest income earners while millionaires get tax cuts. We've also seen the rise of the casualisation of work. Casual work makes it harder for people to get loans or mortgages, to plan their future and to maximise their career opportunities. The priorities of federal Labor start with jobs and wages and tackling inequality in the labour market, and the best way to secure jobs is to ensure we have a well-educated and trained workforce. So, while Labor stood its ground and campaigned against Gonski 2.0, it is a bit unfortunate that we saw the Greens capitulate and allow approximately $68 million to be ripped out of the education system of my home state of Tasmania. Unless we focus on quality education based on need, we will leave behind a generation ill-equipped to face the challenges of the future economy.


I'll just quickly talk about Australia's homeownership rate, which is now at a six-decade low. Over the past generation, the share of young Australians owning their home has fallen while the share who are renting has risen. As major city house prices push the seven-figure mark, we increasingly risk becoming a nation where the only way of buying a home is to get help from your parents. That's okay if your parents can afford it. I had to help my daughter recently to purchase a home. I earn good money, but if you're earning $60,000 or $70,000 a year, or even less, how do you help your adult child buy a home? Let me tell you: it cannot be done. My daughter wasn't eligible to get a mortgage, because she's on contract work all the time. Although she has an honours degree, she was— (Time expired)

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (17:12):  I rise today to speak in response to the matter of public importance submitted to the Senate by our parliamentary colleague from South Australian, Senator Wong. Although I applaud the spirit of Senator Wong in raising this matter of public importance in this place, I am frankly galled by the political nonsense inherent in the senator's insinuation that the Labor Party somehow has a superior vision for Australia's future. In this matter of public importance, Senator Wong blindly echoes the cheap populism and desperate rhetoric of her disingenuous leader. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition, with his cheap and easy calls for fairness and equality, under which hide a dangerous redistributionist agenda, clearly believes he has found a path through his lack of personal appeal to voters and is desperately channelling the populist exploitations of the UK's Jeremy Corbyn. If you'll excuse the pun on such a serious matter, Bill Shorten is clearly remaking himself as a Corbyn copy of his UK socialist hero. Do you like that?


Let me remind the chamber of the Turnbull government's approach to a fairer and better Australia. Three months ago, the Treasurer delivered his budget in the other place. It was a budget firmly centred entirely on the notions of fairness, opportunity and security. Indeed, those on this side of the chamber are the staunch defenders of these notions, including fairness, but not of a populist, lowest-common-denominator, divisive definition of fairness. It is not a 'chapter 1, page 1 of the socialist playbook of the politics of envy' definition of fairness, nor is it a 'when all else fails, engage in class warfare' definition of fairness, conjuring a Monopoly-man-esque image of the rich Australian using trusts to legally avoid his fair dues of tax. The coalition's view of fairness is an inclusive one. It is a fairness that unites the nation in common purpose and does not divide it for political purpose.


The idea of fairness perpetuated by Labor and the Greens is a very, very narrow construct about distribution from those who have to those who have less. It doesn't take into account the innovation, the risks and the sacrifices taken by small business people that enable them to build a business and employ others. Fairness should also involve rewarding them for their risks, their sacrifices and their sleepless nights in order to create something of value. Government must never lose sight of the risks taken by industrious men and women in this country nor seek to punish their success.


I take, for example, the attack by those opposite on family trusts. Discretionary trusts, as we all know, are not tax avoidance structures. They can be, and often are, used by farmers and by small businesses to aid in things like succession planning and asset protection. And that the Labor Party would dismiss trusts simply as a crude tool of the tax-avoiding rich is an insult—an insult to the multitude of small businesses and agricultural trusts in Australia. It's an insult to small business people and it's an insult to farmers.


This is just the latest hit to small business from a Labor Party that doesn't understand that Australian small businesses drive Australian jobs and wages. Following their refusal to keep the lower company tax rate that the Turnbull government has legislated for small businesses, this is a party that simply doesn't care about small business. I know that those opposite might like to think that in the catchcry 'fairness' they have found a phrase that will 'Cry ""Havoc!"" and let slip the dogs of war'. But, in my mind, I feel that they have actually unleashed a poodle as opposed to a pit bull here.


The Australian public are not fools; they know that higher taxes are not the answer. Higher taxes will not solve the problems for those that have been left behind. As the Treasurer so plainly and so clearly put it: higher taxes don't increase your wage. Higher taxes don't increase your wage—that is a flat-earth argument that will penalise Australian families and whack small businesses. Indeed, the Parliamentary Budget Office has released the costings of Australia's new taxation plan, and it will be no surprise to hear that they estimated a cost to the economy in excess of $167 million. Now, how Senator Wong, the Leader of the Opposition or indeed anybody on that side of the chamber in Labor's parliamentary caucus could see this as good tax policy—as fair tax policy—is totally beyond me. It truly is a mystery.


Acting Deputy President, you will hear those opposite, those whose hopes are desperately pinned upon some improvement in the Leader of the Opposition's personal popularity, repeat the mantra of inequality and fairness like a broken record. But, as the Leader of the Opposition himself said in his budget reply speech, repetition is no substitute for conviction. For our country's sake, for our children's sake, we cannot allow Labor's creeping redistributionist agenda to come to pass. This is not a new vision; it has never been a new vision. It is the oldest play in the ALP's little red book. It is a socialist wolf in Labor's sheep's clothing.


So, I thank Senator Wong. I thank her very much for bringing this matter to the attention of the chamber. But I feel confident in dismissing this matter of public importance as simply the politically motivated nonsense that it is. And I thank the chamber for its time.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2017-08-14,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (17:18):  The Australia I grew up in is in the rear-view mirror. When I was a child, I was told that if I did the right thing by others, if I kept myself out of trouble and if I worked hard, I would be successful. Today, that promise isn't true anymore. We still think the key to improving your lot in life is hard work, but that's increasingly not the case. The link between work and reward is being eroded.


Compared to the Australia of the previous generation, today we're still working hard but we're a nation working for lower wages with less job security. The generation who grew up being told that the way you moved up in the world was with education and training is now in charge of this place, and is making policy saying that students should pay more and that universities should get less. House prices are growing faster than income and trying to save up a deposit for a first home is like chasing a piece of string on the ground that keeps getting further away from you every time you go to grab it. Median house prices grew four per cent in Launceston last year and they grew eight per cent in Hobart. Meanwhile, incomes are going nowhere and there's still a big problem with unemployment and underemployment. Young people are being told to work hard and save for their first home, but they don't have the jobs to get their foot in the door and they are getting no help from this government. Of course, the Turnbull government thinks it's helping by giving young people an internship that pays them nothing and offers them no guarantee of employment at the end. 


Where has the big picture thinking gone? We have a government that says, 'If you want to study then you should pay more to do it and, if a university wants to teach you, it should have to pay more to do that too.' We have a government saying that there is not enough money to increase Youth Allowance payments for students. The result is that students can't afford to spend their weekends studying because they're spending their time making coffees or waiting tables, because they need to be able to feed themselves somehow. Then the government looks at the money those students are making on the weekends and they say: 'You're making too much money. We'll have to cut some of that too.' Where does this all end? Where is the logic? Are these students working too much or not enough? Every hour they spend working in a pub or in a supermarket is an hour they're not spending on their study. We wonder how we're going to get people to finish their degrees. Well, here's a thought: why don't we give students enough time to actually study in the first place? 


The Greens put forward a bill this morning that would have increased Youth Allowance by $110 a fortnight. The effect would have been to give students a little bit of breathing room. It would have meant that missing a shift because you're sick or studying wouldn't mean starving for a week. It would have meant more students doing more study, which is what we're supposed to be encouraging, which is supposed to be the purpose of the Youth Allowance payments in the first place. The bill was voted down by the champions of equality and opportunity in the Australian Labor Party. You'd expect it from the government but it's particularly shocking from the Australian Labor Party.


What's worse is that it wasn't just students who would have benefited from the increase; those on Newstart would have been better off too. But, instead of backing an increase for those who can't find a job, they backed a review instead. Another review won't change the fact that there are more unemployed people than there are job vacancies. It's simple arithmetic. If there are more people looking for a job than there are jobs, then not everyone will find one—it's pretty simple. Rather than punishing those who can't get a job, not because they don't want one but because there aren't enough jobs, we should be looking at the other side of the equation. We should be doing more to create jobs that will employ those people looking for work. 


Looking after the vulnerable means actually looking after the vulnerable. It isn't a promise to say the right thing; it means actually doing the right thing. Let's be real. Pensioners aren't asking for the world. They aren't asking for a mansion, a jet ski and an investment property on the beach. Pensioners are simply asking for an age pension that gives them enough to turn on the heater in the morning. That's what they are asking for. Is it too much to ask? This government spends all its time fighting itself. What do we do to get a government that fights for the rest of us? Well, do you know what? I'll tell you who else is struggling: there are job seekers, there are students, there are veterans and there are small businesses. I can tell you they're in trouble. (Time expired).

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (17:23):  I rise to repeat this simple, self-evident truth. The Turnbull government will not bother itself to tackle the ever-extending list of cost-of-living challenges its leadership has forced upon all Australians. As Bill Shorten said last month: 'Workers' share of income is at its lowest levels in half a century'. There is less money in their pay packet and less security in their job. More and more Australians are part time or casualised and are denied a proper income that they could live on. They are able to be dismissed, put off or have their contract varied at any time. 


Our out-of-pocket childcare costs have risen every year under the Abbott-Turnbull government. Despite their childcare changes, the government's own figures show fees are set to keep rising at over five per cent a year—well above wages. But the Turnbull government doesn't care about addressing inequality. It has no plans and no interest in addressing people's life circumstances, not because it can't, but because it won't. Helping Australians with cost-of-living challenges is simply not in this government's DNA. This is the party that has spent nearly half a decade talking up tax cuts for millionaires and multinationals, while, at the same time, applauding tax cuts to wages and implementing cuts to basic services. They haven't advanced climate policy or energy policy and the problems of housing affordability and negative gearing are untouched. Multinationals still do not have to pay their fair share of tax. There's an income tax cut for the top bracket and penalty rate cuts for the lowest tax bracket.


However, there's another truth in this parliament and it is the truth about the Labor Party. The Labor Party works for a fair and more equal society. It is the truth about us that we always have and we always will. There is only one party interested in improving the lives of all Australians: it is the Labor Party. The Labor Party is prepared not only to recognise inequality as the most serious threat to our health as an economy and our cohesion as a society but to set out and take the necessary steps that will actually address it.


As Bill Shorten has said, Labor will tackle inequality and restore the confidence so desperately needed in our economy. Labor will work with business to drive the industries that deliver decent jobs that people can build a life around and gain a mortgage around and so that they can form meaningful relationships and have dreams and hopes for their future and their children's future. Labor will have the courage to end the toxic politics created by this government on climate and energy policy, which will create the certainty needed to boost investment and drive down energy costs. Labor will put the great Australian dream of owning your own home back within the reach of working and middle-class Australians. Labor will invest in Medicare, in dental care and in our healthcare system, so that Australians are healthier at home and, of course, more productive at work. We will do what this government refuses to do.


This government continues to ignore the issues and the challenges facing Australians, to ignore the facts of inequality. In fact, Senator Cormann doesn't even think that there is an inequality problem. He actually thinks inequality is getting better, despite what the Governor of the Reserve Bank claims to admit. Well, the Labor Party knows very well that as long as the Turnbull government continues to govern for the people of Australia, inequality will worsen and Australians will be the worse off.


Labor will do what this government has refused to do, because we will always stand on the side of fairness and we will always stand on the side of decency for all Australians. We will reward hard work. We will invest in the future and ensure that Australia, once again, does indeed become the country of the fair go.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (17:27):  What we have seen from those opposite in this debate is the fact that we do need a new vision for this country, because what we've seen is a really motley crew of an excuse for what they tried to elaborate as their vision for this government. But the reality is we have seen no vision from them. All we have seen is slogans that mean nothing and deliver less for the Australian people. There has been no better example of that in recent days and weeks than the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, lecturing us that inequality has actually been getting better in recent years, proving not only how out of touch he is but also, at the same time, his lack of political acumen. In this chamber, we get lectures about socialism from the finance minister—the guy who's best known for smoking a cigar just prior to delivering the worst budget in living memory. Now what we see is a $122 million survey that will be his legacy as finance minister. So there is no doubt that there needs to be a new vision. 


The comments and contributions from Senator Macdonald and Senator O'Sullivan need to be touched on as well. They came in here and mentioned the importance of coal in regional Queensland. As a Queenslander, I am someone who understands that. But they obviously missed the memo from Scott Morrison, who said that cheap coal-fired power is dead. They obviously failed to pick up that from his contribution.


But why do we need a new vision? I think it's important to highlight just some of the reasons why that is necessary when you look at the record of this government. We know about the comments from Treasurer Morrison around inequality. However, since the mid-1970s, real wages have grown by 72 per cent for the top tenth of workers but just 23 per cent for the bottom tenth. For all their talk about jobs and growth, the key parameters in this year's budget have actually been downgraded. Growth is down, wages growth is down, employment is down and the unemployment rate is up.


When it comes to power prices, we see the ongoing debacle from those opposite, where they have failed to address it in their caucus despite it being such an important issue. They can have all the cups of tea that they like, but they need to reach a conclusion on the clean energy target. Basically, what that means for everyone out there is that they have to declare a winner between the Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister. That's actually the debate that is ongoing at the moment. But we know that a number of people have seen that wholesale power prices have doubled under Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull. Only last week, the Reserve Bank governor added his voice to the long list of business voices that have said this government must adopt a clean energy target. We know what they did with education and the cuts to the Gonski funding, we know what they've been doing with their undermining of Medicare over a long period of time, and we know, despite all the rhetoric that they had in the lead-up to the budget, that they've done nothing to target or do anything about housing affordability. So the case is clear about why we need a new vision when it comes to these important issues.


The pleasing thing is that federal Labor have been leading the policy debate on these important issues. On secure jobs and fairer wages, we won't be slugging those who earn less than $87,000. Importantly in the current context, we will be reversing the cuts to penalty rates so that, for those people who can least afford a cut, Labor will be there to support them. On rising power prices, as I mentioned before, Labor stand ready to work with the government once they've declared a winner between the current Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister about who we need to talk to to get in place a clean energy target, which will be so important to providing stability and, in the long term, lowering the cost of electricity. On education we're very clear: we will restore the $22 billion that they have cut from all Australian schools. On housing affordability, we will reform negative gearing so that you can only negatively gear newly built homes, and reform the capital gains tax concessions that are unfair to so many people trying to enter into the new housing market.


But it's amusing to watch those opposite flounder about as they try to provide an example of what their vision is for this country. Speaker after speaker came in here, and you did not get a consistent message from any of them. That's because they don't have it. They are unsure what they will do to dig themselves out of their hole, whereas federal Labor will continue to provide the leadership that this country is looking for and provide the answers that the people want in this regard.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (17:35):  I present the interim report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the impact of Defence training activities and facilities on rural and regional communities.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator GALLACHER:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I rise as Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee to speak on the first interim report of the committee's inquiry into the impact of Defence training activities and facilities on rural and regional communities. The committee has decided to table interim reports after regional hearings so that local communities do not have to wait until the final report from the committee for issues in their area to be highlighted. To date the committee has been pleased with the level of engagement by the Department of Defence and the willingness of officers to acknowledge that there is room for improvement in their engagement with local communities.


To set the scene for the inquiry: the 2016 white paper indicated the government's intention to strengthen and increase investment in defence capabilities, which was supported by an increase in defence funding. The government has stated that it will implement a range of infrastructure initiatives to support future ADF operations, including upgrading training and facilities over the next 10 years. The white paper also signalled a new approach to defence industry policy, with a focus on small-to-medium enterprises. The focus was reiterated in the 2016 Defence industry policy statement. The Prime Minister and the government ministers have emphasised that the new investment in defence will create jobs across the region and bring benefits to local businesses and communities. These policies and statements from the government have generated expectations that regional Australia will be able to benefit directly and indirectly through participation of local businesses—in particular, small-to-medium enterprises—in building defence capability.


The focus of the committee has been to investigate whether regions, local businesses and local communities have access to information about the plans to expand or upgrade facilities so that they are in a position to offer goods and services. The committee also explored communication by Defence with stakeholders in local communities who will be affected by upgrades or expansion, as well as communication about existing training activities. In addition to looking at channels of communication, the committee spoke with businesses currently working with Defence in an effort to provide guidance for other businesses looking to engage.


The committee held a hearing in Port Augusta on 8 June 2017. The significant test and training areas in South Australia are the Cultana Training Area and the Woomera Range Complex, which will undergo expansion and upgrades. There are also regular exercises, such as Exercise Hamel in 2016 which was centred on the Cultana Training Area.


The committee was pleased to hear the overall message that Defence's presence is welcomed and supported in local communities. The committee would like to see Defence capitalise on this goodwill, as well as on the local knowledge, skills and experience. The committee recognises, as the local communities recognise, that Defence cannot source everything it needs locally. However, the clear message from the hearing was that local businesses wish to have the opportunity to be fairly considered when Defence is sourcing goods and services. The committee heard that there can be a perception that regional areas do not have the necessary skills to provide goods and services. There was a very clear message to the committee that the skills exist and the businesses are willing to engage. The information on local businesses' skills and capacity appears to be readily available.


There are challenges for local business, as most are small and medium enterprises, so scale can present some issues. Procurement processes can also be daunting, especially in documentation, which the committee heard can be onerous and complex. Local businesses also need to focus on maintaining their work in the local community as Defence work can be transitory.


I turn now to the mechanisms being used to engage and enhance local engagement with the potential opportunities from Defence. Communication, coordination and streamlining the dissemination of information are critical to maintaining and improving relationships. For relationships between Defence and the local communities, the committee heard that Defence has made a good effort in disseminating information on business opportunities as a result of the Cultana Training Area Expansion Project, as has tier 1 contractor St Hilliers.


Each regional area has its own communication mechanisms. The committee considered that there are a number of mechanisms in existence which form solid platforms for ongoing communication and coordination across the region. The committee also heard about a new initiative to bring together significant stakeholders from the region to develop a coordination framework. It would appear that this group would go a long way to addressing the coordination and dissemination of information, and the committee was pleased to hear that Defence is engaged in this forum. This forum could also be used to channel the information on local skills, businesses and capacity to appropriate areas, to ensure that businesses are in the best position to take advantage of the commercial opportunities, some of which will require support. There would appear to be channels in place to facilitate this support, including forums with Defence and others to provide training and capacity building as required.


Whilst appreciative of the expected surge in business during exercises, local businesses expressed disappointment that there had been little forewarning to them to allow them to maximise the business opportunities. The committee recognises that Defence must work within the Commonwealth procurement framework but will look more closely at the South Australian model and its applicability to Commonwealth procurement. The committee appreciates the willingness of Defence to engage with this model and the willingness of the industry advocate to engage with Defence.


The committee believes there should be a greater level of visibility and transparency of Defence engagement with local communities. Data at the national level means little in local areas. Defence was able to provide the committee with some information, breaking down contracts by region, and took on notice to provide further information.


The committee has made these initial recommendations: to ensure the most efficient communication mechanisms are in place for the most effective flow of information, which may generate potential business opportunities; to ensure as much information about upcoming training exercises is being disseminated with as much notice as possible; to explore further engagement with the industry advocate to investigate opportunities for events or workshops; and to make more information available to local communities about Defence expenditure in the area.


I thank the committee members for the bipartisan approach to this inquiry. In July, the committee held hearings in Rockhampton and Townsville, and there will be a separate interim report to cover these hearings. Later in the month, the committee is expected to convene hearings in Darwin and Katherine. This was initiated by an approach from the mayors of the Upper Spencer Gulf, who came to Canberra on their regular lobbying exercise and simply said: 'Defence is very welcome in our areas. We love having Defence there. They bring an incidental economic boost. The Cultana training area has been expanded. There is considerable investment of Defence funds in infrastructure but, basically, we can't see the opportunities. We need to be able to see where our local small to medium enterprises can actually get in and do some very valuable work in these small regional economies.'


We had a very successful bipartisan view about this. Former Senator Back was extremely supportive of this effort, as was Senator Fawcett and—I can't think of the other coalition senator that appeared. Basically, the whole effort was that regional Australians need investment and they need the visibility to exercise their skills and opportunities. If we can somehow encourage Defence to be a little bit more transparent and to invest locally it will be for the good of regional South Australia and, indeed, regional Queensland, the Northern Territory and wherever else we look.


I have to put on the record once again the extremely good work of the secretariat in this area. Secretary Sullivan and Suzanne O'Neill convened efficiently, as always. We have produced what I think is a credible piece of work which is worthy of the defence minister's consideration and, in my view, adoption. I seek leave to continue my remarks.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2017-08-14,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:47):  The Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2017 ushers in a landmark reform to competition law in Australia. It's a bill that lowers the burden of proof so the ACCC can more easily take action against companies that misuse their market power. It is the culmination of a long campaign by many people, including my predecessor, Senator Christine Milne, former Leader of the Australian Greens, who worked tirelessly to see this change come into effect. She worked with people who have been done over by big businesses that have used their sheer size to squash competition and squeeze out their supply chains. It is a bill that brings into effect a policy that the Greens took to the 2013 election and the 2016 election. We are very pleased to have been a champion for this reform in this parliament.


It was on the day that Malcolm Turnbull actually challenged former Prime Minister Tony Abbott for the Liberal leadership that we saw the Nationals cross the floor to support a Greens motion on introducing an effects test. I'm sure it was at the front of their mind when they negotiated their secret wish list to support a Turnbull government in a formal coalition. Of course, we are seeing the repercussions of that wish list play out with the marriage equality debate right now. It is interesting that what we have got is a bill that is the result of two parties—not the two major parties in this place, but the Greens and the Nationals—who have championed this reform. We know the Liberals don't like it—they don't like it because it's not something that looks after their big business mates—but we know they are forced to cop it if they are going to stay in government with the support of the National Party. Of course, it will be the Labor Party that will be alone in opposing it.


What we have got, again, is not just Coles and Woolies literally using their market power but the Coles and Woolies of politics who have joined together in so many different ways to stymie this reform. Yet, thanks to some good fortune and circumstance, we have got a very important reform going through this chamber. It's a reform that's good for small business; it's good for farmers; it's good for consumers; and it is good for the economy. It's unquestionably a progressive step forward.


Currently, if the ACCC are to take action against a company for misusing its market power, they have to prove that a company intentionally took advantage of its market power to damage a competitor. In other words, it's not just the effect of the action but the intent. Of course, when we have laws that are seeking to prove intent, we set a very high bar, one that's almost impossible to prosecute. It's been very difficult for the ACCC to take action against big business that deliberately crowds out competitors and squeezes the life out of those further down the supply chain. Under this new law, the ACCC need to take action not based on the intent of a company but when the effect of a company's conduct is to damage competition. It might intend to do it; it might not, but an effects test says that, if big business behaves badly, that is the threshold for the ACCC to step in.


Oligopolies now define modern retail. We know that. From supermarkets to the large hardware chains to whitegoods to electronics to fuel to banking, it goes on and on and on. Shopping in Australia is now a big-brand experience. We know that sometimes there are benefits to it, but often there are huge costs to the long-term health of the market and the economy. That's why we always need to be aware of the role that oligopolies are playing and to ensure that there are measures in place to restrict their power when their power is squeezing out other competitors.


I have to say that it's not every day that we see government move ahead with a policy that is in the face of such strong opposition from some of those vested interests. We've been fighting for this for a long time, and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have refused to entertain any change through that time. But what we see now is an effects test that acknowledges that what actually happens in a market is more important than what the theory says should happen in a market. An effects test says that the result is the thing that counts most. What is the result? What is the effect of these actions?


We know that it's supported by regulators, by academics, by consumer groups and, most importantly, by those many small businesses and farmers who have experienced what it's like to be stomped on by these huge, powerful behemoths of the market. An effects test is a win for many over the powerful interests of the few. It is very, very odd that, given all of those who are lined up in support of an effects test, it is the Labor Party that is standing alone as the voice against an effects test.


The only stakeholders that we can see standing with the ALP are the Business Council. You might be confused by this alliance, but, if you scratch the surface, you find that what you're seeing is a demonstration of the huge but largely silent power of the 'Shoppies' union. It is the Shoppies union who forced Labor to vote against marriage equality for years, time and time again, and who yet may exert their influence on some members of the Labor Party. They forced Labor to engage in a debate around school funding because it stripped out the special funding deals for Catholic schools. Now we're seeing the Shoppies union forcing Labor not to vote for a progressive policy outcome because it comes at the expense of Coles and Woolies. Remember Coles and Woolies, the big businesses that helped the Shoppies union stitch up a secret deal to leave a quarter of a million people, mostly young people, their members, getting screwed over with salaries that are below the minimum wage? Coles and Woolies help deliver the Shoppies their members. And, because there are so many members, they're a very powerful factional bloc within Labor. That is why you get the Labor Party now standing in opposition to what is a very, very positive reform for the nation.


I'm very pleased to stand here today and talk about the many ways in which the Greens have helped to shape the national agenda—the bank levy, for example. We stood firm many years ago proposing a bank levy, and of course we were ridiculed, it must be said, by the government. Yet now here we are with the government introducing a bank levy, something that the Greens campaigned on for many years. We came out and spoke strongly, loudly and passionately against negative gearing, something that distorts the housing market and means that young people don't get an opportunity to buy their own home in the way that their parents and grandparents did. It's great to see the Labor Party change their position on this and adopt some changes to negative gearing. We also championed the need for a banking royal commission. We put that to the parliament. It was voted against by both Labor and Liberal, and yet now we have seen the Labor Party change their tune on that and we are pleased to see it. 


We've campaigned for so many things—medicinal cannabis, where we've seen significant reform—and now we have an effects test, this time supported by the government. We are seeing the Greens help shape both the national and economic agenda and the social and environmental agenda in this country. We are very pleased and proud to have championed this reform. I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Senator Christine Milne, who made sure that an effects test remained a central policy position of the Australian Greens—something she took to the 2013 election and something I am proud to be able to say the Greens have helped deliver in this parliament. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-08-14,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:56):  For a supposedly liberal government, this is a shockingly bad piece of legislation. In a breathless rush to claim to be protecting consumers from wicked corporations, this bill seems to reflect a profound misunderstanding of both competition and the operation of the marketplace. The Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2016 implements some of the recommendations of the Harper review of competition policy. Specifically, the Harper review concluded that section 46 of the competition and consumer laws, dealing with the so-called misuse of market power, should be amended to 'prohibit conduct by firms with substantial market power that has the purpose or likely effect of substantially lessening competition.' In line with these recommendations, the bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to strengthen the prohibition of the purported misuse of market power and target supposedly anticompetitive conduct by corporations. 


The current provision of the act outlaws conduct that (1) is by someone with substantial market power; (2) takes advantage of that substantial market power; and (3) has the purpose of eliminating or damaging a competitor, preventing entry or deterring or preventing competitive conduct. The new provisions continue to see so-called substantial market power as a problem but change the focus of concern away from eliminating or damaging a competitor to any action which supposedly substantially lessens competition. To add insult to injury, the bill is estimated to generate additional compliance costs of $2.5 million per year over the first 10 years as businesses are expected to seek legal advice on the new law. This cost will, of course, be ultimately passed on to consumers. Not only do we get more interference in the marketplace but consumers also end up having to pay for the privilege. Simply put, the entire approach of this legislation is irredeemably flawed.


In trying to work out when a business has an anticompetitive purpose or effect, the bill deems enhancing efficiency, innovation, product quality or price competitiveness as pro-competitive factors, even though businesses do these things with a purpose of reducing competition. They want the market to themselves, and this motivation is good. What is substantial market power? This simply reflects the success of a business in meeting consumer demand. Big businesses, which this bill seems to see as a root of all uncompetitive behaviour, all began as small businesses. They got to be big by being more competitive, not less, and by satisfying their customers better than their competitors, who remain small. In the free market, if you fail to meet the needs of your customers then, however big you are, you will lose market share and eventually close the doors. So, in order to become dominant, big businesses must be doing some things pretty right.


What the authors of this bill seemingly fail to grasp is what actually causes uncompetitiveness. Uncompetitive markets, including monopolies, are, without exception, caused not by businesses, big or otherwise, but by government policies that overregulate and restrict businesses: anticompetitive labour laws, usurious taxation and restrictions on supply and international trade—the list goes on and on. All inhibit the ability of new players to set up and compete. Invariably, government restrictions and controls tend to favour large, established businesses over small business and start-ups.


Naturally any business, big or small, will and should exploit any advantage that comes its way. However, if this leads to a monopoly or duopoly, big business should not be blamed for this, as the fault lies not with them but with the government. Many in this place have complained about retail market dominance by two players, about the dominance of banking in Australia by just four major banks and about the fact that we still have only two airlines dominating domestic air travel. However, the big retailers, banks and airlines are simply the ones with enough cunning to survive in the heavily regulated, taxed and controlled market created by government policy.


The key premise behind this bill is simply wrong. It was not and should never be the responsibility of businesses to encourage competition. A business enhances efficiency, innovation, product quality or price competitiveness because it wants to beat its competition, not increase it. Instead of banning individual corporate conduct with a purpose or effect of lessening competition, if anything, the bill should make such conduct compulsory. Companies should not be blamed or punished for simply exploiting government created market distortions that limit their competitors. All businesses have a responsibility to their shareholders to maximise profits in any market situation. If the government is stupid enough to distort the marketplace with taxes, labour laws and regulations that favour a few big businesses then it is the government, not the businesses, that is to blame.


This bill would have you believe that lack of competition is the fault of big business and that government legislation is the solution. In fact, the opposite is true. The bill will do nothing to increase competition. Increased competition comes from less regulation, less taxes and less restrictive labour laws. When the government actually comes up with legislative solutions that increase competition, they will have the Liberal Democrats' outspoken and enthusiastic support. In the meantime, I will oppose this bill. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,22,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-08-14,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:03):  I can indicate on behalf of my colleagues that we support the second reading stage of the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2017 and we're broadly supportive of this bill. It's been a long time coming, and we do actually need to have strong competition laws in place to prevent abuses of market power. Otherwise, it becomes a free-for-all. Otherwise, dominant players can squash the smaller players, and we've seen evidence of that where a small business that is trying to break into a market can be squashed as a result of predatory pricing practices of bigger operators, because they can afford to do that. That is something that this bill goes some way in addressing.


This bill is a result of the extensive work undertaken by Professor Ian Harper and the review panel. The government ought to be congratulated for undertaking this review. It was the first significant review of this type for many years, and it's a review that has been a long time coming, because of concerns that our competition laws have not been working as effectively as they can be. The practical consequences of that have been set out very eloquently by the great Australian writer Malcolm Knox, the author of the book Supermarket Monsters: The Price of Coles and Woolworths' Dominance, which was published in 2015, a couple of years ago. I commend this book to anyone who's interested in seeing the practical consequences of what happens when you have one or two businesses having an extremely large market share, because that market share brings with it enormous market power, resulting in distortions in the market and problems for smaller operators to do with that.


Now, in relation to this particular piece of legislation, I welcome it. I know that the Nationals have had a significant role in pushing for the effects test, which I think is a good test that ought to be introduced—in fact, it's been long overdue—but I believe it needs to go further. It needs to go further, because the effects test essentially cannot be triggered unless there has been a substantial lessening of competition. Those words 'substantial lessening of competition', I believe, are inherently too restrictive. I think we need to look at what the Europeans have been doing for a number of years in the way they look at competition law. They look at the impact of competition in the marketplace, which looks at it from a broader perspective rather than a very narrow test—a hurdle that I feel would be quite difficult to get over in many circumstances.


We need to see how this bill will work, but, having said that, I believe we actually need to have access to justice for this bill to effectively work. It's no good having a piece of legislation with beneficial clauses in it unless people can access those clauses. It's no good having a law in place unless you can enforce that law effectively. As it currently stands, small-to-medium businesses with clear cases of abuse of market power against them are prevented in practical terms from pursuing those claims due to the impact an adverse legal costs order would have on the business in the event their case were to fail.


A costs order is an elephant in the room that particularly prevents companies that have a good case from pursuing it further. There's one retailer in South Australia—I don't think it's necessary to identify that retailer—who has said to me that he's regularly advised by his lawyers that they actually have a good case for abuse of market power in the current provisions, but the problem is that if they lose the case they will be subject to a multimillion dollar costs order against them, in addition to the very high costs of bringing a case forward. That is a problem that does not exist in the United States or Europe, because cost orders are not made in those jurisdictions in competition matters. It's instructive that in the home of capitalism, the United States, they do not exclude small businesses from access to the protection of their competition laws. Their laws go much further to protect competition than Australian laws do now, or as proposed in this bill.


The Harper review acknowledged the problems of access to justice but offered no practical solutions to them. I note that Senator Katy Gallagher had a bill in this parliament that passed the Senate last week. When I spoke to her about this, she was concerned that I would damn her with faint praise. Well, she will be damned with faint praise. No, I will be praising her with real praise, because that is a good piece of legislation that I hope can pass through both houses of parliament. It finally tackles issues of access to justice so that you don't get these monumental cost orders against a small or medium business taking on a giant corporation. And that's why that bill is so valuable. I think that bill is so good that I've incorporated the provisions of that bill into an amendment to this bill. I understand Labor is opposed to this bill, but I would be gobsmacked if Labor would effectively oppose their own provisions of their own bill in the amendment that I propose to move that will incorporate their access to justice provisions. The government's bill, as good as it is in parts, will not be truly effective unless you tackle the issue of access to justice, and that is something that needs to be dealt with.


The other issue that this bill does not address is something that Senator Canavan has previously raised, and I appreciate his support for this issue. We need to have divestiture powers. You need that sword of Damocles hanging over companies, because it isn't enough if it's simply a monetary penalty. There's nothing like the fear of divestiture to change the culture of a corporate company that could be abusing its market power.


As it currently stands, in the rare situation where a market power abuse finding has been found by a court, the court can order the company be restrained and also impose a large financial fine against a company. And that's problematic, because no amount of restraint or fine will bring back to life the hundreds of small businesses that have been wiped out by large companies' misuse of their market power. And the perpetrators of market abuse can be so large that the fine will be considered by the offending company as simply a cost of doing business. This bill proposes positive changes to the way in which market abuse is proved but it does nothing with respect to enhancing the remedies. That is why there ought to be an ability for a court, as a last resort, to order divesture, which, like the sword of Damocles, would serve as the ultimate threat. It makes sense that a court should have a remedy in its tool kit that makes it impossible for a serious or big business offender to offend again.


The remedy of divesture has been available in the home of capitalism, the United States, for nearly 100 years. The US competition laws were born out of a community call to break up Standard Oil, which was misusing its market power in the oil refinery sector. With divesture written into the market power abuse statutes, the boards of big businesses will think more than twice before proceeding to misuse their market power against competitors. I am thankful for the support that Senator Canavan gave me when I introduced a bill to this effect several years ago. It didn't have much support from the major parties, but Senator Canavan, in a very sensible, erudite additional comment to that report, supported the bill for the reasons that I've outlined.


In relation to the position the Australian Greens have negotiated, I want to say at the outset that I do have enormous regard for Senator Whish-Wilson and the work that he has done and I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to speak to Senator Whish-Wilson previously. But I am disappointed that there weren't further amendments in relation to divesture, that there weren't further amendments in relation to abuses of market power, but also in relation to access to justice, which I think is very important. But I'm hoping that there will be another opportunity, sooner rather than later, to do that. I think there has been an opportunity lost here. I say that respectfully but with a great sense of disappointment because I think Senator Whish-Wilson and I share similar concerns about small and medium businesses being given a fair go in this country.


In relation to the amendments circulated by Senator Whish-Wilson on behalf of the Greens, this amendment relates to the government's proposal to repeal part XIB of the Competition and Consumer Act. The amendment will retain the existing enforcement powers that relate to the telecommunications industry. It is something I've raised on more than one occasion with the chairman of the ACCC, Mr Rod Sims. The repeal of part XIB was the subject of criticism of various telecommunications companies. While Telstra agreed with the proposal that part XIB provisions were are no longer necessary or appropriate given the amendments to section 46, Vodafone—VHA—expressed strong opposition to the repeal under divisions 2 and 3 under part XIB characterising the proposed amendments as unnecessary and premature.


During Senate Estimates in March this year I asked the chairman of the ACCC, Mr Sims, about the utility of part XIB in light of the amendments being made to section 46. He said there's a particular part of XIB that was put in place when the ACCC was having a lot of issues with Telstra and that they were very strong powers in terms of its ability to issue competition notices and fine them $1 million a day. The ACCC just felt that with where the telecommunications market is now, if the current section 46 changes go through then the ACCC has got all the adequate powers. So the other things we're looking at are different sorts of issues. Mr Sims went on to state that the ACCC does not judge that there is any reason to have the industry different to other markets and state that competition in the telecommunications sector, I think it is fair to say, has a long and complicated history.


In 2010, I moved amendments to strengthen the provisions of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill. That bill set a framework for either a voluntary structural separation or compulsory functional separation of Telstra and put in place a number of safeguards with regard to access competition and consumers, something I negotiated with then Minister Conroy. The key issue with respect to whether the Senate ought to pass the amendment was whether part XIB has served its purpose or whether the existing regime should be retained to act as a strong deterrent to anti-competitive conduct in the telecommunications sector.


The last competition notice was issued in April 2006, but this does not mean that part XIB has not been playing an important role. It is my view that the ability of the ACCC to issue a competition notice has been acting as a sufficient deterrent and should continue to operate within what is a dynamic telecommunications sector—or rather, a market is the sector, but it's a dynamic market as well.


Further, the ACCC is currently conducting a market study of the communications sector. The study will allow the ACCC to consider a wide range of interrelated developments that have been raised by the industry and go to the effective functioning of the market. It will inform how the ACCC will undertake its role in parts XIB and XIC of the Competition and Consumer Act to facilitate markets that provide consumers with a choice of products at a price and quality that meet their needs and circumstances. I do not believe it is appropriate to repeal part XIB prior to this market study concluding. I will review the report once it is completed, in order to ascertain if part XIB should remain in its current form.


I can indicate that I and my colleagues will support the amendments circulated by Senator Whish-Wilson. I do have more to say, Deputy President, but my voice is giving way on me—which I'm sure is something that my colleagues are very pleased to hear! So I will try and save my voice for the committee stages of this bill.


We support the second reading of this bill. We believe it can be improved. We believe there has been an opportunity lost in terms of further reforms. In particular, in relation to the issue of the abuse of market power, the threshold for substantial listing of competition I fear will be too high. But the general principle of an effects test is a good one, and that is why we want to see this bill go through—hopefully, with amendments that will strengthen it and make it much more effective.

 (South Australia) (18:17):  Chair, I have some amendments, and I will get your guidance as to how they are to be dealt with. I think I'm the first on the circulated amendments sheet. I'm happy to deal with those as you wish. I won't be proceeding with some amendments, so I will be guided by you as to whether it's appropriate that I firstly withdraw a particular amendment that's on the running sheet. In respect of amendment (1)—and I'm not sure if there's an amended sheet to that effect, but I will be guided by you as to whether it's appropriate that the amendments are dealt with at this point in time, given the running sheet in respect of the bill.



The CHAIR:  Senator Xenophon, are you indicating that you don't want to move (1) because (2) is linked to it?




Senator XENOPHON:
  Yes, that's right. So, in terms of sheet 8139, I seek leave for what is referred to in item 1A to be withdrawn, but I seek leave still to proceed with item 1B, which is the amendment after section 80C.


Leave granted.

  I can explain this: in relation to subsection 2, that relates to 51(3) after the amendments to do with item 1A. I only want to move the amendment on the original sheet that is headed '1B After section 80AC,' which starts off with 'Insert: 80AD Divestiture where contravention of section 46' down to subclause 6. The amendment (2) on the original sheet relates directly to the amendment that I do not wish to proceed with. So, it only deals with the issue—sorry, Chair, I understand there is a fresh amendment and I apologise—



The CHAIR:  Okay, Senator Xenophon: you're amending section 1 and seeking to move that?




Senator XENOPHON:
  It's on sheet 8139, revised and hot off the presses. While that is being circulated, can I just indicate that the reason I'm not proceeding with that earlier amendment is that it was drafted at a time when there was a damage-to-competitors clause considered by the Harper review. It's no longer necessary, particularly with the rewording of the legislation—



The CHAIR:  Senator Xenophon, with regard to your voice, you've sought leave on that and leave was granted so I think it's understood. So it's probably best if you save your voice for the things you really want to move!

The CHAIR:  What you are seeking to do is to move No. (1) on sheet 8139 as revised?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (18:22):  The government will not be supporting this amendment. The Harper review, like the Dawson and Harmer reviews before it, considered and recommended against establishing divestiture as a remedy to address misuse of market power concerns. At these reviews, each concluded that the existing range of available remedies is sufficient to deter misusers of market power and to compensate parties harmed by such conduct. Divestiture is not appropriate for breaches or misuse of market power as it would not target the conduct of concern.


But divestiture is currently available as a remedy for mergers and acquisitions which breach the Competition and Consumer Act. This is appropriate because the remedy directly targets and unwinds the transaction which breached the act. This would not be the case for section 46, where divestiture would at best be a blunt weapon which would not directly address the conduct of concern. The courts would then need to engage in the difficult task of restructuring what may be a highly-integrated firm to achieve this reduction in size. Moreover, there would be a high risk of unintended consequences—for example, a business or parts of it becoming uncompetitive or even unviable, which would be detrimental to consumer welfare.


As I've indicated in various reviews in this space—most recently the Harper Review but before it the Dawson and Harmer reviews—all looked at this and all recommended against it.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (18:23):  Labor won't be supporting this part of the Nick Xenophon Team's amendment. We note that the divestiture provisions are an extension of comments Senator Xenophon has made in the past.


The potential for repeat offenders of anticompetitive conduct is certainly a concern Labor shares. Labor has a proposed reformulation of how base penalties under the Competition and Consumer Act are calculated. We took that to the last election and we have recommitted ourselves to it.


Labor has proposed that Australia adopt a European Union-type penalty system for anticompetitive conduct, which is based on 30 per cent of the annual sales of the relevant product or service multiplied by the number of years the infringement took place, capped at 10 per cent of annual turnover. This would have both a punitive effect on culprits and a disincentive effect on potential culprits. We also note that this is a considerable departure from the status of the Competition and Consumer Act and that the amendment itself would warrant further scrutiny. A divestiture power that judges may apply would be a change to Australian competition laws on a large scale. As such, the measure itself would need to be considered on its own merits rather than in tandem with the proposed effects test. Normally a measure of this scale would be better suited to an in-depth inquiry conducted by a body such as the Productivity Commission. Further to that, drafting would require extensive consultation with extensive stakeholder collaboration. We won't be supporting this section of Senator Xenophon's amendment tonight.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (18:25):  I would like to start by noting Senator Xenophon's been nothing if not consistent on this over a long period of time. The Australian Greens would certainly like to continue the conversation on this with Senator Xenophon. The proposal in the amendment, which allows courts to make divestiture orders and enables courts to break up serious or repeat big business offenders, is an appealing one. I know the Harper Review didn't recommend it and instead suggested the power reside with parliament, but I would like to note that this is a very significant change in what's being proposed here tonight, and that warrants careful and stand-alone consideration, not just being a rider to this bill. This chance to change competition law, which we've got in front of us—on section 46—is critically important. Senator Xenophon, I've done a little bit of reading on the trust-busting legislation in the US. It's not used as often as people perhaps think it is, but nevertheless it's certainly something that interests me, and I would say to you tonight we will keep an open mind on it if it can be brought to this place with separate legislation.


As it is before us tonight, I'm not going to mince my words. If supporting this risks the other legislation going down—and the government said clearly tonight that they won't support it—then we won't be in a position to support this tonight. We would recommend that you bring this back to the Senate in the form of a private member's bill, and we'll give it due consideration.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:27):  Can I just thank my colleagues from the government, the opposition and the Australian Greens for at least stating their position on this. I won't be seeking to divide on this. I understand where the numbers lie on this. But I will just make this point to Senator Cormann, respectfully. The fact that we have a merger and acquisitions power that allows for divestiture within the mergers and acquisitions context indicates that the power does exist and the concept of divestiture is not a novel one in the context of competition law in this country. It's a point that can be made to the opposition and to the Australian Greens. I believe the time will come when divestiture will be seen as an appropriate last-resort remedy where divestiture doesn't mean the whole company is broken up. It could be that, in one state or one marketplace where a company has behaved particularly egregiously and abused its market power, the court should have the right to say, 'You will be broken up in that particular market.' That to me is in some respects more targeted and more nuanced, in a sense, than having an approach where it's just an across-the-board 30 per cent fine or a 10 per cent fine on their turnover—which I'm not opposing from what the opposition is proposing. I think this should be in the toolkit of the courts. 


In Europe, they do have divestiture powers. The reason you don't hear about them is that they're not used very often. It is a last-resort power and, as Senator Whish-Wilson said, they're not used much in the US, because it does change the culture of corporations. If a corporation realises and understands that it can be broken up in whole or in part by abusing its market power, that makes a difference to the culture of that corporation and their conduct in the way they deal with smaller companies down the supply chain. That to me would have a very beneficial and powerful role in changing corporate culture in this country in terms of the abuse of market power.


I am grateful to my colleagues for having the courtesy to indicate why they don't support this. My prediction is that eventually in this place we will have a divestiture power and it will be a good thing for competition law, for the conduct of businesses in this country and for competition and the chance it will give for small businesses and medium businesses to have a level playing field against the big guys.

8 Application



The amendment of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 made by this Schedule applies in relation to actions under subsection 82(1) of that Act brought on or after 1 July 2017.


This relates to adverse costs orders. As I indicated in my second reading contribution, no matter how good a piece of legislation is—and I think it is fair to say that this has good elements, but I believe it should have gone further. Notwithstanding that, we need an ability to have real access to justice for competition law in this country. As I indicated previously, there are many businesses who get advice from their lawyer saying there has been an abuse of market power—predatory pricing or whatever the breach may be—but the lawyer then advises their client, 'By the way, if you want to take this to court, you'll be spending a couple of million dollars and you might be up for an adverse cost order in the millions of dollars.' An adverse cost order could be $5 million, $10 million or $15 million, depending on the complexity of the case, because these can be complex matters.


What I have done here is to move amendments that—and I make no apology for this—are effectively lifted from the amendments that Senator Gallagher moved in her bill, a very good piece of legislation. I think Senator Gallagher was concerned I would be damning her with fake praise. I am praising with her real praise. There is a big difference between the two. My colleagues and I supported her bill, which I was very pleased to see pass the Senate last week as a private senator's bill, and I hope it will pass the lower house as well.


That bill sets a framework for the first time in this country to allow for real access to justice where there can be a whole range of measures: ensuring there are no adverse cost orders; having the office of the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman act as part of the framework of this; enabling applications to be made for assistance and enabling the ombudsman to give assistance in relation to cost orders. It would provide a framework, as set out effectively in Senator Gallagher's bill, as incorporated in this amendment, to ensure that, once and for all, we can proceed to test the competition laws in this country in a way that would make sure they have real teeth. That is why I think Senator Gallagher's bill is such a good bill and why it needs to be incorporated in this particular amendment, to give real teeth to these competition laws.


Mr Temporary Chair—I know this is a bit unfair on you because I know you can't interject from the chair, but your interjection would be one of hearty support, I'm sure—you and the Nationals have had a very important role in driving competition law reform in this country and you should be congratulated for it. All I am seeking to do here is to ensure that this piece of legislation works as intended. It won't work as intended unless we have real access to justice. This is what these amendments are about.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:34):  The government will not be supporting the amendment. The Senate might recall that similar amendments, if not the same amendment, was actually passed as part of a different bill so they arguably double-up what was dealt with before. We believe this is poorly thought out policy with significant implementation issues, which will not have any real practical benefits for small business. Enabling courts to grant cost waiver orders to small business at the outset of a case would raise significant practical issues. It is unclear how a court could be expected to assess the merits of a case at the start of a matter—that is, before evidence has been tested by the parties. This creates a significant risk of cost waiver orders being granted inappropriately.


The party in receipt of the no adverse costs order is incentivised to take up belligerent litigation tactics which are unhelpful for the court. This policy would also have workload implications for the Federal Court. The workload of the Federal Court would increase, as judges would be called up to make cost waiver assessments. The proposal to allow the Small Business Ombudsman to provide a professional opinion on the likelihood of a party successfully obtaining a no adverse costs order would appear to require the office to provide a form of legal advice which is not appropriate for a public statutory office of this nature.


It is not clear how a party who took up litigation on the basis of such an assessment and subsequently did not obtain an order in their favour could then withdraw from the litigation without a cost penalty. We will not be supporting these amendments.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (19:36):  Thank you very much for the call. I also acknowledge Senator Xenophon's support for Labor's small business access to justice policy and    I thank him for his support last week. We appreciate the fact that these amendments of Senator Xenophon's have been split which allowed us to support this section of his amendments whilst noting that we strongly oppose this legislation as it stands. We voted that way at the second reading stage.


We are opposed to the effects test; however, we do support the lift of Labor policy into Senator Xenophon's amendment. I agree with him that, in terms of drafting that bill and formulating our policy prior to the last election, it was really about providing real access to justice for small and medium businesses. Anyone who spends any time with small business will hear stories of reluctance to pursue anticompetitive conduct based on the uncertainty of the costs associated with pursuing that and the acknowledgement that large corporations—big business—have very deep pockets. In terms of protecting their markets, they are prepared to dig deep into those pockets to ensure that small business doesn't pursue practical access to justice. That is exactly what these amendments sought to address in last week's bill and we certainly support the amendment here tonight.


In terms of some of the comments Senator Cormann just made in criticising this, there is a public interest threshold that would be assessed against the no adverse costs order amendments as part of our legislation. It's not predetermining every case. It is looking at cases where the court has decided that there is a public interest question at stake. But, having said that, we will be voting against this bill for the reasons I have already outlined at the second reading stage. However, we are happy to support Senator Xenophon's amendment.

 (Tasmania) (19:38):  I won't speak for very long on this, because I think it's already been stated by the Labor Party—and the government to some extent—that this is a duplication, essentially, of what we considered in a private member's bill in this place only a few days ago. I understand there may be some slight differences, but this is something that Senator Xenophon has been talking about for some time. I am not sure if Labor got their idea from this but, nevertheless, I am sure you will be happy with the fact that we all agreed on a private member's bill in here that essentially does what you have been campaigning on for some time. We already voted for it. We commended the Labor Party for bringing it forward. I thank Senator Xenophon for his amendment, but we don't feel there is a need to support this tonight given we have just supported the private member's bill.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:39):  Now is the time to support this amendment. This is something that Senator Gallagher and others in the Labor Party have done a lot of good work on—




Senator Gallagher:
  You could actually amend the bill.




Senator XENOPHON:
  Here's an opportunity to amend the bill now. Here's an opportunity to progress this issue now. It is an opportunity that will make a difference to access to justice.


With respect to Senator Cormann, in terms of his comments, this is not about belligerent litigation tactics. I have a tiny law firm that knows a bit about litigation, and the biggest single impediment for small businesses to take on a big corporation is the adverse cost orders. The biggest single impediment for a small business to defend itself in a case, even where it could be meritorious in terms of their defence, is the cost orders that will crush them. Often, if there is some small element of risk, they will try and resolve the case, because the consequence of losing the case could be that their business would be destroyed or go into liquidation or that they would be personally bankrupted. The belligerent litigation tactics come from those with very deep pockets.


I have been talking about issues of access to justice for a number of years. Senator Gallagher has done terrific work on this, and none of that should be taken away from her or her colleagues who put up this bill that I am very pleased to support.


On the issue of a cost waiver, there has to be a public interest requirement. The cost waiver is one that will be used only in public interest cases. This won't open the courts to a flood of litigation, but it will open the courts to real access to justice for those who need it most. That's why I support this amendment.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:41):  I want to get it on record, in case I wasn't clear, that we support the intention of this, as we did with the private member's bill, but the difference between us and the Labor Party is that this is not the main game. The main game is amending section 46, a law that we know is unworkable in this country and that we have been campaigning to amend now for some years. That's what we have before us here in the chamber today.


The government has made it clear they won't support this. Labor wants the Greens and others to support this, because they want the bill to be torpedoed. They want this to go down. But we have campaigned long and hard to get section 46 amended. That's the main game here today. We are happy to work with Senator Xenophon or Labor on their private member's bill, and we hope the government gives that consideration when it goes to the other place, but we are here tonight to get a very important reform in place in this parliament, and that is amending section 46 of the Competition Act.

There is one amendment to this bill. It relates to schedule 2, on the telecommunications industry.


Just a little bit of background: the Competition and Consumer Act currently includes an effects test for the telecommunications industry, as well as giving the ACCC greater powers of intervention and the ability to issue competition notices against misuse of market power in the telecommunications industry. The bill before us tonight proposes to remove both these existing provisions on the grounds of duplication. Our amendment retains these powers.


Let me explain a little more about the existing provisions that are currently in place and why we wish to retain these. Division 2 of part XIB sets out the telecommunications-specific competition rule which prohibits a carrier or carriage service provider—called a CSP—from engaging in anticompetitive conduct. Essentially, this is an effects test applying only to the telecommunications market. Let's make this point very clear: we have, for all intents and purposes, an effects test in the telecommunications market right now. And let me make this point clear: stakeholders in the telecommunications industry have been knocking on our door, as I am sure they have on other senators' and MPs' doors, asking us to maintain the effects test as it stands—and I will call it an effects test—because it works for them and they have confidence in it.


My third point, to make it very clear, is that, if you support the Greens amendment tonight to retain this because you recognise that the telecommunications industry likes what's in there now and thinks it works, on principle you support an effects test—a broader effects test for other industries. Let's make that very clear.


What we have at the moment is an effects test applying only to the telecommunications market. Division 3 of part XIB grants the ACCC power to issue competition notices in respect of a contravention to the competition rule. That's called division 2. There are two types of competition notices, part A and B notices, that differ with regard to the particulars of the contravening conduct that the ACCC must include. The issuing of a competition notice requires a carrier or CSP to cease engaging in the identified anticompetitive conduct subject to high potential fines. Division 3 also allows for a person to apply to the ACCC for an order exempting specified conduct for the scope of the anticompetitive conduct provisions in division 2. Overall, by providing for the issuing of competition notices, division 3 enables the ACCC to respond quickly to anticompetitive conduct in the sector.


It is interesting to note also tonight, that Telstra is the only body that is calling for the removal of the ACCC's current intervention powers. We believe they should be retained because not only is the industry firmly of the view that they have worked and they are very confident in them but they give the ACCC the capacity to intervene early in the piece should they see potential misuse of market power. Further, given the rapidly-developing and asymmetrical nature of the telecommunications industry, the retention of the existing provisions is prudent.


I will finish by saying that I hope the Senate can support this amendment. I understand the government will be supporting our amendment tonight, and I thank them for this. I understand that Senator Xenophon will be supporting the amendment. I'm not sure about the other crossbenchers and I'm not sure of Labor's position. I'm guessing they won't be supporting this because this is an effects test—an effects test that seems to work and has the industry engaged and out there lobbying for it to be retained. I thank the government for their flexibility on this. We were working very closely with the telecommunications industry. This was a sticking point for them and for some senators in the Greens, and we thank them for keeping this in place. It's a very powerful symbol that an industry, like the telecommunications industry, believes that an effects test is effective, hence the logic for us transferring this more generally to section 46 for other industries' potential misuse of market power. It's what the ACCC have been asking for.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate) (19:55):  The government will indeed be supporting this Greens amendment. This amendment will replace schedule 2 in the bill with a new schedule. The new schedule will retain the telecommunications-specific anticompetitive conduct provisions in part XIB but stop the new broader section 46 flowing through to that part. As introduced, the bill sought to repeal the anticompetitive conduct provisions in part XIB in light of the introduction of the broader and stronger general misuse of market power law in section 46. With the strengthening of section 46, it would not have been necessary to apply part XIB because section 46 effectively supersedes the competition law rule in XIB. It would also be inappropriate for section 46 to flow through unimpeded to part XIB because of the unique and heavy-handed enforcement mechanisms in part XIB.


Competition notices, which can result in significantly higher pecuniary penalties and the reversal of the onus of proof, are designed for a completely different legal trigger. Our view is that a strengthened section 46 will be able to address any misuse of power in the telecommunication industry. In addition, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission continues to retain other targeted powers to deal with competition concerns in telecommunications. However, it has also become clear that the repeal of the part XIB rules is not supported by all senators. Given this, the government will support the alternative approach developed by the Greens. This retains the part XIB provisions but stops the new section 46 flowing through to part XIB. This approach will leave part XIB largely in place as it stands, with its own additional enforcement provisions but linked to the existing lower effects test. However, the new section 46 will not be enforceable using the disproportionate enforcement mechanism in part XIB. The amendment does not change the new section 46, which will apply to all sectors of the economy.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (19:57):  Labor will be supporting the Greens amendment despite the very ungenerous speech by Senator Whish-Wilson. Coming from a party that just reversed its position on the amendment that Senator Xenophon moved around access to justice compared to their position last week, it was very ungenerous to then stand up and start attacking Labor when we are prepared to support your amendment, Senator Whish-Wilson—despite our overall concerns about the bill as a whole, and which we remain opposed to.


To just pick up on your argument, I would pose this question. If the amendment that you are moving is accommodated in the bill that the government has introduced, and extrapolating your argument that by supporting your amendment we obviously support the effects test, then my question would be: why are you moving this amendment? If this is dealt with under the government's bill, then why the need for the specific amendment that you are moving, Senator Whish-Wilson? It is entirely reasonable for Labor to support this amendment, as you yourself have recognised. You drafted this amendment and you have done a deal with the government, which forced you to oppose the access to justice provisions that you supported last week. Be up-front about it; don't then come swinging at us when we have legitimate reasons to be supporting this amendment as it deals with safeguards in the telecommunications sector, a very specific issue, rather than the much broader application of the section 46 amendment. We are happy to support it. Our position is consistent. By doing so, by supporting it, it does not mean that we will be supporting the broader application of section 46, which we remain opposed to.

We all know why you didn't vote for section 46, a very comprehensive reform that we have been campaigning on for years. Why bring the private member's bill and waste the Senate's time and money if you thought we were going to get this amendment here tonight? I didn't hear from Senator Xenophon before tonight about his amendment on costs. If I had, we may have had a different considered position.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:47):  The Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2017 ushers in a landmark reform to competition law in Australia. It's a bill that lowers the burden of proof so the ACCC can more easily take action against companies that misuse their market power. It is the culmination of a long campaign by many people, including my predecessor, Senator Christine Milne, former Leader of the Australian Greens, who worked tirelessly to see this change come into effect. She worked with people who have been done over by big businesses that have used their sheer size to squash competition and squeeze out their supply chains. It is a bill that brings into effect a policy that the Greens took to the 2013 election and the 2016 election. We are very pleased to have been a champion for this reform in this parliament.


It was on the day that Malcolm Turnbull actually challenged former Prime Minister Tony Abbott for the Liberal leadership that we saw the Nationals cross the floor to support a Greens motion on introducing an effects test. I'm sure it was at the front of their mind when they negotiated their secret wish list to support a Turnbull government in a formal coalition. Of course, we are seeing the repercussions of that wish list play out with the marriage equality debate right now. It is interesting that what we have got is a bill that is the result of two parties—not the two major parties in this place, but the Greens and the Nationals—who have championed this reform. We know the Liberals don't like it—they don't like it because it's not something that looks after their big business mates—but we know they are forced to cop it if they are going to stay in government with the support of the National Party. Of course, it will be the Labor Party that will be alone in opposing it.


What we have got, again, is not just Coles and Woolies literally using their market power but the Coles and Woolies of politics who have joined together in so many different ways to stymie this reform. Yet, thanks to some good fortune and circumstance, we have got a very important reform going through this chamber. It's a reform that's good for small business; it's good for farmers; it's good for consumers; and it is good for the economy. It's unquestionably a progressive step forward.


Currently, if the ACCC are to take action against a company for misusing its market power, they have to prove that a company intentionally took advantage of its market power to damage a competitor. In other words, it's not just the effect of the action but the intent. Of course, when we have laws that are seeking to prove intent, we set a very high bar, one that's almost impossible to prosecute. It's been very difficult for the ACCC to take action against big business that deliberately crowds out competitors and squeezes the life out of those further down the supply chain. Under this new law, the ACCC need to take action not based on the intent of a company but when the effect of a company's conduct is to damage competition. It might intend to do it; it might not, but an effects test says that, if big business behaves badly, that is the threshold for the ACCC to step in.


Oligopolies now define modern retail. We know that. From supermarkets to the large hardware chains to whitegoods to electronics to fuel to banking, it goes on and on and on. Shopping in Australia is now a big-brand experience. We know that sometimes there are benefits to it, but often there are huge costs to the long-term health of the market and the economy. That's why we always need to be aware of the role that oligopolies are playing and to ensure that there are measures in place to restrict their power when their power is squeezing out other competitors.


I have to say that it's not every day that we see government move ahead with a policy that is in the face of such strong opposition from some of those vested interests. We've been fighting for this for a long time, and the Liberal Party and the Labor Party have refused to entertain any change through that time. But what we see now is an effects test that acknowledges that what actually happens in a market is more important than what the theory says should happen in a market. An effects test says that the result is the thing that counts most. What is the result? What is the effect of these actions?


We know that it's supported by regulators, by academics, by consumer groups and, most importantly, by those many small businesses and farmers who have experienced what it's like to be stomped on by these huge, powerful behemoths of the market. An effects test is a win for many over the powerful interests of the few. It is very, very odd that, given all of those who are lined up in support of an effects test, it is the Labor Party that is standing alone as the voice against an effects test.


The only stakeholders that we can see standing with the ALP are the Business Council. You might be confused by this alliance, but, if you scratch the surface, you find that what you're seeing is a demonstration of the huge but largely silent power of the 'Shoppies' union. It is the Shoppies union who forced Labor to vote against marriage equality for years, time and time again, and who yet may exert their influence on some members of the Labor Party. They forced Labor to engage in a debate around school funding because it stripped out the special funding deals for Catholic schools. Now we're seeing the Shoppies union forcing Labor not to vote for a progressive policy outcome because it comes at the expense of Coles and Woolies. Remember Coles and Woolies, the big businesses that helped the Shoppies union stitch up a secret deal to leave a quarter of a million people, mostly young people, their members, getting screwed over with salaries that are below the minimum wage? Coles and Woolies help deliver the Shoppies their members. And, because there are so many members, they're a very powerful factional bloc within Labor. That is why you get the Labor Party now standing in opposition to what is a very, very positive reform for the nation.


I'm very pleased to stand here today and talk about the many ways in which the Greens have helped to shape the national agenda—the bank levy, for example. We stood firm many years ago proposing a bank levy, and of course we were ridiculed, it must be said, by the government. Yet now here we are with the government introducing a bank levy, something that the Greens campaigned on for many years. We came out and spoke strongly, loudly and passionately against negative gearing, something that distorts the housing market and means that young people don't get an opportunity to buy their own home in the way that their parents and grandparents did. It's great to see the Labor Party change their position on this and adopt some changes to negative gearing. We also championed the need for a banking royal commission. We put that to the parliament. It was voted against by both Labor and Liberal, and yet now we have seen the Labor Party change their tune on that and we are pleased to see it. 


We've campaigned for so many things—medicinal cannabis, where we've seen significant reform—and now we have an effects test, this time supported by the government. We are seeing the Greens help shape both the national and economic agenda and the social and environmental agenda in this country. We are very pleased and proud to have championed this reform. I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, Senator Christine Milne, who made sure that an effects test remained a central policy position of the Australian Greens—something she took to the 2013 election and something I am proud to be able to say the Greens have helped deliver in this parliament.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-08-14,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:56):  For a supposedly liberal government, this is a shockingly bad piece of legislation. In a breathless rush to claim to be protecting consumers from wicked corporations, this bill seems to reflect a profound misunderstanding of both competition and the operation of the marketplace. The Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2016 implements some of the recommendations of the Harper review of competition policy. Specifically, the Harper review concluded that section 46 of the competition and consumer laws, dealing with the so-called misuse of market power, should be amended to 'prohibit conduct by firms with substantial market power that has the purpose or likely effect of substantially lessening competition.' In line with these recommendations, the bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to strengthen the prohibition of the purported misuse of market power and target supposedly anticompetitive conduct by corporations. 


The current provision of the act outlaws conduct that (1) is by someone with substantial market power; (2) takes advantage of that substantial market power; and (3) has the purpose of eliminating or damaging a competitor, preventing entry or deterring or preventing competitive conduct. The new provisions continue to see so-called substantial market power as a problem but change the focus of concern away from eliminating or damaging a competitor to any action which supposedly substantially lessens competition. To add insult to injury, the bill is estimated to generate additional compliance costs of $2.5 million per year over the first 10 years as businesses are expected to seek legal advice on the new law. This cost will, of course, be ultimately passed on to consumers. Not only do we get more interference in the marketplace but consumers also end up having to pay for the privilege. Simply put, the entire approach of this legislation is irredeemably flawed.


In trying to work out when a business has an anticompetitive purpose or effect, the bill deems enhancing efficiency, innovation, product quality or price competitiveness as pro-competitive factors, even though businesses do these things with a purpose of reducing competition. They want the market to themselves, and this motivation is good. What is substantial market power? This simply reflects the success of a business in meeting consumer demand. Big businesses, which this bill seems to see as a root of all uncompetitive behaviour, all began as small businesses. They got to be big by being more competitive, not less, and by satisfying their customers better than their competitors, who remain small. In the free market, if you fail to meet the needs of your customers then, however big you are, you will lose market share and eventually close the doors. So, in order to become dominant, big businesses must be doing some things pretty right.


What the authors of this bill seemingly fail to grasp is what actually causes uncompetitiveness. Uncompetitive markets, including monopolies, are, without exception, caused not by businesses, big or otherwise, but by government policies that overregulate and restrict businesses: anticompetitive labour laws, usurious taxation and restrictions on supply and international trade—the list goes on and on. All inhibit the ability of new players to set up and compete. Invariably, government restrictions and controls tend to favour large, established businesses over small business and start-ups.


Naturally any business, big or small, will and should exploit any advantage that comes its way. However, if this leads to a monopoly or duopoly, big business should not be blamed for this, as the fault lies not with them but with the government. Many in this place have complained about retail market dominance by two players, about the dominance of banking in Australia by just four major banks and about the fact that we still have only two airlines dominating domestic air travel. However, the big retailers, banks and airlines are simply the ones with enough cunning to survive in the heavily regulated, taxed and controlled market created by government policy.


The key premise behind this bill is simply wrong. It was not and should never be the responsibility of businesses to encourage competition. A business enhances efficiency, innovation, product quality or price competitiveness because it wants to beat its competition, not increase it. Instead of banning individual corporate conduct with a purpose or effect of lessening competition, if anything, the bill should make such conduct compulsory. Companies should not be blamed or punished for simply exploiting government created market distortions that limit their competitors. All businesses have a responsibility to their shareholders to maximise profits in any market situation. If the government is stupid enough to distort the marketplace with taxes, labour laws and regulations that favour a few big businesses then it is the government, not the businesses, that is to blame.


This bill would have you believe that lack of competition is the fault of big business and that government legislation is the solution. In fact, the opposite is true. The bill will do nothing to increase competition. Increased competition comes from less regulation, less taxes and less restrictive labour laws. When the government actually comes up with legislative solutions that increase competition, they will have the Liberal Democrats' outspoken and enthusiastic support. In the meantime, I will oppose this bill.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",NXT,2017-08-14,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (18:03):  I can indicate on behalf of my colleagues that we support the second reading stage of the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Bill 2017 and we're broadly supportive of this bill. It's been a long time coming, and we do actually need to have strong competition laws in place to prevent abuses of market power. Otherwise, it becomes a free-for-all. Otherwise, dominant players can squash the smaller players, and we've seen evidence of that where a small business that is trying to break into a market can be squashed as a result of predatory pricing practices of bigger operators, because they can afford to do that. That is something that this bill goes some way in addressing.


This bill is a result of the extensive work undertaken by Professor Ian Harper and the review panel. The government ought to be congratulated for undertaking this review. It was the first significant review of this type for many years, and it's a review that has been a long time coming, because of concerns that our competition laws have not been working as effectively as they can be. The practical consequences of that have been set out very eloquently by the great Australian writer Malcolm Knox, the author of the book Supermarket Monsters: The Price of Coles and Woolworths' Dominance, which was published in 2015, a couple of years ago. I commend this book to anyone who's interested in seeing the practical consequences of what happens when you have one or two businesses having an extremely large market share, because that market share brings with it enormous market power, resulting in distortions in the market and problems for smaller operators to do with that.


Now, in relation to this particular piece of legislation, I welcome it. I know that the Nationals have had a significant role in pushing for the effects test, which I think is a good test that ought to be introduced—in fact, it's been long overdue—but I believe it needs to go further. It needs to go further, because the effects test essentially cannot be triggered unless there has been a substantial lessening of competition. Those words 'substantial lessening of competition', I believe, are inherently too restrictive. I think we need to look at what the Europeans have been doing for a number of years in the way they look at competition law. They look at the impact of competition in the marketplace, which looks at it from a broader perspective rather than a very narrow test—a hurdle that I feel would be quite difficult to get over in many circumstances.


We need to see how this bill will work, but, having said that, I believe we actually need to have access to justice for this bill to effectively work. It's no good having a piece of legislation with beneficial clauses in it unless people can access those clauses. It's no good having a law in place unless you can enforce that law effectively. As it currently stands, small-to-medium businesses with clear cases of abuse of market power against them are prevented in practical terms from pursuing those claims due to the impact an adverse legal costs order would have on the business in the event their case were to fail.


A costs order is an elephant in the room that particularly prevents companies that have a good case from pursuing it further. There's one retailer in South Australia—I don't think it's necessary to identify that retailer—who has said to me that he's regularly advised by his lawyers that they actually have a good case for abuse of market power in the current provisions, but the problem is that if they lose the case they will be subject to a multimillion dollar costs order against them, in addition to the very high costs of bringing a case forward. That is a problem that does not exist in the United States or Europe, because cost orders are not made in those jurisdictions in competition matters. It's instructive that in the home of capitalism, the United States, they do not exclude small businesses from access to the protection of their competition laws. Their laws go much further to protect competition than Australian laws do now, or as proposed in this bill.


The Harper review acknowledged the problems of access to justice but offered no practical solutions to them. I note that Senator Katy Gallagher had a bill in this parliament that passed the Senate last week. When I spoke to her about this, she was concerned that I would damn her with faint praise. Well, she will be damned with faint praise. No, I will be praising her with real praise, because that is a good piece of legislation that I hope can pass through both houses of parliament. It finally tackles issues of access to justice so that you don't get these monumental cost orders against a small or medium business taking on a giant corporation. And that's why that bill is so valuable. I think that bill is so good that I've incorporated the provisions of that bill into an amendment to this bill. I understand Labor is opposed to this bill, but I would be gobsmacked if Labor would effectively oppose their own provisions of their own bill in the amendment that I propose to move that will incorporate their access to justice provisions. The government's bill, as good as it is in parts, will not be truly effective unless you tackle the issue of access to justice, and that is something that needs to be dealt with.


The other issue that this bill does not address is something that Senator Canavan has previously raised, and I appreciate his support for this issue. We need to have divestiture powers. You need that sword of Damocles hanging over companies, because it isn't enough if it's simply a monetary penalty. There's nothing like the fear of divestiture to change the culture of a corporate company that could be abusing its market power.


As it currently stands, in the rare situation where a market power abuse finding has been found by a court, the court can order the company be restrained and also impose a large financial fine against a company. And that's problematic, because no amount of restraint or fine will bring back to life the hundreds of small businesses that have been wiped out by large companies' misuse of their market power. And the perpetrators of market abuse can be so large that the fine will be considered by the offending company as simply a cost of doing business. This bill proposes positive changes to the way in which market abuse is proved but it does nothing with respect to enhancing the remedies. That is why there ought to be an ability for a court, as a last resort, to order divesture, which, like the sword of Damocles, would serve as the ultimate threat. It makes sense that a court should have a remedy in its tool kit that makes it impossible for a serious or big business offender to offend again.


The remedy of divesture has been available in the home of capitalism, the United States, for nearly 100 years. The US competition laws were born out of a community call to break up Standard Oil, which was misusing its market power in the oil refinery sector. With divesture written into the market power abuse statutes, the boards of big businesses will think more than twice before proceeding to misuse their market power against competitors. I am thankful for the support that Senator Canavan gave me when I introduced a bill to this effect several years ago. It didn't have much support from the major parties, but Senator Canavan, in a very sensible, erudite additional comment to that report, supported the bill for the reasons that I've outlined.


In relation to the position the Australian Greens have negotiated, I want to say at the outset that I do have enormous regard for Senator Whish-Wilson and the work that he has done and I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to speak to Senator Whish-Wilson previously. But I am disappointed that there weren't further amendments in relation to divesture, that there weren't further amendments in relation to abuses of market power, but also in relation to access to justice, which I think is very important. But I'm hoping that there will be another opportunity, sooner rather than later, to do that. I think there has been an opportunity lost here. I say that respectfully but with a great sense of disappointment because I think Senator Whish-Wilson and I share similar concerns about small and medium businesses being given a fair go in this country.


In relation to the amendments circulated by Senator Whish-Wilson on behalf of the Greens, this amendment relates to the government's proposal to repeal part XIB of the Competition and Consumer Act. The amendment will retain the existing enforcement powers that relate to the telecommunications industry. It is something I've raised on more than one occasion with the chairman of the ACCC, Mr Rod Sims. The repeal of part XIB was the subject of criticism of various telecommunications companies. While Telstra agreed with the proposal that part XIB provisions were are no longer necessary or appropriate given the amendments to section 46, Vodafone—VHA—expressed strong opposition to the repeal under divisions 2 and 3 under part XIB characterising the proposed amendments as unnecessary and premature.


During Senate Estimates in March this year I asked the chairman of the ACCC, Mr Sims, about the utility of part XIB in light of the amendments being made to section 46. He said there's a particular part of XIB that was put in place when the ACCC was having a lot of issues with Telstra and that they were very strong powers in terms of its ability to issue competition notices and fine them $1 million a day. The ACCC just felt that with where the telecommunications market is now, if the current section 46 changes go through then the ACCC has got all the adequate powers. So the other things we're looking at are different sorts of issues. Mr Sims went on to state that the ACCC does not judge that there is any reason to have the industry different to other markets and state that competition in the telecommunications sector, I think it is fair to say, has a long and complicated history.


In 2010, I moved amendments to strengthen the provisions of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill. That bill set a framework for either a voluntary structural separation or compulsory functional separation of Telstra and put in place a number of safeguards with regard to access competition and consumers, something I negotiated with then Minister Conroy. The key issue with respect to whether the Senate ought to pass the amendment was whether part XIB has served its purpose or whether the existing regime should be retained to act as a strong deterrent to anti-competitive conduct in the telecommunications sector.


The last competition notice was issued in April 2006, but this does not mean that part XIB has not been playing an important role. It is my view that the ability of the ACCC to issue a competition notice has been acting as a sufficient deterrent and should continue to operate within what is a dynamic telecommunications sector—or rather, a market is the sector, but it's a dynamic market as well.


Further, the ACCC is currently conducting a market study of the communications sector. The study will allow the ACCC to consider a wide range of interrelated developments that have been raised by the industry and go to the effective functioning of the market. It will inform how the ACCC will undertake its role in parts XIB and XIC of the Competition and Consumer Act to facilitate markets that provide consumers with a choice of products at a price and quality that meet their needs and circumstances. I do not believe it is appropriate to repeal part XIB prior to this market study concluding. I will review the report once it is completed, in order to ascertain if part XIB should remain in its current form.


I can indicate that I and my colleagues will support the amendments circulated by Senator Whish-Wilson. I do have more to say, Deputy President, but my voice is giving way on me—which I'm sure is something that my colleagues are very pleased to hear! So I will try and save my voice for the committee stages of this bill.


We support the second reading of this bill. We believe it can be improved. We believe there has been an opportunity lost in terms of further reforms. In particular, in relation to the issue of the abuse of market power, the threshold for substantial listing of competition I fear will be too high. But the general principle of an effects test is a good one, and that is why we want to see this bill go through—hopefully, with amendments that will strengthen it and make it much more effective.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (20:38):  Is it any wonder that this bill proposed by Minister Cash is so deficient? Her former colleague, Bruce Billson, was trousering money from the Franchise Council of Australia while he was still a member of parliament. The former coalition small business minister is the principal business lobbyist opposing the bill, using all of his experience, contacts and influence to diminish the effectiveness of this bill. Billson has asserted that he regularly updated his interests and his declarations. However, despite being in this highly compromising position, he somehow failed to disclose his position or salary at that time. It absolutely stinks. It's as rotten as it gets. Questions surrounding the influence Mr Billson had on the Turnbull government's vulnerable workers legislation abound. The Franchising Council of Australia is a powerful business lobbyist that wants the bill killed. Senator Cash and Mr Billson need to explain what conversations they or any of their staff had in relation to this bill. Mr Billson needs to explain what discussions he had with colleagues while in the parliament regarding underpayment and exploitation by franchisees. Mr Billson needs to outline what pressure he put on the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash.


The vulnerable workers legislation is weak and utterly deficient. It will not effectively hold to account businesses that are doing the wrong thing. Revelations about Bruce Billson's compromised position as head of the Franchising Council of Australia reveal why. Perhaps the government could turn its attention away from relentless ideological attacks on unions and instead canvass Mr Billson's suspicious position and dealings with the government regarding this deficient bill.


Despite the 7-Eleven scandal coming to light more than two years ago, the government delayed this bill. While there are a number of serious questions surrounding Mr Billson's compromised and covert conduct, and his influence over the bill, what remains crystal clear is that the Turnbull government doesn't take examples of systemic worker exploitation seriously. It pays lip service to the exploitation of workers, while turning all of its resources against working people and their unions.


The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill amends the Fair Work Act to increase penalties for what are described as 'serious contraventions'—conduct which is deliberate and a part of a systemic pattern of conduct by one or more persons relating to contraventions of prescribed workplace laws. I note at this point that the increase in penalties falls short of what Labor committed to at the last election. There are increased penalties for employer record-keeping failures. The bill makes franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments by their franchisees or subsidiaries where they knew, or ought reasonably to have known, of the contraventions and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them. The new responsibilities will only apply where franchisors and holding companies have a significant degree of influence or control over their business networks, and the franchisor or holding company may raise a defence of taking reasonable steps to prevent a contravention. The bill expressly prohibits employers from unreasonably requiring their employees to make payments—that is, demanding that a proportion of their wages be paid back in cash. It gives the Ombudsman and employees at SES level the power to compulsorily question persons as part of an investigation into breaches of the Fair Work Act.


The bill falls significantly short of the suite of legislative measures required to properly address the breadth of worker exploitation we have seen occurring far too frequently across the country. For example, it does nothing in relation to stopping sham contracting or phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities. It doesn't reform the Fair Work Act to strengthen protections for workers who want to exercise their workplace rights—for example, querying whether they are an employee and not an independent contractor. It doesn't make it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages, or strengthen protections for foreign workers who are exploited because of their immigration status. It doesn't address the proliferation of dodgy labour hire companies. Labor moved a private member's bill back in March 2016 and have policies which do address all of these issues. Yet the government haven't done anything at all on these matters. They like to pretend that they want to protect workers, but they don't.


This bill purports to make franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments by franchisees or subsidiaries. This is aimed at responding to the 7-Eleven scandal, but there are flaws with the new civil liability offence in this bill, which shows that the government's response is weak. The government's offence will not reverse the onus of proof, which means that it will remain very hard for workers and the Fair Work Ombudsman to successfully prosecute franchisors. Many large businesses do not use a franchise model and will therefore not be liable, and businesses that use a franchise model are likely to move out of that model or design their business relationships in order to escape prospective liability under the offence. Labor's amendments address all of these flaws. They are essential to giving this bill real teeth. The government must support them if it truly wants to stamp out underpayments across our economy.


The second area is the proper use of coercive powers for investigations into exploitation of vulnerable workers. Labor has led the government every step of the way in proposing measures to protect vulnerable workers. Labor wants the Fair Work Ombudsman to have all necessary powers to pursue unscrupulous employers who exploit their workforce. There is a clear need for the ombudsman to have the ability to use coercive questioning powers when investigating employers who underpay their workers, but, as with any coercive powers, they must be subject to an appropriate oversight and used sparingly. Labor's amendments are entirely consistent with the purpose of the new powers and with the government's stated reason for introducing them.


As drafted, the bill provides for the Fair Work Ombudsman's coercive questioning powers to be exercised in relation to any Fair Work Ombudsman investigation, which includes investigations into industrial action taken by workers and their unions. In contrast, the explanatory memorandum more narrowly describes the purpose of the coercive powers as 'strengthening the evidence-gathering powers of the Fair Work Ombudsman to ensure that the exploitation of vulnerable workers can be effectively investigated'. It's about investigating employers. The government's public statements have described the bill as introducing better investigatory powers relating to the exploitation of vulnerable workers. So both the explanatory memorandum and the government's public statements say the bill is for this purpose, but the bill is actually using a wider range of powers for wider purposes than the government has made public. There is no evidence that these new coercive powers are legitimately needed for any purpose other than gathering evidence against exploitative employers.


The ombudsman's evidence before the Senate employment committee focused on strengthening her power to conduct investigations into systemic underpayments. She specifically used 7-Eleven as an example of where the absence of coercive powers restricted her ability to properly investigate. Further, in her submission to the Senate employment committee, the Fair Work Ombudsman specifically linked these coercive questioning powers to investigations of new provisions in the bill.


There is, however, strength to the concern that, with coercive questioning powers in its arsenal, this government would direct the Fair Work Ombudsman to put more of its resources into investigating union activities. This is the lived experience with the ABCC and the ROC. The Prime Minister and Senator Abetz directed Fair Work Building and Construction on 12 November 2013 to transfer wage compliance functions to the Fair Work Ombudsman, despite legislation requiring Fair Work Building and Construction to deal with wage compliance. So there you have it, how this government operates; it doesn't care about workers being exploited. This bill will not resolve the problems. The then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and the then minister, Senator Abetz, directed the Fair Work Building and Construction not to pursue breaches of legislation against employees. That wasn't their job, according to the two ideologues and extremists when it comes to the trade union movement.


We need to limit the use of proposed coercive powers to investigations into underpayment of wages and allowances. Our position is consistent: coercive powers should be used sparingly, and only where justified. If the government does not support Labor's amendments to put in AAT oversight and require the ombudsman to only use their coercive powers for investigations into the exploitation of vulnerable workers, then they will be exposed. They will be exposed in their pretence that they care about workers in this country. They will be exposed in their attempt to have yet another agency prosecute the government's ideological crusade against working people and their unions.


This case study, taken from the Fair Work Ombudsman's submission to the Senate employment committee inquiry into this legislation, shows why Labor's amendment, extending liability to where companies use labour hire and along the supply chain, is necessary. It's also an example of the type of investigation the Fair Work Ombudsman needs coercive questioning powers for—that is, an investigation into the exploitation of workers. They said:


Over a number of years the [Fair Work Ombudsman] received intelligence that site managers employed by Baiada were actively involved in employing migrants to work excessively long hours, paying them below minimum entitlement rates in cash, and threatening workers with termination when they complained.


The Baiada Inquiry was principally concerned with identifying the nature and terms of labour procurement through the Baiada Group’s contracting networks. Understanding in detail the characteristics of the labour arrangements was critical to identifying whether the arrangements comply with the [Fair Work] Act and who may be responsible for non-compliance with workplace laws.


The [Fair Work Ombudsman] found that principal contractors in the labour supply chain were related to the directors of Baiada and were using the supply chain to avoid regulatory obligations. False records had been created and produced by the contractors in response to a [notice to produce] issued by the [Fair Work Ombudsman], and little significant or meaningful documentation was provided regarding the nature and terms of its contracting arrangements. Baiada also denied inspectors access to its three sites in [New South Wales] during the course of the Inquiry which prevented inspectors an opportunity to observe work practices or to talk to workers about work conditions, policies and procedures.


The lack of cooperation from the Baiada Group, including failure to provide accurate contact details for contractors, lengthy delays in providing requested records and not consenting to Fair Work inspectors entering worksites, along with the failure of contractors to update business registration records in contravention of the Corporations Act 2001, presented challenges in contacting directors and serving notices issued by the Fair Work inspectors under the [Fair Work] Act.


Due to the negligible records produced and the [Fair Work Ombudsman's] reliance on voluntary participation in interviews, the [Fair Work Ombudsman] was unable to effectively account for the hundreds of thousands of dollars that moved down the supply chain, conduct proper interviews with employees or compel those with information to speak with inspectors.


Despite volumes of intelligence received by the [Fair Work Ombudsman] regarding Baiada's alleged involvement, no evidence sufficient to put before the court was recovered, due to the limitations on the [Fair Work Ombudsman's] investigative powers.


That's what the Fair Work Ombudsman said.


Now, I am clearly of the view that if you really want to deal with exploitation against working people, then the situation at Baiada needs to be dealt with. This legislation does not cover that range of circumstances and will not allow the Fair Work Ombudsman to deal with it effectively. It's concentrating on the franchising area, and I would appeal to Senator Xenophon and his team to stop being a rubber stamp on this government's attacks on workers' rights and support Labor's amendments. That's what will protect workers: our amendments as they are on this bill before parliament.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (20:55):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise tonight to contribute to this debate on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017, although I must say that I am sad that it comes at the expense of watching what I understand is a fascinating episode of the Four Corners program tonight on the Greens political party. But I will look forward to downloading it later on iview and enjoying it in its full glory.


Before I turn to the main part of the bill tonight, I want to take the opportunity to respond to some of the observations that Senator Cameron made in his speech on the bill just then. I particularly want to focus on what I regard as his unfair and inappropriate attack on the character of Bruce Billson, the former minister and member in the other place, and also his implied criticism of the character of Senator Cash, the minister responsible for this legislation. It was a highly personal attack that made what I regard as very serious allegations and implications of corruption. I think he did even use the word 'corrupt' once in his speech. He certainly alleged that Mr Billson's advocacy on this bill was covert in some way, which I think is not supported by the facts.


It is certainly true that Mr Billson failed in his obligation to update his register of interests appropriately when he was a member of parliament. I take my own register of interests very seriously, as all senators and members should, and Mr Billson has apologised for what was an oversight, as he should. It's not acceptable to fail to update your register of interests. But to suggest that Mr Billson's appointment to the Franchise Council of Australia was in some way a secret flies in the face of the fact that a press release was issued, announcing his appointment to the Franchise Council of Australia. No-one was in any doubt about Mr Billson's involvement or interest in this matter, either in his final few months as a member of parliament before he retired or subsequently after his retirement from parliament and beginning his advocacy on behalf of the Franchise Council.


It was even less reasonable and even more unfair for Senator Cameron to go on to imply that Mr Billson had somehow had undue influence over the minister in the drafting of these laws. Senator Cameron has obviously missed the very strong criticism that the Franchise Council has made of the proposed laws—the very strong disappointment in these laws that the Franchise Council, along with some other business organisations, has made. There is no evidence in any way, shape or form that the minister was inappropriately or unduly influenced by the advocacy of Mr Billson. Of course, it is completely fair and appropriate for franchises or any other community organisations or business associations to have their views represented in public debate and to make the case for their point of view on the legislation, and for government to consider their point of view and, where appropriate and where the government agrees, to incorporate their point of view into the subsequent legislation. So I just want to underline what I thought was a very unfair and unjust personal attack on the minister and Mr Billson.


Senator Cameron also lamented that this bill does not reverse the onus of proof, as if that were a negative thing. I could not disagree more strongly. It is a foundational principle of the rule of law that one is innocent until proven guilty and not otherwise. As far as possible, and as often as we can, I think that principle should be upheld. If it is ever to be abridged in legislation I think it should require a very great and extraordinary justification, because it is an abrogation of the rule of law. My former employer, the Institute of Public Affairs, publishes a regular survey on the number of instances that this legal right has been overturned in the past by legislation, and it is a troublingly large number of occasions. I particularly point out that it is most often reversed in the context of workplace relations, and very often, within that context, is aimed—not exclusively, but predominantly—at employers, and I think that that is something which, as far as possible, we should strive not to do.


Turning now to the substance of the bill before us: this is yet more evidence that the Turnbull government takes very seriously the issue of exploitation of workers. Anybody who has read about or heard of or is aware of the exploitation of workers at a number of franchises—including 7-Eleven, most spectacularly, but also Muffin Break, Gloria Jean's, Subway, Caltex, Domino's and Pizza Hut—would agree that the laws which currently regulate this issue are inadequate and that they do not give sufficient capacity to the Fair Work Ombudsman, among others, to address this issue.


One thing was missing from Senator Cameron's speech—unless he made the point in his initial remarks that he was continuing tonight and I missed it, and I apologise if I have. But one thing that I didn't hear in his speech was the fact that of course this government is amending the previous government's Fair Work Act. These breaches have occurred under laws not drafted by this government; in fact, the laws were drafted over the objections of the party of which I'm a member. The laws were drafted by the former Labor government. They passed during the Rudd prime ministerial years, and were authored, I understand, by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. It is under those laws that these contraventions have taken place. Laws that were authored for Labor, and with the benefit of union assistance, have allowed these breaches to take place. So for some unions and for some Labor senators—as they have in this debate—to imply that the failure of these laws, which has occurred on our watch, is in some way the coalition's fault rather than their own, given that it was they who authored the laws, I think is a great stretch and discredits them. They would do much better to admit that the laws which they drafted were inadequate, that the powers that they gave their Fair Work Ombudsman were insufficient, that these breaches have occurred due to their laws and not anyone else's, and that this government is taking the right and appropriate steps to address their failure to draft appropriate laws to prevent these instances of abuse of workers taking place.


Workers are of course the primary victims of underpayment, and perhaps the most sympathetic victims. They deserve redress. But of course they are not the only victims. Law-abiding businesses that pay their workers a fair and appropriate rate of pay are also victims, because they have to compete against businesses that are not complying with the law and are evading their legal responsibilities, and that makes it harder for those law-abiding businesses to exist and to thrive. This bill addresses not just those abuses of workers but the associated abuse of law-abiding businesses, and I think that is one of the reasons why the bill deserves strong support.


Of course taxpayers, in a sense, are also victims of this law. When workers are underpaid, they clearly won't be paying their full rate of tax, and that is an unjust and unfair thing for all of us to bear as a community. So there are many reasons why this issue needs to be addressed, and there are many reasons why the Turnbull government is taking action to address what is an abuse of power—as we have demonstrated we are willing to do. Whether it is union bosses or employers or anyone else intimidating people and failing to comply with the law, we will take action to address those contraventions.


There are a number of key elements of this bill—in particular, the increase in the number of penalties for serious contraventions of the payment related protections in the Fair Work Act. This applies particularly when those contraventions are systematic and deliberate. This is not intending to target accidental or inadvertent contraventions. But systematic and deliberate contraventions do deserve substantially increased penalties, and there will be a tenfold increase in those penalties.


Importantly, the bill will also target and increase penalties for record-keeping failures—failures to keep appropriate records. It is not sufficient for an employer who may not have been paying their employees the correct rates of pay to plead ignorance, or to plead that they have insufficient records and that they are unable to go back and check whether their workers were paid the right amount. It is a fair and reasonable thing to ensure that employers are keeping adequate and up-to-date records of their payments to their employees, so that, if allegations of systemic underpayment are raised in the future, those allegations can be appropriately investigated and acted upon.


This bill will also outlaw the practice of cash-back and other coercive behaviour by employers, where employees may, in essence, be paid correctly but, in reality, not be paid correctly because they are forced by their employer to repay part of their wages. It seemed to me a fairly extraordinary thing that this practice was not already unlawful, but this government is addressing this issue to ensure that it is unlawful. The bill will hold franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments where they should have known about them but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them.


The bill strengthens the investigation of underpayments by giving the Fair Work Ombudsman effective evidence-gathering powers on par with ASIC and the ACCC and by outlawing the provision of false and misleading information or hindering and obstructing inspectors who carry out investigations into compliance with the Fair Work Act. It builds on a record of action by the Turnbull government to address these issues to protect other vulnerable workers, including the establishment of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce. It will boost funding to the Fair Work Ombudsman by $20 million to ensure that the regulator has the resources to investigate and prosecute employers who exploit workers.


The government established Taskforce Cadena in June 2015—a joint task force between Border Force and the Fair Work Ombudsman—to target and disrupt criminals who are organising visa fraud, illegal work, and the exploitation of foreign workers. The Senate Standing Committee on Education and Employment heard particularly disturbing evidence about these practices, and that's why the Turnbull government has taken action to address that. A valid pay slip, as a proof of paid work, will be required before a second working holiday visa will be granted to a temporary migrant worker. The bill outlaws the payments to sponsors of foreign workers through making it a criminal offence for employers and visa applicants to solicit and receive a payment in return for visa sponsorship. Finally, funding will be provided to enforcement bodies to ensure employers comply with obligations as sponsors of skilled visa holders.


I'm a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and Employment, and the committee has produced a very comprehensive and, I think, helpful report into this bill. I mention that not in any way to take credit for Senator McKenzie's excellent work as chair. As is always the case, she deserves the lion's share of the credit for a comprehensive report and for what, I thought, were some very reasonable and sensible recommendations as to how the bill could be improved to ensure that the words of the bill reflect the intention of the bill. The committee made a range of recommendations including that the government should consider amending the bill to ensure that the conduct which is being caught is the exact conduct which is intended to be caught and no greater. It does not impose unreasonable or unfair burdens on franchisors where they have a less direct relationship or less direct oversight over their franchisees.


I understand that there will be a number of amendments proposed, particularly by crossbench senators, which are in part inspired by the recommendations of the committee, that will seek to give effect to the committee's recommendations. I look forward to hearing about those amendments later on during the debate.


I'd just now like to turn briefly to some of the stories of exploitation that we've heard so far that have led the government to take this action to address this issue. I should, in particular, pay tribute to the journalists who have done an excellent job in uncovering, exposing and demonstrating the systemic nature of these underpayments. Particularly, I should note Adele Ferguson of the Fairfax papers, who has worked very hard to identify, expose, document and catalogue these abuses. It shows the very important role that investigative journalists play as part of a civil society. We cannot rely on government alone or, indeed, any other community organisation to ensure that laws are enforced and adhered to. A powerful fourth estate, if it fulfils its role, can contribute to that very successfully.


Ms Ferguson in conjunction with Mario Christodoulou exposed in a very powerful way in the Sydney Morning Herald recently, in particular detail, the systemic way in which Domino's Pizza underpaid and exploited its workers. No-one could think, having read this report, that these were accidental oversights, which I accept absolutely do occur, because complying with our industrial relations system is not a straightforward thing, particularly for small business. But for a large business or large franchise, such as Domino's, there is no excuse for not complying with the law, and exposing it being done on such a systemic basis was a great service by Ms Ferguson.


A recent report, again in The Sydney Morning Herald, by Anna Patty, catalogued just how extensive we now know the underpayment to be at 7-Eleven, in particular, noting that the compensation bill for 7-Eleven workers had climbed over $110 million. That is an extraordinary amount, which averages about $39,000 for each of the 2,832 claims made by workers who say they were underpaid. To have underpayment with that number of workers and on that scale is unconscionable and supports the action the government is taking to fix this law.


I look forward to hearing the contributions of other senators in this debate. I believe the government has struck the right balance in addressing what is clearly a demonstrated issue of concern to the community and to workers but also doing so in a way that is precise and targeted, addresses the issue at hand, and does not stray into wider issues or have unintended and inadvertent effects. So I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (21:11):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill, because the protection of vulnerable workers is something that we have been calling on this government to do for years and years. Under this government's watch, there are still scores and scores of examples of workers being exploited by their employers. There've been many high-profile cases, and we've seen in the media reports on cases like 7-Eleven and Pizza Hut happening right under the noses of those opposite.


Who would have thought that we would still be here telling these tales in 2017? What has the government been doing about it? Basically, very, very little. More than a year ago, with much fanfare, the government announced it would take action to crack down on workers' exploitation. But, despite multiple promises to deal with this urgent legislation, the Turnbull government have dithered and delayed, proving their callous disregard for workers who have been exploited.


This bill goes some way to deal with some of the exploitation issues concerning vulnerable workers across the country, but it falls significantly short. I will get to this in a moment. We know those opposite do not take workers' exploitation seriously, which is why Labor has put forward amendments to address the deficiencies with this bill.


I'll touch briefly on what this bill does. It amends the Fair Work Act to increase penalties for serious contraventions of prescribed workplace laws, increase penalties for employer record-keeping failures, and make franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments by their franchisees or subsidiaries in instances where they knew, or ought to have known, and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them—a measure that falls short. This bill also seeks to prohibit employers from demanding that a proportion of employees' wage be paid back in cash. Finally, this bill seeks to give the Fair Work Ombudsman and employees at the SES level the power to compulsorily question persons as part of their investigation into breaches of the Fair Work Act.


As I just said, this is a start, but it isn't enough. It's good to have the chance to speak on this bill tonight, because protecting workers' rights, and the government's failure to act on workers' rights, is something Labor has strongly campaigned on for a long time. The reality is that Labor has led the government every step of the way in proposing measures that will actually protect vulnerable workers. Those opposite have had to be dragged to the table to bring forward any measures to address exploitation of vulnerable workers. This legislation has been a long time coming, but unfortunately what we have before us tonight is a bill that falls short of what is actually needed. It doesn't go anywhere near far enough. The measures in this bill don't go far enough to address the extent of workers' exploitation, and we have seen, really, some terrible examples of shameful abuse of workers under this Liberal government. The bill falls short of Labor's suite of policies and legislative reforms that we announced 12 months ago, well before this out-of-touch Liberal government even thought about protecting workers. The bill as it stands doesn't even come close to the policies Labor took to the federal election last year to combat sham contractors, license labour hire companies, reform the Fair Work Act to strengthen protections for workers, and criminalise employer conduct that involves the use of coercion or threats.


The other serious shortfall of the government's bill, which really highlights their inability to address the issue of worker exploitation, is their refusal to protect penalty rates. There is absolutely nothing in this legislation for those who rely on penalty rates, who are some of the lowest-paid and most vulnerable workers in Australia. But is this really such a surprise? I don't think so. This is a Prime Minister who has thrown his support behind cuts to penalty rates at every opportunity. He owns the decision to cut penalty rates.


You have to wonder whether the Turnbull Liberal government actually cares about protecting workers at all. Instead of trying to defend everyday workers from having their wages cut, they want to give a $50 billion tax cut to big business and the banks. If this out-of-touch government really cared about protecting workers, 700,000 Australians, including 40,000 Tasmanians, would not have lost their penalty rates last month. If those opposite really cared about vulnerable workers, the threat of penalty rate cuts extending to other industries and other low-paid workers would not exist. If this government really cared about vulnerable workers, the Minister for Women, Michaelia Cash, wouldn't have thrown her full support behind the cuts to penalty rates, which will disproportionately impact on women. How out of touch can you get? Are you not moving around your electorate? Do you not listen to people to see how far the inequality in this country has actually gone? This government just doesn't get it, and I'm not sure they ever will.


During question time on 30 March this year the Prime Minister said, 'Everything we're doing is creating jobs.' I'm not sure whether he was being sarcastic or is just living in a different country, because in the last 12 months there's been more than 700,000 Australians having to hold down a second job in order to make ends meet. This is an increase of 9.2 per cent over the past six years. Employment growth has halved and remains well below trend. Full-time jobs have declined, with job creation dominated by part-time work. Underemployment is at a record high. More than 1.1 million Australians want more work but can't find it. Wage growth has fallen to new record lows. Inequality is at a 75-year high. And apprentice numbers are still spiralling downwards. There are now only 265,000 apprentices in training compared to 413,400 in September 2013.


In a media release on 1 August, Minister Cash said, 'The Turnbull government is getting on with the job of helping more young Australians into work.' Well, you aren't pulling the wool over the eyes of our minister. I mean, all you have to do is go to regional areas around this country, go to our home state of Tasmania, to know the reality about the high level of unemployment among our youth. Under this Liberal government, the economy is not working as it should. It's not working in the interests of everyday working Australians. Too many people are working harder for less. Too many people are living from pay cheque to pay cheque. Too many people have less money in their pay packet and less security in their job. Too many people are underpaid, under-represented and, in many cases, frightened of complaining. The digital divide, all the barriers to quality education, rising house prices, escalating energy prices, older workers being displaced—the list goes on and on.


But despite all of this the Prime Minister does nothing, because he leads a government which cares more about protecting the privileges of the top end of town than it does about making life easier for everyday Australians. And we've seen today in that other place that the Prime Minister's only motivation in relation to jobs is to protect his Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, to protect his own job. Any other Prime Minister would have asked their Deputy Prime Minister to step aside. That's what a leader would have done; that's what a strong leader would do.


So it doesn't matter how many times the Prime Minister tries to tell us that he's a strong leader. He's not strong at all. Perhaps he should keep telling himself—perhaps he should stand in front of the mirror and tell himself, 'I am a strong leader, I am a strong leader.' The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Barnaby Joyce: if he were the calibre of a good man, he would stand aside. He would stand aside until the issue is resolved by the High Court. But the dysfunction and the chaos within this government just rolls on and on. Really, it's like a bad soap opera; it just gets worse and worse. The characters aren't even good characters!


The Prime Minister takes every opportunity to tell Australians that he's delivering and that he's keeping his promises, but all he's achieving is absolutely nothing. The Australian community see right through him. They see the dysfunction; they see the chaos in this government. When the Deputy Prime Minister has called into question whether or not he is eligible to sit in the House of Representatives and he continues to sit there and continues to vote, then that says so much about the character, the honesty and the integrity of this government.


But tonight Labor has been and will be putting forward some relevant amendments that will try to make the most out of this bill. If you look at the facts and the figures, the Prime Minister is taking Australians nowhere, and it’s the people he's supposed to represent who have to live with the consequences of a chaotic and dysfunctional government. What is crystal clear is that the Turnbull government doesn't take workers' exploitation seriously. This government isn't interested in the wellbeing or the safety of workers; it's interested only in quick political wins.


I'm glad we're finally dealing with this bill tonight, because Labor has fairness and workers' rights at the core of our mission. It's part of our social fabric and it's part of Labor's DNA, which is in stark contrast to those on the opposite side of the chamber. We know that if the government were serious about tackling the horrendous examples of workers' exploitation then they would have taken action before the winter break like they said they would. What they have proposed in this bill is inadequate. There's a lot more work to be done, which is why Labor is moving amendments to properly address workers' exploitation. So I urge those on the other side of the chamber and on the crossbench to support our amendments.


We on this side of the chamber will continue to fight to protect vulnerable workers. We will put their interests ahead of ours—unlike the Prime Minister, who only puts his own job and the job of the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, before Australian workers.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-08-14,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (21:23):  I just had to leave my office to come into the chamber to speak on this very important piece of legislation, the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. It was disappointing, actually, to leave the television, where I was watching Four Corners—




Senator McGrath:
  Tell us more re: Four Corners!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  It was former Senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne and state MLCs in NSW and the Greens smashing Senator Rhiannon something terrible. But anyway, I've come in here on a more important issue only to find Senator Polley saying some crazy things over there, talking about penalty rates.


It was the Labor Party in government that formed Fair Work Australia. In fact, they even appointed the commissioners. They set up the whole system. They appointed the review of the penalty rates. So they set up the umpire, the umpire made a decision to shave some of those penalty rates on Sundays and public holidays and we get the blame for it. Unbelievable!


We get blamed for what they do! I mean, you're always right. Even when you're wrong, you're right! That's your system, Senator Cameron, and you go on and blame the government. Senator Polley was talking about high regional unemployment. It is quite amazing where I live. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  Senator Polley on a point of order? 




Senator Polley:
  It is in the standing orders that you should refer to senators by their title. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I believe that Senator Williams had referred to senators—but I would remind Senator Williams. Senator Polley, I'll take you at your word; however, I certainly did not hear him refer to anybody else but by their title. 




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I referred to Senator Polley. Does she have another title? If she does have, I'd be keen to learn about that. So Senator Polley takes the point of order. Regional jobs: it is quite amazing where I live that we have Bindaree Beef our local abattoir. We have plenty of young unemployed. Why don't they work at the abattoir? We rely on Brazilian and Filipino visa workers to carry out the work. Why aren't the locals working there? Would it be the fact that some of them don't want to work at an abattoir? Did some get a job there and when they rolled up they failed the grog test or the drug test? You only have to talk to many abattoir owners who rely so much on backpackers et cetera coming in to do that work. We had this big debate about the backpackers tax. We've 730,000 people unemployed in Australia, can't they pick fruit? Can't they help with the vintage in the grape season when the wine grapes are being picked? Can't they work in the abattoirs? Can't they shear sheep? Unbelievable. 


Back to the bill in front of us—this is a very important amendment. Could I commend my good friend, Adele Ferguson. My wife, Nancy, and I are very good friends with Adele and her husband, Christian, and their daughter, Emma. Adele tipped me off months before she did the Four Corners story on 7-Eleven. What a disgusting situation it was: youngsters out here on student visas. On none of those visas could they work more than 20 hours per week so 7-Eleven franchisees employed them and worked them for 40 hours a week, but at half-pay. Instead of paying them $17, $18 or $19 an hour, or whatever the rate was—perhaps more on a casual rate—they paid around $10 an hour in many cases. Then they said to those students, 'If you dob us in for underpaying you, we're gonna go to the government and we're gonna dob you in for working more than 20 hours a week, and we'll have you kicked out of the country.' What a good blackmailing system that was to use and abuse workers. I've said it a thousand times: life is about fairness. People should be treated fairly, with a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. It's been around all my life that saying. Congratulations, Adele Ferguson, for highlighting the rorting that 7-Eleven carried out in many of their franchises on many of those workers, and their absolute abuse of them.


Another very respected person in Australia, Mr Allan Fels, was appointed the adjudicator to clean this mess up. It wasn't long before millions and millions of dollars were being paid by 7-Eleven. And what did they do? They sacked Allan Fels. I wonder why? Because a decent man was doing the right thing, that's my suspicion. And so it goes on. There is not only 7-Eleven, but also Muffin Break, Gloria Jean's, Subway, Caltex, Domino's, and Pizza Hut franchises. That's just some.


I've said it before in this place: when the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which I'm part of, completes our whistleblowers inquiry and our inquiry into life insurance, I'd like to see the committee do an inquiry into franchises and the absolute abuse of their workers and the tactics they use to cheat workers. Why did 7-Eleven underpay their workers? Was it because the actual chiefs of 7-Eleven were not giving a fair deal to their franchisees? Were they forced to actually cheat to try and stay afloat? These are questions we need to have answered, and I think a parliamentary inquiry by the PJC on Corporations and Financial Services could have a good look at that and perhaps find more answers to see if we need more amendments later on. 


The conduct by certain businesses is fuelled by inadequate penalties and ineffective laws, which fail to deter lawbreaking and make worker exploitation difficult for the regulator, the Fair Work Ombudsman, to prove. Underpayment of workers is unfair for workers, but also for competing businesses who do the right thing and face higher costs because they are complying with the law. If you are a convenience store other than 7-Eleven and you're paying the correct salary or the correct rate of pay to your employees, you've got certainly an unfair competitive disadvantage to those who are cheating the system. It is so wrong. When someone abuses their power, whether it's union bosses intimidating small businesses or dodgy employers exploiting vulnerable workers, the Turnbull government will take action. I'm pleased that is exactly what we're doing here now.




Senator Cameron:
  What about crooked farmers?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Crooked farmers? Never heard of one! Senator Cameron is saying in his interjection, 'What about crooked farmers?' All the farmers I know have been the honest, hardworking people who do such a great job not only feeding all of Australia but millions of people around the world as well, and who suffer some terrible times. Luckily, with good irrigation equipment and good pumps, these days they can do well.


This bill will amend the Fair Work Act to increase penalties by 10 times for serious contraventions of payment related protections in the Fair Work Act, which will apply when contraventions are systemic and deliberate. The bill will also raise penalties for record-keeping requirements to make them consistent with penalties for underpayment of workers. The bill will outlaw cashback and other coercive behaviour by employers where employees are paid correctly but then forced by their employer to repay part of their wages. How is that for a cheating system? They say, 'The award's $20 an hour and we'll pay you $20 an hour, but here's the deal: you give us $8 an hour back for giving you a job.' What a disgusting treatment! It will hold franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments where they should have known about them but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them, as in the case of 7-Eleven and no doubt more to come. The amendments will strengthen the investigation of underpayments by giving the Fair Work Ombudsman effective evidence-gathering powers similar to that of ASIC and the ACCC and outlawing the provision of false or misleading information and the hindering and obstruction of inspectors who carry out investigations into compliance with the Fair Work Act. Those powers will be welcomed by the ombudsman and are, as I said, similar to those of ASIC and the ACCC.


A point on building on a record of protecting vulnerable workers: the bill builds on steps already taken by the government to protect vulnerable workers, including establishing the Migrant Workers' Taskforce chaired by Professor Allan Fels—a man who I have been privileged to meet on several occasions, and who is a thoroughly honest, decent man, in my opinion, who will do a great job of chairing that task force—to target employers who exploit migrant workers and to continue to monitor the progress of 7-Eleven in rectifying workers' underpayments. Hopefully, the compensation is going out to those workers with interest on top. We will be boosting funding to the Fair Work Ombudsman by $20 million to ensure that the regulator has the resources to investigate and prosecute employers who exploit workers. That is another good thing. There is no point having a good oversight cop on the beat without the funding for them to carry out their duties; they need to be resourced well. Taskforce Cadena was established in June 2015. This is a joint task force between Australian Border Force and the Fair Work Ombudsman to target and disrupt criminals organising visa fraud, illegal work and exploitation of foreign workers. Also, we are requiring a valid payslip as proof of paid work before a second working holiday visa will be granted to temporary migrant workers. The amendment outlaws payments to sponsors of foreign workers by making it a criminal offence for employers and visa applicants to solicit or receive a payment in return for visa sponsorships. That's good thing to bring the heavies down on those people who wish to cheat in that way. We are funding enforcement bodies to ensure that employers comply with their obligations as sponsors of skilled visa holders.


As I said, the first person to bring this to the public arena was Adele Ferguson, with her Four Corners story, and I commend her for her great work. It is simply wrong that employers use all sorts of bribes, threats or whatever to threaten workers for one reason other another, and then underpay them or not pay them by the award. It is disgusting, and I've known those companies that will no doubt be under the spotlight when we get this inquiry going, and I hope we do: not only 7-Eleven but Muffin Break, Gloria Jean's, Subway, Caltex, Domino's and Pizza Hut franchises.


I bet you there are more people cheating, because these students who come here, especially the students, have to work and get a job to try and make their way through tertiary studies. We know what our education system is like in Australia. One of our huge income earners for our nation is education—people coming here to get a top-quality education. Our standards are tremendous, our reputation is great, and many from overseas—India, Asia or wherever—like to come here because they can hang their hat on one thing that makes them extremely proud: 'I have got a degree from an Australian university.' Of course, many of them come from very poor families, and when they come here they work very, very hard, and they need to work hard to pay their way through university, to pay for their accommodation and meals et cetera and the cost of living, only to find that some of these franchisors are simply abusing them. So the amendments put forward in this legislation make it a criminal activity and set up a watchdog with Professor Allan Fels at the lead—as I said, a thoroughly decent man—to see these people are not cheated, they're treated with respect, they are paid the correct award wages and they can get on with their lives without having to be bribed, blackmailed or whatever into receiving pay that is simply unacceptable and, of course, well below the award.


We have an award system in this country. We have umpires that set those awards: as I said, Fair Work Australia and the Fair Work Ombudsman, who make various decisions. Of course, when they make a decision that those opposite don't like, because those opposite set the whole system up, they blame us on this side of the chamber. That's quite amazing—blaming us for their activities, for establishing the umpire. The umpire makes a decision. I've seen it all my life. I've said it before. When the umpire was put in place to work on things such as the shearing award, when they gave a pay rise, we as graziers paid the pay rise with no questions asked. But, of course, when they said, 'You can use wide combs as an option,' what did we have? We had strikes, fights and sheds black-banned by the unions. My brother Peter and I had our shed black-banned because the umpire made a decision but the Australian Workers' Union didn't like it. So this is typical: when the umpire makes a decision, if those opposite don't like it, they say, 'Let's cause havoc and strife, as we did in the shearing industry.' Luckily, since then we've never seen a dispute in the shearing industry.


Hopefully this amendment will clean this mess up in Australia—I'm confident it will. With the inquiry into this by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, we can have a good look over several months—six months or eight months; there'll be no hurry once the workload's off. We know how stressed the committees are for work at the moment. Let's look at the terms of reference. Let's have another look at the franchisors and the franchisees, how they've behaved and what pressure they're under. Is it the franchisors causing the pressure? That's one of the arguments under 7-Eleven: small profit margins and the small business battling to keep their head above water to survive financially. Look at the franchisees and their behaviour. Look at the compensation and how it's working.


It will be very good to have Allan Fels in front of the committee and ask Mr Fels some questions about how he carried out his duties at 7-Eleven, where he was going with it and why they kicked him out. That's the question I'd like to have answered, because he was brought in as a man who commands enormous respect in Australia. He was doing the right thing, serving out millions of dollars of compensation—rightfully so—to those foreign workers who were cheated, blackmailed, bribed or whatever, only to find that next thing Allan Fels was booted from his position as the independent umpire making judgements on those compensation packages.


I look forward to the ride ahead and say that, if we can see more wrongdoing in the franchise industry, hopefully the committee inquiry will bring that out. If necessary, we will come back into the chamber here and make more amendments, if we can find it out. That's what committees are there for: to find out what's wrong, to see the current laws, to recommend to the government and say, 'Hey, this needs changing; this is something you've overlooked,' and to hear those witnesses come forward.


I hope we get some of those young workers and students, many of them from India. We see them out there. They are great workers in the service stations, 7-Eleven stores, et cetera. Let's hear from them, let's hear their side of the story and let's see what else we can find out to see what else has to be done so that employers, franchisors and franchisees treat their workers properly. I've been fortunate in my life. I've been an employer and an employee. I worked as an employee as a truck driver, in small business, EMS, agricultural spraying and as a shearer. I've also been an employer in business and on the farm, so I have a good understanding of both sides. People should be treated fairly, paid at least the award and looked after—a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (21:40):  I too rise to make a contribution to the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 that's before us this evening. Before I do that, though, I want to say that I am disappointed in some of the comments that Senator Williams has made, particularly when he described Australian local workers that he says didn't want to work in the local abattoir perhaps because they were drunk or on drugs. That is an absolute slur on the character of Australian workers. In fact, the visa inquiry which I chaired—and Senator McKenzie was the deputy chair—found quite the contrary in Queensland. I am very disappointed that Senator Williams, who normally does stick up for workers in this place, would make those slurs to suggest that these local workers were too drunk or high on drugs and not wanting to work in an abattoir. That is a slur against Australian local workers. I would ask that at some point he withdraw that. 


I also want to draw Senator Williams's attention to the visa inquiry that Senator McKenzie and I did. There's no need to look at a joint inquiry. We did a Senate inquiry some two years ago that was set up under a reference that Labor put forward where we saw truly shocking exploitation of workers. I have to say that, as a longstanding trade union official before I came to the Senate, I made this remark during committee processes: I thought I had seen all the exploitation there was to see. I can certainly tell the Senate and those listening that the evidence I heard truly shocked me—Baiada, D'VineRipe, the abattoirs—it went on and on and on. And it wasn't just visa workers. We saw Australian or local workers displaced and visa workers put in their place, because they represented a cheap form of labour. It is absolutely unacceptable to what we in Australia stand for, and that is a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. 


I'm pleased that this bill is with us, but it's taken way too long and it does not go far enough. Certainly, I'm sure, that is the view of all of my Labor colleagues; it simply doesn't go far enough. We found in the Senate inquiry that I chaired that it isn't just visa workers working in a particular segment of our labour market who are exploited. I'd suggest we don't need to scratch the surface very far at all to see that there's exploitation of workers in this country across nearly all industries. Unless they are well-regulated or well-unionised, exploitation is rife. That is a sad fact for a country that at Federation set some truly groundbreaking laws and initiatives when it comes to protecting vulnerable workers or all workers. We were one of the first countries to put in place the eight-hour day. Those are traditions we ought be proud of. Certainly, in terms of protecting workers, we should continue to do that, and this bill doesn't go far enough. 


In the inquiry that we led in the Senate, we did focus particularly on visa categories which gave workers work rights. I'm not going to canvas the range of visas that do that, but all of those visas need proper regulations where the work is an incidental part of the visa, which it is for students coming here to work, or where it is someone on a 457 visa who is specifically here to work. What we heard in the committee was that the exploitation of foreign workers, and, indeed, local workers, meant that other programs we had where we particularly involved our neighbours in Timor-Leste—where those seasonal workers were invited over in a very targeted, well-protected program—tended to tail off, because foreign workers were being completely exploited. This means that employers now don't go to the trouble of setting up the seasonal worker programs that are primarily set up to enable workers from countries like Timor-Leste to come here and get that experience, to get some money to send back to their families. They were a reliable pool of workers, but those sorts of well-regulated programs are now under threat because of this open exploitation of foreign workers.


We also know that it's not just exploitation and the loss of significant wages. The underpayments at 7-Eleven are shameful, and I don't think anyone in this parliament disputes that. Millions of dollars were ripped off young workers. Imagine workers being forced to pay money back in this day and age! Employers were falsifying the wage record, and if you earned $100 for the day—although you'd have to be a very lucky 7-Eleven worker to get that much—your employer then clawed back at least half of that, and often more than that. Those workers were caught in a situation where they had to work more hours because they simply weren't earning enough, because the employer was ripping them off or was not paying them at all or was putting them on training shifts that didn't attract money. On and on and on it went.


In Queensland, the meat workers' union gave really strong evidence. There was a myth that local workers didn't want abattoir jobs, that they were simply hard to get; however, the meat workers' union went to towns, held town hall meetings, got young people to come along, got the employers from the abattoirs to come along, and they saw firsthand that in fact there was a pool of young workers. And not just young workers, but a pool of workers of all ages who really were prepared to work in an abattoir. They required some skilling and they required the vaccinations, as do foreign workers, but the employers simply didn't pick them up.


The meat workers' union didn't just leave it at this initial run-through in Queensland with employers to show that in country towns there actually were workers who wanted to do abattoir work. The union got commitments from the employers that they would take on these workers who had expressed an interest, and they went back some months later to find that only a very small proportion of those workers had been taken on. It was obvious to me, certainly, because of my former experience as a trade union official, that the competitive part of the meat industry, the abattoir industry, which is the boning room, was absolutely full of visa workers. Why? Because that is where competition is tough; that is where wages are contributing to profit levels. The more you ripped off foreign workers by paying them piece rates, which simply did not exist in the awards, or just ripped them off, then the bigger the profit margin was.


The employers tried to run this ridiculous argument that didn't hold water at all, saying how this was a particular skill area and required a certain amount of training. If that was the case, they had a supply of local workers who were ready and willing to be skilled up. But really, when it came down to it, when you took all the fluff and nonsense away from what the employers were saying, this was the area where you could really exploit foreign workers. You could pay them the award and not the enterprise agreement, because you were using a labour hire company. You could completely undercut the rates of pay and, therefore, enhance your profit. And what we know, through the meat industry, is that those workers weren't even getting the award rates of pay. You had the situation where the meat industry had negotiated enterprise agreements in consultation with the employer, the employer had agreed to pay X amount of dollars—particular rates for boners; particular rates across the rest of the abattoir—and yet in almost 100 per cent of cases we saw that the boning room in particular was the room where abattoir after abattoir—

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (20:38):  Is it any wonder that this bill proposed by Minister Cash is so deficient? Her former colleague, Bruce Billson, was trousering money from the Franchise Council of Australia while he was still a member of parliament. The former coalition small business minister is the principal business lobbyist opposing the bill, using all of his experience, contacts and influence to diminish the effectiveness of this bill. Billson has asserted that he regularly updated his interests and his declarations. However, despite being in this highly compromising position, he somehow failed to disclose his position or salary at that time. It absolutely stinks. It's as rotten as it gets. Questions surrounding the influence Mr Billson had on the Turnbull government's vulnerable workers legislation abound. The Franchising Council of Australia is a powerful business lobbyist that wants the bill killed. Senator Cash and Mr Billson need to explain what conversations they or any of their staff had in relation to this bill. Mr Billson needs to explain what discussions he had with colleagues while in the parliament regarding underpayment and exploitation by franchisees. Mr Billson needs to outline what pressure he put on the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash.


The vulnerable workers legislation is weak and utterly deficient. It will not effectively hold to account businesses that are doing the wrong thing. Revelations about Bruce Billson's compromised position as head of the Franchising Council of Australia reveal why. Perhaps the government could turn its attention away from relentless ideological attacks on unions and instead canvass Mr Billson's suspicious position and dealings with the government regarding this deficient bill.


Despite the 7-Eleven scandal coming to light more than two years ago, the government delayed this bill. While there are a number of serious questions surrounding Mr Billson's compromised and covert conduct, and his influence over the bill, what remains crystal clear is that the Turnbull government doesn't take examples of systemic worker exploitation seriously. It pays lip service to the exploitation of workers, while turning all of its resources against working people and their unions.


The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill amends the Fair Work Act to increase penalties for what are described as 'serious contraventions'—conduct which is deliberate and a part of a systemic pattern of conduct by one or more persons relating to contraventions of prescribed workplace laws. I note at this point that the increase in penalties falls short of what Labor committed to at the last election. There are increased penalties for employer record-keeping failures. The bill makes franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments by their franchisees or subsidiaries where they knew, or ought reasonably to have known, of the contraventions and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them. The new responsibilities will only apply where franchisors and holding companies have a significant degree of influence or control over their business networks, and the franchisor or holding company may raise a defence of taking reasonable steps to prevent a contravention. The bill expressly prohibits employers from unreasonably requiring their employees to make payments—that is, demanding that a proportion of their wages be paid back in cash. It gives the Ombudsman and employees at SES level the power to compulsorily question persons as part of an investigation into breaches of the Fair Work Act.


The bill falls significantly short of the suite of legislative measures required to properly address the breadth of worker exploitation we have seen occurring far too frequently across the country. For example, it does nothing in relation to stopping sham contracting or phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities. It doesn't reform the Fair Work Act to strengthen protections for workers who want to exercise their workplace rights—for example, querying whether they are an employee and not an independent contractor. It doesn't make it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages, or strengthen protections for foreign workers who are exploited because of their immigration status. It doesn't address the proliferation of dodgy labour hire companies. Labor moved a private member's bill back in March 2016 and have policies which do address all of these issues. Yet the government haven't done anything at all on these matters. They like to pretend that they want to protect workers, but they don't.


This bill purports to make franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments by franchisees or subsidiaries. This is aimed at responding to the 7-Eleven scandal, but there are flaws with the new civil liability offence in this bill, which shows that the government's response is weak. The government's offence will not reverse the onus of proof, which means that it will remain very hard for workers and the Fair Work Ombudsman to successfully prosecute franchisors. Many large businesses do not use a franchise model and will therefore not be liable, and businesses that use a franchise model are likely to move out of that model or design their business relationships in order to escape prospective liability under the offence. Labor's amendments address all of these flaws. They are essential to giving this bill real teeth. The government must support them if it truly wants to stamp out underpayments across our economy.


The second area is the proper use of coercive powers for investigations into exploitation of vulnerable workers. Labor has led the government every step of the way in proposing measures to protect vulnerable workers. Labor wants the Fair Work Ombudsman to have all necessary powers to pursue unscrupulous employers who exploit their workforce. There is a clear need for the ombudsman to have the ability to use coercive questioning powers when investigating employers who underpay their workers, but, as with any coercive powers, they must be subject to an appropriate oversight and used sparingly. Labor's amendments are entirely consistent with the purpose of the new powers and with the government's stated reason for introducing them.


As drafted, the bill provides for the Fair Work Ombudsman's coercive questioning powers to be exercised in relation to any Fair Work Ombudsman investigation, which includes investigations into industrial action taken by workers and their unions. In contrast, the explanatory memorandum more narrowly describes the purpose of the coercive powers as 'strengthening the evidence-gathering powers of the Fair Work Ombudsman to ensure that the exploitation of vulnerable workers can be effectively investigated'. It's about investigating employers. The government's public statements have described the bill as introducing better investigatory powers relating to the exploitation of vulnerable workers. So both the explanatory memorandum and the government's public statements say the bill is for this purpose, but the bill is actually using a wider range of powers for wider purposes than the government has made public. There is no evidence that these new coercive powers are legitimately needed for any purpose other than gathering evidence against exploitative employers.


The ombudsman's evidence before the Senate employment committee focused on strengthening her power to conduct investigations into systemic underpayments. She specifically used 7-Eleven as an example of where the absence of coercive powers restricted her ability to properly investigate. Further, in her submission to the Senate employment committee, the Fair Work Ombudsman specifically linked these coercive questioning powers to investigations of new provisions in the bill.


There is, however, strength to the concern that, with coercive questioning powers in its arsenal, this government would direct the Fair Work Ombudsman to put more of its resources into investigating union activities. This is the lived experience with the ABCC and the ROC. The Prime Minister and Senator Abetz directed Fair Work Building and Construction on 12 November 2013 to transfer wage compliance functions to the Fair Work Ombudsman, despite legislation requiring Fair Work Building and Construction to deal with wage compliance. So there you have it, how this government operates; it doesn't care about workers being exploited. This bill will not resolve the problems. The then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, and the then minister, Senator Abetz, directed the Fair Work Building and Construction not to pursue breaches of legislation against employees. That wasn't their job, according to the two ideologues and extremists when it comes to the trade union movement.


We need to limit the use of proposed coercive powers to investigations into underpayment of wages and allowances. Our position is consistent: coercive powers should be used sparingly, and only where justified. If the government does not support Labor's amendments to put in AAT oversight and require the ombudsman to only use their coercive powers for investigations into the exploitation of vulnerable workers, then they will be exposed. They will be exposed in their pretence that they care about workers in this country. They will be exposed in their attempt to have yet another agency prosecute the government's ideological crusade against working people and their unions.


This case study, taken from the Fair Work Ombudsman's submission to the Senate employment committee inquiry into this legislation, shows why Labor's amendment, extending liability to where companies use labour hire and along the supply chain, is necessary. It's also an example of the type of investigation the Fair Work Ombudsman needs coercive questioning powers for—that is, an investigation into the exploitation of workers. They said:


Over a number of years the [Fair Work Ombudsman] received intelligence that site managers employed by Baiada were actively involved in employing migrants to work excessively long hours, paying them below minimum entitlement rates in cash, and threatening workers with termination when they complained.


The Baiada Inquiry was principally concerned with identifying the nature and terms of labour procurement through the Baiada Group’s contracting networks. Understanding in detail the characteristics of the labour arrangements was critical to identifying whether the arrangements comply with the [Fair Work] Act and who may be responsible for non-compliance with workplace laws.


The [Fair Work Ombudsman] found that principal contractors in the labour supply chain were related to the directors of Baiada and were using the supply chain to avoid regulatory obligations. False records had been created and produced by the contractors in response to a [notice to produce] issued by the [Fair Work Ombudsman], and little significant or meaningful documentation was provided regarding the nature and terms of its contracting arrangements. Baiada also denied inspectors access to its three sites in [New South Wales] during the course of the Inquiry which prevented inspectors an opportunity to observe work practices or to talk to workers about work conditions, policies and procedures.


The lack of cooperation from the Baiada Group, including failure to provide accurate contact details for contractors, lengthy delays in providing requested records and not consenting to Fair Work inspectors entering worksites, along with the failure of contractors to update business registration records in contravention of the Corporations Act 2001, presented challenges in contacting directors and serving notices issued by the Fair Work inspectors under the [Fair Work] Act.


Due to the negligible records produced and the [Fair Work Ombudsman's] reliance on voluntary participation in interviews, the [Fair Work Ombudsman] was unable to effectively account for the hundreds of thousands of dollars that moved down the supply chain, conduct proper interviews with employees or compel those with information to speak with inspectors.


Despite volumes of intelligence received by the [Fair Work Ombudsman] regarding Baiada's alleged involvement, no evidence sufficient to put before the court was recovered, due to the limitations on the [Fair Work Ombudsman's] investigative powers.


That's what the Fair Work Ombudsman said.


Now, I am clearly of the view that if you really want to deal with exploitation against working people, then the situation at Baiada needs to be dealt with. This legislation does not cover that range of circumstances and will not allow the Fair Work Ombudsman to deal with it effectively. It's concentrating on the franchising area, and I would appeal to Senator Xenophon and his team to stop being a rubber stamp on this government's attacks on workers' rights and support Labor's amendments. That's what will protect workers: our amendments as they are on this bill before parliament.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,24,2
"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-08-14,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (20:55):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to rise tonight to contribute to this debate on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017, although I must say that I am sad that it comes at the expense of watching what I understand is a fascinating episode of the Four Corners program tonight on the Greens political party. But I will look forward to downloading it later on iview and enjoying it in its full glory.


Before I turn to the main part of the bill tonight, I want to take the opportunity to respond to some of the observations that Senator Cameron made in his speech on the bill just then. I particularly want to focus on what I regard as his unfair and inappropriate attack on the character of Bruce Billson, the former minister and member in the other place, and also his implied criticism of the character of Senator Cash, the minister responsible for this legislation. It was a highly personal attack that made what I regard as very serious allegations and implications of corruption. I think he did even use the word 'corrupt' once in his speech. He certainly alleged that Mr Billson's advocacy on this bill was covert in some way, which I think is not supported by the facts.


It is certainly true that Mr Billson failed in his obligation to update his register of interests appropriately when he was a member of parliament. I take my own register of interests very seriously, as all senators and members should, and Mr Billson has apologised for what was an oversight, as he should. It's not acceptable to fail to update your register of interests. But to suggest that Mr Billson's appointment to the Franchise Council of Australia was in some way a secret flies in the face of the fact that a press release was issued, announcing his appointment to the Franchise Council of Australia. No-one was in any doubt about Mr Billson's involvement or interest in this matter, either in his final few months as a member of parliament before he retired or subsequently after his retirement from parliament and beginning his advocacy on behalf of the Franchise Council.


It was even less reasonable and even more unfair for Senator Cameron to go on to imply that Mr Billson had somehow had undue influence over the minister in the drafting of these laws. Senator Cameron has obviously missed the very strong criticism that the Franchise Council has made of the proposed laws—the very strong disappointment in these laws that the Franchise Council, along with some other business organisations, has made. There is no evidence in any way, shape or form that the minister was inappropriately or unduly influenced by the advocacy of Mr Billson. Of course, it is completely fair and appropriate for franchises or any other community organisations or business associations to have their views represented in public debate and to make the case for their point of view on the legislation, and for government to consider their point of view and, where appropriate and where the government agrees, to incorporate their point of view into the subsequent legislation. So I just want to underline what I thought was a very unfair and unjust personal attack on the minister and Mr Billson.


Senator Cameron also lamented that this bill does not reverse the onus of proof, as if that were a negative thing. I could not disagree more strongly. It is a foundational principle of the rule of law that one is innocent until proven guilty and not otherwise. As far as possible, and as often as we can, I think that principle should be upheld. If it is ever to be abridged in legislation I think it should require a very great and extraordinary justification, because it is an abrogation of the rule of law. My former employer, the Institute of Public Affairs, publishes a regular survey on the number of instances that this legal right has been overturned in the past by legislation, and it is a troublingly large number of occasions. I particularly point out that it is most often reversed in the context of workplace relations, and very often, within that context, is aimed—not exclusively, but predominantly—at employers, and I think that that is something which, as far as possible, we should strive not to do.


Turning now to the substance of the bill before us: this is yet more evidence that the Turnbull government takes very seriously the issue of exploitation of workers. Anybody who has read about or heard of or is aware of the exploitation of workers at a number of franchises—including 7-Eleven, most spectacularly, but also Muffin Break, Gloria Jean's, Subway, Caltex, Domino's and Pizza Hut—would agree that the laws which currently regulate this issue are inadequate and that they do not give sufficient capacity to the Fair Work Ombudsman, among others, to address this issue.


One thing was missing from Senator Cameron's speech—unless he made the point in his initial remarks that he was continuing tonight and I missed it, and I apologise if I have. But one thing that I didn't hear in his speech was the fact that of course this government is amending the previous government's Fair Work Act. These breaches have occurred under laws not drafted by this government; in fact, the laws were drafted over the objections of the party of which I'm a member. The laws were drafted by the former Labor government. They passed during the Rudd prime ministerial years, and were authored, I understand, by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. It is under those laws that these contraventions have taken place. Laws that were authored for Labor, and with the benefit of union assistance, have allowed these breaches to take place. So for some unions and for some Labor senators—as they have in this debate—to imply that the failure of these laws, which has occurred on our watch, is in some way the coalition's fault rather than their own, given that it was they who authored the laws, I think is a great stretch and discredits them. They would do much better to admit that the laws which they drafted were inadequate, that the powers that they gave their Fair Work Ombudsman were insufficient, that these breaches have occurred due to their laws and not anyone else's, and that this government is taking the right and appropriate steps to address their failure to draft appropriate laws to prevent these instances of abuse of workers taking place.


Workers are of course the primary victims of underpayment, and perhaps the most sympathetic victims. They deserve redress. But of course they are not the only victims. Law-abiding businesses that pay their workers a fair and appropriate rate of pay are also victims, because they have to compete against businesses that are not complying with the law and are evading their legal responsibilities, and that makes it harder for those law-abiding businesses to exist and to thrive. This bill addresses not just those abuses of workers but the associated abuse of law-abiding businesses, and I think that is one of the reasons why the bill deserves strong support.


Of course taxpayers, in a sense, are also victims of this law. When workers are underpaid, they clearly won't be paying their full rate of tax, and that is an unjust and unfair thing for all of us to bear as a community. So there are many reasons why this issue needs to be addressed, and there are many reasons why the Turnbull government is taking action to address what is an abuse of power—as we have demonstrated we are willing to do. Whether it is union bosses or employers or anyone else intimidating people and failing to comply with the law, we will take action to address those contraventions.


There are a number of key elements of this bill—in particular, the increase in the number of penalties for serious contraventions of the payment related protections in the Fair Work Act. This applies particularly when those contraventions are systematic and deliberate. This is not intending to target accidental or inadvertent contraventions. But systematic and deliberate contraventions do deserve substantially increased penalties, and there will be a tenfold increase in those penalties.


Importantly, the bill will also target and increase penalties for record-keeping failures—failures to keep appropriate records. It is not sufficient for an employer who may not have been paying their employees the correct rates of pay to plead ignorance, or to plead that they have insufficient records and that they are unable to go back and check whether their workers were paid the right amount. It is a fair and reasonable thing to ensure that employers are keeping adequate and up-to-date records of their payments to their employees, so that, if allegations of systemic underpayment are raised in the future, those allegations can be appropriately investigated and acted upon.


This bill will also outlaw the practice of cash-back and other coercive behaviour by employers, where employees may, in essence, be paid correctly but, in reality, not be paid correctly because they are forced by their employer to repay part of their wages. It seemed to me a fairly extraordinary thing that this practice was not already unlawful, but this government is addressing this issue to ensure that it is unlawful. The bill will hold franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments where they should have known about them but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them.


The bill strengthens the investigation of underpayments by giving the Fair Work Ombudsman effective evidence-gathering powers on par with ASIC and the ACCC and by outlawing the provision of false and misleading information or hindering and obstructing inspectors who carry out investigations into compliance with the Fair Work Act. It builds on a record of action by the Turnbull government to address these issues to protect other vulnerable workers, including the establishment of the Migrant Workers' Taskforce. It will boost funding to the Fair Work Ombudsman by $20 million to ensure that the regulator has the resources to investigate and prosecute employers who exploit workers.


The government established Taskforce Cadena in June 2015—a joint task force between Border Force and the Fair Work Ombudsman—to target and disrupt criminals who are organising visa fraud, illegal work, and the exploitation of foreign workers. The Senate Standing Committee on Education and Employment heard particularly disturbing evidence about these practices, and that's why the Turnbull government has taken action to address that. A valid pay slip, as a proof of paid work, will be required before a second working holiday visa will be granted to a temporary migrant worker. The bill outlaws the payments to sponsors of foreign workers through making it a criminal offence for employers and visa applicants to solicit and receive a payment in return for visa sponsorship. Finally, funding will be provided to enforcement bodies to ensure employers comply with obligations as sponsors of skilled visa holders.


I'm a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and Employment, and the committee has produced a very comprehensive and, I think, helpful report into this bill. I mention that not in any way to take credit for Senator McKenzie's excellent work as chair. As is always the case, she deserves the lion's share of the credit for a comprehensive report and for what, I thought, were some very reasonable and sensible recommendations as to how the bill could be improved to ensure that the words of the bill reflect the intention of the bill. The committee made a range of recommendations including that the government should consider amending the bill to ensure that the conduct which is being caught is the exact conduct which is intended to be caught and no greater. It does not impose unreasonable or unfair burdens on franchisors where they have a less direct relationship or less direct oversight over their franchisees.


I understand that there will be a number of amendments proposed, particularly by crossbench senators, which are in part inspired by the recommendations of the committee, that will seek to give effect to the committee's recommendations. I look forward to hearing about those amendments later on during the debate.


I'd just now like to turn briefly to some of the stories of exploitation that we've heard so far that have led the government to take this action to address this issue. I should, in particular, pay tribute to the journalists who have done an excellent job in uncovering, exposing and demonstrating the systemic nature of these underpayments. Particularly, I should note Adele Ferguson of the Fairfax papers, who has worked very hard to identify, expose, document and catalogue these abuses. It shows the very important role that investigative journalists play as part of a civil society. We cannot rely on government alone or, indeed, any other community organisation to ensure that laws are enforced and adhered to. A powerful fourth estate, if it fulfils its role, can contribute to that very successfully.


Ms Ferguson in conjunction with Mario Christodoulou exposed in a very powerful way in the Sydney Morning Herald recently, in particular detail, the systemic way in which Domino's Pizza underpaid and exploited its workers. No-one could think, having read this report, that these were accidental oversights, which I accept absolutely do occur, because complying with our industrial relations system is not a straightforward thing, particularly for small business. But for a large business or large franchise, such as Domino's, there is no excuse for not complying with the law, and exposing it being done on such a systemic basis was a great service by Ms Ferguson.


A recent report, again in The Sydney Morning Herald, by Anna Patty, catalogued just how extensive we now know the underpayment to be at 7-Eleven, in particular, noting that the compensation bill for 7-Eleven workers had climbed over $110 million. That is an extraordinary amount, which averages about $39,000 for each of the 2,832 claims made by workers who say they were underpaid. To have underpayment with that number of workers and on that scale is unconscionable and supports the action the government is taking to fix this law.


I look forward to hearing the contributions of other senators in this debate. I believe the government has struck the right balance in addressing what is clearly a demonstrated issue of concern to the community and to workers but also doing so in a way that is precise and targeted, addresses the issue at hand, and does not stray into wider issues or have unintended and inadvertent effects. So I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (21:11):  I rise to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill, because the protection of vulnerable workers is something that we have been calling on this government to do for years and years. Under this government's watch, there are still scores and scores of examples of workers being exploited by their employers. There've been many high-profile cases, and we've seen in the media reports on cases like 7-Eleven and Pizza Hut happening right under the noses of those opposite.


Who would have thought that we would still be here telling these tales in 2017? What has the government been doing about it? Basically, very, very little. More than a year ago, with much fanfare, the government announced it would take action to crack down on workers' exploitation. But, despite multiple promises to deal with this urgent legislation, the Turnbull government have dithered and delayed, proving their callous disregard for workers who have been exploited.


This bill goes some way to deal with some of the exploitation issues concerning vulnerable workers across the country, but it falls significantly short. I will get to this in a moment. We know those opposite do not take workers' exploitation seriously, which is why Labor has put forward amendments to address the deficiencies with this bill.


I'll touch briefly on what this bill does. It amends the Fair Work Act to increase penalties for serious contraventions of prescribed workplace laws, increase penalties for employer record-keeping failures, and make franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments by their franchisees or subsidiaries in instances where they knew, or ought to have known, and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them—a measure that falls short. This bill also seeks to prohibit employers from demanding that a proportion of employees' wage be paid back in cash. Finally, this bill seeks to give the Fair Work Ombudsman and employees at the SES level the power to compulsorily question persons as part of their investigation into breaches of the Fair Work Act.


As I just said, this is a start, but it isn't enough. It's good to have the chance to speak on this bill tonight, because protecting workers' rights, and the government's failure to act on workers' rights, is something Labor has strongly campaigned on for a long time. The reality is that Labor has led the government every step of the way in proposing measures that will actually protect vulnerable workers. Those opposite have had to be dragged to the table to bring forward any measures to address exploitation of vulnerable workers. This legislation has been a long time coming, but unfortunately what we have before us tonight is a bill that falls short of what is actually needed. It doesn't go anywhere near far enough. The measures in this bill don't go far enough to address the extent of workers' exploitation, and we have seen, really, some terrible examples of shameful abuse of workers under this Liberal government. The bill falls short of Labor's suite of policies and legislative reforms that we announced 12 months ago, well before this out-of-touch Liberal government even thought about protecting workers. The bill as it stands doesn't even come close to the policies Labor took to the federal election last year to combat sham contractors, license labour hire companies, reform the Fair Work Act to strengthen protections for workers, and criminalise employer conduct that involves the use of coercion or threats.


The other serious shortfall of the government's bill, which really highlights their inability to address the issue of worker exploitation, is their refusal to protect penalty rates. There is absolutely nothing in this legislation for those who rely on penalty rates, who are some of the lowest-paid and most vulnerable workers in Australia. But is this really such a surprise? I don't think so. This is a Prime Minister who has thrown his support behind cuts to penalty rates at every opportunity. He owns the decision to cut penalty rates.


You have to wonder whether the Turnbull Liberal government actually cares about protecting workers at all. Instead of trying to defend everyday workers from having their wages cut, they want to give a $50 billion tax cut to big business and the banks. If this out-of-touch government really cared about protecting workers, 700,000 Australians, including 40,000 Tasmanians, would not have lost their penalty rates last month. If those opposite really cared about vulnerable workers, the threat of penalty rate cuts extending to other industries and other low-paid workers would not exist. If this government really cared about vulnerable workers, the Minister for Women, Michaelia Cash, wouldn't have thrown her full support behind the cuts to penalty rates, which will disproportionately impact on women. How out of touch can you get? Are you not moving around your electorate? Do you not listen to people to see how far the inequality in this country has actually gone? This government just doesn't get it, and I'm not sure they ever will.


During question time on 30 March this year the Prime Minister said, 'Everything we're doing is creating jobs.' I'm not sure whether he was being sarcastic or is just living in a different country, because in the last 12 months there's been more than 700,000 Australians having to hold down a second job in order to make ends meet. This is an increase of 9.2 per cent over the past six years. Employment growth has halved and remains well below trend. Full-time jobs have declined, with job creation dominated by part-time work. Underemployment is at a record high. More than 1.1 million Australians want more work but can't find it. Wage growth has fallen to new record lows. Inequality is at a 75-year high. And apprentice numbers are still spiralling downwards. There are now only 265,000 apprentices in training compared to 413,400 in September 2013.


In a media release on 1 August, Minister Cash said, 'The Turnbull government is getting on with the job of helping more young Australians into work.' Well, you aren't pulling the wool over the eyes of our minister. I mean, all you have to do is go to regional areas around this country, go to our home state of Tasmania, to know the reality about the high level of unemployment among our youth. Under this Liberal government, the economy is not working as it should. It's not working in the interests of everyday working Australians. Too many people are working harder for less. Too many people are living from pay cheque to pay cheque. Too many people have less money in their pay packet and less security in their job. Too many people are underpaid, under-represented and, in many cases, frightened of complaining. The digital divide, all the barriers to quality education, rising house prices, escalating energy prices, older workers being displaced—the list goes on and on.


But despite all of this the Prime Minister does nothing, because he leads a government which cares more about protecting the privileges of the top end of town than it does about making life easier for everyday Australians. And we've seen today in that other place that the Prime Minister's only motivation in relation to jobs is to protect his Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, to protect his own job. Any other Prime Minister would have asked their Deputy Prime Minister to step aside. That's what a leader would have done; that's what a strong leader would do.


So it doesn't matter how many times the Prime Minister tries to tell us that he's a strong leader. He's not strong at all. Perhaps he should keep telling himself—perhaps he should stand in front of the mirror and tell himself, 'I am a strong leader, I am a strong leader.' The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Barnaby Joyce: if he were the calibre of a good man, he would stand aside. He would stand aside until the issue is resolved by the High Court. But the dysfunction and the chaos within this government just rolls on and on. Really, it's like a bad soap opera; it just gets worse and worse. The characters aren't even good characters!


The Prime Minister takes every opportunity to tell Australians that he's delivering and that he's keeping his promises, but all he's achieving is absolutely nothing. The Australian community see right through him. They see the dysfunction; they see the chaos in this government. When the Deputy Prime Minister has called into question whether or not he is eligible to sit in the House of Representatives and he continues to sit there and continues to vote, then that says so much about the character, the honesty and the integrity of this government.


But tonight Labor has been and will be putting forward some relevant amendments that will try to make the most out of this bill. If you look at the facts and the figures, the Prime Minister is taking Australians nowhere, and it’s the people he's supposed to represent who have to live with the consequences of a chaotic and dysfunctional government. What is crystal clear is that the Turnbull government doesn't take workers' exploitation seriously. This government isn't interested in the wellbeing or the safety of workers; it's interested only in quick political wins.


I'm glad we're finally dealing with this bill tonight, because Labor has fairness and workers' rights at the core of our mission. It's part of our social fabric and it's part of Labor's DNA, which is in stark contrast to those on the opposite side of the chamber. We know that if the government were serious about tackling the horrendous examples of workers' exploitation then they would have taken action before the winter break like they said they would. What they have proposed in this bill is inadequate. There's a lot more work to be done, which is why Labor is moving amendments to properly address workers' exploitation. So I urge those on the other side of the chamber and on the crossbench to support our amendments.


We on this side of the chamber will continue to fight to protect vulnerable workers. We will put their interests ahead of ours—unlike the Prime Minister, who only puts his own job and the job of the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, before Australian workers.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-08-14,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (21:23):  I just had to leave my office to come into the chamber to speak on this very important piece of legislation, the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. It was disappointing, actually, to leave the television, where I was watching Four Corners—




Senator McGrath:
  Tell us more re: Four Corners!




Senator WILLIAMS:
  It was former Senators Bob Brown and Christine Milne and state MLCs in NSW and the Greens smashing Senator Rhiannon something terrible. But anyway, I've come in here on a more important issue only to find Senator Polley saying some crazy things over there, talking about penalty rates.


It was the Labor Party in government that formed Fair Work Australia. In fact, they even appointed the commissioners. They set up the whole system. They appointed the review of the penalty rates. So they set up the umpire, the umpire made a decision to shave some of those penalty rates on Sundays and public holidays and we get the blame for it. Unbelievable!


We get blamed for what they do! I mean, you're always right. Even when you're wrong, you're right! That's your system, Senator Cameron, and you go on and blame the government. Senator Polley was talking about high regional unemployment. It is quite amazing where I live. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  Senator Polley on a point of order? 




Senator Polley:
  It is in the standing orders that you should refer to senators by their title. 



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I believe that Senator Williams had referred to senators—but I would remind Senator Williams. Senator Polley, I'll take you at your word; however, I certainly did not hear him refer to anybody else but by their title. 




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I referred to Senator Polley. Does she have another title? If she does have, I'd be keen to learn about that. So Senator Polley takes the point of order. Regional jobs: it is quite amazing where I live that we have Bindaree Beef our local abattoir. We have plenty of young unemployed. Why don't they work at the abattoir? We rely on Brazilian and Filipino visa workers to carry out the work. Why aren't the locals working there? Would it be the fact that some of them don't want to work at an abattoir? Did some get a job there and when they rolled up they failed the grog test or the drug test? You only have to talk to many abattoir owners who rely so much on backpackers et cetera coming in to do that work. We had this big debate about the backpackers tax. We've 730,000 people unemployed in Australia, can't they pick fruit? Can't they help with the vintage in the grape season when the wine grapes are being picked? Can't they work in the abattoirs? Can't they shear sheep? Unbelievable. 


Back to the bill in front of us—this is a very important amendment. Could I commend my good friend, Adele Ferguson. My wife, Nancy, and I are very good friends with Adele and her husband, Christian, and their daughter, Emma. Adele tipped me off months before she did the Four Corners story on 7-Eleven. What a disgusting situation it was: youngsters out here on student visas. On none of those visas could they work more than 20 hours per week so 7-Eleven franchisees employed them and worked them for 40 hours a week, but at half-pay. Instead of paying them $17, $18 or $19 an hour, or whatever the rate was—perhaps more on a casual rate—they paid around $10 an hour in many cases. Then they said to those students, 'If you dob us in for underpaying you, we're gonna go to the government and we're gonna dob you in for working more than 20 hours a week, and we'll have you kicked out of the country.' What a good blackmailing system that was to use and abuse workers. I've said it a thousand times: life is about fairness. People should be treated fairly, with a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. It's been around all my life that saying. Congratulations, Adele Ferguson, for highlighting the rorting that 7-Eleven carried out in many of their franchises on many of those workers, and their absolute abuse of them.


Another very respected person in Australia, Mr Allan Fels, was appointed the adjudicator to clean this mess up. It wasn't long before millions and millions of dollars were being paid by 7-Eleven. And what did they do? They sacked Allan Fels. I wonder why? Because a decent man was doing the right thing, that's my suspicion. And so it goes on. There is not only 7-Eleven, but also Muffin Break, Gloria Jean's, Subway, Caltex, Domino's, and Pizza Hut franchises. That's just some.


I've said it before in this place: when the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, which I'm part of, completes our whistleblowers inquiry and our inquiry into life insurance, I'd like to see the committee do an inquiry into franchises and the absolute abuse of their workers and the tactics they use to cheat workers. Why did 7-Eleven underpay their workers? Was it because the actual chiefs of 7-Eleven were not giving a fair deal to their franchisees? Were they forced to actually cheat to try and stay afloat? These are questions we need to have answered, and I think a parliamentary inquiry by the PJC on Corporations and Financial Services could have a good look at that and perhaps find more answers to see if we need more amendments later on. 


The conduct by certain businesses is fuelled by inadequate penalties and ineffective laws, which fail to deter lawbreaking and make worker exploitation difficult for the regulator, the Fair Work Ombudsman, to prove. Underpayment of workers is unfair for workers, but also for competing businesses who do the right thing and face higher costs because they are complying with the law. If you are a convenience store other than 7-Eleven and you're paying the correct salary or the correct rate of pay to your employees, you've got certainly an unfair competitive disadvantage to those who are cheating the system. It is so wrong. When someone abuses their power, whether it's union bosses intimidating small businesses or dodgy employers exploiting vulnerable workers, the Turnbull government will take action. I'm pleased that is exactly what we're doing here now.




Senator Cameron:
  What about crooked farmers?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Crooked farmers? Never heard of one! Senator Cameron is saying in his interjection, 'What about crooked farmers?' All the farmers I know have been the honest, hardworking people who do such a great job not only feeding all of Australia but millions of people around the world as well, and who suffer some terrible times. Luckily, with good irrigation equipment and good pumps, these days they can do well.


This bill will amend the Fair Work Act to increase penalties by 10 times for serious contraventions of payment related protections in the Fair Work Act, which will apply when contraventions are systemic and deliberate. The bill will also raise penalties for record-keeping requirements to make them consistent with penalties for underpayment of workers. The bill will outlaw cashback and other coercive behaviour by employers where employees are paid correctly but then forced by their employer to repay part of their wages. How is that for a cheating system? They say, 'The award's $20 an hour and we'll pay you $20 an hour, but here's the deal: you give us $8 an hour back for giving you a job.' What a disgusting treatment! It will hold franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments where they should have known about them but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them, as in the case of 7-Eleven and no doubt more to come. The amendments will strengthen the investigation of underpayments by giving the Fair Work Ombudsman effective evidence-gathering powers similar to that of ASIC and the ACCC and outlawing the provision of false or misleading information and the hindering and obstruction of inspectors who carry out investigations into compliance with the Fair Work Act. Those powers will be welcomed by the ombudsman and are, as I said, similar to those of ASIC and the ACCC.


A point on building on a record of protecting vulnerable workers: the bill builds on steps already taken by the government to protect vulnerable workers, including establishing the Migrant Workers' Taskforce chaired by Professor Allan Fels—a man who I have been privileged to meet on several occasions, and who is a thoroughly honest, decent man, in my opinion, who will do a great job of chairing that task force—to target employers who exploit migrant workers and to continue to monitor the progress of 7-Eleven in rectifying workers' underpayments. Hopefully, the compensation is going out to those workers with interest on top. We will be boosting funding to the Fair Work Ombudsman by $20 million to ensure that the regulator has the resources to investigate and prosecute employers who exploit workers. That is another good thing. There is no point having a good oversight cop on the beat without the funding for them to carry out their duties; they need to be resourced well. Taskforce Cadena was established in June 2015. This is a joint task force between Australian Border Force and the Fair Work Ombudsman to target and disrupt criminals organising visa fraud, illegal work and exploitation of foreign workers. Also, we are requiring a valid payslip as proof of paid work before a second working holiday visa will be granted to temporary migrant workers. The amendment outlaws payments to sponsors of foreign workers by making it a criminal offence for employers and visa applicants to solicit or receive a payment in return for visa sponsorships. That's good thing to bring the heavies down on those people who wish to cheat in that way. We are funding enforcement bodies to ensure that employers comply with their obligations as sponsors of skilled visa holders.


As I said, the first person to bring this to the public arena was Adele Ferguson, with her Four Corners story, and I commend her for her great work. It is simply wrong that employers use all sorts of bribes, threats or whatever to threaten workers for one reason other another, and then underpay them or not pay them by the award. It is disgusting, and I've known those companies that will no doubt be under the spotlight when we get this inquiry going, and I hope we do: not only 7-Eleven but Muffin Break, Gloria Jean's, Subway, Caltex, Domino's and Pizza Hut franchises.


I bet you there are more people cheating, because these students who come here, especially the students, have to work and get a job to try and make their way through tertiary studies. We know what our education system is like in Australia. One of our huge income earners for our nation is education—people coming here to get a top-quality education. Our standards are tremendous, our reputation is great, and many from overseas—India, Asia or wherever—like to come here because they can hang their hat on one thing that makes them extremely proud: 'I have got a degree from an Australian university.' Of course, many of them come from very poor families, and when they come here they work very, very hard, and they need to work hard to pay their way through university, to pay for their accommodation and meals et cetera and the cost of living, only to find that some of these franchisors are simply abusing them. So the amendments put forward in this legislation make it a criminal activity and set up a watchdog with Professor Allan Fels at the lead—as I said, a thoroughly decent man—to see these people are not cheated, they're treated with respect, they are paid the correct award wages and they can get on with their lives without having to be bribed, blackmailed or whatever into receiving pay that is simply unacceptable and, of course, well below the award.


We have an award system in this country. We have umpires that set those awards: as I said, Fair Work Australia and the Fair Work Ombudsman, who make various decisions. Of course, when they make a decision that those opposite don't like, because those opposite set the whole system up, they blame us on this side of the chamber. That's quite amazing—blaming us for their activities, for establishing the umpire. The umpire makes a decision. I've seen it all my life. I've said it before. When the umpire was put in place to work on things such as the shearing award, when they gave a pay rise, we as graziers paid the pay rise with no questions asked. But, of course, when they said, 'You can use wide combs as an option,' what did we have? We had strikes, fights and sheds black-banned by the unions. My brother Peter and I had our shed black-banned because the umpire made a decision but the Australian Workers' Union didn't like it. So this is typical: when the umpire makes a decision, if those opposite don't like it, they say, 'Let's cause havoc and strife, as we did in the shearing industry.' Luckily, since then we've never seen a dispute in the shearing industry.


Hopefully this amendment will clean this mess up in Australia—I'm confident it will. With the inquiry into this by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, we can have a good look over several months—six months or eight months; there'll be no hurry once the workload's off. We know how stressed the committees are for work at the moment. Let's look at the terms of reference. Let's have another look at the franchisors and the franchisees, how they've behaved and what pressure they're under. Is it the franchisors causing the pressure? That's one of the arguments under 7-Eleven: small profit margins and the small business battling to keep their head above water to survive financially. Look at the franchisees and their behaviour. Look at the compensation and how it's working.


It will be very good to have Allan Fels in front of the committee and ask Mr Fels some questions about how he carried out his duties at 7-Eleven, where he was going with it and why they kicked him out. That's the question I'd like to have answered, because he was brought in as a man who commands enormous respect in Australia. He was doing the right thing, serving out millions of dollars of compensation—rightfully so—to those foreign workers who were cheated, blackmailed, bribed or whatever, only to find that next thing Allan Fels was booted from his position as the independent umpire making judgements on those compensation packages.


I look forward to the ride ahead and say that, if we can see more wrongdoing in the franchise industry, hopefully the committee inquiry will bring that out. If necessary, we will come back into the chamber here and make more amendments, if we can find it out. That's what committees are there for: to find out what's wrong, to see the current laws, to recommend to the government and say, 'Hey, this needs changing; this is something you've overlooked,' and to hear those witnesses come forward.


I hope we get some of those young workers and students, many of them from India. We see them out there. They are great workers in the service stations, 7-Eleven stores, et cetera. Let's hear from them, let's hear their side of the story and let's see what else we can find out to see what else has to be done so that employers, franchisors and franchisees treat their workers properly. I've been fortunate in my life. I've been an employer and an employee. I worked as an employee as a truck driver, in small business, EMS, agricultural spraying and as a shearer. I've also been an employer in business and on the farm, so I have a good understanding of both sides. People should be treated fairly, paid at least the award and looked after—a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia—Deputy President and Chair of Committees) (21:40):  I too rise to make a contribution to the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 that's before us this evening. Before I do that, though, I want to say that I am disappointed in some of the comments that Senator Williams has made, particularly when he described Australian local workers that he says didn't want to work in the local abattoir perhaps because they were drunk or on drugs. That is an absolute slur on the character of Australian workers. In fact, the visa inquiry which I chaired—and Senator McKenzie was the deputy chair—found quite the contrary in Queensland. I am very disappointed that Senator Williams, who normally does stick up for workers in this place, would make those slurs to suggest that these local workers were too drunk or high on drugs and not wanting to work in an abattoir. That is a slur against Australian local workers. I would ask that at some point he withdraw that. 


I also want to draw Senator Williams's attention to the visa inquiry that Senator McKenzie and I did. There's no need to look at a joint inquiry. We did a Senate inquiry some two years ago that was set up under a reference that Labor put forward where we saw truly shocking exploitation of workers. I have to say that, as a longstanding trade union official before I came to the Senate, I made this remark during committee processes: I thought I had seen all the exploitation there was to see. I can certainly tell the Senate and those listening that the evidence I heard truly shocked me—Baiada, D'VineRipe, the abattoirs—it went on and on and on. And it wasn't just visa workers. We saw Australian or local workers displaced and visa workers put in their place, because they represented a cheap form of labour. It is absolutely unacceptable to what we in Australia stand for, and that is a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. 


I'm pleased that this bill is with us, but it's taken way too long and it does not go far enough. Certainly, I'm sure, that is the view of all of my Labor colleagues; it simply doesn't go far enough. We found in the Senate inquiry that I chaired that it isn't just visa workers working in a particular segment of our labour market who are exploited. I'd suggest we don't need to scratch the surface very far at all to see that there's exploitation of workers in this country across nearly all industries. Unless they are well-regulated or well-unionised, exploitation is rife. That is a sad fact for a country that at Federation set some truly groundbreaking laws and initiatives when it comes to protecting vulnerable workers or all workers. We were one of the first countries to put in place the eight-hour day. Those are traditions we ought be proud of. Certainly, in terms of protecting workers, we should continue to do that, and this bill doesn't go far enough. 


In the inquiry that we led in the Senate, we did focus particularly on visa categories which gave workers work rights. I'm not going to canvas the range of visas that do that, but all of those visas need proper regulations where the work is an incidental part of the visa, which it is for students coming here to work, or where it is someone on a 457 visa who is specifically here to work. What we heard in the committee was that the exploitation of foreign workers, and, indeed, local workers, meant that other programs we had where we particularly involved our neighbours in Timor-Leste—where those seasonal workers were invited over in a very targeted, well-protected program—tended to tail off, because foreign workers were being completely exploited. This means that employers now don't go to the trouble of setting up the seasonal worker programs that are primarily set up to enable workers from countries like Timor-Leste to come here and get that experience, to get some money to send back to their families. They were a reliable pool of workers, but those sorts of well-regulated programs are now under threat because of this open exploitation of foreign workers.


We also know that it's not just exploitation and the loss of significant wages. The underpayments at 7-Eleven are shameful, and I don't think anyone in this parliament disputes that. Millions of dollars were ripped off young workers. Imagine workers being forced to pay money back in this day and age! Employers were falsifying the wage record, and if you earned $100 for the day—although you'd have to be a very lucky 7-Eleven worker to get that much—your employer then clawed back at least half of that, and often more than that. Those workers were caught in a situation where they had to work more hours because they simply weren't earning enough, because the employer was ripping them off or was not paying them at all or was putting them on training shifts that didn't attract money. On and on and on it went.


In Queensland, the meat workers' union gave really strong evidence. There was a myth that local workers didn't want abattoir jobs, that they were simply hard to get; however, the meat workers' union went to towns, held town hall meetings, got young people to come along, got the employers from the abattoirs to come along, and they saw firsthand that in fact there was a pool of young workers. And not just young workers, but a pool of workers of all ages who really were prepared to work in an abattoir. They required some skilling and they required the vaccinations, as do foreign workers, but the employers simply didn't pick them up.


The meat workers' union didn't just leave it at this initial run-through in Queensland with employers to show that in country towns there actually were workers who wanted to do abattoir work. The union got commitments from the employers that they would take on these workers who had expressed an interest, and they went back some months later to find that only a very small proportion of those workers had been taken on. It was obvious to me, certainly, because of my former experience as a trade union official, that the competitive part of the meat industry, the abattoir industry, which is the boning room, was absolutely full of visa workers. Why? Because that is where competition is tough; that is where wages are contributing to profit levels. The more you ripped off foreign workers by paying them piece rates, which simply did not exist in the awards, or just ripped them off, then the bigger the profit margin was.


The employers tried to run this ridiculous argument that didn't hold water at all, saying how this was a particular skill area and required a certain amount of training. If that was the case, they had a supply of local workers who were ready and willing to be skilled up. But really, when it came down to it, when you took all the fluff and nonsense away from what the employers were saying, this was the area where you could really exploit foreign workers. You could pay them the award and not the enterprise agreement, because you were using a labour hire company. You could completely undercut the rates of pay and, therefore, enhance your profit. And what we know, through the meat industry, is that those workers weren't even getting the award rates of pay. You had the situation where the meat industry had negotiated enterprise agreements in consultation with the employer, the employer had agreed to pay X amount of dollars—particular rates for boners; particular rates across the rest of the abattoir—and yet in almost 100 per cent of cases we saw that the boning room in particular was the room where abattoir after abattoir—

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2017-08-14,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (21:50):  I rise to make a contribution in adjournment about a very important issue to many South Australians and, indeed, many Australians. On 23 February 2017, the Fair Work Commission handed down a decision on penalty rates. That recommended a reduction in penalty rates for workers covered by four awards: fast food, pharmacy, retail and hospitality.


As different workers are employed at different levels under the different awards, each award has a different base rate of pay, and the impact on workers is diverse. To get a sense of the scale of the impact of the proposed cuts you need to have a look at the lowest paid casual workers covered by the retail award. They would lose $38.88 on a Sunday for an eight-hour shift. The highest paid permanent work is covered by the pharmacy award. That would be $127.09 worse off for an eight-hour shift.


While the number of people affected by the proposal is disputed, there is no dispute that the number of people affected is significant. The government is reported to believe about 285,000 people face a pay cut, while the ACTU points out that 648,000 people are covered by these relevant awards. To the extent that award conditions influence the conditions in non-government agreements, the number of people affected by the decision is likely to be even greater than the 648,000 which is quoted.


What we have here is a situation where a government, in seeking to refer to an independent umpire, has destroyed the independence of the umpire by making a continuous series of one-sided appointments. For anybody who is not familiar with the Industrial Relations Commission and its predecessors and the current Fair Work Commission, there's normally an appointment from an employer side and an employee side. This government disbanded that and made five direct appointments from one side, but it doesn't stop them saying that they still refer to the independent umpire. 


What's really worrying is that, since 2013, real wages in normal terms have been flat. That's a problem for tax collectors. That's a problem for retailers. That's a problem for lenders. That's a problem in all sectors of the economy where people are finding it really difficult to consume goods and services, invest or borrow money. It's going to come back and bite the government exactly in the wrong place: in revenue collection and economic activity.


What we have in Australia is a system where, over 100 years, workers have been able to bargain. They've been able to get reasonably progressive wages and conditions, unlike other areas of the world, like the United States. If you were to talk to an American about long service leave, they'll think you're on another planet. Long service leave does not exist to them. If you were to talk to an American about four weeks annual leave every year, they'll think you're on another planet, because they get two weeks after five years. If you talk about a leave loading payment they'll think you're on another planet, and, if you talk about a minimum rate of pay of about $17-plus an hour, they'll also think you're in some sort of alternative galaxy.


One of the things we've done really well in Australia is to share the economy around. Workers, through unions and their own efforts, have been able to bargain for respectful wages and conditions and enjoy respectable take-home wages and conditions. A flat and declining wage outcome is not good for anybody: it's not good for the government, it's not good for business and it's certainly not good for those workers who rely on those penalty rates. Increasingly, the people in retail and fast food do not enjoy a full-time job. They are casuals and students. They are people who take that opportunity to supplement their studies with a couple of days of work. I think the stats are that junior rates are about 14.8 hours per week. That's about the average that junior workers get. That's actually dropped down to 13.4 hours per week. So it's not as if these people are working 40 hours plus the weekend; it's 14 or 15 hours a week. It is barely sustainment. They're barely able to sustain themselves. The diminution of their earning capacity through a reduction in penalty rates in retail and fast food is reprehensible. It really is penny-pinching and mind-boggling that a government thinks it can actually stimulate the economy by supporting this sort of reduction in take-home pay.


If we look at the average weekly total hours worked, it was 32.1 hours per week, but it has now gone down to 31.8. So even those who have a full week's work are suffering in that there's less work available throughout the working week. I'm sure that the people who earn these sorts of salaries spend 90 per cent, if not 100 per cent, of their take-home pay. They would need to do that just to simply sustain themselves. As I've already said, a lot of these people are students, people who are trying to progress themselves through university. They are incurring a HECS debt and they are earning some money to offset the burden they may be on their parents, or whomever. It really is an absolute disgrace.


Let's have a look in the state of South Australia. There'll be contention about these figures, but we know that in the seat of Boothby there are about 7,433 retail workers who are affected and 3,789 food and accommodation workers. In a federal seat almost 10 per cent of workers—11,222—are going to be affected by this reduction in penalty rates. That's a significant issue, and I'm sure all of those workers will know who the person in that electorate is who voted in favour of not protecting their penalty rates. Nicole Flint, the member for Boothby, is on the record as saying that she is not a supporter of penalty rates and that it is a disincentive for employment. Well, there are plenty of retail workers and pharmacy workers in the seat of Boothby who will remember those comments. 


In the seat of Grey there are 6,529 retail workers and 4,303 food and accommodation workers—potentially a total of 11,482 workers affected. I know that Mr Rowan Ramsey is on the record as saying that I've distributed a DL which is a mistruth that was his characterisation of it. Look, you can argue the semantics of it, but are penalty rates going to be reduced in the seat of Grey? The answer is yes. Are they going to be reduced at Chemist Warehouse? The answer is yes. Are they going to be reduced at any of those outlets open on a Sunday? The answer is yes. Rowan and I will continue to engage right up until the next election about this issue, but, suffice to say, there is a substantial number of people who will be affected. 


In the Xenophon seat of Mayo, 6,716 retail workers will be affected and 4,005 food and accommodation workers. It is a total of 10,721 workers. So we might take the ambit of the top level of people that are going to be affected by this, but you would need a pretty precise algorithm to actually work out who isn't going to be affected. We believe broad-brush is good. If that's the number of people in that sector then, potentially, they could be affected. I would say that some of those people may be under other agreements or arrangements and others may not be, but that's the potential of it.


This government has been mean-spirited with pensioners, with young workers and with fast food, retail and pharmacy workers. It is not going to end well. This is a recipe for electoral disaster, hopefully. In all of these seats where up to 10 per cent of the most vulnerable workers are affect by this diminution in penalty rates we will use our best endeavours to make sure that they know who is responsible for this, that they know that they should be talking to their elected member of parliament, saying, 'Why aren't you resisting this? Why aren't you protecting my ability to earn a decent wage, enjoy decent conditions and go about my business in a satisfactory and sensible way?' It's particularly wrong to deny the 30 per cent of young workers who are unemployed the ability to enjoy a fruitful return for their endeavours.
