Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (11:01):  As I was saying, this is an extra tax grab of $900 million. Basically, it is the government with its hands in the pockets of Australians. This is Robin Hood in reverse. While it may be understandable to some that a government and a Treasurer that have totally lost control of their fiscal policy would be desperate to rip every dollar that they can out of the pockets of Australians, the fact that they attempt to hide it through this bill is what frustrates and angers the community and certainly leads them to not trust the duplicitous actions of this government. More than half the Gillard government's promised surplus 2012-13—and I said 'promised'—is to be achieved through the increased revenue from this bill. This is the sole purpose of the government removing this money from your accounts. This is what the government is doing.


Its addiction to spending has left it unable to balance its budget. The government will, as it has so often previously, resort to negative comparisons to somehow justify this incompetence and its wasteful spending. How often have we had to listen to the Treasurer basically gloating that Australia's debt position is not nearly as bad as that of other nations? It is an absolute nonsense argument: 'We might be in a bad way, but others are worse, so that makes it fine.' This government is saying that, although they have propelled Australia down a hole, we are not as deeply down that hole as perhaps somewhere like Greece or other at risk nations, so that should give us some comfort. That is a farce perpetrated on us all by a Labor government in a desperate state. And they are looking at walking away from that budget surplus promise—just watch this space.


Australia was in a good financial position. The previous Liberal government left the current one with a budget surplus, no net debt and billions of dollars invested in savings. The Labor government did what Labor governments do: they spent all the money and wasted so much of it. They are now gorging on debt. Through our amendments, the coalition is seeking to fix what is just the latest legislative debacle from this government. Our amendments seek to redefine the appropriate timeframes needed for fairness in this process. For example, the three-year inactivity threshold for bank accounts is far too short. I have articulated any number of reasons why your account may not have been active over that period. That definitely should be reviewed. The most appropriate period needs to be reassessed. There also needs to be a better explanation as to why the first homeowner account is included. It is just an extraordinary inclusion. Many aspiring homeowners struggle to attain that much-needed deposit. They are working so hard and we should be encouraging such people, not making it harder for them, not having them live in fear: 'If you don't make a contribution to that account, then the government will take it.'


There are also questions about the range of accounts captured by this legislation. It remains the position of the opposition that the new rules should apply only to accounts that earn very low or zero interest, typically at-call accounts.


The coalition also believe that accounts should be grouped under account holders so that if someone has one or more active accounts which are currently in use, then any inactive accounts should not be claimed by the government. They are working their accounts; it is how they are working their financial affairs. In such circumstances, the account holder is obviously known to the banking institution and their account is not lost; it is simply inactive. And that is okay and should be okay with this government. It is not okay for the government to take your funds in that instance.


The government has already acknowledged that this latest piece of legislation is flawed. I wonder why the government cannot get its work done right the first time. Why can't it do the work that is necessary to get this type of legislation right? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has put out a media statement outlining a months delay in implementing the bill, which will now come into effect on 31 May next year.


This is just another example of the government's incompetence. We also know that further delays will almost be inevitable, as the government struggles to get its act together. The government also needs to tell the House and the banking sector how these amendments will change the financial impact of the bill over the forward estimates. We need to know more about this and so do the people of Australia. Let us hope that the government actually tries to improve this legislation and bring it into this House in the form it should have brought it in in the first place.


The amendments that the coalition are proposing certainly deserve support.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (11:07):  I am pleased to speak on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Let us be clear about what this bill is about. For those listening out there in the wider Australian audience, this is about a government that is trying to legitimise the ability to put its hand in the pockets of everyday Australians and take moneys out of superannuation accounts, home saver accounts and a whole range of accounts that have been inactive for some time. As the member for Forrest just explained to us, the problem is that the government has reduced the time thresholds.


Having an inactive account is not a sin, it is not illegal and it is not wrong. There are a whole range of reasons why you might have an inactive account. But the government, because they need to prop up the bottom line, because they know that they are in financial trouble—they have this fascination with a $1.1 billion surplus, which they know is just a fantasy—but to make it look good they are rushing this legislation through the parliament today, without industry consultation and without proper scrutiny by the Senate's Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The joint committee wanted to examine this bill and it has not been given the opportunity and time to do so in any meaningful way. So it has been rushed through today because, at the MYEFO update only weeks ago, Treasurer Wayne Swan said he wanted to grab this money to prop up the government's bottom line.


This government has financial problems; it is running out of money. The fact that it is borrowing $100 million a day from China is not enough. It now wants to raid the bank accounts, the superannuation accounts and home saver accounts of ordinary Australians who are out there in the wider community. So we are going to reserve our position on this bill until the outcome of a further Senate inquiry, at a date to be announced. This is desperate legislation and it is quite unseemly that it would be in this place today. This year the amount of unclaimed money held by ASIC has risen to $677 million and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, is licking his lips in anticipation because he wants to get this money—after squandering the money he had been given through the taxation system. This bill seeks to reduce the length of time unclaimed money sits in an account before it can be transferred to government coffers. In other words, it would expedite this government getting their hands on money which Australians are entitled to. 


Imagine if we had made such a money grab. Imagine if Peter Costello had done this. You would have heard a hue and cry: 'What are you doing to the workers of Australia? What are you doing to the ordinary mums and dads of Australia? You are raiding their bank accounts. You are raiding their home saver accounts. You are raiding their superannuation accounts.' We would have been, in the words of those on the other side, the ultimate Tory thieves helping ourselves to Australians' moneys. But, as the Prime Minister says, 'This is the Labor way.' It is the Labor way today—helping themselves to this money.


This bill was introduced the last time we met—three weeks ago. It was introduced, I understand, on the Tuesday night. I happened to be on duty in the chamber on the Wednesday morning when it was brought to this House. The shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, was here ready to speak on this bill and he was furious because he had only received notification that it was coming into this House the night before. There had been no opportunity to consult with industry. Given the complexities and the significant implications associated with the bill, the coalition sought to have the bill referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. A meeting of that committee was called immediately and at that meeting it was decided that the bill should be referred to the committee for review. As I said, on the Wednesday that decision was respectfully overturned by the Speaker and it became clear that the government wanted the bill passed that week.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Canning is treading on dangerous ground here.




Mr RANDALL:
  I am just giving the history of what happened.



The SPEAKER:  No, you are giving other people's interpretation of what happened here. I suggest you exercise great caution to ensure you do not reinvent the history of this matter based on other people's interpretation of events.




Mr RANDALL:
  Thank you, Madam Speaker, but I did happen to be in the chamber at the time. I will leave it there. Given the consequences of this legislative amendment, it would have been wise for this bill to have been carefully examined before a vote was held. Given the Labor government's desperation to secure more revenue, however, I can see why such scrutiny was bypassed.


There are many Australians who would be affected by this proposed legislative amendment. An article titled 'The quest for buried treasure', written by Lesley Parker and published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 14 November, shows that the average parcel of unclaimed funds in Western Australia is the highest in the country at $791. I do not know why that is, but our state—I happen to be a member from Western Australia—seems to be leading the charge in quite a few areas. While there are many inactive accounts which have only very small amounts of unclaimed money sitting in them, there are many examples where significant sums of money rest in an account without the knowledge of the account holder. In Western Australia, for example, there is an account with an unclaimed balance of almost a million dollars. The government has decided, through this proposed legislation, that this money should be redirected to federal coffers as a matter of urgency. Anyone in this place who takes even a cursory glance at this proposal will know that it warrants further scrutiny—especially given the number of Australian account holders who will be impacted by this bill. 


Many thousands of my constituents in the Canning electorate would, because they are superannuants or self-managed superannuation fund holders, demand that parliament investigate the implications of a tier of government claiming money from Australians before we rush ahead with such a proposal. As I will come to later, this bill has unintended consequences—for example, where there is health insurance linked to a superannuation fund. This is a sadly accurate reflection of the disregard the Gillard government have for taxpayers' money. It is apparently not enough for them to recklessly waste the money which, as I said, is given to them through our taxation system and through the revenue the Commonwealth attracts; now they wish to rush through a process which will result in additional money being effectively placed in trust with the government—I emphasise the word 'trust'. It will be handed over to the government and held, but the government have a terrible track record with the responsibility of handling public funds. With the speed at which it is being rushed through the parliament, the coalition objects to this legislation.


This bill will have major implications for unclaimed bank accounts, life insurance policies, which I did not mention earlier, a range of superannuation accounts, home savers accounts and unclaimed company moneys. It seeks to allow the government to gain control of moneys in people's inactive accounts after three years. Currently it is seven years. So after three years they are coming for you. It also allows the government to gain control of workers' unclaimed superannuation money where an account has been inactive for 12 months—12 months, rather than five years. What if you have been up north on a contract and you just have not got around to tending to your self-managed superannuation fund, for example?



An opposition member:  Goneski.




Mr RANDALL:
  You return to Perth and look to get your account going again because you have come back with a pocketful of money. Sorry, it is not there. The federal government has taken your account because you have been out of circulation for 12 months. It increases the limit of lost super funds it can raid from just $200 to $2,000—in other words, a multiple of 10.


Inactive First Home Saver Accounts and life insurance funds are also under attack by the Gillard government. What about parents who establish a First Home Saver Account for their children? Have they thought of this unintended consequence? Parents with a bit of money who want to do the right thing by their young child so that they can get into the home mortgage market later in life may put it into a home saver account. Unfortunately, as things go on and bills get bigger, they may not put any money into this home saver account for their child and it may go inactive for several years because of financial circumstances. Goodness me, the government has come and got it!


What about people who travel overseas for a period of time? Dare I say, I have some missionaries in my electorate who go to Africa and other parts of the world offering their time almost free of charge. They do this for two or three years. They will come back to Australia and find that, because their account was inactive and they were working almost in a charitable fashion, not earning, they have been hit. What about soldiers sent overseas? I am not talking about soldiers in Afghanistan or on peacekeeping missions but those who go away to other areas where they might sign on for a longer period of time. When they come back after 12 months: goneski—not the Gonski that most people know but the goneski that will happen to their account.


So we can see that this bill will have major ramifications for many Australians. It is incumbent upon this parliament to rigorously explore the implications of the bill rather than rush it through both houses, as is the apparent intention of the government today. We often hear about the new era of transparency, with this 'rainbow coalition' that was cobbled together in 2010. Dare I refer to the time I sat in this chamber three weeks ago, when the member for Lyne was occupying the chair? He wanted to leave the chair because he was not happy with the bill and wanted to contribute to debate. We helped facilitate it. The Greens member for Melbourne said the Greens were not happy with this bill because it had suddenly been thrust upon them as well and they had not seen the detail. Obviously, in recent times they always protest and then eventually roll over and have their tummies scratched by this government and go along with it.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Canning!




Mr RANDALL:
  It is a good analogy. Legs in the air, getting a tummy scratch by the Prime Minister, because they fall in line with her all the time. They have never really voted against anything that would cause this government any grief.


The coalition opposes this bill because we do not want this to be added to the growing list of embarrassing examples where transparency has been discarded for political expediency. And we know what they are: the formulation of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax; and the failure of the Labor government to deliver on the single promise with the country Independents to introduce spatial accounting, to help understand federal expenditure in the regions of Australia. I will just briefly expand on that, because this is part of the transparency. With great fanfare the Independent members said that, along with Minister Crean, they would involve themselves in what is called spatial accounting, so that we could see where the money was spent in each electorate in the regions. We have asked the questions now, and they cannot do it. I think it is that they do not want to do it. And how about the bungling of the Australia Network tender; the reversal on the carbon tax floor price; and the ongoing deals with the Greens to maintain power. It is all part of a shambolic government, and this legislation is part of that.


In addition, yesterday I spoke with industry people and industry sources about this issue and they are deeply concerned about the speed with which this bill has been rushed through the parliament without proper scrutiny. One of the unintended consequences raised with me was the implication involving insurance policies associated with superannuation funds. Many Australians with superannuation accounts have health insurance policies connected their super policies. A client's ability to lodge a claim through their policy would be taken away if their account were claimed by the Commonwealth after remaining inactive for several years. The fact that it is inactive does not mean to say that the health funds still could not come out of funds that were in there. This has massive implications for many Australians, and the government should respect the fact that their suggested legislative amendments need to be adequately scrutinised to ensure their actions do not lead to negative outcomes for Australians.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:22):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The bill before the House seeks to enact various changes to unclaimed money measures, which were flagged in the government's 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.


The bill makes amendments in five areas: the Banking Act 1959; the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008; the Life Insurance Act 1995; the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001; and the Corporations Act 2001. The bill effectively brings forward the time at which money is recognised under the relevant law as lost or unclaimed, which will in turn have the effect of moving approximately $700 million into the federal government's general consolidated revenue fund for the 2012-13 financial year and beyond. Make no mistake, these bills are merely a cover-up for this disastrous Gillard Labor government. They are designed to cover up $172 billion of accumulated deficits—record deficits—with more deficits likely to come in the 2012-13 financial year and beyond.


The changes in today's bill are one of many so-called saving measures announced by the Treasurer in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. As we know, the vast majority of what the Treasurer referred to as a saving was merely taking more money away from Australian taxpayers and businesses—and taking it away sooner than the government did previously.


The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, after which stakeholders had five working days to make a submission to the committee. As Labor does with so many important pieces of legislation, similar to the rushed implementation of their Future of Financial Advice rules, they rammed their measures through parliament without any regard to the intended and unintended consequences of their legislation. In this case, for a measure to be worth potentially up to $760 million, there were only 18 days between referral to the committee and the committee's report being released. This is simply not enough time for those interested—consumers, business groups and industry associations—to consider the consequences of these changes. The coalition senators of that committee released a dissenting report which highlights many of the bill's problems. They made two recommendations: firstly, that the government withdraw the bill in order to facilitate further consultation and that the explanatory memorandum be revised to be clear about how the legislation is intended to work; secondly, if the government does not withdraw the bill—which it has not done—that the bill be amended to delay implementation until at least 31 December 2013 for Schedules 1 and 2 and that there be further delay for Schedule 4. 


More recently, the government announced just yesterday afternoon significant changes to the bill in response to many of the concerns noted by the coalition senators' dissenting report. It takes seven paragraphs into the media release of the Parliamentary Secretary for the Treasurer, the member for Oxley, for the government to admit that it is making significant changes to the original legislation and to then admit that it is changing the implementation date to 31 May 2013. What it does not say is that the original date in the legislation was 30 April 2013. So all organisations affected by this legislation will be given a total of just one extra month to implement costly reforms and introduce compliance regimes. As I have noted, the coalition believes that one month is not enough. Authorised deposit-taking institutions—ADIs—first-home saver account providers, life insurers and superannuation funds need and want at least a year. However, this Labor government does not listen to stakeholders. It pays lip service to their concerns by giving them one extra month to significantly alter system-wide processes.


This is a symptom of what the coalition has been saying all along about this legislation. The government has abused process with the manner in and timing with which this bill was introduced into parliament. Most fundamentally, the government must update the explanatory memorandum and be upfront about the impact this legislation and its subsequent changes will have over the forward estimates. The government has not yet done so. It is more interested in rushing through the legislation, making hurried changes and leaving it to the industry and consumers to worry about the consequences afterwards. This hurried process did not have to happen. From the outset, Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions told the committee that the government should delay implementation. The coalition senators noted the response of the Australian Bankers' Association, which acknowledged that:


…the proposed timing for implementation and a commencement of 31 December 2012 is unrealistic, being in less than 2 months and falling during a period when banks implement freezes on any technology or IT systems changes. It is estimated that banks and other ADIs will require at least 6 months to make all the necessary changes, inform customers in a legally compliant manner, and meet compliance requirements.


I turn now to look at the individual sections of the bill. Firstly, Schedule 1 of the bill amends section 69 of the Banking Act 1959 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions. These changes will reduce the period before an amount payable by an ADI is treated as unclaimed money from seven years to three years. The test of engagement the government has chosen in determining whether an account is to be treated as unclaimed money is whether a transaction has occurred in the account for that period of time. What is even more alarming is that until yesterday the inactivity test would have been applied at the account level, not the customer level. So we could have ended up with the situation where an active customer with a pre-existing relationship with an ADI had several accounts but might have had one account that they were not using. For that one single account, the money would have been deemed 'inactive' and transferred to consolidated revenue, despite their being an active customer. This change had potential widespread consequences for many Australians. 


As the shadow Treasurer has highlighted to the House, there might be many examples of an Australian worker who has been offered a post overseas for three years, who has money sitting in a bank account, who leaves their money in that account accumulating interest and who does not make any further deposits or withdrawals in that period. For the purposes of this bill, their deposit is treated as unclaimed funds and therefore is able to be transferred into consolidated revenue. The coalition still has deep reservations as to the potential unintended consequences that this legislation may have for many Australians with untouched funds in bank accounts.


Secondly, Schedule 2 to of this bill amends the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by first-home saver account providers. The new law amends sections 17A and 51C of the FHSA Act to change the unclaimed funds period from seven years to three years. Since the introduction of First Home Save Accounts in the 2008-09 budget, the Australian economy has continued to grapple with the effects of the global financial crisis. Many Australians may have started up a first-home saver account and then been affected by economic circumstances such as rising cost-of-living pressures, and therefore they may not have been able to make contributions. Today's bill means that some of these accounts are at risk of being claimed by the government. 


Thirdly, schedule 3 of the bill amends section 216 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 to provide for the new arrangements for unclaimed life insurance funds. Unclaimed moneys include sums payable on the maturity of a policy which are not claimed within seven years after the maturity date of the policy. The new arrangements will reduce the period from seven years to three years before life insurance funds are treated as unclaimed.


Fourthly, schedule 4 of the bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 to change arrangements for the transfer of lost member accounts to the tax office and to provide for the payment of interest on unclaimed superannuation money. Lost superannuation with balances of less than $2,000 will be deemed inactive after only three years; currently it is seven years. The coalition's dissenting report notes that this has the potential to make worse off those already vulnerable in our community—that is, those who take the most time to accumulate anywhere close to $2,000 in a superannuation account. We are talking about young people, low-income earners and new earners.


I was very concerned about the reduction in the time of inactivity from five years to only 12 months. Yesterday afternoon, the government acknowledged this problem in their legislation and announced that accounts which are active but where the member is uncontactable will not be transferred to the ATO. This is an embarrassing turnaround from the government. I am glad that they finally acknowledged the concerns relating to the nature of superannuation accounts.


Many young people and low-income earners will have multiple jobs and multiple super funds. The immediate pay packet of someone earning a low wage might be more pressing in terms of updating addresses and other contact information. Yet, if they then move house—and even if their super account is still receiving contributions—their account can be deemed lost if communication has been attempted twice. Therefore, to assist in protecting active but lost accounts, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and the Financial Services Council recommended a minimum two-year period before an account can be deemed lost, and that the two-year clock be reset when a member receives a contribution or any form of contact has occurred.


This is a very reasonable proposition which would add a safeguard for Australian superannuation accounts. I reiterate my gratitude that the Labor government has at least listened to the concerns from industry and consumers so that active accounts will not be transferred to the ATO unnecessarily.


Fifthly, schedule 5 of the bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. We should consider today's bill in the wider context of tax reform—more precisely, the complete lack of fundamental tax reform over the last five years. The Rudd Labor government first commissioned the Henry tax review, which began in 2008. The review received more than 1,500 submissions, cost more than $10 million and finally delivered a report over 1,300 pages long. The report included 138 recommendations to the government, the vast majority of which have not been appropriately considered by the government. Instead, we have a record of no real reform and all we see is new taxes and tax increases.


Successive Labor governments have introduced an additional 20,900 regulations and only repealed 104. Labor promised that they would follow a strict 'one in, one out' approach to the growth of regulation. Instead, for every regulation removed, 200 regulations have been added. While the Treasurer wants to rush this unclaimed money bill through parliament, they do have form when it comes to rapidly raising taxes in Australia. Among many other things, in 2008 they increased the alcopops tax and raised the luxury car tax from 25 to 33 per cent. They have attacked superannuation on numerous occasions. They attacked the medical expense tax offset and abolished the entrepreneur tax offset, and their most recent reform was to force large businesses to pay their pay-as-you-go instalments to the government every month instead of every quarter. This measure is supposed to net the government $5.5 billion in the next financial year.


Mining companies were slugged with a mining tax that has, to date, not raised a single dollar in revenue. With the mining tax, Australian businesses were supposed to see a cut in the company tax rate of 30c to 29c and then to 28c per dollar. The company tax rate today still stands at 30c, and Labor has completely abandoned reform in this area. As a result, the government has amended the net debt ceiling limit four times in the last five years. It first increased the limit in 2008 to $75 billion, then again in 2009, 2011 and 2012, with the limit now standing at $300 billion. As a consequence we have a government that then has to introduce measures in today's Treasury legislation amendment bill—a short-term fix to raise more than $760 million to smooth over the budget figures.


However, these changes have been rushed and ill-considered. The last 24 hours has seen the Labor government confess that it has introduced deeply flawed legislation, something it does not admit to very often, although there are countless examples of legislation passed by the Labor government which should not have been introduced, let alone passed, and which has required significant revision after its passage. With this Treasury bill, the government must at the very least delay the implementation of the bill and listen to the concerns of all stakeholders before imposing unnecessary and additional compliance cost.


The shortcomings that I and my coalition colleagues have outlined, both in the Senate dissenting report and in parliament, must be addressed in the form of further consultation. Despite the changes announced yesterday, this bill is still a bad bill. I therefore strongly oppose today's bill in its current form.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (11:36):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. As the shadow Treasurer has said, this bill should not be called the 'unclaimed money bill'; it should be called the 'government claims your money bill'. I guess you could also call it 'use it or lose it'. Anyone with a bank account should rush out and put in 10c to make sure the account is active. For one of my accounts I will probably have to do that because it is a family trust declared account. It is on my register of interests. It has been sitting there and earning interest for the family trust but it has not been activated or used for four years. That means it will be claimed by the government. This is another typical example of a government putting up a bill when it does not understand the consequences; it does not think through any of the legislation. If there is one thing that the business community knows it is that the government does not understand the knock-on consequences of a lot of the bills that are introduced and how they affect business.


Essentially this bill is an attempt to manufacture a paper surplus for this current financial year in the face of predictions from analysts around the country that there is going to be no budget surplus. In fact, more than half of the Gillard government's promised surplus for 2012-13 is supposed to be achieved through increased revenue from this bill. The government is clearly worried that it will break yet another political commitment that has been repeated time and time again by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. Those opposite are desperate for cash.


We all support getting the budget back to surplus, but the coalition wants a real surplus, not a paper surplus. The context of the legislation is the four largest deficit budgets in Australia's history, remarkably coming after four of the largest surpluses at the end of the prosperous Howard era. The rushing of this legislation will impose costs which will be borne by the account holders and consumers, and we must consider the interests of consumers who are the holders of bank accounts, superannuation accounts and insurance accounts while we assess the merits of this bill. On the other side of the coin are the account providers: banks, super funds, insurance companies or other financial institutions which are having the ill-considered measures imposed upon them without warning or consultation. We heard the Assistant Treasurer at a recent function in Melbourne talk about the Labor government and how much consultation it undertakes with business, but this bill is typical and it shows that the government does not consult with people when bringing in bills. Inadequate warning or consultation is stated in the coalition's dissenting report to the Senate inquiry. The stated objectives of this legislation are sound: to prevent erosion of small, lost or inactive account balances from fees and charges and to reunite unclaimed balances with their owners. However, as with many Labor bills, the substance of the bill does not match the objectives. We had the same problem with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill, which I spoke about in September—a bill with stated intentions that no-one could disagree with but with consequences that almost everyone disagreed with. This bill has the same problem.


However, while it was possible to conclude that the charities legislation debacle was just another example to add to the list of incompetence in the Labor Party, with the pink batts and the school halls, this legislation is more of a deliberate attempt to mislead. It is a grab for cash; there can be no doubt about that. The costs imposed on account providers from this legislation, which will be far greater due to the rushed nature of the introduction of the legislation, will inevitably be passed on to consumers—and I think the last thing Australians will want to see at the moment is higher bank charges.


The coalition will move amendments to introduce more realistic implementation time frames, and if these amendments are successful we will not oppose the bill. There may well be some elements in this bill that have merit, but these are largely wiped out by the rushed, ill-considered and disorderly manner in which they are being pursued. Specifically, given the number of problems raised concerning the legislation, the coalition senators of the Economics Committee determined that the sensible decision would be to undertake further consultation and, failing that, the implementation dates for schedules 1, 2 and 4 should be delayed.


I understand that at the eleventh hour the member for Oxley, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is in the chamber at the moment, has flagged changes that push back the reporting and transfer deadlines by a month for both banks and superannuation funds. While it is positive that the government has recognised one of the elements of concern with the legislation, this does not appropriately address the concerns that were raised by industry. From the outset we say that the government needs to explain, in an updated explanatory memorandum to this bill, how these changes will impact the key dates as outlined in the explanatory memorandum for changes in schedules 1, 2, and 4. The government also needs to inform the House, in an updated explanatory memorandum, how these amendments will change the financial impact of the bill over the forward estimates. These last-minute changes give an air of chaos and, by their very nature, limit time for consideration. I am the last speaker on this bill, and many have spoken over the last two sitting weeks. To rush through these changes at the end, without giving people a chance to digest them, analyse them and see what the impact is on the budget, is poor.


This bill seeks to make significant amendments to the Banking Act 1959, the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008, the Life Insurance Act 1995, the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001. The bill makes various cut-and-paste amendments to existing acts that give effect to the unclaimed moneys measures announced in the 2012-13 MYEFO. These amendments will impact arrangements relating to the transfer of unclaimed moneys to ASIC for bank accounts and life insurance policies, lost member accounts to the ATO for the superannuation, and unclaimed moneys for company moneys. This bill will bring forward the time at which money is recognised under the relevant law as lost or unclaimed, leaving Australians everywhere vulnerable to this government's greedy reach.


This bill affects many financial institutions and many different kinds of assets held by Australians. Schedule 1 of this bill amends section 69 of the Banking Act 1959 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by Australian deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs. These changes will reduce the period before an amount payable by an ADI is treated as unclaimed moneys from seven years to a period of only three years. If this bill passes, money held in ADIs will be deemed as unclaimed if a transaction has not occurred in the account for that period of time. This excludes payment of interest accrued. This change has mammoth potential widespread consequences for many Australians. For instance, say an Australian worker who has been offered a post overseas for the next four years decides to leave a sizeable amount of money in a high-interest bank account to accumulate interest. This person, who for whatever reason has chosen not to make any further deposits or withdrawals for that period of time, will, under this bill, have their deposit treated as unclaimed moneys. These funds will be moved to the government's own account, known as the consolidated revenue fund, and used to pad out the bottom line of that financial year's budget. In the Senate report a number of concerns were raised, which were shared by coalition senators, about the reduction by four years in the inactivity test period. The senators concluded that the three-year inactivity test for bank accounts is too short and needs to be reviewed to consider whether five years would be a more appropriate duration. Accounts which might be affected include those of Australians being posted overseas and accounts owned by children or set up for children's savings but without a contribution during the three years. In the case of a first home saver account, hard times can mean that contributions are not made for at least three years. Can you imagine the number of people that might be affected by an arbitrary three-year test? I imagine that is why the government is so keen to act this financial year.


The coalition dissenting report also pointed out that many account types should be excluded. A submission from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia stated:


A high level analysis by CBA indicates that the majority of account balances at CBA which would be impacted by the proposed changes to unclaimed monies currently receive an interest rate higher than the CPI linked rate which the Bill proposes to be paid on those balances once transferred to unclaimed monies.


So, a three-year requirement would be detrimental to a large number of Australians. Another recommendation from the coalition Senate report was that inactivity should be tested at the account holder level. If an inactive account is held by a consumer with one or more accounts at the bank, strongly suggesting that the customer is still alive and engaged with the bank, then the balance of the inactive account should not be deemed unclaimed and transferred to consolidated revenue. As such, where a customer holds multiple accounts with the bank, the inactivity test should be elevated to the level of the customer to help avoid unintended consequences.


The government also plans to appropriate funds from first home saver accounts by amending the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed monies held by the first home saver account providers. This is outlined in schedule 2. Once again, the bill before the parliament today would amend section 17A and 51C of the FHSA Act to change unclaimed monies for the period from seven years to three years as with the changes to the ADIs.


The government announced the introduction of first home saver accounts in its own 2008-09 budget to assist parents in saving for their children's future. Many parents have established these accounts for their children but may not have been able to make contributions recently for a variety of factors, be it the ever rising cost of living that this government does not acknowledge or a temporary lack of disposable income. Some of these accounts have a very real risk of being claimed by the government, particularly when holders of these accounts have not been able to afford to contribute to their deposits over the past three years or have not been in contact with the bank which holds these deposits. The coalition considers that this four-year reduction also increases, unreasonably, the risks of unintended consequences and we suggest that this bill be delayed a year to allow sufficient time for consultation.


This bill will amend the Life Insurance Act 1995 as per schedule 3 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed life insurance monies. Life insurance companies are required to report on and pay unclaimed monies to the Commonwealth. Unclaimed monies include sums payable on the maturity of a policy which are not claimed within seven years after the maturity date of the policy. The new arrangements outlined in this bill will reduce the period before life insurance monies are treated as unclaimed from seven to three years. It is, again, not clear how these provisions will apply to contemporary life insurance products or policies, and this confusion has arisen because the government has not had time to properly develop the legislation.


Schedule 4 to the bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 to change the circumstances in which small lost member accounts and accounts of unidentifiable members must be transferred to the ATO to provide for the payment of CPI interest on unclaimed superannuation money. Again, the coalition recommends that the proposed amendments in schedule 4 of the bill be delayed for a full year to 31 December 2013 to address the critical issues raised since the announcement of this measure. Lost superannuation accounts with balances of less than $2,000 that have up until now been inactive for only three years—currently this is set at seven years—and accounts of identifiable members that have been inactive for 12 months will now be required to be paid to Australian Taxation Office. It is not clear how legislative change will apply to people who have moved jobs and have multiple superannuation accounts, spent time overseas or moved residences. The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees noted in its submission that the problem of transferring such active accounts to consolidated revenue was that it was most likely to impact new employees, young people and low-income earners as these contributing members typically take the most time to accumulate account balance over $2,000. 


This bill seeks to amend longstanding pillars of our financial services industry. Changes to these acts must never be made lightly, and the coalition will not facilitate a government that is acting out of self-interest as opposed to properly considered public policy. The coalition has advocated for a wide range of review measures to ensure that this bill has had due assessment to ensure that there were no unintended consequences. This is a bill that this government has concocted out of desperation to save its crumbling budget bottom line. 


The coalition senators reached three recommendations, which include various parts of the schedules 1, 2 and 4, and the amendments to be moved by the shadow Treasurer this afternoon will reflect this. I urge the government to support them for the benefit of both consumers and industry who have been caught unawares by this rushed legislation. One of the other unintended consequences is for people who develop dementia. What will be done with their accounts? Will the government take money from people who are getting ill? Is that right? You have said they will keep their money; will they?

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (11:51):  I stand today to speak to the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. From the outset, let me say that I have real concerns with the speed at which this bill has been brought to this House. I understand from the government's perspective why it needs to introduce this bill, which will bring $700 million into consolidated revenue and some $886 million into consolidated revenue over the forward estimates. This consolidated revenue benefit is designed to do nothing more than prop up the budget in an attempt to produce a surplus to make the government look good. This is not earnings by government. This is taking the money which individuals or corporations own and that is in bank accounts, life insurance and superannuation policies that actually belong to someone. Your excuse is that this money does not belong to someone, so therefore it belongs to the government, and therefore the government can use it to prop up its ineptitude in managing a budget. I have real concerns with the speed. 


These concerns have been expressed in dissenting reports put down in the Senate. In particular, one of the things that really concerns me is in relation to superannuation, and the fact that the government will deem an account lost or inactive if there has been no action within 12 months. There are a large number of people, particularly young Australians who, when they leave school and start work might have a multitude of jobs; might amass a lot of small amounts of superannuation which they have not consolidated into one account. They might go travelling or they might go overseas for 12 months as a rite of passage as they explore offshore opportunities. Indeed, they might even go bush for 12 months and jackaroo or work up in Cairns in the tourism industry and be deemed non-contactable. Therefore, their hard earned money will go into consolidated revenue for this government. It is true that when it is claimed back they will be able to get an interest supplement from the government at the lowest rate.




Mr Ripoll:
  Less fees and charges.




Mr BALDWIN:
  Well, Parliamentary Secretary, let's be honest about it: this is about a cash grab to line up the bottom line of your budget and nothing more. That is why it is being done with this speed. And those young children sitting up in the gallery watching you would say, 'What are you doing to my future earning capacity when you have designed a scheme that now, within 12 months of deemed inactivity, by criteria set down by you and your colleagues that will take that money away?'


I have real concerns, and I believe that this bill before the House is going to be supported by Independents because there was a deal done. And that deal is the poker machines legislation which will be brought into this House tonight, which the government previously said would not work—in fact, Minister Macklin said on a number of occasions that the voluntary precommitment would not work. But, such is the demand from perhaps the member for Denison that he wants his bill through, and the government needs his support on this bill to get it through to prop up the bottom line. This government is selling out the hotel and the club industries for the purposes of getting this bill through. I will have more to say on that tonight, when I speak to the gambling reforms legislation.


I want to say that I feel very uncomfortable with this bill. I am glad that the shadow Treasurer will be moving a number of regulatory changes to make sure that it conforms more with sound, sensible responses—particularly at the time in which this will all come together. But I want to say I feel uncomfortable, because it is clear that this bill does nothing more than raid the bank accounts and superannuation funds of people to prop up the government's bottom line. Be honest about it.




Mr Ripoll:
  You're just making it up!




Mr BALDWIN:
  I'm not making it up, Parliamentary Secretary. Here you are, with your forward estimates, your schedules to the bill—schedules 1, 2 and 3: banking, first home saver account, life insurance this year will deliver you $93.4 million as you raid it off people; schedule 4: superannuation, $513.5 million; schedule 5: companies and corporations, $94 million; $700 million to your bottom line. So it is not true revenue, it is not income, it is not money the government has earned—it is money you are taking out of the accounts of everyday Australians to prop up your financial position to make you look like you could be somewhat of a responsible financially accurate government. You are not: you are robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it is not your money.


I am not going to speak any further on this bill. I will be opposing it. I think it is wrong. I think the delivery method is wrong. I think the speed and access are wrong. And in particular I feel that the fact that this bill has brought other bills into action because of deals and swaps and a need for votes is going to do immeasurable harm to Australia.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (11:57):  With the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012 the government yet again travels down a well-worn path, with another blatant cash grab of Australians' hard-earned income. I have no hesitation in opposing this bill, because of the haste with which this government has chosen to introduce this legislation. Gone is sufficient time to assess the impact and unintended consequences, replaced with a desperate dash to the next budget—framed by creative accounting towards a non-paper surplus.


Again, the people of Tangney and all other Australians are left disregarded by a shambles of naive legislation and ignorant policy. Reforms to the Banking Act 1969 make new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held in deposit-taking institutions. The coalition had sought to refer the bill to the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for prudent and measured assessment. Why this government has not sent this bill to the parliamentary inquiry lends itself to the question: what are the members of this Labor government seeking to achieve? And do they fully understand the potential implications for Australians? Instead, this bill has been rushed to the House for debate because Labor sees opportunity to profit from those who can least afford it. We are three days from this place rising for 2012. It is quite apparent the government is bent on rushing this and a swathe of other bills to a vote to temper current debt of $252.9 billion. In addition to the Banking Act 1969, this bill also seeks to amend unclaimed money measures which were flagged in the government's 2012-13 MYEFO, to the First Home Savers Account Act 2008, the Life Insurance Act 1985, the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001—the focus: arrangements relating to the transfer of unclaimed moneys to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for bank accounts and life insurance policies, lost members' accounts at the Australian Taxation Office for superannuation, and unclaimed moneys for companies' moneys.


Similar to most of the economic policies of the current Treasurer, this legislation will bring forward to 2012-13 a significant sum of money that the legislation will recognise as unclaimed, lost or abandoned. This figure is forecast to be $762 million. To do this, changes will reduce the period before an amount payable by an Australian deposit-taking institution is treated as unclaimed moneys from seven years to three.


Let me be clear. If a worker who has money sitting in a bank account accumulating interest and does not make any further deposits or withdrawals for that period of time, at the three-year mark they will have their deposit treated as unclaimed moneys. These funds will then be moved to consolidated revenue. It is towards Orwellian that government would come in and just pluck money from a private account because it has not been active for three years. This is the reverse Robin Hood. It means that 'small' Australians—not the big end of town but the small end of town that Labor purports to support—will be robbed by the biggest institution in the land, the Australian government. This is from the Labor Party, which prides itself on fighting for the little guy. Some fight!


How can an Australian government head down this path—to tap into private funds just because Australians rightly chose to leave money in a particular account? This is not the type of government I want. This is not the type of government the people of Tangney want—and they are telling me just that. Should this bill pass this place, I imagine many people, young and old, will step back 50 years and stuff their money under the mattress—better having it stagnant and not interest bearing than losing the money all together. This policy is archaic, deceptive and impractical.


Schedule 2 of this bill amends the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008—an amendment to a bill introduced by this government relatively recently to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by the first home saver account providers. Amendments change, once again, the unclaimed moneys period from seven years to three years. Again, this schedule makes us question Labor's due diligence when introducing legislation it has drafted, with amendments after just a few years because the government has seen fiscal opportunity and seen fit to amend legislation for government gain at the cost of the individual citizen.


Surely there is a better way to balance the budget—even after this government has produced four of the biggest budget deficits in Australia's history. Prudent, fiscally responsible and competent government should always strive for higher productivity and higher standards of living for all Australians. Pinching $2,000 here and $3,000 there, while unjust, is also bureaucratically implausible. The cost of administering this poorly developed policy surely outweighs the net gain to the government.


Now I go to schedule 3, concerning life insurance. Currently life insurance companies are required to report on and pay unclaimed moneys to the Commonwealth. Unclaimed moneys include sums payable on the maturity of a policy which are not claimed within seven years after the maturity date of that policy. The new arrangements will reduce the period before life insurance moneys are treated as unclaimed moneys from seven to—you guessed it—three years. Once again, we see a reduction in the time frame, and it will allow the government to step in and take that money. If someone legitimately choses to have a bank account and leave money in there for more than three years, and not wish to add to it and not wish to subtract from it, surely they have the right to do that and not be worried that a government is going to step in and appropriate the money.


Schedule 4 of the bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act. Lost super accounts with balances of less than $2,000 that have until now been active for only three years—currently this is seven—and accounts of unidentifiable members that have been inactive for 12 months are now to be paid to the Australian Taxation Office. Note the figure of less than $2,000. Once again, we are not talking about the big end of town. Schedule 5 deals with the Corporations Act. Once again, the government seeks to move the goalposts so it is easier to get hold of private citizens' money. 


This bill just beggars belief. It changes the pillars of our financial services industry. It is clear that the rushed time lines and implementation of this bill have been driven by nothing more than a Treasurer pretending that he can deliver a surplus, a surplus that is at risk without the passing of this bill. The coalition and I will not support or facilitate a government that acts on political interest with disregard for properly considered public policy. Good government is the goal of all members in this place, Labor and Liberal, and it saddens me that the Labor Party have sold what was left of their dignity to manufacture a superficial surplus.


The Leader of the Opposition's team have left this government naked. The bill exposes the wanton greed and lust for power endemic in tired and troubled Labor. This bill generates $762 million, which is a very convenient sum when the surplus is expected to be a wafer thin $1.077 billion. There is no way around it. The Treasurer is robbing not only Peter but also Paul. The only people getting paid are Labor cronies in unions and backroom boys. 


In the final analysis, it is difficult to understand not the bill itself but where it is coming from, who is driving it. Is it the Australian Bankers Association? No, because they remain sceptical of its necessity and of the transitional administrative arrangements. Is it the lobby groups and/or academic groups? No, because they point to the lack of any evidence to suggest that three years is the optimal time to take a person's money. The job of a government should be to safeguard and protect the properties of people, not to meander into their bank accounts and confiscate their hard earned treasure. This bill goes to prove the point that the Leader of the Opposition and I have made, time and time again: a government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take everything you have.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (12:08):  I thank all members who have spoken and contributed to this debate. I can understand that there is some confusion, although I find it difficult to understand why that is the case. We have clearly articulated exactly what this bill does—and the amendments to this bill—in protecting people's savings and superannuation, protecting their money and, for the first time, ensuring that people's lost accounts are not eroded away by fees and charges, and that for the first time they also have an opportunity to continue to earn interest. These are good for consumers and good for the country. The bill is certainly not what has been described by a number of members opposite. In fact, it is the case that the rules on how unclaimed moneys are dealt with, with ASIC and the ATO, are in currently place. They currently exist. In that effect there are no changes. The changes are to when it takes place. It will happen more quickly, but that is a really good thing for consumers because the earlier it happens the earlier their lost accounts can be reconnected and the quicker they can re-access their funds.


The interesting part about the different elements that have been raised is that the reason the accounts are lost in the first place is people have for whatever reason become disconnected and they have no mechanism to reconnect with their lost account in whatever form. No method exists. If it is with the bank it is not in the bank's interests to put forward that you reconnect with your funds and take them out, but it is in the government's interest that ordinary people are reconnected with their funds, that the fees and charges stop being taken out and eroding a person's savings, and that savings are added to by giving people CPI interest—yes, at the lowest rate, but interest so that the value of their money maintains value over time. These are really good, sensible changes.


I am prepared to have debates and arguments over time frames—whether it is seven years or three or whatever other time frame—but that does not change the principle. The principle we have before us is that we are trying to save people's money by giving them interest for the first time, to stop the erosion of the value of their money by having fees and charges taken out for the first time, and to make sure that the government, through the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, actively reconnects people with their money. Right now, what happens in the absence of these very good changes we are putting forward is that those unclaimed moneys go on for not three years or seven years but 10 or 15 years because people do not know. The reason they are unclaimed is a lot of people do not know they exist, or they are overseas, or whatever the case may be. The faster we can reconnect people the better it is.


There is a whole range of other issues that have been raised by opposition members trying to confuse this area—that the government is somehow reaching into people's accounts. That is not the case at all. This is an amendment to existing laws about things that currently happen, and this is an improvement to what we have seen in the past. This bill is directly intended to do exactly what it does, which is re-unite Australians with their lost moneys faster and to protect that lost money from inflation and fees. I am astonished that anyone in this place would oppose it.


We have made a number of technical amendments and we have clarified a range of areas—because there are a lot of technical issues in some of these matters—and this now means it is clear for banks and for consumers. We have given the appropriate time frames for organisations to be able to implement these new measures. Contrary to the suggestions from the opposition, this bill does not introduce a new regime for lost moneys. Rather, the bill will deliver better outcomes for consumers by making a small number of refinements to the existing regime. This is the disingenuous element of some of what has been said in this debate.


These are laws that existed under the Howard government. What we have done and what we continue to do in government is take those laws and make them better. Following consultation with the industry the government will move amendments to the bill that will provide industry with more time to implement the changes. There is no argument from industry about whether this is right or wrong, because it is currently being done. We are giving industry a little bit more time to be able to properly—



Mr Hockey interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  We get laughter from the opposition. More time—isn't that what they were saying? Isn't that what they wanted? That is exactly what we have done—we have given them a little bit more time. It will happen in good time because the faster these changes happen the better it is for consumers. If we used the principle that the opposition brings to the table there would be no time, because they could never find the time in 12 years in government—there was never any time. There was never any time to make any good changes. We will take the time and we will do it.


Specifically, we have also authorised for deposit-taking institutions, First Home Saver Account providers and life insurers to be required to make supplementary assessment and transfer by 31 May 2013. That is sufficient time for the changes to be adopted, adapted and implemented so that people can be earlier reconnected with their money. This provides an extra five months for these institutions to identify lost accounts and an extra two months to transfer them, as requested by industry groups such as Abacus. We agree with them. Let us give them a little bit more time. Let us make these changes. But the faster we get there the quicker people will be reconnected. All the evidence is on the table. All you have to do is go through the evidence from history. Have a look at what happened with unclaimed moneys in each previous year. There were more and more of them over time and no effort was made—nothing was done—to reconnect people. As soon as this Labor government started to make an effort, we saw a change. We saw people who had lost accounts being reconnected with their accounts. We are seeing people with lost super being reconnected with their super. We are seeing the things that this bill intends to do working.


We have had more evidence recently. There has been a bit of media activity around this issue, including on the radio. The government and ASIC have promoted the fact that people ought to go and use the free search tool at ASIC or the ATO to look for their lost accounts. A whole drift of people have gone there to reconnect for the first time. This bill will assist people to do that.


This is the key that the opposition needs to understand. Most people have no way of knowing that they have lost money. Even if you thought you had, where would you look? It is lost. Where would you start? But as soon as it transfers from the institution—the bank or wherever it might be—to ASIC or the ATO you can search for it. It does not matter how long you wait. You can search it now or you can search it in 10 years and your money will still be there. It will not have been eroded by fees and charges. The real value of your money will have been maintained because you will get interest. For the first time, you will get interest. How could you oppose that? In 10 years time, somebody who lost their money will be able to reconnect with their funds. Under this mob's rule, what happened was that it just stayed lost. That is what they want: they want the money to stay lost. They want the lost accounts to stay lost. They want to make an amendment all right: one to take the time period from the old seven years to forever, because they are not interested in reconnecting people with their funds. We are and that is exactly what we are doing.


Consultation with industry has identified some areas in which the intent of the amendments can be clarified. These issues can and will be dealt with through regulations, as per my press release yesterday.


These reforms will ensure that more Australians are reunited with their lost moneys. They will also ensure that this happens faster. That is the whole point. Why wait any longer? If somebody has a lost account—lost moneys in either their life insurance policy, superannuation, bank accounts or even property—why should they have to wait any further? Let us reconnect people with their money and let us do it now.


There were a range of issues raised by speakers on the other side. I will make a few points to clarify things. The principles in the existing legislation will not be changed. The principles remain exactly the same. At some point in time, be it seven years or three years, that money will be transferred—and this was done during the Howard era—from an account that is lost, unidentifiable or inactive to the ATO or to ASIC. What we are doing is making that happen faster so that you can reconnect with your funds faster. The principles have not changed. When those opposite say that the government is taking your money, that is not the case, because that is the existing law—it is exactly what happens now; it is exactly what happened during the Howard era. We did not hear them at that point in time saying that they were taking that money. The key principle differences are that it stops your money being eroded through fees and charges for the first time and that you get interest for the first time.


The other concern from the opposition revolves around speed: it is all too fast, according to them. We may be moving too quickly for the opposition, but we can walk, chew gum and breathe at the same time and introduce good amendments. This is not too fast. This is appropriate. It is about time that people are reconnected with their funds in a more timely manner. Whether that lost money is in superannuation, life insurance policies or bank accounts, the settings that we are putting in place are appropriate—and particularly for super. There is a complexity to super, particularly for young people with multiple accounts. In fact, superannuation is one of the areas in which there is an enormous amount of lost money. The shorter the time period, the quicker it moves across, the faster that you will be able to identify and reconnect with your superannuation. That is great for consumers. It means that they can get their money faster.


The issues that have been raised have been more than amply dealt with. The amendments that we have put forward, after good consultation with the industry about implementation periods, are sensible and appropriate. The government commends this bill to the House, because it is good for consumers and good for reconnecting people with their lost moneys.

The coalition is moving an amendment to delay the start date of schedules 1, 2 and 4 of this bill, which deal with changes to bank accounts, first home saver accounts and unclaimed superannuation. Under schedule 1, the coalition is seeking to delay the implementation date of the changes, which reduce the period before an amount payable by an Australian deposit-taking institution or money held in a bank account is treated as unclaimed money from seven years to three years. As the Senate inquiry found:


Submissions from the Australian Bankers' Association (ABA), the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and the Association of Financial Advisers (AFA) suggested three years was too short a period of inactivity to deem an account unclaimed, particularly given the growing number and type of accounts that customers intentionally leave inactive for extended periods.


Submissions from institutions provided to the committee also challenged the government’s claim that owners of inactive accounts would be better off once the money in those accounts was transferred, with examples provided of many accounts where interest paid on those accounts was currently higher than CPI or inflation.


In relation to this measure, the coalition thinks that it is particularly disturbing that information provided by Treasury confirmed that they were unable to quantify the number of affected accounts. Treasury did not even know how many accounts were going to be affected but mentioned that approximately 14,000 accounts were transferred to ASIC last financial year. When questioned whether inactive accounts of active customers—for example, customers with other active accounts would be excluded—Treasury simply stated that the definition of unclaimed moneys had not changed.


It is important to note that the test for unclaimed moneys within the legislation before the House is whether or not a transaction has occurred on that account, not whether or not you have other active accounts within one institution. When the coalition pressed Treasury around current statistics for bank accounts that will be impacted by this legislation, they were only able to refer to current data under the current seven-year time limit. Of the accounts listed in ASIC's database that were transferred in the 2012 financial year, half had a balance below $1,275 and the mean account balance was approximately $4,400. Perhaps the most disturbing feature was the current largest unclaimed bank account listed in the ASIC database was for $992,750 in Carlisle, in Western Australia. If this is what is going on on ASIC's register after seven years, then how many people are going to be affected after three years? The government does not know. The coalition deems this to be an unsatisfactory policy motivation. The coalition will also move an amendment to delay the implementation date of schedule 2 to this bill, which deals with the changes to first home saver accounts, for similar reasons to that which I have outlined for the delay of schedule 1. Our amendments will also delay the start date of schedule 4 of this bill which amends unclaimed moneys in superannuation. This delay will provide a more timely introduction for the government, given the autoconsolidation changes that are due to commence on 1 January 2014.


In short, we are giving everyone time to properly consider this legislation and to properly implement it. The policy intent might be there, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer is right to say we had similar in principle unclaimed policy proposals under our government. But this government is just doing a fix to try and get the budget to surplus this year. That is all it is about, and quite frankly we are not going to cop it because we will not support legislation that is fundamentally flawed and adds to the red tape burden of everyone on an everyday basis.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The question is that opposition amendment (1) be agreed to. I think the ayes have it. Do the noes have it? Is a division required? In accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier, the division is deferred until the conclusion of the discussion of a matter of public importance. The debate on this item is therefore adjourned until that time.




Mr Morrison:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Having been in the House when you called the result of that vote, I would ask that you review the proceedings between now and when you have indicated the debate may take place on this matter. My distinct recollection of the last few minutes is that the amendments were determined by the vote that was taken here. There was no voice calling for no and there was no call for a division before you declared the matter.



Opposition members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I called for noes and there was a no. The member for North Sydney and the parliamentary secretary will resume their seats. I said: 'The ayes have it?' and the ayes said yes, which is often the case in a division. I then called for noes and, although there was a quiet no, there was a no and I asked if a division were required.




Mr Hockey:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I do not want to reflect in any way upon the chair, but I distinctly did not hear—and I am sitting right here—any members on the other side of the House call out no when you invited them to do so. Therefore you declared the vote in our favour. I would ask you to refer the matter to the Speaker for checking the tapes, because I think you acted entirely properly. There were no declared noes against the amendment; therefore, the matter is passed. If the government seeks to have the matter resubmitted for a vote at a later time, then that is something it can discuss with us. But I did distinctly hear that there was no dissenting voice.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney will resume his seat, as will the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer.




Mr Ripoll:
  I ask for a similar opportunity to what you gave the member for North Sydney. There were clearly two voices for no, and if they have a problem hearing that is their problem and not ours. There were clearly two noes.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I did call for the noes. I started by calling if the ayes had it, as would normally be the case: you would call for the ayes and not immediately call for the noes. They were very quiet noes, I will admit.



Mr Ripoll interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer does not have the call. The parliamentary secretary will resume his seat.




Mr Hockey:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask that this matter be referred to the Speaker for consideration and that the Speaker advise the House prior to any vote that is being held over until after the MPI. I think that is a perfectly reasonable approach. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not suggesting that you were in any way wrong, but I do suggest that, long after the vote was declared, there was a voice of dissent. Let the tapes determine that. I really do urge you to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I did not declare the vote.




Mr Ripoll:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: if it helps the House, if I was too quiet on this occasion—although I made it quite clear that it was a no and I looked at you at that point; you may not have seen me or heard my the voice—I ask that you call it again and I will make sure that I yell it very loudly. We can go to the video ref as many times as you like. My intent was clear. The no was clear. If others did not hear it, that is their problem. I am asking you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to consider that the intent was clear—and it is quite clear what we are trying to do—and re-put the question. If you are concerned that somehow it was not loud enough—it was loud but not loud enough—I am prepared to make it as loud as necessary to ensure that it is loud enough. No-one questions that it was loud; it was just not loud enough.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the parliamentary secretary. I have ruled that the noes have it and that there will be a deferred division. That will be an opportunity for the House to decide on the amendment. There are divisions yet to be taken.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (11:01):  As I was saying, this is an extra tax grab of $900 million. Basically, it is the government with its hands in the pockets of Australians. This is Robin Hood in reverse. While it may be understandable to some that a government and a Treasurer that have totally lost control of their fiscal policy would be desperate to rip every dollar that they can out of the pockets of Australians, the fact that they attempt to hide it through this bill is what frustrates and angers the community and certainly leads them to not trust the duplicitous actions of this government. More than half the Gillard government's promised surplus 2012-13—and I said 'promised'—is to be achieved through the increased revenue from this bill. This is the sole purpose of the government removing this money from your accounts. This is what the government is doing.


Its addiction to spending has left it unable to balance its budget. The government will, as it has so often previously, resort to negative comparisons to somehow justify this incompetence and its wasteful spending. How often have we had to listen to the Treasurer basically gloating that Australia's debt position is not nearly as bad as that of other nations? It is an absolute nonsense argument: 'We might be in a bad way, but others are worse, so that makes it fine.' This government is saying that, although they have propelled Australia down a hole, we are not as deeply down that hole as perhaps somewhere like Greece or other at risk nations, so that should give us some comfort. That is a farce perpetrated on us all by a Labor government in a desperate state. And they are looking at walking away from that budget surplus promise—just watch this space.


Australia was in a good financial position. The previous Liberal government left the current one with a budget surplus, no net debt and billions of dollars invested in savings. The Labor government did what Labor governments do: they spent all the money and wasted so much of it. They are now gorging on debt. Through our amendments, the coalition is seeking to fix what is just the latest legislative debacle from this government. Our amendments seek to redefine the appropriate timeframes needed for fairness in this process. For example, the three-year inactivity threshold for bank accounts is far too short. I have articulated any number of reasons why your account may not have been active over that period. That definitely should be reviewed. The most appropriate period needs to be reassessed. There also needs to be a better explanation as to why the first homeowner account is included. It is just an extraordinary inclusion. Many aspiring homeowners struggle to attain that much-needed deposit. They are working so hard and we should be encouraging such people, not making it harder for them, not having them live in fear: 'If you don't make a contribution to that account, then the government will take it.'


There are also questions about the range of accounts captured by this legislation. It remains the position of the opposition that the new rules should apply only to accounts that earn very low or zero interest, typically at-call accounts.


The coalition also believe that accounts should be grouped under account holders so that if someone has one or more active accounts which are currently in use, then any inactive accounts should not be claimed by the government. They are working their accounts; it is how they are working their financial affairs. In such circumstances, the account holder is obviously known to the banking institution and their account is not lost; it is simply inactive. And that is okay and should be okay with this government. It is not okay for the government to take your funds in that instance.


The government has already acknowledged that this latest piece of legislation is flawed. I wonder why the government cannot get its work done right the first time. Why can't it do the work that is necessary to get this type of legislation right? The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer has put out a media statement outlining a months delay in implementing the bill, which will now come into effect on 31 May next year.


This is just another example of the government's incompetence. We also know that further delays will almost be inevitable, as the government struggles to get its act together. The government also needs to tell the House and the banking sector how these amendments will change the financial impact of the bill over the forward estimates. We need to know more about this and so do the people of Australia. Let us hope that the government actually tries to improve this legislation and bring it into this House in the form it should have brought it in in the first place.


The amendments that the coalition are proposing certainly deserve support.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (11:07):  I am pleased to speak on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. Let us be clear about what this bill is about. For those listening out there in the wider Australian audience, this is about a government that is trying to legitimise the ability to put its hand in the pockets of everyday Australians and take moneys out of superannuation accounts, home saver accounts and a whole range of accounts that have been inactive for some time. As the member for Forrest just explained to us, the problem is that the government has reduced the time thresholds.


Having an inactive account is not a sin, it is not illegal and it is not wrong. There are a whole range of reasons why you might have an inactive account. But the government, because they need to prop up the bottom line, because they know that they are in financial trouble—they have this fascination with a $1.1 billion surplus, which they know is just a fantasy—but to make it look good they are rushing this legislation through the parliament today, without industry consultation and without proper scrutiny by the Senate's Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The joint committee wanted to examine this bill and it has not been given the opportunity and time to do so in any meaningful way. So it has been rushed through today because, at the MYEFO update only weeks ago, Treasurer Wayne Swan said he wanted to grab this money to prop up the government's bottom line.


This government has financial problems; it is running out of money. The fact that it is borrowing $100 million a day from China is not enough. It now wants to raid the bank accounts, the superannuation accounts and home saver accounts of ordinary Australians who are out there in the wider community. So we are going to reserve our position on this bill until the outcome of a further Senate inquiry, at a date to be announced. This is desperate legislation and it is quite unseemly that it would be in this place today. This year the amount of unclaimed money held by ASIC has risen to $677 million and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, is licking his lips in anticipation because he wants to get this money—after squandering the money he had been given through the taxation system. This bill seeks to reduce the length of time unclaimed money sits in an account before it can be transferred to government coffers. In other words, it would expedite this government getting their hands on money which Australians are entitled to. 


Imagine if we had made such a money grab. Imagine if Peter Costello had done this. You would have heard a hue and cry: 'What are you doing to the workers of Australia? What are you doing to the ordinary mums and dads of Australia? You are raiding their bank accounts. You are raiding their home saver accounts. You are raiding their superannuation accounts.' We would have been, in the words of those on the other side, the ultimate Tory thieves helping ourselves to Australians' moneys. But, as the Prime Minister says, 'This is the Labor way.' It is the Labor way today—helping themselves to this money.


This bill was introduced the last time we met—three weeks ago. It was introduced, I understand, on the Tuesday night. I happened to be on duty in the chamber on the Wednesday morning when it was brought to this House. The shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, was here ready to speak on this bill and he was furious because he had only received notification that it was coming into this House the night before. There had been no opportunity to consult with industry. Given the complexities and the significant implications associated with the bill, the coalition sought to have the bill referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. A meeting of that committee was called immediately and at that meeting it was decided that the bill should be referred to the committee for review. As I said, on the Wednesday that decision was respectfully overturned by the Speaker and it became clear that the government wanted the bill passed that week.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Canning is treading on dangerous ground here.




Mr RANDALL:
  I am just giving the history of what happened.



The SPEAKER:  No, you are giving other people's interpretation of what happened here. I suggest you exercise great caution to ensure you do not reinvent the history of this matter based on other people's interpretation of events.




Mr RANDALL:
  Thank you, Madam Speaker, but I did happen to be in the chamber at the time. I will leave it there. Given the consequences of this legislative amendment, it would have been wise for this bill to have been carefully examined before a vote was held. Given the Labor government's desperation to secure more revenue, however, I can see why such scrutiny was bypassed.


There are many Australians who would be affected by this proposed legislative amendment. An article titled 'The quest for buried treasure', written by Lesley Parker and published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 14 November, shows that the average parcel of unclaimed funds in Western Australia is the highest in the country at $791. I do not know why that is, but our state—I happen to be a member from Western Australia—seems to be leading the charge in quite a few areas. While there are many inactive accounts which have only very small amounts of unclaimed money sitting in them, there are many examples where significant sums of money rest in an account without the knowledge of the account holder. In Western Australia, for example, there is an account with an unclaimed balance of almost a million dollars. The government has decided, through this proposed legislation, that this money should be redirected to federal coffers as a matter of urgency. Anyone in this place who takes even a cursory glance at this proposal will know that it warrants further scrutiny—especially given the number of Australian account holders who will be impacted by this bill. 


Many thousands of my constituents in the Canning electorate would, because they are superannuants or self-managed superannuation fund holders, demand that parliament investigate the implications of a tier of government claiming money from Australians before we rush ahead with such a proposal. As I will come to later, this bill has unintended consequences—for example, where there is health insurance linked to a superannuation fund. This is a sadly accurate reflection of the disregard the Gillard government have for taxpayers' money. It is apparently not enough for them to recklessly waste the money which, as I said, is given to them through our taxation system and through the revenue the Commonwealth attracts; now they wish to rush through a process which will result in additional money being effectively placed in trust with the government—I emphasise the word 'trust'. It will be handed over to the government and held, but the government have a terrible track record with the responsibility of handling public funds. With the speed at which it is being rushed through the parliament, the coalition objects to this legislation.


This bill will have major implications for unclaimed bank accounts, life insurance policies, which I did not mention earlier, a range of superannuation accounts, home savers accounts and unclaimed company moneys. It seeks to allow the government to gain control of moneys in people's inactive accounts after three years. Currently it is seven years. So after three years they are coming for you. It also allows the government to gain control of workers' unclaimed superannuation money where an account has been inactive for 12 months—12 months, rather than five years. What if you have been up north on a contract and you just have not got around to tending to your self-managed superannuation fund, for example?



An opposition member:  Goneski.




Mr RANDALL:
  You return to Perth and look to get your account going again because you have come back with a pocketful of money. Sorry, it is not there. The federal government has taken your account because you have been out of circulation for 12 months. It increases the limit of lost super funds it can raid from just $200 to $2,000—in other words, a multiple of 10.


Inactive First Home Saver Accounts and life insurance funds are also under attack by the Gillard government. What about parents who establish a First Home Saver Account for their children? Have they thought of this unintended consequence? Parents with a bit of money who want to do the right thing by their young child so that they can get into the home mortgage market later in life may put it into a home saver account. Unfortunately, as things go on and bills get bigger, they may not put any money into this home saver account for their child and it may go inactive for several years because of financial circumstances. Goodness me, the government has come and got it!


What about people who travel overseas for a period of time? Dare I say, I have some missionaries in my electorate who go to Africa and other parts of the world offering their time almost free of charge. They do this for two or three years. They will come back to Australia and find that, because their account was inactive and they were working almost in a charitable fashion, not earning, they have been hit. What about soldiers sent overseas? I am not talking about soldiers in Afghanistan or on peacekeeping missions but those who go away to other areas where they might sign on for a longer period of time. When they come back after 12 months: goneski—not the Gonski that most people know but the goneski that will happen to their account.


So we can see that this bill will have major ramifications for many Australians. It is incumbent upon this parliament to rigorously explore the implications of the bill rather than rush it through both houses, as is the apparent intention of the government today. We often hear about the new era of transparency, with this 'rainbow coalition' that was cobbled together in 2010. Dare I refer to the time I sat in this chamber three weeks ago, when the member for Lyne was occupying the chair? He wanted to leave the chair because he was not happy with the bill and wanted to contribute to debate. We helped facilitate it. The Greens member for Melbourne said the Greens were not happy with this bill because it had suddenly been thrust upon them as well and they had not seen the detail. Obviously, in recent times they always protest and then eventually roll over and have their tummies scratched by this government and go along with it.



The SPEAKER:  The member for Canning!




Mr RANDALL:
  It is a good analogy. Legs in the air, getting a tummy scratch by the Prime Minister, because they fall in line with her all the time. They have never really voted against anything that would cause this government any grief.


The coalition opposes this bill because we do not want this to be added to the growing list of embarrassing examples where transparency has been discarded for political expediency. And we know what they are: the formulation of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax; and the failure of the Labor government to deliver on the single promise with the country Independents to introduce spatial accounting, to help understand federal expenditure in the regions of Australia. I will just briefly expand on that, because this is part of the transparency. With great fanfare the Independent members said that, along with Minister Crean, they would involve themselves in what is called spatial accounting, so that we could see where the money was spent in each electorate in the regions. We have asked the questions now, and they cannot do it. I think it is that they do not want to do it. And how about the bungling of the Australia Network tender; the reversal on the carbon tax floor price; and the ongoing deals with the Greens to maintain power. It is all part of a shambolic government, and this legislation is part of that.


In addition, yesterday I spoke with industry people and industry sources about this issue and they are deeply concerned about the speed with which this bill has been rushed through the parliament without proper scrutiny. One of the unintended consequences raised with me was the implication involving insurance policies associated with superannuation funds. Many Australians with superannuation accounts have health insurance policies connected their super policies. A client's ability to lodge a claim through their policy would be taken away if their account were claimed by the Commonwealth after remaining inactive for several years. The fact that it is inactive does not mean to say that the health funds still could not come out of funds that were in there. This has massive implications for many Australians, and the government should respect the fact that their suggested legislative amendments need to be adequately scrutinised to ensure their actions do not lead to negative outcomes for Australians.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:22):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. The bill before the House seeks to enact various changes to unclaimed money measures, which were flagged in the government's 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.


The bill makes amendments in five areas: the Banking Act 1959; the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008; the Life Insurance Act 1995; the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001; and the Corporations Act 2001. The bill effectively brings forward the time at which money is recognised under the relevant law as lost or unclaimed, which will in turn have the effect of moving approximately $700 million into the federal government's general consolidated revenue fund for the 2012-13 financial year and beyond. Make no mistake, these bills are merely a cover-up for this disastrous Gillard Labor government. They are designed to cover up $172 billion of accumulated deficits—record deficits—with more deficits likely to come in the 2012-13 financial year and beyond.


The changes in today's bill are one of many so-called saving measures announced by the Treasurer in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. As we know, the vast majority of what the Treasurer referred to as a saving was merely taking more money away from Australian taxpayers and businesses—and taking it away sooner than the government did previously.


The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, after which stakeholders had five working days to make a submission to the committee. As Labor does with so many important pieces of legislation, similar to the rushed implementation of their Future of Financial Advice rules, they rammed their measures through parliament without any regard to the intended and unintended consequences of their legislation. In this case, for a measure to be worth potentially up to $760 million, there were only 18 days between referral to the committee and the committee's report being released. This is simply not enough time for those interested—consumers, business groups and industry associations—to consider the consequences of these changes. The coalition senators of that committee released a dissenting report which highlights many of the bill's problems. They made two recommendations: firstly, that the government withdraw the bill in order to facilitate further consultation and that the explanatory memorandum be revised to be clear about how the legislation is intended to work; secondly, if the government does not withdraw the bill—which it has not done—that the bill be amended to delay implementation until at least 31 December 2013 for Schedules 1 and 2 and that there be further delay for Schedule 4. 


More recently, the government announced just yesterday afternoon significant changes to the bill in response to many of the concerns noted by the coalition senators' dissenting report. It takes seven paragraphs into the media release of the Parliamentary Secretary for the Treasurer, the member for Oxley, for the government to admit that it is making significant changes to the original legislation and to then admit that it is changing the implementation date to 31 May 2013. What it does not say is that the original date in the legislation was 30 April 2013. So all organisations affected by this legislation will be given a total of just one extra month to implement costly reforms and introduce compliance regimes. As I have noted, the coalition believes that one month is not enough. Authorised deposit-taking institutions—ADIs—first-home saver account providers, life insurers and superannuation funds need and want at least a year. However, this Labor government does not listen to stakeholders. It pays lip service to their concerns by giving them one extra month to significantly alter system-wide processes.


This is a symptom of what the coalition has been saying all along about this legislation. The government has abused process with the manner in and timing with which this bill was introduced into parliament. Most fundamentally, the government must update the explanatory memorandum and be upfront about the impact this legislation and its subsequent changes will have over the forward estimates. The government has not yet done so. It is more interested in rushing through the legislation, making hurried changes and leaving it to the industry and consumers to worry about the consequences afterwards. This hurried process did not have to happen. From the outset, Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions told the committee that the government should delay implementation. The coalition senators noted the response of the Australian Bankers' Association, which acknowledged that:


…the proposed timing for implementation and a commencement of 31 December 2012 is unrealistic, being in less than 2 months and falling during a period when banks implement freezes on any technology or IT systems changes. It is estimated that banks and other ADIs will require at least 6 months to make all the necessary changes, inform customers in a legally compliant manner, and meet compliance requirements.


I turn now to look at the individual sections of the bill. Firstly, Schedule 1 of the bill amends section 69 of the Banking Act 1959 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions. These changes will reduce the period before an amount payable by an ADI is treated as unclaimed money from seven years to three years. The test of engagement the government has chosen in determining whether an account is to be treated as unclaimed money is whether a transaction has occurred in the account for that period of time. What is even more alarming is that until yesterday the inactivity test would have been applied at the account level, not the customer level. So we could have ended up with the situation where an active customer with a pre-existing relationship with an ADI had several accounts but might have had one account that they were not using. For that one single account, the money would have been deemed 'inactive' and transferred to consolidated revenue, despite their being an active customer. This change had potential widespread consequences for many Australians. 


As the shadow Treasurer has highlighted to the House, there might be many examples of an Australian worker who has been offered a post overseas for three years, who has money sitting in a bank account, who leaves their money in that account accumulating interest and who does not make any further deposits or withdrawals in that period. For the purposes of this bill, their deposit is treated as unclaimed funds and therefore is able to be transferred into consolidated revenue. The coalition still has deep reservations as to the potential unintended consequences that this legislation may have for many Australians with untouched funds in bank accounts.


Secondly, Schedule 2 to of this bill amends the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by first-home saver account providers. The new law amends sections 17A and 51C of the FHSA Act to change the unclaimed funds period from seven years to three years. Since the introduction of First Home Save Accounts in the 2008-09 budget, the Australian economy has continued to grapple with the effects of the global financial crisis. Many Australians may have started up a first-home saver account and then been affected by economic circumstances such as rising cost-of-living pressures, and therefore they may not have been able to make contributions. Today's bill means that some of these accounts are at risk of being claimed by the government. 


Thirdly, schedule 3 of the bill amends section 216 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 to provide for the new arrangements for unclaimed life insurance funds. Unclaimed moneys include sums payable on the maturity of a policy which are not claimed within seven years after the maturity date of the policy. The new arrangements will reduce the period from seven years to three years before life insurance funds are treated as unclaimed.


Fourthly, schedule 4 of the bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 to change arrangements for the transfer of lost member accounts to the tax office and to provide for the payment of interest on unclaimed superannuation money. Lost superannuation with balances of less than $2,000 will be deemed inactive after only three years; currently it is seven years. The coalition's dissenting report notes that this has the potential to make worse off those already vulnerable in our community—that is, those who take the most time to accumulate anywhere close to $2,000 in a superannuation account. We are talking about young people, low-income earners and new earners.


I was very concerned about the reduction in the time of inactivity from five years to only 12 months. Yesterday afternoon, the government acknowledged this problem in their legislation and announced that accounts which are active but where the member is uncontactable will not be transferred to the ATO. This is an embarrassing turnaround from the government. I am glad that they finally acknowledged the concerns relating to the nature of superannuation accounts.


Many young people and low-income earners will have multiple jobs and multiple super funds. The immediate pay packet of someone earning a low wage might be more pressing in terms of updating addresses and other contact information. Yet, if they then move house—and even if their super account is still receiving contributions—their account can be deemed lost if communication has been attempted twice. Therefore, to assist in protecting active but lost accounts, the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and the Financial Services Council recommended a minimum two-year period before an account can be deemed lost, and that the two-year clock be reset when a member receives a contribution or any form of contact has occurred.


This is a very reasonable proposition which would add a safeguard for Australian superannuation accounts. I reiterate my gratitude that the Labor government has at least listened to the concerns from industry and consumers so that active accounts will not be transferred to the ATO unnecessarily.


Fifthly, schedule 5 of the bill amends the Corporations Act 2001 and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. We should consider today's bill in the wider context of tax reform—more precisely, the complete lack of fundamental tax reform over the last five years. The Rudd Labor government first commissioned the Henry tax review, which began in 2008. The review received more than 1,500 submissions, cost more than $10 million and finally delivered a report over 1,300 pages long. The report included 138 recommendations to the government, the vast majority of which have not been appropriately considered by the government. Instead, we have a record of no real reform and all we see is new taxes and tax increases.


Successive Labor governments have introduced an additional 20,900 regulations and only repealed 104. Labor promised that they would follow a strict 'one in, one out' approach to the growth of regulation. Instead, for every regulation removed, 200 regulations have been added. While the Treasurer wants to rush this unclaimed money bill through parliament, they do have form when it comes to rapidly raising taxes in Australia. Among many other things, in 2008 they increased the alcopops tax and raised the luxury car tax from 25 to 33 per cent. They have attacked superannuation on numerous occasions. They attacked the medical expense tax offset and abolished the entrepreneur tax offset, and their most recent reform was to force large businesses to pay their pay-as-you-go instalments to the government every month instead of every quarter. This measure is supposed to net the government $5.5 billion in the next financial year.


Mining companies were slugged with a mining tax that has, to date, not raised a single dollar in revenue. With the mining tax, Australian businesses were supposed to see a cut in the company tax rate of 30c to 29c and then to 28c per dollar. The company tax rate today still stands at 30c, and Labor has completely abandoned reform in this area. As a result, the government has amended the net debt ceiling limit four times in the last five years. It first increased the limit in 2008 to $75 billion, then again in 2009, 2011 and 2012, with the limit now standing at $300 billion. As a consequence we have a government that then has to introduce measures in today's Treasury legislation amendment bill—a short-term fix to raise more than $760 million to smooth over the budget figures.


However, these changes have been rushed and ill-considered. The last 24 hours has seen the Labor government confess that it has introduced deeply flawed legislation, something it does not admit to very often, although there are countless examples of legislation passed by the Labor government which should not have been introduced, let alone passed, and which has required significant revision after its passage. With this Treasury bill, the government must at the very least delay the implementation of the bill and listen to the concerns of all stakeholders before imposing unnecessary and additional compliance cost.


The shortcomings that I and my coalition colleagues have outlined, both in the Senate dissenting report and in parliament, must be addressed in the form of further consultation. Despite the changes announced yesterday, this bill is still a bad bill. I therefore strongly oppose today's bill in its current form.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (11:36):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. As the shadow Treasurer has said, this bill should not be called the 'unclaimed money bill'; it should be called the 'government claims your money bill'. I guess you could also call it 'use it or lose it'. Anyone with a bank account should rush out and put in 10c to make sure the account is active. For one of my accounts I will probably have to do that because it is a family trust declared account. It is on my register of interests. It has been sitting there and earning interest for the family trust but it has not been activated or used for four years. That means it will be claimed by the government. This is another typical example of a government putting up a bill when it does not understand the consequences; it does not think through any of the legislation. If there is one thing that the business community knows it is that the government does not understand the knock-on consequences of a lot of the bills that are introduced and how they affect business.


Essentially this bill is an attempt to manufacture a paper surplus for this current financial year in the face of predictions from analysts around the country that there is going to be no budget surplus. In fact, more than half of the Gillard government's promised surplus for 2012-13 is supposed to be achieved through increased revenue from this bill. The government is clearly worried that it will break yet another political commitment that has been repeated time and time again by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. Those opposite are desperate for cash.


We all support getting the budget back to surplus, but the coalition wants a real surplus, not a paper surplus. The context of the legislation is the four largest deficit budgets in Australia's history, remarkably coming after four of the largest surpluses at the end of the prosperous Howard era. The rushing of this legislation will impose costs which will be borne by the account holders and consumers, and we must consider the interests of consumers who are the holders of bank accounts, superannuation accounts and insurance accounts while we assess the merits of this bill. On the other side of the coin are the account providers: banks, super funds, insurance companies or other financial institutions which are having the ill-considered measures imposed upon them without warning or consultation. We heard the Assistant Treasurer at a recent function in Melbourne talk about the Labor government and how much consultation it undertakes with business, but this bill is typical and it shows that the government does not consult with people when bringing in bills. Inadequate warning or consultation is stated in the coalition's dissenting report to the Senate inquiry. The stated objectives of this legislation are sound: to prevent erosion of small, lost or inactive account balances from fees and charges and to reunite unclaimed balances with their owners. However, as with many Labor bills, the substance of the bill does not match the objectives. We had the same problem with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Bill, which I spoke about in September—a bill with stated intentions that no-one could disagree with but with consequences that almost everyone disagreed with. This bill has the same problem.


However, while it was possible to conclude that the charities legislation debacle was just another example to add to the list of incompetence in the Labor Party, with the pink batts and the school halls, this legislation is more of a deliberate attempt to mislead. It is a grab for cash; there can be no doubt about that. The costs imposed on account providers from this legislation, which will be far greater due to the rushed nature of the introduction of the legislation, will inevitably be passed on to consumers—and I think the last thing Australians will want to see at the moment is higher bank charges.


The coalition will move amendments to introduce more realistic implementation time frames, and if these amendments are successful we will not oppose the bill. There may well be some elements in this bill that have merit, but these are largely wiped out by the rushed, ill-considered and disorderly manner in which they are being pursued. Specifically, given the number of problems raised concerning the legislation, the coalition senators of the Economics Committee determined that the sensible decision would be to undertake further consultation and, failing that, the implementation dates for schedules 1, 2 and 4 should be delayed.


I understand that at the eleventh hour the member for Oxley, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is in the chamber at the moment, has flagged changes that push back the reporting and transfer deadlines by a month for both banks and superannuation funds. While it is positive that the government has recognised one of the elements of concern with the legislation, this does not appropriately address the concerns that were raised by industry. From the outset we say that the government needs to explain, in an updated explanatory memorandum to this bill, how these changes will impact the key dates as outlined in the explanatory memorandum for changes in schedules 1, 2, and 4. The government also needs to inform the House, in an updated explanatory memorandum, how these amendments will change the financial impact of the bill over the forward estimates. These last-minute changes give an air of chaos and, by their very nature, limit time for consideration. I am the last speaker on this bill, and many have spoken over the last two sitting weeks. To rush through these changes at the end, without giving people a chance to digest them, analyse them and see what the impact is on the budget, is poor.


This bill seeks to make significant amendments to the Banking Act 1959, the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008, the Life Insurance Act 1995, the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001. The bill makes various cut-and-paste amendments to existing acts that give effect to the unclaimed moneys measures announced in the 2012-13 MYEFO. These amendments will impact arrangements relating to the transfer of unclaimed moneys to ASIC for bank accounts and life insurance policies, lost member accounts to the ATO for the superannuation, and unclaimed moneys for company moneys. This bill will bring forward the time at which money is recognised under the relevant law as lost or unclaimed, leaving Australians everywhere vulnerable to this government's greedy reach.


This bill affects many financial institutions and many different kinds of assets held by Australians. Schedule 1 of this bill amends section 69 of the Banking Act 1959 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by Australian deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs. These changes will reduce the period before an amount payable by an ADI is treated as unclaimed moneys from seven years to a period of only three years. If this bill passes, money held in ADIs will be deemed as unclaimed if a transaction has not occurred in the account for that period of time. This excludes payment of interest accrued. This change has mammoth potential widespread consequences for many Australians. For instance, say an Australian worker who has been offered a post overseas for the next four years decides to leave a sizeable amount of money in a high-interest bank account to accumulate interest. This person, who for whatever reason has chosen not to make any further deposits or withdrawals for that period of time, will, under this bill, have their deposit treated as unclaimed moneys. These funds will be moved to the government's own account, known as the consolidated revenue fund, and used to pad out the bottom line of that financial year's budget. In the Senate report a number of concerns were raised, which were shared by coalition senators, about the reduction by four years in the inactivity test period. The senators concluded that the three-year inactivity test for bank accounts is too short and needs to be reviewed to consider whether five years would be a more appropriate duration. Accounts which might be affected include those of Australians being posted overseas and accounts owned by children or set up for children's savings but without a contribution during the three years. In the case of a first home saver account, hard times can mean that contributions are not made for at least three years. Can you imagine the number of people that might be affected by an arbitrary three-year test? I imagine that is why the government is so keen to act this financial year.


The coalition dissenting report also pointed out that many account types should be excluded. A submission from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia stated:


A high level analysis by CBA indicates that the majority of account balances at CBA which would be impacted by the proposed changes to unclaimed monies currently receive an interest rate higher than the CPI linked rate which the Bill proposes to be paid on those balances once transferred to unclaimed monies.


So, a three-year requirement would be detrimental to a large number of Australians. Another recommendation from the coalition Senate report was that inactivity should be tested at the account holder level. If an inactive account is held by a consumer with one or more accounts at the bank, strongly suggesting that the customer is still alive and engaged with the bank, then the balance of the inactive account should not be deemed unclaimed and transferred to consolidated revenue. As such, where a customer holds multiple accounts with the bank, the inactivity test should be elevated to the level of the customer to help avoid unintended consequences.


The government also plans to appropriate funds from first home saver accounts by amending the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed monies held by the first home saver account providers. This is outlined in schedule 2. Once again, the bill before the parliament today would amend section 17A and 51C of the FHSA Act to change unclaimed monies for the period from seven years to three years as with the changes to the ADIs.


The government announced the introduction of first home saver accounts in its own 2008-09 budget to assist parents in saving for their children's future. Many parents have established these accounts for their children but may not have been able to make contributions recently for a variety of factors, be it the ever rising cost of living that this government does not acknowledge or a temporary lack of disposable income. Some of these accounts have a very real risk of being claimed by the government, particularly when holders of these accounts have not been able to afford to contribute to their deposits over the past three years or have not been in contact with the bank which holds these deposits. The coalition considers that this four-year reduction also increases, unreasonably, the risks of unintended consequences and we suggest that this bill be delayed a year to allow sufficient time for consultation.


This bill will amend the Life Insurance Act 1995 as per schedule 3 to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed life insurance monies. Life insurance companies are required to report on and pay unclaimed monies to the Commonwealth. Unclaimed monies include sums payable on the maturity of a policy which are not claimed within seven years after the maturity date of the policy. The new arrangements outlined in this bill will reduce the period before life insurance monies are treated as unclaimed from seven to three years. It is, again, not clear how these provisions will apply to contemporary life insurance products or policies, and this confusion has arisen because the government has not had time to properly develop the legislation.


Schedule 4 to the bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999 to change the circumstances in which small lost member accounts and accounts of unidentifiable members must be transferred to the ATO to provide for the payment of CPI interest on unclaimed superannuation money. Again, the coalition recommends that the proposed amendments in schedule 4 of the bill be delayed for a full year to 31 December 2013 to address the critical issues raised since the announcement of this measure. Lost superannuation accounts with balances of less than $2,000 that have up until now been inactive for only three years—currently this is set at seven years—and accounts of identifiable members that have been inactive for 12 months will now be required to be paid to Australian Taxation Office. It is not clear how legislative change will apply to people who have moved jobs and have multiple superannuation accounts, spent time overseas or moved residences. The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees noted in its submission that the problem of transferring such active accounts to consolidated revenue was that it was most likely to impact new employees, young people and low-income earners as these contributing members typically take the most time to accumulate account balance over $2,000. 


This bill seeks to amend longstanding pillars of our financial services industry. Changes to these acts must never be made lightly, and the coalition will not facilitate a government that is acting out of self-interest as opposed to properly considered public policy. The coalition has advocated for a wide range of review measures to ensure that this bill has had due assessment to ensure that there were no unintended consequences. This is a bill that this government has concocted out of desperation to save its crumbling budget bottom line. 


The coalition senators reached three recommendations, which include various parts of the schedules 1, 2 and 4, and the amendments to be moved by the shadow Treasurer this afternoon will reflect this. I urge the government to support them for the benefit of both consumers and industry who have been caught unawares by this rushed legislation. One of the other unintended consequences is for people who develop dementia. What will be done with their accounts? Will the government take money from people who are getting ill? Is that right? You have said they will keep their money; will they?

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (11:51):  I stand today to speak to the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012. From the outset, let me say that I have real concerns with the speed at which this bill has been brought to this House. I understand from the government's perspective why it needs to introduce this bill, which will bring $700 million into consolidated revenue and some $886 million into consolidated revenue over the forward estimates. This consolidated revenue benefit is designed to do nothing more than prop up the budget in an attempt to produce a surplus to make the government look good. This is not earnings by government. This is taking the money which individuals or corporations own and that is in bank accounts, life insurance and superannuation policies that actually belong to someone. Your excuse is that this money does not belong to someone, so therefore it belongs to the government, and therefore the government can use it to prop up its ineptitude in managing a budget. I have real concerns with the speed. 


These concerns have been expressed in dissenting reports put down in the Senate. In particular, one of the things that really concerns me is in relation to superannuation, and the fact that the government will deem an account lost or inactive if there has been no action within 12 months. There are a large number of people, particularly young Australians who, when they leave school and start work might have a multitude of jobs; might amass a lot of small amounts of superannuation which they have not consolidated into one account. They might go travelling or they might go overseas for 12 months as a rite of passage as they explore offshore opportunities. Indeed, they might even go bush for 12 months and jackaroo or work up in Cairns in the tourism industry and be deemed non-contactable. Therefore, their hard earned money will go into consolidated revenue for this government. It is true that when it is claimed back they will be able to get an interest supplement from the government at the lowest rate.




Mr Ripoll:
  Less fees and charges.




Mr BALDWIN:
  Well, Parliamentary Secretary, let's be honest about it: this is about a cash grab to line up the bottom line of your budget and nothing more. That is why it is being done with this speed. And those young children sitting up in the gallery watching you would say, 'What are you doing to my future earning capacity when you have designed a scheme that now, within 12 months of deemed inactivity, by criteria set down by you and your colleagues that will take that money away?'


I have real concerns, and I believe that this bill before the House is going to be supported by Independents because there was a deal done. And that deal is the poker machines legislation which will be brought into this House tonight, which the government previously said would not work—in fact, Minister Macklin said on a number of occasions that the voluntary precommitment would not work. But, such is the demand from perhaps the member for Denison that he wants his bill through, and the government needs his support on this bill to get it through to prop up the bottom line. This government is selling out the hotel and the club industries for the purposes of getting this bill through. I will have more to say on that tonight, when I speak to the gambling reforms legislation.


I want to say that I feel very uncomfortable with this bill. I am glad that the shadow Treasurer will be moving a number of regulatory changes to make sure that it conforms more with sound, sensible responses—particularly at the time in which this will all come together. But I want to say I feel uncomfortable, because it is clear that this bill does nothing more than raid the bank accounts and superannuation funds of people to prop up the government's bottom line. Be honest about it.




Mr Ripoll:
  You're just making it up!




Mr BALDWIN:
  I'm not making it up, Parliamentary Secretary. Here you are, with your forward estimates, your schedules to the bill—schedules 1, 2 and 3: banking, first home saver account, life insurance this year will deliver you $93.4 million as you raid it off people; schedule 4: superannuation, $513.5 million; schedule 5: companies and corporations, $94 million; $700 million to your bottom line. So it is not true revenue, it is not income, it is not money the government has earned—it is money you are taking out of the accounts of everyday Australians to prop up your financial position to make you look like you could be somewhat of a responsible financially accurate government. You are not: you are robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it is not your money.


I am not going to speak any further on this bill. I will be opposing it. I think it is wrong. I think the delivery method is wrong. I think the speed and access are wrong. And in particular I feel that the fact that this bill has brought other bills into action because of deals and swaps and a need for votes is going to do immeasurable harm to Australia.

"Jensen, Dennis, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (11:57):  With the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012 the government yet again travels down a well-worn path, with another blatant cash grab of Australians' hard-earned income. I have no hesitation in opposing this bill, because of the haste with which this government has chosen to introduce this legislation. Gone is sufficient time to assess the impact and unintended consequences, replaced with a desperate dash to the next budget—framed by creative accounting towards a non-paper surplus.


Again, the people of Tangney and all other Australians are left disregarded by a shambles of naive legislation and ignorant policy. Reforms to the Banking Act 1969 make new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held in deposit-taking institutions. The coalition had sought to refer the bill to the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for prudent and measured assessment. Why this government has not sent this bill to the parliamentary inquiry lends itself to the question: what are the members of this Labor government seeking to achieve? And do they fully understand the potential implications for Australians? Instead, this bill has been rushed to the House for debate because Labor sees opportunity to profit from those who can least afford it. We are three days from this place rising for 2012. It is quite apparent the government is bent on rushing this and a swathe of other bills to a vote to temper current debt of $252.9 billion. In addition to the Banking Act 1969, this bill also seeks to amend unclaimed money measures which were flagged in the government's 2012-13 MYEFO, to the First Home Savers Account Act 2008, the Life Insurance Act 1985, the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 and the Corporations Act 2001—the focus: arrangements relating to the transfer of unclaimed moneys to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for bank accounts and life insurance policies, lost members' accounts at the Australian Taxation Office for superannuation, and unclaimed moneys for companies' moneys.


Similar to most of the economic policies of the current Treasurer, this legislation will bring forward to 2012-13 a significant sum of money that the legislation will recognise as unclaimed, lost or abandoned. This figure is forecast to be $762 million. To do this, changes will reduce the period before an amount payable by an Australian deposit-taking institution is treated as unclaimed moneys from seven years to three.


Let me be clear. If a worker who has money sitting in a bank account accumulating interest and does not make any further deposits or withdrawals for that period of time, at the three-year mark they will have their deposit treated as unclaimed moneys. These funds will then be moved to consolidated revenue. It is towards Orwellian that government would come in and just pluck money from a private account because it has not been active for three years. This is the reverse Robin Hood. It means that 'small' Australians—not the big end of town but the small end of town that Labor purports to support—will be robbed by the biggest institution in the land, the Australian government. This is from the Labor Party, which prides itself on fighting for the little guy. Some fight!


How can an Australian government head down this path—to tap into private funds just because Australians rightly chose to leave money in a particular account? This is not the type of government I want. This is not the type of government the people of Tangney want—and they are telling me just that. Should this bill pass this place, I imagine many people, young and old, will step back 50 years and stuff their money under the mattress—better having it stagnant and not interest bearing than losing the money all together. This policy is archaic, deceptive and impractical.


Schedule 2 of this bill amends the First Home Saver Accounts Act 2008—an amendment to a bill introduced by this government relatively recently to provide for new arrangements for unclaimed moneys held by the first home saver account providers. Amendments change, once again, the unclaimed moneys period from seven years to three years. Again, this schedule makes us question Labor's due diligence when introducing legislation it has drafted, with amendments after just a few years because the government has seen fiscal opportunity and seen fit to amend legislation for government gain at the cost of the individual citizen.


Surely there is a better way to balance the budget—even after this government has produced four of the biggest budget deficits in Australia's history. Prudent, fiscally responsible and competent government should always strive for higher productivity and higher standards of living for all Australians. Pinching $2,000 here and $3,000 there, while unjust, is also bureaucratically implausible. The cost of administering this poorly developed policy surely outweighs the net gain to the government.


Now I go to schedule 3, concerning life insurance. Currently life insurance companies are required to report on and pay unclaimed moneys to the Commonwealth. Unclaimed moneys include sums payable on the maturity of a policy which are not claimed within seven years after the maturity date of that policy. The new arrangements will reduce the period before life insurance moneys are treated as unclaimed moneys from seven to—you guessed it—three years. Once again, we see a reduction in the time frame, and it will allow the government to step in and take that money. If someone legitimately choses to have a bank account and leave money in there for more than three years, and not wish to add to it and not wish to subtract from it, surely they have the right to do that and not be worried that a government is going to step in and appropriate the money.


Schedule 4 of the bill amends the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act. Lost super accounts with balances of less than $2,000 that have until now been active for only three years—currently this is seven—and accounts of unidentifiable members that have been inactive for 12 months are now to be paid to the Australian Taxation Office. Note the figure of less than $2,000. Once again, we are not talking about the big end of town. Schedule 5 deals with the Corporations Act. Once again, the government seeks to move the goalposts so it is easier to get hold of private citizens' money. 


This bill just beggars belief. It changes the pillars of our financial services industry. It is clear that the rushed time lines and implementation of this bill have been driven by nothing more than a Treasurer pretending that he can deliver a surplus, a surplus that is at risk without the passing of this bill. The coalition and I will not support or facilitate a government that acts on political interest with disregard for properly considered public policy. Good government is the goal of all members in this place, Labor and Liberal, and it saddens me that the Labor Party have sold what was left of their dignity to manufacture a superficial surplus.


The Leader of the Opposition's team have left this government naked. The bill exposes the wanton greed and lust for power endemic in tired and troubled Labor. This bill generates $762 million, which is a very convenient sum when the surplus is expected to be a wafer thin $1.077 billion. There is no way around it. The Treasurer is robbing not only Peter but also Paul. The only people getting paid are Labor cronies in unions and backroom boys. 


In the final analysis, it is difficult to understand not the bill itself but where it is coming from, who is driving it. Is it the Australian Bankers Association? No, because they remain sceptical of its necessity and of the transitional administrative arrangements. Is it the lobby groups and/or academic groups? No, because they point to the lack of any evidence to suggest that three years is the optimal time to take a person's money. The job of a government should be to safeguard and protect the properties of people, not to meander into their bank accounts and confiscate their hard earned treasure. This bill goes to prove the point that the Leader of the Opposition and I have made, time and time again: a government big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take everything you have.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (12:08):  I thank all members who have spoken and contributed to this debate. I can understand that there is some confusion, although I find it difficult to understand why that is the case. We have clearly articulated exactly what this bill does—and the amendments to this bill—in protecting people's savings and superannuation, protecting their money and, for the first time, ensuring that people's lost accounts are not eroded away by fees and charges, and that for the first time they also have an opportunity to continue to earn interest. These are good for consumers and good for the country. The bill is certainly not what has been described by a number of members opposite. In fact, it is the case that the rules on how unclaimed moneys are dealt with, with ASIC and the ATO, are in currently place. They currently exist. In that effect there are no changes. The changes are to when it takes place. It will happen more quickly, but that is a really good thing for consumers because the earlier it happens the earlier their lost accounts can be reconnected and the quicker they can re-access their funds.


The interesting part about the different elements that have been raised is that the reason the accounts are lost in the first place is people have for whatever reason become disconnected and they have no mechanism to reconnect with their lost account in whatever form. No method exists. If it is with the bank it is not in the bank's interests to put forward that you reconnect with your funds and take them out, but it is in the government's interest that ordinary people are reconnected with their funds, that the fees and charges stop being taken out and eroding a person's savings, and that savings are added to by giving people CPI interest—yes, at the lowest rate, but interest so that the value of their money maintains value over time. These are really good, sensible changes.


I am prepared to have debates and arguments over time frames—whether it is seven years or three or whatever other time frame—but that does not change the principle. The principle we have before us is that we are trying to save people's money by giving them interest for the first time, to stop the erosion of the value of their money by having fees and charges taken out for the first time, and to make sure that the government, through the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, actively reconnects people with their money. Right now, what happens in the absence of these very good changes we are putting forward is that those unclaimed moneys go on for not three years or seven years but 10 or 15 years because people do not know. The reason they are unclaimed is a lot of people do not know they exist, or they are overseas, or whatever the case may be. The faster we can reconnect people the better it is.


There is a whole range of other issues that have been raised by opposition members trying to confuse this area—that the government is somehow reaching into people's accounts. That is not the case at all. This is an amendment to existing laws about things that currently happen, and this is an improvement to what we have seen in the past. This bill is directly intended to do exactly what it does, which is re-unite Australians with their lost moneys faster and to protect that lost money from inflation and fees. I am astonished that anyone in this place would oppose it.


We have made a number of technical amendments and we have clarified a range of areas—because there are a lot of technical issues in some of these matters—and this now means it is clear for banks and for consumers. We have given the appropriate time frames for organisations to be able to implement these new measures. Contrary to the suggestions from the opposition, this bill does not introduce a new regime for lost moneys. Rather, the bill will deliver better outcomes for consumers by making a small number of refinements to the existing regime. This is the disingenuous element of some of what has been said in this debate.


These are laws that existed under the Howard government. What we have done and what we continue to do in government is take those laws and make them better. Following consultation with the industry the government will move amendments to the bill that will provide industry with more time to implement the changes. There is no argument from industry about whether this is right or wrong, because it is currently being done. We are giving industry a little bit more time to be able to properly—



Mr Hockey interjecting—




Mr RIPOLL:
  We get laughter from the opposition. More time—isn't that what they were saying? Isn't that what they wanted? That is exactly what we have done—we have given them a little bit more time. It will happen in good time because the faster these changes happen the better it is for consumers. If we used the principle that the opposition brings to the table there would be no time, because they could never find the time in 12 years in government—there was never any time. There was never any time to make any good changes. We will take the time and we will do it.


Specifically, we have also authorised for deposit-taking institutions, First Home Saver Account providers and life insurers to be required to make supplementary assessment and transfer by 31 May 2013. That is sufficient time for the changes to be adopted, adapted and implemented so that people can be earlier reconnected with their money. This provides an extra five months for these institutions to identify lost accounts and an extra two months to transfer them, as requested by industry groups such as Abacus. We agree with them. Let us give them a little bit more time. Let us make these changes. But the faster we get there the quicker people will be reconnected. All the evidence is on the table. All you have to do is go through the evidence from history. Have a look at what happened with unclaimed moneys in each previous year. There were more and more of them over time and no effort was made—nothing was done—to reconnect people. As soon as this Labor government started to make an effort, we saw a change. We saw people who had lost accounts being reconnected with their accounts. We are seeing people with lost super being reconnected with their super. We are seeing the things that this bill intends to do working.


We have had more evidence recently. There has been a bit of media activity around this issue, including on the radio. The government and ASIC have promoted the fact that people ought to go and use the free search tool at ASIC or the ATO to look for their lost accounts. A whole drift of people have gone there to reconnect for the first time. This bill will assist people to do that.


This is the key that the opposition needs to understand. Most people have no way of knowing that they have lost money. Even if you thought you had, where would you look? It is lost. Where would you start? But as soon as it transfers from the institution—the bank or wherever it might be—to ASIC or the ATO you can search for it. It does not matter how long you wait. You can search it now or you can search it in 10 years and your money will still be there. It will not have been eroded by fees and charges. The real value of your money will have been maintained because you will get interest. For the first time, you will get interest. How could you oppose that? In 10 years time, somebody who lost their money will be able to reconnect with their funds. Under this mob's rule, what happened was that it just stayed lost. That is what they want: they want the money to stay lost. They want the lost accounts to stay lost. They want to make an amendment all right: one to take the time period from the old seven years to forever, because they are not interested in reconnecting people with their funds. We are and that is exactly what we are doing.


Consultation with industry has identified some areas in which the intent of the amendments can be clarified. These issues can and will be dealt with through regulations, as per my press release yesterday.


These reforms will ensure that more Australians are reunited with their lost moneys. They will also ensure that this happens faster. That is the whole point. Why wait any longer? If somebody has a lost account—lost moneys in either their life insurance policy, superannuation, bank accounts or even property—why should they have to wait any further? Let us reconnect people with their money and let us do it now.


There were a range of issues raised by speakers on the other side. I will make a few points to clarify things. The principles in the existing legislation will not be changed. The principles remain exactly the same. At some point in time, be it seven years or three years, that money will be transferred—and this was done during the Howard era—from an account that is lost, unidentifiable or inactive to the ATO or to ASIC. What we are doing is making that happen faster so that you can reconnect with your funds faster. The principles have not changed. When those opposite say that the government is taking your money, that is not the case, because that is the existing law—it is exactly what happens now; it is exactly what happened during the Howard era. We did not hear them at that point in time saying that they were taking that money. The key principle differences are that it stops your money being eroded through fees and charges for the first time and that you get interest for the first time.


The other concern from the opposition revolves around speed: it is all too fast, according to them. We may be moving too quickly for the opposition, but we can walk, chew gum and breathe at the same time and introduce good amendments. This is not too fast. This is appropriate. It is about time that people are reconnected with their funds in a more timely manner. Whether that lost money is in superannuation, life insurance policies or bank accounts, the settings that we are putting in place are appropriate—and particularly for super. There is a complexity to super, particularly for young people with multiple accounts. In fact, superannuation is one of the areas in which there is an enormous amount of lost money. The shorter the time period, the quicker it moves across, the faster that you will be able to identify and reconnect with your superannuation. That is great for consumers. It means that they can get their money faster.


The issues that have been raised have been more than amply dealt with. The amendments that we have put forward, after good consultation with the industry about implementation periods, are sensible and appropriate. The government commends this bill to the House, because it is good for consumers and good for reconnecting people with their lost moneys.

The SPEAKER
 (15:11):  In the last sitting week the Manager of Opposition Business raised as a matter of privilege two claims that the House had been misled. One concerned an answer that had been given by the Treasurer; the other concerned a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence. I have been able to speak to the Manager of Opposition Business about these matters but I should also report back to the House on them. 


There is no doubt that a member found to have deliberately misled the House can be found to have committed a contempt. Although many such complaints have been made in the past, to date no Speaker of the House has found that a prima facie case has been made out, and precedent to enable a motion to be referred has never been given as of right. However, the House recently agreed to refer such a matter in relation to the member for Dobell. I have told the Manager of Opposition Business that on the information available to me the circumstances of the matter which he has raised would not justify departure from the position that has been taken by many of my predecessors.


The second issue was raised yesterday by the honourable member for Wentworth in respect of the term 'mendacious'. The problem with this word is that it can mean false or untrue, but it can also mean lying. I make four points. First, like all Speakers I judge these matters not only on the actual words used but having regard to the circumstances and the context in which they are used. Secondly, members may not accuse each other of lying. Accordingly, if a sharp accusation is directed to a member in terms such as 'You are mendacious,' I would regard it as unparliamentary.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  You can laugh all you like but this is the standard that has been set over many years. In other circumstances the word might be allowed; for example, the statement 'That is mendacious' or a reference to the government's or opposition's mendacity might be tolerated. Third, I repeat that I will not issue a list of words that may not be used. Such a list is unhelpful and does not recognise the importance of tone and context.


Finally, I assure the House that I applaud all efforts to improve the civility of our proceedings and I am sure members share this goal. I ask them to exercise restraint in the terms they use about each other.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (15:16):  I understand the minister for immigration may be joining us for this MPI today, and I know that the member for North Sydney would be keen to know that because he has been looking for Captain Emad just like I have—




Mr Hockey:
  I have!




Mr MORRISON:
  and maybe the minister will be able to tell us where Captain Emad is today, given that on the last few occasions he has been out searching!


This is a serious matter—five years of failure that have no peer. Earlier in this place today we were debating, as we continue to debate, the excision bill that is currently before the parliament. Back in 2006, it was the current Minister for Immigration and Citizenship who described that bill, should it be passed, as 'a stain on our national character'. One thing that is very clear is that the only stain is on that side of the House for their failure to put in place effective border protection measures over the last five years. In that 2006 speech, the minister for immigration said that he thought amending the bill was 'like putting lipstick on a pig'. The government's hypocrisy is such that it is now coming into this place trying to use that very pig, as the minister described it, to try and save their own political bacon—because it is this government, as it creeps from failure to backflip on this issue, that continues to repeat every single day it is in office the failures that have put Australia in such an adverse position when it comes to our borders. Labor's failures on our borders are without peer and, without any doubt, they have exceeded our worst expectations. Five years of failure, rising costs, chaos, tragedy and now hypocrisy on a grand scale: all of this has been on Labor's watch.


I refer now to page 2 of the Immigration Detention Statistics Summary of 23 November 2007, the day before the federal election of that year. When the Howard government left office in November 2007, the number of people who had arrived illegally in Australia by boat, described in here as 'unauthorised boat arrivals', who were in any form of detention—including community detention, alternative temporary detention in the community, immigration detention centres, residential housing and immigration transit accommodation, all of these places—was four. Four.



Opposition members:  Four!




Mr MORRISON:
  Four. You could count the number of people who had arrived illegally by boat who were in any form of detention, going through processing, on one hand. There were four. I seek leave to table the document.


Leave granted.




Mr MORRISON:
  I turn now to the Immigration Detention Statistics Summary for 30 September 2012, the most recent that the government has published. It is a much bigger report this time; it goes for far more pages—there is a lot more to report. Going to page 5 of that report, the number of people in any of those forms of detention I just referred to who had arrived illegally by boat as of 30 September 2012 was 8,987. Now, that does not include the 4,000 or thereabouts we estimate are on bridging visas and out in the community, following the government's decision on 25 November last year; and it does not include the 4,000 that have turned up since that report was published. So it has gone from just four people to, we estimate now—including those inside and outside detention—over 12,000. If those metrics do not speak of policy failure, then I do not know what does.


There is a very interesting chart in that report. It is a chart showing the population in immigration detention since January 1990. If you want to know what lift-off looks like, this is what it looks like. When you get to January 2009, once the effects of the government's decision to abolish the Howard government measures took place, you get lift-off when it comes to illegal boat arrivals. You get lift-off. That graph is included in the earlier reports, Madam Speaker, and I seek leave to table that report of 30 September 2012.


Leave granted.




Mr MORRISON:
  We have had to produce that result. Over 30,000 people have arrived on illegal boats since this government abolished the effective policies of the Howard government. That is a large number of people. The numbers that we might take under our immigration program may be relatively smaller, but 30,000 people is a lot of people. To give people an idea of how many people that might be: it is bigger than a town like Alice, as I said on the weekend; it is bigger than Albany; it is bigger than Busselton, as the member behind me mentioned; it is 1½ times the size of Goulburn; it is bigger than the city of Warrnambool; it is bigger than Nowra-Bomaderry, where I was last week; it is bigger than Mount Gambier; it is bigger than Gawler; it is bigger than Victor Harbor.


If you want to get another idea of how many people have turned up, then maybe the member for Lindsay can assist. The next time the member for Lindsay, the commander, is piped aboard the Panthers' stadium out there in Penrith, he should know that the number of people who have arrived on illegal boats under the watch of the government of which he has been a part is 1½ times the number of people you can put into the Panthers' stadium; it is 1½ times the number that you can put into the Sharks' stadium, in my own electorate of Cronulla; it is 1½ times the number you can put into Parramatta Stadium. For any major rugby league ground you go to, whether in New South Wales or Queensland, you will find that it is 1½ times the number you can put in it. It is more than you can put into Canberra Stadium, not far from this place.


Thirty thousand is a significant number to have arrived. For the Howard government to achieve that, it would have taken half a millennium, in terms of the number of people that arrived in the last six years after the Howard government's effective border protection policies were put in place.


This is the record of the government's failure on our borders, and it is getting worse. It is not getting better, it is getting worse, because more than half of those arrivals have turned up since the beginning of this year. More than a third of them have turned up since 1 July this year. Remember: on 1 July this year, the Treasurer stood at that dispatch box and presented a budget which said that the average number of people he estimated arrived every month was 450. The average figure for this financial year is more than 2,000. If you were to use the methodology adopted by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for when MYEFO would have updated that figure, the 30-month average, then the figure now underpinning the budget would be around 715 per month, which is less than half what is occurring, which means that this budget, if anyone ever doubted it in the first place, is blown, and they have blown it on boats alone.


The cost of these increases in arrivals is breathtaking. The blow-out alone over the last four years, going out over the forward estimates, is $6.6 billion, and that does not include the cost of increasing the refugee and humanitarian intake, which is the policy of this government, to 20,000, which is 25,000 extra places over the next four years at a cost of $1.3 billion and at a cost of more than $50,000 per place.


To give people some understanding of the rate of increase: in 2007-08, the cost of managing this issue was $85 million a year; in this year, not including capital costs, the cost will be $2.4 billion. This chart I am showing sets out—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Cook can desist from showing the chart.




Mr MORRISON:
  the high level of increase in costs, which we have seen to rise from $85 million a year to $113 million in 2008-09, to $292 million in 2009-10, to $879 million in 2010-11, to $1.4 billion in 2011-12, and this year to $2.4 billion—and that is based on a budget which is estimating arrivals at less than half the rate that is occurring. This is a government that has blown the borders and, as a result, they have blown the budget, too, without any hesitation of doubt.


The humanitarian consequences of these failures are the most significant, and we know of the loss of life that has occurred over the last five years—we estimate it to be over 1,000 people; how many it is, we really do not know. We also know that over 8,000 people have missed out on protection visas in Australia, waiting in places all around the world, because they did not come on a boat under this government. These are the human costs of the government's failure over the last five years.


It all results and stems from an unwillingness by the government to recognise when they have got something wrong—and I do not mean politically wrong, because that is the only thing the government ever seems to be able to come to terms with, but when they have got the policy wrong. And these policies will continue to fail as long as the government continues to cling to the failure.


Labor have decided—rather than to restore the measures that worked, as the member for Berowra was saying just before we came in here for question time—to go their own way. And go their own way they have. They decided to chance their arm, and the record of failure is as I have related to the House: the asylum freeze, the East Timor farce, and the failed Malaysian people swap, which the government itself has abandoned.


The government itself abandoned the Malaysian people swap, refusing to take any genuine action after the Houston report. We continue to make clear our objections to this policy, but the government itself has decided to just drop it, leave it alone and blame the opposition rather than take action. Yet one of the key actions they could take is this. Malaysia has a choice, and the government has a choice in its dealings with Malaysia. Malaysia could sign the refugee convention which would ensure there were binding legal protections in Malaysia. I think that is highly unlikely. I do not think it will happen. The other thing Malaysia could do, which the government could negotiate for, is to introduce legally binding protections in their immigration act. Has the minister raised that with the Malaysian government since the Houston report was handed down? I doubt it, given that a year ago, almost, he told me that they had rejected that notion.


The policy of bridging visas and community release announced just a year ago on 25 November has proved to be an absolute disaster, with over 16,000 people—well over half of the total arrivals—turning up since the government introduced that policy. After being dragged kicking and screaming to reopen Nauru and Manus Island, the daily problems of the government's inability to implement anything effectively continue to be demonstrated, and I will have the opportunity to witness that firsthand when I head to Nauru next week. The no-advantage policy which the government have thrown their arms around but are yet incapable of explaining to anyone also continues to be a thorn in the side of a government struggling and still trying to find their way on an issue where the Prime Minister herself said they had lost their way when she took office. They are no closer to finding it today. In fact, they are further away than they have ever been.


There is a different and better way forward. It is the way forward that the coalition offered when we were in government and it can turn failure around and turn it into success. It can turn it into success with policies that have worked. Those policies still have their doubters, just as they had back in 2001. In the Australian on 1 September 2001, it was said when John Howard had turned around the Tampa: 'The government is hoping its hard-line approach towards the Tampa will bear fruit. That is unlikely given the global reality of 22 million refugees, many of whom are languishing in countries on the Indian Ocean Rim.' Well, they were wrong. All those who said John Howard's policies would not work were wrong. Those who say they will not work again are wrong.


We will restore those policies, and we will ensure that this country once again has a government that believes in strong border protection and implements strong border protection. As we go to the next election, there will be a simple question: who do you trust to protect the nation's borders—the mob who have trashed our borders with over 30,000 arrivals, $6.6 billion in cost blowouts and carnage, chaos, cost and tragedy to back up that record, or a coalition who have the conviction, the belief, the policy, the resolve and the record? That is the choice. By making the choice of the coalition we can send a message to the people smugglers that they will understand.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (15:31):  It is now almost 12 months since 200 people died off the coast of Indonesia. On 18 December, 200 people drowned off the coast of Java trying to get to Australia. About 100 bodies were eventually washed up upon the shore; 100 remained at the bottom of the Java Sea. A lot of people have forgotten about that, but I have not. I had been in the job for about four days and the events of that day and the subsequent days are scarred on my memory. The first reports of 87 people having survived were followed by more disappointing reports that only 33 had survived. We saw images on our TV screens and in our newspapers of exhausted, half-dead survivors and heard the stories that followed of people being swallowed up by the ocean.


Ultimately that is what this debate is all about. It is about stopping a repeat of this. It deserves better than the yelling and screaming and the smart lines that often pass for debate on this issue. That is what is wrong with this debate: it has been poisoned by politics. It is rancid with politics. The great irony of all this is that the major parties agree on most things here. The difference is at the margins. But you would not know it from this debate and you would not know it from what you read in the newspapers and see on TV or hear in this place. Why? The reason is that this is not a debate that is principally about policy; it is a debate that is about politics.


Let me give you an example. Four days before those 200 people drowned almost a year ago, the Prime Minister wrote to the Leader of the Opposition. In that letter, the Prime Minister said to the Leader of the Opposition: 'The Australian people expect us to work together to ensure that the national interest is upheld. I would be happy to make Minister Bowen available to meet with Mr Morrison in an attempt to identify a mutually satisfactory outcome.' Two days later, two days before those 200 people drowned, the Leader of the Opposition wrote back. In that letter that Leader of the Opposition in response said: 'I do not see much point.' So you have the Prime Minister in her letter reaching out, saying, 'We need to work together,' and you have an opposition leader in response saying, 'I do not see much point.' He did not see much point in even having a meeting.


The day after those people died, the government wrote to the Leader of the Opposition again and asked him to make the shadow minister for immigration available to sit down with the minister to reach a compromise. He still refused and then he demanded a written proposal from the government before any talks could begin. So we did that. The government gave him a written proposal where we put on the table the offer to implement offshore processing in Nauru and the government's plan with Malaysia. Then, on the morning before those talks were to begin, on the morning before Mr Bowen and Mr Morrison were to sit down, the Leader of the Opposition held a press conference and rejected the written proposal that we had made. So, in effect, the negotiations ended before they began. All of that was in the aftermath of 200 people dying, and he still refused to give the government the powers that we think we need to stop people risking their lives by getting on a boat and possibly dying at sea.


That refusal still exists today. The Leader of the Opposition still refuses to pass legislation to send people to Malaysia. Why is that? My view is that this is about politics. In the debate that we had on this very same issue only a few weeks ago, I pulled out a quote from David Marr's article in the Quarterly Essay. It is a quote that bears repeating. On page 36 of that essay, he says:


WikiLeaks told us how keen the Coalition is to exploit the boats. In late 2009, in the dying days of Malcolm Turnbull's leadership of the Opposition, a ""key Liberal party strategist"" popped in to the US embassy in Canberra to say how pleased the party was that refugee boats were, once again, making their way to Christmas Island. ""The issue was 'fantastic,"" he said. ""And 'the more boats that come the better."" But he admitted they had yet to find a way to make the issue work in their favour: ""his research indicated only a 'slight trend' towards the Coalition.""


That quote tells you everything you need to know about this debate. It tells you why it is so hard to come to an agreement between the two major parties. It explains everything that is going on here. A senior Liberal Party strategist went to the United States embassy to have a meeting, saying 'this issue is fantastic' and 'the more boats that come the better' and expressing their disappointment that they had not been able to get more political benefit out of it already. That is what is wrong with this debate: people who think like this, people who say things like that and people who are more concerned about political advantage than they are about the boats.



Mr Frydenberg interjecting—




Mr CLARE:
  The member for Kooyong might express his disappointment. I know he is a man who would never say things like that. The problem is there are people like that who have decided that the more boats that come the better. We are better than this. The member for Kooyong is better than that and we as a parliament are better than that. We have to get rid of comments like that if we are going to sort this issue out.


There are no easy answers in all of this. This is a wretchedly difficult area of public policy. There are plenty of views, plenty of ideas about how to address it. My view is this. Whatever you think the solution is, we should all agree on this: the government of the day should be given the power that it believes it needs to stop people dying. That is what we did when we were in opposition, when we gave support to John Howard's laws to implement offshore processing, and that is what we have been denied in government by the Liberal Party, by the National Party and by the Greens party. They have all refused to give us the powers that we have come to the view are necessary to help stop people dying at sea.


That is why we set up an expert panel to help to break this political impasse. Headed by Angus Houston, it made 22 recommendations, including offshore processing Nauru—and we have started offshore processing there—and at Manus. That has now begun. It also included doubling the number of refugees that we will take each year, part of increasing our humanitarian program from 13,500 to 20,000. That has been done. We are increasing co-operation, as recommended, between Australia and Indonesia on search and rescue. I visited Indonesia in September with Minister Smith and Minister Albanese and we agreed to six measures to help to do that. That includes making sure that Australian search and rescue gives Indonesian search and rescue the type of ship tracking information and communication via satellite that is necessary to get in touch with merchant ships as quickly as possible and an agreement with Indonesia to allow our search and rescue planes to land and refuel in Indonesia.


The report from Angus Houston and the expert panel also talked about the importance of disrupting boat ventures—stopping people getting on boats before they set to sea. The latest information on that is that so far this year 209 disruptions have occurred, involving 7,964 people, including 120 disruptions from Indonesia, 65 from Sri Lanka, 14 from Thailand, five from Malaysia, four from India and one from Vietnam.


We are also flying people back to Sri Lanka who are not refugees. In the past few weeks we have flown home 650 people, including 50 people today, and there is more to come. The biggest increase that we have seen in boats this year is from Sri Lanka. They are more than half the number, and many of the people on these boats are not refugees. They are economic migrants—people seeking a job, people seeking a better life. They are not entitled to protection, and that is why they are being sent home.


The importance of this should not be underestimated. The threat of death has not deterred many from getting on a boat. But this should. There is no point in paying a people smuggler thousands of dollars to get on a boat if you are going to be flown straight home. That message will hopefully get through to people in Sri Lanka who are thinking about trying their luck and getting on a boat when they see someone in the street who they thought had gone on a boat only a few weeks ago and who is now back home in Sri Lanka. The media plays an important role in getting this message through to people who are thinking about getting on a boat. The headline in the Daily News in Colombo, one of its major newspapers, said this last Tuesday:


Australia issues fresh warning to Lankan 'Boat people'


'YOU'LL BE PACKED OFF IN FIRST AVAILABLE FLIGHT'


This is a tough message, a strong message, but an important message. It is designed to help save lives. It is designed to stop people making that decision to waste their money and potentially risk their lives.


We have to do all of these things I have just outlined and more on top of that. We have to implement each and every one of the recommendations that Angus Houston and his panel recommended. That means Nauru. It means Manus Island. It also means Malaysia. If we are going to tackle this problem for good, we need a regional solution and Malaysia is part of that. That is what the report said. It said it was critical. The opposition have refused to support Malaysia, and the shadow minister articulated that again in the debate today. Their argument is that Malaysia has not signed the UN refugee convention. That is a false excuse. It is an argument that has been made up by the opposition to hide behind. They sent people to Nauru for six years and Nauru was never a signatory to the refugee convention during that time. They oppose Malaysia not because it has not signed the UN convention on refugees but because it suits their political objectives.


I think it is the height of hypocrisy to criticise the government on this issue and refuse to give us the powers we believe we need to stop people risking their lives at sea. This is an issue that is too important for that sort of politics. We have to be prepared, on this issue at least, to work together. We have to be prepared to compromise, and if that means changing your position then so be it.


This motion talks about consistency. It would have you believe that the opposition have not changed their policy on this issue in 10 years. That is not correct. Both parties have changed their position. Only 3½ years ago the opposition, with its former shadow minister for immigration, supported the closure of Nauru and supported the closure of Manus Island. On Lateline the former shadow minister said:


We don't need the Pacific Solution now, that's Nauru Island and Manus Island, because we have the Christmas Island centre completed.


Both sides have changed their position. You change your position when the facts change and you change your position if that is what it takes to save lives. That is what we ask the opposition now: give us the powers that we believe we need to help stop people dying at sea. We have been fighting about this issue now for 11 years. We have been fighting about it since the Tampa arrived. Australians have had a gutful of it. They want us to stop shouting at each other and start talking to each other. They want us to work together.


If you need more proof of the importance of doing that, look at the story in the Sun Herald on the weekend that tells of another boat and another 33 people who drowned last month. Only one person survived—a 22-year-old man rescued by a fishing boat, who is now in an Indonesian detention centre. He paid $5½ thousand to a people smuggler called Sikander. He says the boat took off on 26 October and, on the way to Australia, the engine stopped. The phone they had did not work. The boat began to sink. This is what he told the Sun-Herald:


''On the first day there was hope. Everyone was optimistic,'' he said. ''We were praying, saying there will be an island, there will be a boat.


''On the second day, some people, they lost control, shouting and crying, saying, 'No one will help us.' One guy was in very bad condition. He lost his grip of the rope and went away and he was screaming, crying a few times. After that we didn't hear him any more.


''Then time was passing, night was coming, and the day passing, losing friends. I would see dead bodies coming from the right side, left side. Everyone, one by one, was waiting for their turn because everyone knew that there may not be help, there may not be any chance for a second life.


''Some guys got crazy, they were talking and fighting, they let go of the rope and went away. On the third night there were seven people on the rope, but … in the morning, there were only three people left including me.


In the end, there was only one. That is just one story. There are a lot of stories like this—too many.


Monsoon season is fast upon us. Last December, 200 people died. The December before that, dozens more died when a ship hit the rocks on the coast of Christmas Island. I dread what might happen in the days and weeks ahead. We have got to stop yelling at each other and start talking to each other about this issue. I urge anyone that is thinking about getting onto a boat: don't; don't do it; don't risk your life. And I sincerely urge all of us parliamentarians to be worthy of the name and to work together to stop this happening again.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (15:46):  I want to respond to some of the things that the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice just said in his speech on this matter of public importance discussion on border protection. I have heard his arguments on this issue before. The first thing I want to refute—and I want to refute it in the strongest possible terms—is that somehow we do not want to see the boats stop coming illegally to Australia. The Labor Party has put this. The minister just put it. Other ministers have put it at various points. I can assure the minister and I can assure the Australian people that that is complete and utter nonsense. We do want to see this issue resolved and we would always be prepared to work with the government to resolve it. But, if we are going to work with the government, they need to embrace policies that are actually going to work, something that has completely eluded them for the whole five years they have been in government.


We know what policies are going to work, because we implemented them in government when we were faced with a similar situation. You know what? They actually worked to resolve this problem. The whole reason that this problem recurred, the whole reason that we went from having four people in the detention network when the government changed and an average of three boat arrivals in any given year of the last six years of the Howard government, was that when the Labor Party came to office, in an absolute fit of some form of moral superiority—they wanted to put their credentials on display about how they were so much better humanitarians than the Howard government—they instituted a series of policy backflips that undermined the robust system of border protection that they had inherited, and that led to the re-emergence of people smuggling. People smuggling was dead and buried under the previous government. When the Labor Party came to office, they restarted people smuggling by not understanding the implications of the policies that they were pursuing.




Ms Roxon:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is entirely inappropriate to suggest that the government is running people-smuggling processes. The shadow minister should not be allowed to make such an assertion in this debate. It is a serious issue. We do not always agree with each other, but it can be debated in an appropriate way. To make that sort of assertion about the government is an outrageous slur and he should not be able to do that in the debate.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The member for Stirling would assist the House if he heard the Attorney-General's comments. I think in this chamber we all feel the difficulty of the policy and of resolving this whole illegal trade of people. I would ask him to moderate his comments in relation to assertions that could be taken as a comment that the government is running a people-smuggling racket.




Mr KEENAN:
  I was not saying anything of the sort. I was saying that the government, because of their misguided policies, are responsible for the re-emergence of people smuggling. That is 100 per cent factual and cannot be argued with. I did not say that they were people smugglers or that somehow—




Ms Roxon:
  You did, actually.




Mr KEENAN:
  I did not say anything of the sort. This is the ludicrous misrepresentation that we get from a government that do not understand the implications of the policy decisions that they have taken. They still refuse to admit that it was those policy decisions that have led Australia down this blind alley—with over 30,000 people arriving here illegally on over 500 boats—from a problem that was solved when they came to office. The reason that we are dealing with it again is specifically because of the Labor Party's misguided policies. The reason that they are not going to be able to deal with it now is that, since they took those policy decisions of August 2008 that reinvigorated people smuggling, they have had a whole series of policy prescriptions, none of which they have been able to implement effectively, all of which they have announced and then either been unable to implement or not had the resolve to implement. 


This is why we say now that it is the Labor Party themselves that are the obstacle for us to get any resolution to this issue. Even if the Labor Party were to come up with another policy tomorrow—and for all we know that is possible—why would the criminal gangs of people smugglers, who have been benefiting from the failed policies that the government have been pursuing since they came to office, take them remotely seriously when they say that they are going to do something differently to attack the people-smuggling trade?


We have heard it all before, as have the people smugglers, who are sophisticated enough to understand the implications of the policy debate here in Australia. These fateful decisions were taken in August 2008. The abolition of the Pacific solution and the abolition of temporary protection visas were the policies that allowed the people-smuggling trade to once again emerge, and this is why we have been inundated with illegal boat arrivals ever since.


But the misguided policies that were taken by the Labor Party have been compounded every time they have dealt with this issue. They reinvigorated the people-smuggling trade, and, when the people smugglers started sending people down to Australia illegally, the government initially denied that they had a problem. They denied that this was a real issue. They subsequently pinned it on international factors. We had minister after minister roll up to the dispatch box in this place and say: 'Well, it's got nothing to do with us. It's a turbulent international environment and that means people are going to seek to come here illegally.' They have now abandoned that excuse too.


Of course, one of the reasons the now Prime Minister Julia Gillard dispatched the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was his inability, as she saw it, to deal with the border protection crisis. By the time the government approached the 2010 election, they knew they had a political problem on their hands, so they did re-embrace something that they had been vilifying for a long time, and that is a regional processing centre. They said they were going to put a regional processing centre on the island nation of East Timor. They did so without doing any homework. It was announced as part of the Labor Party's policy platform for that election. They did not do their due diligence with the East Timorese government, who were taken by surprise by this announcement. Subsequently, that announcement was completely dead on arrival. They continued to push it as though it was somehow a live issue, as though somehow the East Timorese were considering it, to the detriment of actually coming up with an answer to this problem.


Finally, they faced reality and abandoned that, and they subsequently came up with this Malaysia people swap arrangement. The minister, as you heard, was going on about how, if we were to allow them to do the Malaysia people swap, this would somehow contribute to stopping people smuggling. He neglects to mention a few very salient points about that arrangement. Firstly, Malaysia is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and therefore, if you were to send people there for processing, they would not be subject to the sorts of safeguards that we would expect them to be subject to. Secondly, and I think very importantly—and this is often lost in this debate—is that the arrangement that the Labor Party negotiated with Malaysia was a 4,000-for-800 people swap, so we were only going to send a maximum of 800 people to be processed there. In the context of illegal arrivals at the moment, that is about a week and a half of illegal arrivals—and they say that somehow this is going to be the silver bullet that gets people smugglers to take them seriously for once! The Malaysia arrangement was never going to do that. It is a flawed arrangement from our perspective because it does not provide the protections that we would expect, and it certainly does not provide the scale that is the result of the Labor Party's failed border protection policies.


There have been subsequent positions that the government has taken—and it would be very difficult for me to list them all. I am not sure that even Labor backbenchers or ministers can keep up with all the iterations of the Labor Party's border protection policies over the past five years. What we can say categorically about them, though, is that every single one of them has failed to do anything to put a dent in people smuggling. Even the announcement of going back for offshore processing in Nauru and Manus, which was a step in the right direction, has done nothing but accelerate the rate of illegal arrivals. Indeed, 25 per cent of the 30,000 people that have been smuggled here illegally under this government have come since that announcement was made on 13 August.


We can only conclude that the problem is now not the policies; it is the Labor Party themselves. They cannot now credibly come into this parliament or go outside this parliament and say, 'We've now got a new idea for something that's going to close down people smuggling,' because why would anybody, let alone the people smugglers, take them seriously when they have had such a litany of failure on this issue and, of course, it was their policies that started this issue in the first place?

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (15:57):  On 18 October 2001 an Indonesian fishing boat left the port of Bandar Lampung. There were 421 people on board, including at least 70 children. The boat was 20 metres long and four metres wide, so people were tightly packed on board. The next day, about 70 kilometres south of Indonesia, the boat encountered heavy seas, took on water, listed violently to one side, capsized and sank within an hour. There were life jackets on board, but none of them worked. As a Senate committee chaired by the late, great, Senator Peter Cook concluded, there were at least 70 children aboard when SIEVX sank. Only three survived. Two hundred adults also lost their lives. This was the precursor to many more deaths at sea over the next decade.


We are where we are today because Australia, as an island continent, is a dangerous place to journey to. We are where we are today because the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees is a document largely drafted in the aftermath of World War II to deal with what were by today's standards relatively moderate asylum seeker flows across land. We are where we are today because Australia faces a unique challenge. Four per cent of those who take boats to get to Australia perish on the seas attempting to do so, so our policies need to be targeted at stopping those deaths at sea.


There are those in both houses who have served on the SIEVX inquiry, and there are other parliamentarians who have served on the Christmas Island inquiry. We have just heard the Minister for Justice speak movingly about some of the more recent tragedies that have occurred. I believe that in this debate there is no compassion in a policy which says that, if you take a leaky boat to Australia and make it, you can stay. I do not think that that policy is a compassionate one. I do not think that that policy is one which aligns with the value of the Labor Party, a party that I am privileged to represent in this place. What we have done through putting the Malaysian agreement before this parliament—an agreement rejected by an alliance of those to the left and to the right of us—has been to try and ensure that we do not create incentives for people to make the dangerous boat journey here. That Malaysian agreement was struck down by the High Court, and legislation to enable it was unable to pass through this parliament. We then found ourselves in a position where a productive exchange of letters over the Christmas break last year between the opposition immigration spokesperson and the government immigration spokesperson was stymied when the Leader of the Opposition became involved. It became almost absurd. The member for Cook was asked at one point: 'If the government were to adopt all of your policies, would you support them?' and he could not even say yes to that. So, as an attempted circuit-breaker, this government asked three distinguished Australians—Angus Houston, Michael L'Estrange and Paris Aristotle—to come up with a report which would look at how we could prevent tragic drownings at sea. When the Houston report came down, the government immediately announced we would follow its recommendations. All we have unfortunately seen from those opposite is an attempt to try to play politics with one of the most difficult issues in Australian public life.


There are three facts that I do not think have received significant discussion in public commentary on this issue. First, the humanitarian intake in Australia has been increased by 45 per cent to 20,000 places. I called for that in a speech at the end of last year and was extremely pleased when it was adopted. That is 45 per cent more people who are able to enjoy the high-quality humanitarian settlement process in Australia. Subject to economic circumstances, that will be increased to 27,000 places in the next five years. That cements Australia's position as the leading resettlement country globally on a per capita basis, according to United Nations data.


Secondly, Australia has been a world leader in how we provide those settlement services. I am enormously proud of the charities—some of them religious, some of them not—in my electorate of Fraser who work hard with newly arrived refugees. In some cases this will be a young Afghan boy who has lost his parents or whose parents have not joined him here and who is struggling to learn English and fit into the local community.


Canberrans have accepted refugees from Sudan, and many of them are making a great contribution to our city. In fact, I was pleased to start the day playing a game of basketball outside Parliament House with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the member for Chifley Senator Lundy and a range of parliamentary staff. We were playing against the Big Bang Ballers—a phrase not best said 10 times quickly—a group run by Pierre Johannessen in Canberra. Pierre works with at-risk youth who play Saturday night basketball. Many of the youth who join in are migrant youth or refugee youth. The Sudanese blokes on the other team certainly ran rings around me. But it is testament to the Canberra community that we are able to work on that resettlement so well.


Antonio Guterres, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, told 7.30 on 13 February this year:


Australia has received 750,000 refugees until now. Australia's one of the most successful, if not the most successful, resettlement programs in the world with a large number of people being successfully integrated in the Australian society.


We provide English language support; case management; torture and trauma counselling; funding for migrant resource centres; and cultural orientation programs.


The third thing that you do not hear often in this debate is that the average length of time spent by asylum seekers in detention facilities has decreased. It decreased from 277 days in November 2011 to 93 days in June 2012. The government is reducing the amount of time that people spend in detention.


In re-opening the Nauru and Manus Island facilities, we are also providing external scrutiny, something that never existed when the Howard government was in power. Amnesty International has recently brought down a critical report on the Nauru detention centre. The government does not agree with all of the findings in that report. But it is important to note that that report would not have been possible under the Howard government. Next week I understand the member for Cook is travelling to Nauru—again, something that would not have been possible under the Howard government.


That internal scrutiny is important to me as somebody who believes that it is important to deter people from making a dangerous boat journey, but we must also treat with dignity and compassion those who make that journey. You will not hear me, as the member for Cook and the member for Stirling said, describing as illegals those who come as asylum seekers. It is not illegal to seek refuge in another country. You also will not hear me attempting to have it both ways on the refugee convention. 


In speaking on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 shortly before question time, I discussed some of the circumstances that determine why a country signs or does not sign the refugee convention. I find it passing strange that the opposition is willing to turn boats back to Indonesia—a dangerous attempt which could endanger the lives of not only asylum seekers but also Navy personnel—given that Indonesia is a non-signatory country. We believe that it is important to recognise that circumstances have changed since the refugee convention was signed and to find an approach that is humane and compassionate.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:07):  Since November 2007, the government has lost control of Australia's borders. As I said in previous speeches to this House, Labor's border protection policies should be likened to an employment program for people smugglers. The Howard government put them out of business and Labor resurrected them. Since November 2007, Labor's failures on our borders have gotten worse, and their half-hearted policies and commitment is not up to the job. Labor's dismantling of the coalition's border protection policies have resulted in more than 30,000 arrivals. Of the 30,057 arrivals on 515 boats, more than half of this number—15,403—have turned up this year, and more than one-third—10,146—had turned up since July 1. Beyond the catastrophic loss of life and the inability to discourage people smugglers, Labor's border protection failures have also equated to a $6.6 billion budget blowout since 2009-10. This blowout does not include the additional $1.3 billion required to increase Australia's refugee and humanitarian intake to 20,000—up from 13,750—as part of the Houston report's recommendations.


This is a public policy disaster in both humanitarian terms and budgetary terms. There is no other way to describe it. In 2011-12, the government spent more than $4 billion on humanitarian services for migrants and refugees. In 2012-13, it is estimated that will increase to almost $4.28 billion, according to their budget estimates. The astronomical cost impacts that flow from Labor's horrendous border protection policies mean that the delivery of effective settlement services for new migrants and refugees have got that much harder. Somehow, we have got to do that with $6.6 billion less in the budget.


Yes, it is true that we had good settlement policies. The member for Fraser was earlier quoting Antonio Guterres, and he said that Australia has some of the best settlement services in the world. We have had in the past a good settlement policy and good settlement programs and we have settled many, many refugees—some 750,000 since World War II. But, those settlement services are at risk. Labor's border protection failures and gross inefficiencies in the management of the migrant and refugee settlement programs have placed enormous pressures on both settlement services and settlement service providers throughout Australia, and they are going to cause danger to social cohesion in this country. The increase in the humanitarian intake to 20,000 will also stretch and put more pressure on infrastructure, more pressure on education, more pressure on the health sector and more pressure on housing.


In relation to the housing sector and the availability of accommodation, a number of settlement service providers have already reported to me that the scarcity of available housing services has led to rental bidding wars which is causing rental prices to go up in many areas that are relying on public housing waiting lists. In Western Australia alone, there is a seven-year waiting list for public housing. I want to commend the terribly hard work that agencies like the Red Cross and others have to do when they have to house asylum seekers, because it is getting more and more difficult as this government's policies fail and we are getting more and more people. 


There are many settlement services provided. One that I want to talk about is the English language service to new migrants and refugees. The primary vehicle for delivering these English-language programs is the Adult Migrant English Program, or AMEP. Language skills are universally acknowledged throughout the world as being a critical and a very core component of positive settlement outcomes. As such, one would expect that Australia's settlement service programs for new migrants and refugees would be geared at delivering outcomes that result in higher levels of literacy and good positive language outcomes. But, how are we going at the moment? At the moment, the AMEP will cost the Australian taxpayer more than $220 million in 2012-13, and that is not small change in anybody's language. 


During a Senate estimates hearing in February this year, it was mentioned that there was increasing pressure to deliver an adequate AMEP program and that participants were issued with certificates although they did not even have functional English proficiency, and a further 14 per cent of participants were issued with certificates just for turning up. It is absolutely beyond me how any government would issue a certificate for just turning up. Here we have a program that has a 68 per cent failure rate for a $220 million investment. Poor English language skills result in poor and very poor employment outcomes. Poor employment outcomes trap new migrants on welfare dependency and reinforce a sense of failure, not just for new migrants and refugees themselves, but for the wider Australian community, which in turn creates pressures on social cohesion. Apart from that $220 million price tag, what is even more galling is the extremely poor results being produced from that program. Labor is well aware of the consequential negative flows, particularly from underperforming programs, yet still introduces these very clunky template approaches to service delivery. 


The government initiated a report last year. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship produced the report, Settlement Outcomes of New Arrivals, which found that 83 per cent of refugees were still on some form of Centrelink benefit more than five years after they arrived in this country. I had the opportunity recently to visit many parts of regional Queensland and to meet with settlement service providers. They highlighted the pressures on language services and on-the-job service programs for new migrants and refugees who have not arrived in this country illegally, but the ones who have arrived legally. Also, they expressed concern to me about the dramatic increase in irregular maritime arrivals. For example, I just want to highlight one of these areas. In Toowoomba, there are 3,000 new migrants and refugees from sub-Saharan Africa. After five years, 70 per cent of them still are not able to find permanent employment. Far from setting up new migrants and refugees who are legally in this country to succeed, we are now setting up people to fail because of Labor's failed border protection policies. I turn to discuss the unaccompanied minors on humanitarian visas in Australia. A report was recently done by the Multicultural Youth Advocacy Network and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. It was released on 16 October this year and includes some very disturbing facts. It highlighted again Labor's neglect, which has left unaccompanied minors vulnerable to online predators. The report reveals that, as of 30 June, there were some 865 unaccompanied minors living in Australia and that, in addition to being without their parents, these young people had to arrange their own carers. How did they arrange their own carers? They went on Facebook—how else would you arrange your own carer!—and other social networking sites. To anyone who is a parent, that is absolutely appalling. Imagine your child being in a strange country by themselves—without you to protect them and unable to speak the local language—and looking for a carer on the internet. Does that sound like a good system to you? It scares the hell out of me.


The problem of children looking for carers on the internet was highlighted in a report in the Herald Sun titled 'Asylum kids an online target'. In the report a departmental spokesman is quoted as saying that unaccompanied minors are placed in permanent care arrangements by the department but:


… not placed in a permanent care arrangement by (the department) without an assessment of the suitability of that placement.


The department is also reported as saying that it is 'satisfied' with the current arrangements for unaccompanied minors. Yet the department is putting unaccompanied minors in risky situations. Such statements are staggering. These guardianship arrangements are unsuitable: as any parent will tell you, there is a real risk to young people from online predators. I would like Minister Bowen to explain how care arrangements for unaccompanied minors are satisfactory. The Sun Herald report also highlighted great concerns about the lack of targeted support and transitional arrangements for unaccompanied minors before they turn 18 as well as the need for a national framework for the care and support of such children.


Labor's border protection failures have resulted in fiscal and humanitarian disaster. Such failures tear at the fabric of Australia's social cohesion and put at risk our successful migration program. (Time expired)

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:17):  I hate to begin my contribution with a confession such as this, but I have to confess that I missed the member for Cook's contribution to the debate on this MPI. Luckily for me, the member for Holt and the member for Lyons are here to tell me what he said. I imagine that the member for Cook said that border management is a joke. He probably said that we should never have changed what those opposite did. He probably said that we should go back and do what they did before.




Mr Adams:
  Yes.




Mr Byrne:
  Indeed.




Mr HUSIC:
  Yes, pretty much; I am sorry I missed it. The member for Holt may be able to help me out here: did he at any point make a contribution that spelled out what those opposite would do?




Mr Byrne:
  Not that I am aware of.




Mr HUSIC:
  Not that you are aware of; I thought that that would be the case. The only policy those opposite have on the complex subject of asylum seekers is to go back to their old policy. They do not recognise that, as the member for Holt said, times have changed. They do not accept that people smugglers alter their tactics to take into account government policy. It never comes into their thinking. Those opposite are all about going back. They always talk about doing something that John Howard did. As I have said previously, the Leader of the Opposition has never had an idea that John Howard did not think of first. Coalition policy is the biggest recycling program this country has ever seen. They talked about Work Choices being dead, buried and cremated. I do not know how that works, but bringing up all the policies they tried in the past is a big exhumation job. They think that all their old polices will fit circumstances now.


The motion in the MPI debate today talks about consistency. Consistency for those opposite is all about ignoring reality and not looking at the situation as it is now. Their policies are one-size-fits-all, and the problem is that the size of the policy they are trying to fit onto today's situation fitted circumstances 10 seasons ago. But perhaps I am being unfair: they did have one new policy. I remember them hectoring us, 'Just pick up the phone and call Nauru.' Then they made a call to scope out how much it would cost to reopen the processing centre on Nauru. Who did they call? They did not call Immigration—they did not call anyone in the know about what it would cost to reopen the centre on Nauru. They called a catering company. That is the quality of the policy-making of those opposite. They used an accounting firm instead of Treasury to cost their policies in the lead-up to the 2012 election, and they used a catering company to work out how to reopen the centre on Nauru! They outsourced policy to Masterchef, yet they lecture us on policy and say 'just do what we did in the past'!


We have tried to break the impasse on asylum seekers by having an eminent trio of Australians, led by Angus Houston, step forward to work out what the best way forward is: what course can we take that will get us out of the political divide where there is a logjam and we are unable to move? They came up with 22 recommendations looking at the incentives which exist at the moment to people-smuggling: does the system as it is geared presently allow people to abuse the system to get here? They have tried to work out how to put in place incentives for people to use the system properly. People have the personal wealth to buy passage to Australia, and there are people profiting from their desperation by trying to get them here in vessels which are clearly unsafe and which people who are masters of the sea would never allow to be used to transport people. Things were put in place—for example, the no-advantage rule that has been steadily implemented by this government to create a disincentive for people turning to people smugglers—and there were things put in place to fix up loopholes, as has been the subject of legislation that is currently being debated in this place about unauthorised maritime arrivals. 


We have increased the humanitarian intake. This is an interesting point because this matter of public importance calls for consistency. Now, in an effort to try and win the Greens' support in June, when the member for Lyne moved his resolution on regional processing, by all accounts a quick meeting was convened by those on the opposite side, where they agreed that they would increase the humanitarian intake. They did that—and then what happened? Last week we had the Leader of the Opposition say that he has trashed that. He is now not supporting an increase in the humanitarian intake. In fact, he will now wind it back.


Those opposite lecture us on consistency when, in the space of a couple of months, they have moved away from their policy. Just to secure and meet their own political ends in this place they have done that. There is no consistency when it comes to the policies of those opposite. They say to us, for example, that they will not support the Malaysian agreement. As I said earlier today, if you were against having people detained for extended periods, if you were for people having work rights—as those opposite have advocated—and if you were for people having some access to education, you would support the Malaysia agreement quick smart. You would not support the situation as it is now. 


As I said earlier today—I have been quite frank about it—I do not think Manus Island and Nauru will work in the longer term. I have said that previously. I have said it to the minister and I have said it publicly. I do not think it will work because it is not reflective of the situation we are in now. The situation now is that we need to remove the incentive from people smugglers to say to people, 'You'll just sit on Nauru for a bit and then you'll get here.' That is it: it is a holding pattern that they are offering to people who want to pay to get here.


The longer-term decision for us is to do what the Houston report said: the next stage of offshore processing has to be Malaysia. The Houston report said that we need to move on this as quickly as possible. My argument is that this should be done as soon as possible to ensure that we are able to break this down. 


Those opposite do not support it. They say it should only happen if you can find a country that has signed up to the refugee convention. They say this regardless of the fact that their tow-back policy would see people towed back to a country that is not a signatory. They say this regardless of the fact that in September they instituted a policy that would see people shipped back to Sri Lanka straight away, ignoring the refugee convention and not even giving fair consideration to their applications. The opposition would send them back to Sri Lanka, which, coincidentally, is not a signatory to the refugee convention.


Again, we are lectured on consistency by people who are, themselves, inconsistent. As I said, if you want to see a massive dent in the approach taken by people smugglers—a massive dent in the success of people smugglers—you will support Malaysia in a heartbeat. But those opposite are happy to play politics while we are trying to deal with a situation where people are drowning because they are being offered false hope. And the worst thing about this entire debate is that, we will argue, with regard to other policy issues—for example, on this whole notion of means testing—that people who have high incomes should support themselves. We talk about that. We give no regard for the people stuck in refugee camps. We are talking about people who have the money to pay for a berth to come here while other people see the best years of their lives go past while they are sitting in refugee camps. We are not looking at liberating them; we are looking at this.


We do need to put in place every single disincentive possible to prevent people from risking their lives and risking the lives of children—and people profiting off that—and, in the process, we potentially need to give people a second chance at a new life by freeing them from refugee camps. That is consistent policy.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (16:27):  It is always good to follow the member for Chifley. I just let him know that there are already people being sent back to Sri Lanka. When I was on Christmas Island last week they were already going back—and they are the ones who want to work. They come to Australia and say they want to work, so they get sent back. 


I rise to support the Member for Cook on his MPI. The Member for Cook started his MPI with comments about searching for Captain Emad, along with the shadow Treasurer. It was an example of the failures of this government and its policy failures.


The minister in charge of customs, the member for Blaxland, opened his speech with the reminder of the 200 people who died off the shore of Indonesia nearly one year ago. And the member for Fraser also reminded us of the deaths at sea in 2001. I understand the minister's sentiments and I remind him that this is exactly the reason we raised this MPI. It is about saving people's lives by stopping the people smugglers and the illegal entry trade. If we, as an opposition, need to continue to remind the government of that, we will do that in every way possible.


We are also often reminded of the Prime Minister's statement when in opposition, 'Another boat; another policy failure.' Well, I say to the government that that is what you created in your scrapping of John Howard's Pacific solution in 2008—more policy failure. With the scrapping of the Pacific solution this government created a magnet for the people smugglers, and of that there can be no doubt.


This week marks five years since I was elected to parliament in 2007, and in those five years I have seen many examples of disastrous Labor policy failures which have hit hard in my electorate and out in the broader Australian electorate. However, none has been quite so catastrophic, as I said before, as Labor's decision to effectively repeal the Pacific solution—the border protection policy that had reduced the number of illegal boats to, effectively, zero. 


When the Howard government left office in November 2007, there were just four people in the detention network who had arrived illegally by boat. As I said earlier, the boats were so rare that when one eventually showed up, Julia Gillard would get excited, stand up in parliament and declare 'a policy failure'. Well, Prime Minister, by your standards we have had well over 500 policy failures in border protection since you took power. The results from the reignition of the people-smuggling trade have been tragic. Over a thousand people have died at sea, a thousand souls lost because Australia cannot secure its borders from the people smugglers. This is a tragic loss and a horrible one—1,000 people have drowned on our doorstep. And the arrivals are quite simply out of control. Currently there are 2,000 people arriving every month. As the shadow minister said, that is the equivalent of the QE2 turning up at Christmas Island with a full passenger manifest every month.


This is the fifth month in a row that more than 2,000 people have arrived illegally. And they are showing no signs of slowing down. In total, 30,000-plus have arrived under Labor and the government seems powerless to stop it. The people smugglers know that this government has lost control and, what is more, it has run out of places in detention facilities. In the West Australian last week it was revealed that, as there are no detention places left, illegal arrivals were to be fast-tracked to live in our suburbs, although without work rights. This caused plenty of concern in Western Australia, particularly in my electorate of Swan. This chaotic situation cannot be allowed to continue.


I will repeat a story I told in parliament earlier in the year. A gentleman came up to me after a citizenship ceremony wanting to get his photo taken with his MP. When I asked which country he had come from, he said he was from Afghanistan. I asked him, 'How did you arrive here?' He said, 'By boat.' I asked: 'How did you happen to get onto the boat? How did you find the people smugglers?' He said that he did not find the people smugglers, that they came to his village offering anyone who was interested entry to Australia. I asked him, 'What did that cost you?' He said, 'US$10,000.' 'That's a fair price,' I said. 'How did you actually get here?' He said: 'We flew to Malaysia and then we got on a boat in Malaysia. We bypassed Indonesia. Before we went to Christmas Island we were told to destroy all our identification, so we did. Then I got processed and came to Australia.' 'So you beat the system?' I said. With a smile on his face, he said, 'Yes, I beat the system.' The reason I tell this story is that it shows that this is a business and nothing more—a business this government has enabled.


At least 8,100 people are waiting offshore in desperate circumstances and have been denied Australia's protection via humanitarian visas over the last three years due to this boat influx. These people—the people in refugee camps, the people who don't have US$10,000-plus to pay a people smuggler—need our help most. That is the tragedy of this situation. The people of Australia welcomed a controlled immigration policy. John Howard built a consensus in favour of immigration over his time in government. It is a tragedy that humanitarian visa places are being sold on the Australian government's behalf by the people smugglers.


That brings us to this matter of public importance today: 


The Government’s inability to deliver strong, consistent and effective border protection and asylum policy over the past five years.


That the border protection laws have been weakened and can be deemed ineffective is indisputable. The lack of a consistent policy response means the boats keep on coming. First we had the removal of temporary protection visas and offshore processing. Then, before the last election, we had the East Timor fiasco—an incredibly embarrassing incident for Australia where the Prime Minister spoke to the wrong member of the East Timorese government. I am sure the other members on this side of the House will remember how many times we heard, before the previous election, 'We must stop the boats.' The Labor candidate for Swan repeated it over and over again. But, as yet, we have not seen it happen.


The Prime Minister ditched the East Timor solution and tried a people swap arrangement with Malaysia. It did not work, and the High Court struck it down anyway. Still the boats came. Then the government defaulted to a policy of onshore processing, their previous preference, which continued to fail. During this time, the Leader of the Opposition recommended to the government 106 times that they pick up the phone to the President of Nauru and revive offshore processing as part of a three-part plan to revive the Pacific solution.


When this advice was confirmed by the Houston panel, the Prime Minister finally acted and reversed a four-year opposition to offshore processing on Nauru. But, as the coalition has said time and time again, one policy on its own will not do it. The government needs to reinstate the proven suite of Howard policies in full—namely, TPVs, offshore processing and turning around the boats when it is safe to do so.


As I have said previously—from the information I have received from people in Western Australia who know what is going on—the people currently in detention centres are emailing their friends overseas to say, 'Come now before the policies are changed; come now before the coalition is re-elected.' This has been confirmed by one of the guards at the Northam detention centre. He told me that message is continually being emailed by people currently in detention centres.


Financially, there have been significant consequences for the taxpayer. The annual budget in 2007-08 for offshore asylum seeker management was just $85 million. The total bill for this year alone is $2.8 billion. The government's wafer-thin surplus prediction is wiped out by this alone. I can see the shadow Treasurer salivating and wishing he could get his hands on that $2.8 billion for his budgets. You can see the government trying to grab cash wherever it can, as we found out this morning with the Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012.


But, just as the people smugglers do not believe the government is serious about getting tough on people smugglers, the people of Australia are under no illusions that the government will deliver on its budget surplus promise, despite it being repeated dozens and dozens of time by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The reality, as my colleague the shadow minister for immigration, the member for Cook, has pointed out, is that the Pacific solution, when put together with temporary protection visas and turning boats back when safe, reduced the number of boat arrivals to Australia by 99 per cent and cost taxpayers only $289 million over six years. The current government has said this three-pillar solution will not work. But, in the meantime, we still see the boats coming, with many lives put at risk.


The shadow minister for customs refuted the comments by the Minister for Home Affairs that the coalition were happy to see the boats restart and continue because there was some political gain from it. I too refute those comments and have, along with other members of the coalition, continually called for this government to stop the people smuggling. This government should step up and stop this evil trade. They should keep their promise and stop the people smuggling.

This government supports constitutional change to recognise the unique and special place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and we are committed to achieving this. We appointed an expert panel to develop options for constitutional change to help us work out how best to recognise Indigenous Australians in the Constitution. Now, for the first time, we have specific proposals on how to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution, and I thank the expert panel members for their excellent work in developing these proposals. We are now working, through Reconciliation Australia and You Me Unity, to build a movement for change of our Constitution. 


In extending the time frame for a referendum, we have also set out a clear way forward and momentum to build support. This week, we will be introducing a bill for an act of recognition, acknowledging the unique and special place of our first peoples. The act will demonstrate that parliament is united on progressing constitutional recognition to show the Australian community the leadership needed for change. I am pleased that the opposition, the Greens and a number of Independents have shown their support to pass the act of recognition. Strong parliamentary support for the bill will help build momentum for change. We have proposed a sunset date of two years, setting a clear time frame to work towards the ultimate goal of constitutional recognition. 


To further show the parliament's desire to work together towards the goal of successful referendum, we agreed to work with the opposition to establish a joint select committee. The membership of the committee will be drawn from across the parliament. The committee will be asked to consider the bill for the act of recognition as its first task, reporting in late January next year. The committee will be then asked to continue to progress constitutional change. The recommendations of the expert panel will be the foundation of their considerations. I thank all the incoming members of the committee for their willingness to take on this very important task. We know that there is still a lot of work to be done to make sure that we are able to hold a successful referendum that unites our nation. The committee will play a significant role in ensuring that this occurs. I commend the motion to the House.

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (17:20):  Achieving constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders is a very significant step towards genuine and lasting reconciliation. It is a cause the coalition has long been associated with and one that we have proudly long supported. The coalition's position for over a decade has been that there should be recognition of Australia's Indigenous people in the Constitution. That is why when we were in government, in 1999, we put a proposal to the people seeking to include recognition in the preamble of the Australian Constitution. As history records, our proposal unfortunately did not succeed.


We again strongly advocated for such recognition during the 2007 election campaign. It would come as no surprise, therefore, that it was our proactive approach to this issue that ensured it retained the attention it so deserves. It was the Leader of the Opposition who wrote to the Prime Minister proposing that such a committee, as proposed by the motion moved by the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, be established. We must all remain mindful that the primary objective of a constitutional referendum to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is to achieve a unifying moment for our nation, a moment similar to that of the 1967 referendum. The work done by the expert panel, including my friend and colleague the member for Hasluck, the first Indigenous person to be elected to this House, has continued the journey of reconciliation.


Reconciliation is something that we believe in. It is something which we are proud to support. And it is something which we will continue to advocate. We remain of the view that constitutional recognition is a continuation of that important journey.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (17:26):  I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 33rd AIPA general assembly from 16 to 22 September 2012, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr SIMPKINS:
  I am pleased to address the report and to make comments on the Parliamentary Delegation to the 33rd general assembly of the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, which was held in Lombok, Indonesia, from 16 to 22 September 2012. I would like to thank at the outset the head of the delegation, Senator Singh, and the delegation secretary, Peggy Danaee. Ms Danaee did a great job of looking after the two of us, and I would say that the in-country administration is very smooth and made the delegation's work very much easier. I also thank her for this outstanding report.


I will not continue on the administrative detail but will concentrate purely on the work of the assembly. Australia is one of a number of observer nations that have regularly participated in these ASEAN interparliamentary assemblies. In many ways, the regular and consistent participation by Australia acknowledges and provides respect to our ASEAN neighbours. Clearly, when we look at the trade, agricultural and financial interactions we have with ASEAN countries, the region is of such importance that we must engage with them at every level possible. At the diplomatic level and at the executive level we are already represented, but the parliamentary level needs to have the one-on-one collaboration that such assemblies provide.


Apart from such interactions, it was also useful to closely watch the interactions between the ASEAN members. Even in the introductory speeches from delegations there was an opportunity to identify more pointed language and commentary about other members and about internal matters in other nations. It was notable that concerns about money laundering and the pursuit of a drug-free ASEAN region were also confirmed in the committee reports at the end of the conference, and Australia should take heart from this recognition. Also, it is clear that Australia should never engage in any legalisation of illicit drugs, as we do not want to distance ourselves from our near neighbours and be seen as weak in resolve in the region.


The other specific agenda item of note was the dialogue between the Australian delegation and the ASEAN representatives. It was unfortunate that control of the meeting was suboptimal, resulting in not all agenda items being covered. It was clear from the formal nature of the meeting that the need to have formal opening remarks was not made clear in our preparations in Canberra.


Madam Deputy Speaker, can I just ask a question of you. I was led to believe that I would get five minutes for this. Would it be possible for me, given that the time is expended, to have my speech adopted rather than delay the House any further? There is nothing of a political nature in it.

Mr Bowen:
  Yes, we would grant leave.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I just need to clarify what the member for Cowan was asking for.




Mr SIMPKINS:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I seek leave to table the balance of the prepared notes that I have.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Leave is granted. Just a clarification: it cannot be incorporated into Hansard, but you can table it.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (17:29):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry, I present the committee's report, entitled Netting the benefits:inquiry into the role of science for the future of fisheries and aquaculture, together with minutes of the proceedings and evidence received by the committee. 


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr ADAMS:
  by leave—Today I am pleased to present the committee's report on the inquiry into the role of science for the future of fisheries and aquaculture. Australia is at the cutting edge of global initiatives to meet the needs of a growing international population. Our nation's efforts in developing innovative solutions, particularly in the sphere of sustainable fisheries management, is world renowned.


Australia's scientific capabilities in this area are led ably by a range of key organisations such as the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, the CSIRO and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.


Each of these organisations use the skills and experience of highly qualified professionals, committed to ensuring long-term growth and sustainable development in an industry that, like many others, has been affected by climatic and economic factors.


The world's population is growing and new ways need to be found to supply more food to feed everybody. Seafood is an excellent source of protein, and therefore needs to be a core part of future food supply.


Our belief is that the diligent work of scientists, coupled with strong investment in science, will provide the solutions needed to deliver better quality food to more people than ever before.


Commencing in March this year, the committee's inquiry focused on the science of fisheries management; aquaculture research and development; biosecurity challenges; and related governance arrangements. A total of 50 submissions were received and extensive public hearings were held. These enabled the committee to discuss key issues with numerous researchers, field experts, industry representatives, environmental groups and state and federal fisheries managers.


The committee travelled to Perth, Hobart and Townsville to conduct site inspections to see firsthand the research projects currently underway. In particular, aquaculture is rapidly moving forward with the help of science, such as identifying new species well suited to aquaculture and finding new cost-effective varieties of fish feed.


The committee found that, although Australia's fisheries management is highly regarded globally, there are some gaps in our knowledge, leading to incorrect interpretations, which has been used against the commercial fishing industry.


Additionally, responsibilities in Australia for fisheries management and aquaculture are complex. This is because fish do not respect state and federal boundaries—they swim across these divides and sometimes over vast areas of ocean—creating the shared responsibility for both the fish and their habitats.


Alongside day-to-day management of fisheries, there is a sizeable research and development effort taking place—with its own complexities and administrative arrangements. This effort, however, needs to be complemented with improved and standardised national reporting of fishing and aquaculture statistics.


Resolving governance and policy issues was another key concern of stakeholders, in particular the duplication and tensions between fisheries legislation and environmental legislation.


Notably, high-profile issues including the establishment of new marine protected areas and the arrival of the supertrawler Abel Tasman arose during the inquiry.


Understandably, there was plenty of debate and discussion during the inquiry regarding the role science plays in fisheries and aquaculture and the level of precaution that the law requires to be followed when decisions are made.


The committee has made 22 recommendations overall. Firstly, the committee has recommended development of a national regional policy statement on fisheries, aquaculture and recreational fishing, which should include: (1) an overall statement of strategic intent (national fisheries policy statement) to drive future direction; (2) a new guideline on precaution; and (3) research, development and extension work program. The report also calls for day-to-day fisheries management to remain free from political direction. For too long, too many state ministers for fisheries have been making decisions about quotas within their domains.


Secondly, the committee has recommended that there be comprehensive national data collection and reporting in four key areas: (1) the level of investment in fisheries and aquaculture research, development and extension; (2) the status of wild fisheries stocks and ecosystems; (3) recreational fishing; and (4) fisheries and aquaculture industry activity statistics.


During the inquiry the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Research and Economics, ABARES, informed the committee of their intention to produce a report during 2012 similar to the annual State of the forests report. The committee supports this approach.


Thirdly, the committee made recommendations relating to specific issues or industry sectors, which briefly include:


Developing a 'one stop shop' model for project approvals, including environmental assessments;


Further study and analysis of climate change implications for fisheries and aquaculture;


•   Improving coordination of fisheries and aquaculture research;


Speeding up the implementation of monitoring and evaluation activities for the national marine reserves network;


A Productivity Commission inquiry into the efficiency of the Australian fishing industry and the effectiveness of governance arrangements;


An update to AQUAPLAN, which relates to arrangements for aquatic disease issues;


A comprehensive and detailed national aquaculture policy;


A national peak body for commercial fishing organisations; and


Providing aid, along with training, especially to our Pacific neighbours, to assist with their fisheries management and aquaculture industries.


I am hopeful that governments around Australia will give favourable consideration to the report's recommendations. The committee looks forward to following the outcomes that result from this inquiry.


I wish to thank my committee, particularly my Deputy Chair, Alby Schultz, for his dedication, time and effort in helping us get this report done, and my Tasmanian colleague Geoff Lyons, who assisted on many occasions. All those in the committee played their part, doing their utmost to ensure that the inquiry was able to take place in a timely manner. I thank also the committee secretariat—Thomas Gregory, David Brunoro and Nathan Fewkes—who have worked tirelessly to finalise this report in this final week of parliament.


I believe this is a landmark inquiry in light of the discussions on fishing this year and I look forward to an early response by government.


I commend the report to the House.

Mr SCHULTZ
 (Hume) (17:38):  by leave—I just want to make that point about the report that has just been bought into the House by member for Lyons—the chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry—that this report is a very significant report in terms of the fishing industry in Australia. It identifies 22 recommendations. I can only hope, as deputy chair of this committee, that after the good work that has gone into this report it is not left lying on the shelf collecting dust like many reports have done in the past.


It is a classic example of a very definitive inquiry by a group of dedicated people about our fishing industry, and it illustrates the sustainable management practices of all fishers—if I can use the politically correct term rather than fishermen—around Australia, whether they be recreational fishermen or professional fishermen. Our practices are the envy of the rest of the world. There has been significant evidence taken that illustrates that we need to improve on our practices, and more importantly, we need to correlate what is happening on a state-by-state and territory-by-territory basis, so that we can continue to demonstrate to the rest of the world that we are good at sustainable yield and we are good at fishing practices.


I commend the chairman for the wonderful work that he has done and I commend the committee members for the significant individual and collective contribution that they have made to the report. I commend the report to the House.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-11-27,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:41):  It is distressing to be here debating a bill that is similar for all intents and purposes to a step that was taken by the previous Howard government. Many of us had thought that we were no longer in an environment where we would start carving out bits of this country and saying that they did not count as properly being Australia for migration purposes. It is especially distressing because following the events that have happened this year—which everyone in this country would be aware of—where you could not fail to be moved by the tragedy of people drowning at sea as they were escaping to Australia to find a better life, we had in this parliament a unique opportunity to confront what is a difficult issue and what is a global issue; and that is the substantial movement of people around the world, and in this region, as they flee persecution, as they flee war, as flee torture and as they flee hunger. When we were presented with that opportunity, we could have had a rational debate about the kind of country that we want to be. Instead, in an environment that I have heard described as one of moral panic, where it was said that this parliament had to do something and it did not matter what it was as long as we did something, we found ourselves setting a course that would inevitably lead to bills like this.


I fear that we have gone where perhaps the right wing of the Labor Party has always wanted to take us, because Labor, instead of taking us back to Fraser, has taken us back to Howard. That is something that is a source of distress to many people in this country. We could have had inklings of that when we saw the first proposed Malaysia solution, which the High Court and the Angus Houston panel said did not contain sufficient protections for the most vulnerable people in the world as they fled, coming here and seeking our protection. Under the conventions that we had signed up to, it was not acceptable to take the people and then dump them in another country. We saw inklings of this desire of Labor to take us back to Howard from the recent announcement that people who have come here would not be allowed to work while they have their claims processed. We now see confirmation of it in a bill that, for all intents and purposes, excises the whole of Australia from the migration zone if you happen to arrive by boat. As we head into an election year we are seeing a distressing position increasingly being taken by the government. When there is a significant decision to be made on an important social issue, faced with the choice of whether to work with the coalition or to work with the Greens and other progressives in the parliament, the government is increasingly choosing to work with the coalition. We saw it recently on the Murray-Darling issue, and we are seeing it on the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.


There has been much talk about what alternatives we might have been able to come up with as a parliament—and there are many. But to have an alternative you need to shift your position and be willing to compromise. There was one fundamental issue on which the government was unwilling to compromise, and that was offshore processing: if someone finds their way here by boat after having escaped war, perhaps—after having fled, perhaps, halfway across the globe—then we want to take them to another country or an island; we do not want to process them here; we want to remove them from Australia, whether they are man, woman or child, and potentially lock them up indefinitely. That fundamental point was why the government chose to go and work with the coalition—and of course found a willing partner there. There is a road map for all of this, and that road map was set out by the Howard government.


Let us just consider for a moment someone who finds themselves in such a desperate situation that they will pay someone they have never met some money to get into a boat. This person may have been waiting in the camp in Indonesia, on our doorstep, for a number of years. There are over 8,000 people waiting there, with over 1,000 of them having been found to be refugees, but with no clear pathway out, and with Australia having taken only 50 or 100-odd people from the camp in the last year or two. If I were sitting in that camp, especially if I had been found to be a refugee, and I had seen others sitting near me waiting for years and years, and I did not see a pathway out, and someone came along and said, 'Give us a bit of money and I'll pop you on a boat and you'll get to Australia', well, I would do it. And I reckon anyone here would do it.


What are we doing with those people who come here? We are now putting them in a legal limbo. We are now saying to those people, who had no other clear pathway out, 'You are being put in legal limbo, because when you land you do not actually land in Australia; we reserve the right to now send you off somewhere else for an indefinite period of time.' The worst thing about this is that if the intention is to stop the boats—and I will come back to that in a moment—it will not work. We saw, under the Howard government, one of the biggest single maritime disasters, with 353 people dying at sea, at a time when offshore processing and the Pacific solution was at its height and in full force. And why is that? It is because unless Australia becomes as bad as Afghanistan under the Taliban, or unless Australia starts torturing its citizens, we are always going to be a better bet for people. And we are never going to become that bad, so people around the world, as they look for a safe haven, are always going to look to places like Australia.


We have signed up to the UN refugee convention and said that if people come here then we will look after and process them. If they are not found to be genuine refugees, we send them back; if they are, we find a way of helping them. We are not doing that for these people for whom we say we are going to insist on offshore processing. We will fail morally if we pass this bill, because we have not provided them with a safer alternative pathway. It is all well and good to talk about the no-advantage test. But really—morally—the only way you can say that that is a defensible proposal is if there is safe and quick pathway to come here other than by boat. If you are waiting in Indonesia or Malaysia the average processing time for you can be anything from four years upwards. If you want to take a mathematical average of the time in Malaysia, depending on the category you are in, it could be six or seven years.


We have an obligation—and this is what we could have done—to say, 'We will stop people drowning at sea by removing the risk and the incentive for them to get on a boat by providing safer pathways for coming to Australia.' We could have said—and this is what the Greens have been consistently proposing, even though others have sought to diminish our position as being simply about onshore processing—that if you start to take 1,000 people from the camps in Indonesia and beef up the processing we have there, whether through UNHCR or through Australia operating its own processing centre in Indonesia, and you do the same in Malaysia and increase our humanitarian intake, then all of a sudden the message that starts to go through those camps will be that Australia is taking people again. The message is that, if you are a genuine refugee and you wait your turn for long enough, you will find yourself either in Australia or being resettled somewhere else, so there is no point in getting on a boat. That is what almost all the experts who fronted up to the Houston inquiry, and who have spoken out since, have said is the answer. The people who are working on the ground in the camps in Indonesia and in Malaysia have said that the best thing you can do is give people in the camps hope that if they wait long enough they will find their way out to Australia. At the moment, there is no hope there.


There is lots of talk about the people smugglers' business model. The people smugglers' business model is based on the desperation and the lack of hope that people who are languishing in these camps feel. They feel that there is no other alternative. If we were serious—if this debate was really about saving the lives of refugees—we would have provided them with safer pathways. We have not done that at all. That is because this debate is about two old parties trying to out-tough each other. It is about the right wing of the Labor Party saying, 'When faced with a choice, we would rather go and work with the coalition than work with the Greens or the crossbenchers to find a solution.' Now we find ourselves in a situation in which history is repeating. Instead of going back to Malcolm Fraser, we have gone back to John Howard. The most disappointing thing about it is that there is a better side to Australians. In the years after the Vietnam War, we took in between 90,000 and 100,000 people from Vietnam. We saw them coming in boats. We saw the tragedy that that involved and we said that we needed a regional solution that involved looking after these people and taking our fair share. It was by no means pretty or necessarily the most humane thing. It was a very distressing time for very many people. And it involved people being held in processing centres for a while.


But what we did not do when they arrived here on boats was turn them around. What we did not do was say, 'You've made your way here by boat, so we're going to take you to another country and let them look after you.' Instead, we said to the whole country and to the refugees: 'This is a problem. We've played a role in it. There are people coming here after fleeing a war'—and we should recognise that echo with the people who are coming here after Afghanistan—'and we will come up with a solution that is not only going to stop you getting so desperate that you'll jump on a boat but that will be humane. We will not need to suspend our obligations under the refugee convention and we will certainly not need to say that the whole of Australia does not count as Australia if you arrive here by boat.'


If you ask people in this country whether or not it was a good thing that we did that, most will tell you that it was. Everyone can tell you the story of someone they know in their family, in their workplace or in their street who came here as a refugee and who has now made this country a better place by virtue of being here. There is a better side to each and all of us as citizens of this country. The choice for the leadership of the government is this: which side are they going to pander to? Are they going to pander to the worst in us, the most fearful in us, and embark on a battle that they can never win, which is to try and out-tough Tony Abbott on this question? Or are they going to say, 'No matter what kinds of walls we put up around this country, because we are a democracy people are always going to come here, so the question is how to manage it, not how to try and win votes out of it in outer suburban marginal electorates in New South Wales or Queensland'? The question should be: how do we make Australia better? I reckon if you asked people most would tell you that they would be up for that challenge. But it requires leadership.


We have not seen that leadership and as a result we find ourselves here yet again deciding that we are going to provide differential treatment and have different classes of people. If you had happened to have found your way here by boat 30 years ago, you would have been welcomed and made a part of Australia and would now be one of those people running a business, in a leadership position, in a parliament somewhere in this country or an archbishop. But now we are saying: 'Potentially you will find yourself on a prison island or somewhere else if the government approves that. You will be held for an indefinite period of time. We don't care what mental health consequences that is going to have for you. You are there as an example to be a deterrent for others.' That is not the kind of country that I want and it is not the kind of country that many other people here want either.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (17:56):  I am pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. We would not be here tonight debating this at all if this Rudd-Gillard government had not have changed the policies in 2007. We had policies that worked. People have said this many times, but it has to be said again: when the Rudd government took over in 2007, there were four people who had arrived by boat in detention. The policies worked. No matter how you spin it and no matter how you play with it, at the end of the day the changing of the policies that the member for Berowra put in, which included temporary protection visas, the offshore Pacific solution and the turning back of boats where it was safe to do so, worked. The number of people coming by boat dried up to a trickle.


Let us look at the history of this. I was in the parliament at the time when John Howard brought in these measures—the Tampa solution. I was elected in that year, 2001, so I remember it well. People wanted us to do something about this, and we did. It sent a very strong signal to people smugglers that we were not open for business. Unbelievably, the Rudd Labor government made a great fanfare of dismantling that policy. Western Australian Senator Chris Evans was the immigration minister at the time. I felt pretty cheated by the way he gloated at what he did to a successful policy. I will be reminding my electorate in Western Australia of the role of Senate Evans in this come the next election, because they need to know who was responsible for the dismantling of a successful government policy that saved this country a lot of money and saved a lot of lives.


Senator Evans gloated about dismantling not only the solution but the camps at Manus Island and Nauru. When this new solution was taken on by the Gillard government, they complained that the camp on Nauru had fallen into disrepair and was derelict. They talked in the same manner about Manus Island. The minister at the time, Senator Evans, should be castigated for having bragged about destroying government property or being a barracker for those who destroyed government property.


Eventually the message filtered through to the people smugglers that Australia was open for business again. This government saw a sudden and exponential increase in the numbers of people deciding to take the risky journey to Australia. I speak about this with a little bit of authority, because I have been to Afghanistan and seen the people there who want to come to Australia by any means. I have been to Sri Lanka recently and I met with those detained by the Sri Lankan navy and talked with them about their reasons for coming. And I can tell you, in Sri Lanka, not one person that I spoke to said they were coming here for humanitarian reasons—not one person. They said they were coming here because they knew they could get a good job and there was a lot of money in Australia. When I told them they would not get a visa they said to me, 'It doesn't matter; we'll try, and we'll try again.' Interestingly, the minister, who is at the table, probably does not want to be aware of this, but the money that they get to go home is worth about three years' salary to many Sri Lankans, particularly in the north. It is not much of a deterrent: $16 a week is what the guy serving me in Jaffna told me he earns. So it is not a bad lure to come here and be sent home with your three years' salary.


But let's get back onto this disgraceful backflip, as it has been described by everybody who has been speaking on this bill—even the Greens member, Adam Bandt, from Melbourne. This hypocrisy knows no bounds. At least the member for Melbourne is consistent. I do not agree with the Greens' policies—I think they are pretty whacky and out of touch with the reality of the Australian electorate, who want to see an orderly migration system, not the one that the Greens want where they say, 'We need to better facilitate their entry into Australia.' Unless you vote Greens, you just do not ascribe to that strange logic about getting people here.


I was in the parliament in 2006 when we were vilified, up hill and down dale, by everyone possible in this place, when John Howard wanted to do what this bill wants to do—that is, essentially excise Australia from being a migration zone. We first talked about the islands around Australia. Oh, shock horror! People said it was unconstitutional, it was un-Australian; and now the current government, as we did in 2006, suddenly, because it was recommended by the three members of their advisory panel, have decided to have a go at this. But let us just remember: they vilified us as well about the Pacific solution. They had to contract out their advice, and they got the Houston committee to then tell them, 'Yes, you should try Manus Island and Nauru'—too late; they are coming in their droves. You cannot build a camp big enough to accommodate the thousands of people who are coming per month.


So what has happened? Australia is full. Inverbrackie is full. Curtin is full. Northam is full. Leonora is full. They are opening up the centre at Tasmania. What is the next solution? 'Well, we tried to get people to take them as billets, and we wanted to pay them so much a week'—so all these poor ladies around Australia were happy to try and earn a quid by billeting a few refugees while they waited. That has not worked; it has not really cut through or taken off. So what are we going to do? We are going to let them come here, but, because there are so many of them, they can now get a bridging visa to stay in Australia but they cannot work. As I said, I remember the hypocrisy of what they were saying when we did what we did—and it worked.


It has been said, but I have to remind you: it was not only people like Senator Evans, and, of course, the minister at the table, Minister Bowen, who said that this was a 'dark stain on the character of Australia'—these people are not consistent. As I said, at least the Greens are consistent. We are consistent. The only inconsistent ones in this debate are the Labor Party, because they have had so many incarnations and conversions on the way to the Pacific solution—not on the road to Damascus, I can tell you; it is on the road to Nauru and Manus Island—that no-one believes them anymore. People came up to me when I hosted Tony Abbott in my electorate last week and they were saying to us, 'Are you certain you can stop this situation?' And we said, 'Yes, because we've done it before, and it works.'


I heard the member for Berowra in this place say that, when he brought in these measures, he did not know which would work the best of the suite of three measures, but he said that, when you put them all together, they worked. Unfortunately, this government has only got one real part of that suite, one leg of the three-legged stool—and that is the Pacific solution.


Temporary protection visas, which Tony Abbott wants to move a private members' bill on, will test the government to see if they are real in wanting to give a further deterrent. Because, as we know, and you have to explain to people in the electorate—which I do—temporary protection visas allow people to come here and, while their status is being determined as to whether they are genuine refugees or their countries are safe enough to return to, they can have some work rights.


And I tell you what is cutting through to the electorate also—Tony Abbott's enunciation of the fact that we should be allowing these people to be receiving Work for the Dole type payments, because people do not want those arriving here without a legal reason to do so getting on our welfare system. We know that this measure allows them to earn 89 per cent of Newstart. So there you are: you have people in my electorate who are doing it really hard, and I tell you what makes them really angry—and I would be pleased if the minister at the table would listen to some of these. I have people ringing up my electorate office, or emailing me on a daily basis, who are  trying to get here legitimately. A gentleman from the Boddington Gold Mine emailed me today. He has a good job, he pays a lot of tax—about $40,000 a year—he has married an overseas lady, who is pregnant, and he is having real problems getting her to Australia before the birth of the child. And then they see the fact that, if you turn up by boat, you can come straight in and live in the burbs and probably get a house out of it as well. That is what makes them really cross. The number of migration issues that come through my office from people legitimately trying to come here and bring their families, or to reunite or to bring their skills here—it is disgraceful. And yet they see thousands of people coming—30,000 since the government have been in office; 8,000 since they introduced their version of the Pacific solution. And they try to get one member of their family in. No wonder they are so cross and upset with the way the government are treating our immigration policies.


But going back to all of those who wanted to vilify us on this issue—the minister at the table has probably had his ears belted all day—there were right-wingers like the member for Watson, Tony Burke, saying, 'Australia is better than this bill,' 'The legislation before us today undermines our sovereignty,' 'It is offensive to our decency,' and, 'It makes a mockery of this parliament,' The member for Hotham said, 'Labor opposes it outright,' 'There is nothing you can do to this excision bill that will fix it,' 'We will not seek to amend it; we will oppose it in its entirety,' and, 'This bill is shameful and xenophobic.' What happened six years later? 'We are remade, morphed, reborn; we have a different view—we turned 180 degrees. We don't believe in anything we believed in before.' It is just woeful. Of course, we are not going to oppose the bill, because it is the bill we brought to this parliament six years ago.


I will be interested to see what some of the members of the Labor Party do if this comes to a vote—though it will probably be a mickey because we are supporting it. The member for Fremantle has been very outspoken on what a disgraceful set of measures these are, yet I imagine that, if it does come to a vote, she will vote for these measures. She tried to say before that she did not vote for them because there was a mickey, but she did not cross the floor and join those on the mickey vote. She told the Fremantle Herald, when I wrote to her newspaper, that she supported these measures, after saying she could not, would not and did not vote for them. The only reason she did not vote was that it was a mickey vote. I will be pointing this out in the Fremantle Herald when this vote comes up.


The electorates of other left-wing members of this parliament should know their duplicity on this issue as well. In 2006, the Leader of the House, when the parliament was debating the legislation last time, said:


Today this parliament is debating a bill that reduces us as a parliament and as a nation.


…   …   …


This bill is wrong in principle and it is wrong in motivation.


…   …   …


This bill is a disgraceful shirking of responsibility by Australia and it must be rejected. The Australian Labor Party rejects it.


That is what the member for Grayndler said. What do the people in the electorate think? As I said, there have been quite a few backflips. On Monday, 26 November, under the headline 'Charities will struggle to help refugees', the West Australian reported:


WA charity groups have condemned the Federal Government’s policy to dump thousands of refugees in the suburbs, saying they cannot deal with any extra demand on their already overstretched resources.


We know that the shortage of public housing in Western Australia is 20,000, so how will the demand be met? In that report, Anglicare Western Australia executive Ian Carter said the policy 'lacked foresight'. St Vincent de Paul said it was 'inhumane'. I could go on.


But suddenly there is another little crack in the wall. Today, Michael Gordon in the Sydney Morning Herald reported, under the headline 'Work rules for asylum seekers to be relaxed':


NEW rules denying asylum seekers the right to work for up to five years will be relaxed …


It quotes the minister, Chris Bowen, who, the article said:


… wanted over time to work out how people arriving by boat had 'appropriate support and care, and where appropriate they have some mechanism in place to be able to support themselves'.


That is code for, 'How are they going to get a job?' You are either going to give them a temporary protection visa—a decent, honest visa—or you are going to give them this mickey mouse visa that essentially allows them to cheat. I spoke on the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill yesterday, where the provisions against anyone who allows someone to work illegally are being toughened up. So the poor old employer cops all the hammering and fines and everything if he allows someone to work in this country who is not legally entitled to do so. This is only going to encourage people on the breadline to try to get work in the black economy.


This is a disgraceful exhibition of hypocrisy by the Labor Party. They are not doing it properly. They are not going to solve this problem unless they take a deep breath, realise they made a total mistake in 2007 and adopt the full suite of measures of the Howard government, which worked and stopped this evil trade.

"Thomson, Craig, MP",Ind.,2012-11-27,"



Mr CRAIG THOMSON
 (Dobell) (18:10):  This is not an easy issue for governments to deal with. It is not an easy issue for the community to deal with. It is a difficult question where time changes the way in which solutions should be looked at. There was a time when people would come to a parliament like this and argue that the White Australia policy was right. People changed their minds about that. Old policies were changed and new policies were adopted. So I understand that views that people may have had in the past have changed as circumstances have changed, but I do not agree with these changes. Obviously, while my politics are left of centre, they are not 'in the Left', and the characterisation by the previous speaker of people's views as fitting a particular grouping is simply not true.


My approach to policy has always been that we allow the markets to dictate what happens unless there is market failure. Can there have been a greater market failure than what has occurred with close to 40 million people seeking asylum around the world and not having a permanent place to live? There simply cannot be a greater issue that requires governments to act against the way in which society has broken down in some countries and left such large numbers, almost twice the population of Australia, looking for a permanent home because either their existing home is no longer safe or they have been kicked out and are no longer able to stay there. So I do not approach this necessarily with just a bleeding heart; I approach this matter in the same way that I approach every matter, and that is from the point of view of an absolute market failure and the question of how we deal with it. In that context, it is completely understandable that governments may change their minds on issues, but in this case they have done so wrongly.


There were two main reasons that I chose to enter parliament. One was to make sure we got rid of Work Choices and the terrible effects that was having on families, particularly families that commute a lot, as they do on the Central Coast. The second reason was the way in which we treat those people who are less fortunate than us but may not have been born in this country. I was concerned with how we deal with them in a humane way that does not affect the integrity of Australia's borders or make Australia a less secure place. So I am particularly disappointed. I understand the government is searching in a very difficult situation for a solution, but I am very disappointed that they have taken the step of supporting something that they quite rightly rejected in 2006.


Let's be very honest about this. It is just a tricky technical nonsense to actually say that Australia is not part of Australia for the purpose of people seeking asylum. But it is even more tricky than that because it is only not Australia if you have come by boat. And it is even more tricky than that, because if you get on a P&O cruise liner in Fiji and then come to Sydney Harbour and seek asylum, again, you are not affected by this legislation. So the government has picked a particularly inhumane and tricky way of trying to deal with what is a major global problem that requires not short-term political point scoring but long-term solutions that are going to make sure that the people who are in most need are looked after.


I can understand the pressure on the government when you have an opposition that has its head in the sand about these issues and will continually look at pointscoring rather than at positive solutions to this. I listened to the member for Melbourne's contribution and I think the Greens have also failed in this area. They had the opportunity to support the government in talking about regional processing and looking at solutions that go beyond one country. They failed in relation to that and they cannot come in here and say that what they are doing is right. They played the politics of this as well. So we have all parties playing politics with people's lives and ignoring the facts that are there.


Australia is not one of the most generous refugee intake countries in the world—we hear the opposite all the time, but it is simply not true. We are the 14th largest economy yet we accept 0.03 per cent of the world's refugees. I have heard other contributors, including the member for Melbourne, talk about what Australia did in the aftermath of Vietnam. We were accepting about six per cent of world refugees at that time. We are now taking in 0.03 per cent.


One of the other points that has been made—and both parties have made a lot of it—is that stopping the boats will save lives. Well, cutting off someone's last line of escape is no great favour. If you are killed by the Taliban you are just as dead as if you drown. People who are making this very difficult decision about getting on a boat are not doing it for any other reason than that this is their last hope. The argument is often put—and the member for Canning was trying to make this point—that the boat arrivals are not genuine refugees, they are here for economic reasons. That is simply just not true, and it does not hold out in terms of the acceptance of asylum seekers, ultimately, when their claims are processed. If you are looking at where the non-genuine overstayers are then it is clearly plane arrivals. Only between 20 to 40 per cent of plane arrivals who seek asylum in this country are successful. Compare that with the 85 to 90 per cent of people who arrive by boats; clearly, the argument that people are getting on boats to seek some economic advantage just cannot be made out. They are coming because they are desperate, and 85 to 90 per cent of them are successful in having their claims met. They are indeed genuine asylum seekers.


The argument is also put that these people are queue jumpers. Can I say that with close to 40 million seeking asylum in the world it is a terribly long queue. If there were a queue to join, it would take you 135 years to work your way through that queue before you were processed here. So that whole argument is absolute nonsense. It is a cover for people who are racist. That is simply what it is and it has to be said that that is what it is. People who say that there is a queue are actually saying, 'We do not want these people coming here. We do not care about what their circumstances are. We simply do not want them in this country. That is it.' That is a much more honest position to put. We hear, particularly from the coalition, people talking about hypocrisy and so forth. Well, put your argument that you do not want foreigners per se coming to this country, because there is no queue, and if there were one it would take 135 years.


Look at how someone from, say, Afghanistan would seek asylum in Australia. The argument would probably be that they would go to the Australian embassy to seek asylum. But the address of the Australian embassy is, for security reasons, quite clearly and obviously kept secret. So there is nowhere to go in Afghanistan if you want to seek asylum in Australia. It is an absolute nonsense that there is some queue that people can go to and line up in.


These are some of the issues that have been raised as to why we should not be taking people. I actually think that the minister in 2006 made a very good speech, and I know it has been quoted a lot. What he said in 2006 holds just as much now as it did then. He started by saying that in 1951 the United Nations Convention for the Protection of Refugees came into force. The world realised the mistakes of the 1930s, when many western nations turned their backs on Jews fleeing persecution in Germany. Collectively, we said, 'Never again.' I am sure that all of us involved in public life would like to think that we would have done the right thing in those circumstances and stood up for those facing the worst of circumstances, regardless of whether it was popular or unpopular. He went on to talk about the then Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, saying that if it passes parliament 'it will be the day that Australia turned its back on the refugee convention and on refugees escaping circumstances that most of us can only imagine'. He said:


This is a bad bill with no redeeming features. It is a hypocritical and illogical bill. If it is passed today, it will be a stain on our national character. The people who will be disadvantaged by this bill are in fear of their lives, and we should never turn our back on them. They are people who could make a real contribution to Australia.


That was true six years ago and it is equally true now. The government find themselves reacting to the politics and they need to be above that.


I represent the electorate of Dobell. The only time a Labor member lost the seat was in 2001, at the Tampa election. At that particular election there were big posters right around the electorate saying, 'We choose who comes to this country.' We were all saying what a terrible thing that was, yet here we are trying to reproduce almost exactly the same type of legislation—reacting to the same things that happened then. The government are doing it for political reasons. They think that if they are tough in relation to this area they will be rewarded at an election. They are simply ignoring history if they believe that. In 2001 we lost Dobell. We lost some seats even though the approach of the Labor Party at that time was to say: 'We will do everything that Prime Minister John Howard is saying. We support it all. We are not disagreeing with it.' We were trying to make sure there was no difference between us. The Labor Party have clearly not learnt their lesson. They have not learnt their political lesson and they need to get their moral compass back on track in relation to these issues. They did after a period of time in opposition. By 2006, they were fine, looking at these issues in a rational way. They are reacting to very difficult circumstances. They are reacting to a public policy issue that is not easy and does not have a magic bullet solution, but most of all they are reacting to the political bait that is being put by the opposition. It is wrong morally and it is wrong electorally for the Labor Party to go down this path.


I have thought a lot about what I am going to do in this. I will be opposing this legislation. I have thought a lot about it because of the way in which people in my electorate voted in 2001. Do you know what? Sometimes you have to do what is right. Chris Bowen, the minister, as the member for Prospect back in 2006, said, 'You've got to take a decision, even if it will be unpopular, as long as you're sure that it's right.' It is right that this bill is defeated. Australia is Australia. We cannot play tricky word games and try to pretend it is something it is not. We hold ourselves out to be part of the world community. We need to show that we are mature enough to take responsibility on a range of these issues and we should reject this bill wholeheartedly.

"Broadbent, Russell, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (18:26):  As a dear friend of mine often says, prefacing remarks in a political conversation: 'To know where we are today, we have to go back to where we began.' We began with the Australian community's outrage over women and children, and thousands of others, detained behind razor wire, languishing on temporary protection visas in a land where the liberty, freedom and the rule of law are a given, and taken for granted. This bill is yet another step to take us back full circle to a place of national shame. It directly offends the tenet, values and arrangements negotiated by me and others which were passed into law by the Howard government in 2004, then tested and reaffirmed under a set of different circumstances in 2006. That agreement went to the heart of protecting the most vulnerable individuals from life behind a razor-wire fence. It went to the heart of how we treat genuine refugees seeking solace within our shores. The wrongs that were righted removed a disgrace. This proposal is a disgrace and it bring disgrace upon us all.


I stand today more in sorrow than in anger. With injustice and indifference at its core, this proposal to excise the Australian mainland from the migration zone resurrects the legislation proposed in 2006 by the then Howard government. I opposed it then; I oppose it now. If this were not of such a serious nature I would have thought it were a joke. This legislation joins Tasmania with Christmas Island, 5,399 kilometres apart! Though we differ, my party has been entirely consistent in support of this policy position under the leadership of John Howard, Brendon Nelson, Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott. In stark contrast, other members of this House called the 2006 genesis of this bill as being immoral and xenophobic. They were right then. This policy reversal is wrong now. Today, these same representatives sit as members of executive government, parroting their predecessor's policy disgrace. That our leadership—and I am talking about both parties—has come to an enabling consensus on this matter is not a display of unity and bipartisanship; rather, it is a retreat from leading the national debate to a higher place for a greater purpose. I said in 2006 that my decision then to oppose similar legislation was made because it was in the national interest of this Great South Land that it continue to be a passionate protector of the rights of genuine refugees. My position is unchanged today for the sake of our national interests both at home and abroad. I oppose this legislation now as I did its predecessor because it is offends the stand—and it seems today that these words were spoken so long ago—I made in 2006, when I said that Australia should remain:


… a place where dreams come true, where the impossible becomes the possible and the probable becomes the inevitable … where people find a sense of belonging … a place of hope for generations of new immigrants.


I stand tonight in a place of discomfort and controversy in a debate that is complicated, divisive and polarising. In this moment I can choose to be either at peace with my party, unified in opposition to this poor excuse for a Labor government or at peace with my heart for this nation. I choose to be at peace with my heart for this nation. I oppose these Labor Party bills and all who join with them in their intent to enact unjust laws which while they are on our statutes will remain a blight on our national integrity.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (18:31):  Today is a rare day for the government. Today this government is doing something which makes sense, which has a chance of working, which might restore some integrity to Australia's borders and which might act as a deterrent to the repugnant trade of people smugglers who traffic in human misery.


The objective of the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 is to expand the existing offshore processing regime to apply to all persons who arrive unlawfully by sea to mainland Australia. You could be forgiven for thinking that the objective of this bill sounds familiar. That would be because it is familiar. This bill is almost a carbon copy of the bill passed by the House of Representatives under the Howard government in 2006 when it expanded offshore processing to apply to people arriving on mainland Australia. How embarrassing it must be for the government to introduce this bill into the House. Maybe the answer to the question of why the government is doing so lies in the difference between what the now Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, is saying now and what he had to say back in 2006 when he, along with his Labor colleagues, opposed the Howard government's introduction of the almost-identical bill. The now minister described that bill then as a 'stain on our national character'. But what is he saying today? Ms Ellis, who is now also a minister, said that the bill was 'ludicrous', 'harsh', 'inhumane' and 'gutless'—and it went on and on. The hypocrisy of the government's U-turn is absolutely breathtaking.


Tragic and unacceptable loss of life and unprecedented budgetary disaster have flowed from Labor's staggeringly incompetent border protection policies. Labor's border protection policies should be likened to an employment program for people smugglers. The Howard government put the people smugglers out of business; Labor resurrected their business. Since November 2007, when Labor announced that it was dismantling the coalition's border protection polices, there have been 30,000 unauthorised maritime arrivals. This is more people than live in cities such as Alice Springs, Warrnambool, Nowra, Albany, Maryborough and Devonport. It is about 1½ times the number of people who live in cities such as Goulburn, Armidale, Whyalla and Mount Isa.


Since November 2007, Labor's failures on our borders have got worse. The government's policies have been half-hearted, and it has made policy switches from one month to the next. The government is not up to the job, and it is not up to the commitments that it has made. More than half the number—that is, 15,403—of the 30,057 unauthorised maritime arrivals under this government have turned up this year, and more than a third—that is, 10,146—have turned up since 1 July. More people have turned up on more boats in 2012 alone than in the entire 11½ years of the Howard government yet Labor still refuses to acknowledge that it got it horribly wrong when it abolished the Howard government's policies, and it continues to get it wrong by refusing to restore them. This is what happens when intractable political incompetence blinds sensible decision making. Sadly, this dynamic occurs all too often in this government.


At the average rate of arrivals over the full term of the Howard Government, it would have taken John Howard more than 25 years as Prime Minister to reach the number of unauthorised maritime arrivals that have occurred under Labor in less than five years. Under the Howard government's policies, it would have taken more than 500 years to reach 30,000 unauthorised maritime arrivals. Labor's record on border protection shows breathtaking incompetence. It reads as follows. Since the last election, Labor's failures on our borders have increased threefold: in Labor's first term there were 7,349 illegal boat arrivals; so far in Labor's second term there have been more than 22,000. The average monthly rate of arrivals over Labor's second term is almost four times higher—and at current levels it is 10 times higher—than it was in Labor's first term. Absolutely tragically, under Labor's policies more than 1,000 people have perished at sea. At least 8,100 people who have been waiting offshore in desperate circumstances have been denied Australia's protection because they did not come on a boat.


I heard the member for Dobell expressing an interesting slant on border protection policy. He said that there is no such thing as people waiting in queues and no such thing as a United Nations humanitarian refugee waiting list. But I have been to refugee camps. I have spoken to people who have been interviewed. I have been to the Thai-Burmese border and seen the 140,000 people there who are waiting offshore and who are applying under the correct processes to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Also, the budget has blown out. It has blown out to $6.6 billion and counting, including $1.7 billion this year.


This Labor government's policy has done incredible damage to Australia's humanitarian and immigration programs. It has been a public policy disaster in humanitarian terms and also in budgetary terms. There is no other way to describe it. This will put an incredible pressure on public housing. There are agencies like the Red Cross and others who are doing an incredible job, but these numbers keep rising. There will be incredible pressures put on state governments in terms of health and education.


This bill will replace the concept of 'offshore entry person' with the concept of 'unauthorised maritime arrival'. It will mean that more persons who arrive on Australian soil by boat will be subject to removal to an offshore processing country and they will be processed according to that country's regime. What this means is that the bill will effectively excise the Australian mainland from the Migration Act, which is intended to be a disincentive for people to make the journey to Australia.


Labor continues to fail to implement the full suite of measures the coalition had in place. Every day, when they say they will bring out a policy, they keep retreating. Today we saw a retreat, again, on work rights. They were not going to introduce work rights; now they are softening on work rights with the temporary protection visa update and changes that they announced a few days ago. This policy keeps evolving and changing; no wonder people smugglers continue to send people here; they have absolutely no surety about what the government is going to say from one policy decision to the next, or what they are going to stick to.


This government has continued to change its policy from day to day. We introduced these measures in 2006. The impact of these measures would have been much more significant if this government had introduced the full suite of measures. This bill is a step in the right direction and the coalition will support it. The challenge for the Labor Party now is to embrace the complete policy and political honesty, adopt the remainder of the coalition's border protection policies and put people smugglers out of business.


But do not hold your breath for that one, Deputy Speaker. That is too much policy logic from Labor, and after five years of policy failure it is probably expecting a bit too much.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (18:40):  Before I speak to the bill I would like to acknowledge in this chamber the very courageous and wise words of the member for McMillan. I feel privileged indeed to count him as a friend and to have him as a colleague in this place.


The Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 gives effect to recommendation 14 of the Houston expert panel, which proposed excising the Australian mainland so that a person arriving by sea, without a visa, cannot apply for a protection or other visa unless the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship determines that it is in the public interest to lift that restriction.


The practice of excising parts of Australian territory started in 2001, and a bill to expand the excision of the Australian mainland was introduced and passed in the House of Representatives in 2006. As my colleague said, he and I and other colleagues, the former member for Cook, who is somewhere in the gallery, and the former member for Kooyong, opposed that bill at that time. But so concerning were the measures outlined in that bill that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, chaired by then government Senator Marise Payne, recommended that 'the bill not proceed'. It was withdrawn when it was clear it would not pass the Senate—not because of the terrible ramifications of that piece of legislation, but because it simply was not going to pass in the Senate, and that would have been an embarrassment to the government.


The report included a number of recommendations to limit the effects of the bill should the government still elect to introduce it. These were fairly extensive but went to transparency, procedural fairness, special consideration for women and children, parliamentary and/or ombudsman scrutiny of operations on Nauru and Manus Island and a sunset period of 18 months for the operation of the legislation.


This bill before the House has the same intent. It effectively warehouses people in a foreign country and continues a pattern of punitive, arbitrary, indefinite, mandatory detention. These are people: men, women and children who have not been convicted of any crime. May I say, that in looking at these issues over a lengthy time line—I think it has been a 10-year period—there has been more than one inquiry a year into the effects of mandatory detention, and all of them have warned government of the dire consequences of this policy. Yet governments of both persuasions have ignored all of those reports—some of them from their own parliamentary committees.


What really concerns me is that this legislation places these people out of reach of the Australian legal system and casts doubts as to whether any review process will ever be available to them. Our democracy is underpinned by the rule of law, which requires, as a minimum, access to judicial review of administrative action, the right to a fair trial, the right to private communication with a lawyer and access to the courts. This bill is a crack in each of those foundation stones of our democracy. That is why people out there ought to be concerned about the passage of such legislation in unseemly haste in this place. We should ask the question: who or what will protect these people from processing errors? Who or what?


In justifying these extreme measures, the expert panel report provided just two paragraphs of reasoning for such a draconian piece of legislation. On the statistics alone, it is difficult to justify the excision of the whole mainland. In the decade since 2001, a total of five boats have managed to get as far as the Australian mainland—and those five boats carried only 86 people. This is not an avalanche, a tsunami or an invasion. It is hardly a number to give rise to the implementation of such an extreme piece of legislation—a piece of legislation which discriminates against an asylum seeker simply on the basis of the mode of travel they used to come to this country.


Yet we continue along this path, with this bill being the final legal brick in the creation of fortress Australia. Let us be clear: Australia has signed the refugee convention, but it seems the government has no intention of meeting its obligations under that agreement. This bill, combined with the recently passed Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill, the existing legal framework, the memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru and Papua New Guinea, and the new no-advantage test, completes a cunning suite of legislation and international agreements devised by government to effectively avoid Australia's obligations under the refugee convention.


I read a wonderful article in the Canberra Times this morning. It was by Professor William Maley from ANU and Penelope Mathew and was entitled 'Bowen's asylum line is illegal.' They note:



First, international law is underpinned by the simple but powerful principle of 'pacta sunt servanda', namely that every treaty in force is binding on the parties to it and must be performed by them


in good faith. In the exercise of its sovereign capacity, Australia, when it acceded to the Refugee Convention, made a solemn set of 
commitments to other states. If it were to dishonour those commitments, it could hardly expect to be taken seriously if it then complained when other states chose to dishonour their commitments under a whole range of treaties and conventions from which Australians stand to benefit.


The article was worth reading in its entirety and I had a conversation just this afternoon with William Maley on these issues.


Under this new regime, asylum seekers will, at the very least, spend years languishing in detention in foreign countries even if they have been assessed as a refugee, and they may never be able to successfully apply for asylum in Australia. A dissection of the suite of measures uncovers the devil in the detail. Take, for instance, Nauru. The MOU states that refugees will be processed under Nauruan law. This is confirmed by Australia's Department of Immigration and Citizenship in material given to asylum seekers. But, to apply for an Australian refugee visa under regulation 866.21 of the Australian Migration Act regulations, the applicant must be a person to whom 'Australia has protection obligations under the Refugee Convention.'


This is an incredible sleight of hand. It is difficult to see how any asylum seeker can argue Australia's protection obligations are applicable when they are determined to be a refugee in Nauru, under Nauruan law, which is now a signatory to the refugee convention. When I speak to lawyers, it is clear that they can barely understand the complexities in this suite of legislation. Consider the consequences for just one moment. We have shovelled off these desperate people to a country which simply cannot absorb or resettle them, in the process potentially extinguishing any legal claim they have to resettle in Australia. They will, as a result of the government's deliberate policy choice, languish in detention centres offshore for years at Australian taxpayer expense.


I hear speeches in this place about the huge cost of our asylum program. We could avoid that by treating these people decently, resettling them quickly and processing their claims quickly and efficiently. I will not go into that right now, but there is no justification for the huge expense to Australian taxpayers of this flawed policy. We need to ask ourselves what value we place on the rule of law if we are prepared to extinguish it for a political purpose. There can be no other reason for the sweeping changes in this bill.


Consider, for instance, the fact that, from 1 July 1998 to 27 July 2012, there were 79,498 protection visa applications from people who arrived in Australia by air. This is more than double the total number of people arriving by boat over the same period and it is 924 times more people than have arrived on the Australian mainland. Yet this bill will not affect air arrivals. These people, some of whom arrive in Australia with no intention of returning to their country of origin, will not be removed to an overseas detention facility. They will have access to merits review and will live and work in the community despite the fact that, statistically, only about 20 per cent to 30 per cent of them qualify for refugee status. That compares to 90 per cent of the people who arrive by boat qualify. How can this glaring difference in the way people are treated be justified? Why do we continue to demonise and penalise people who arrive by boat? It is difficult to accept the argument that Australia's approach of stripping away the protections contained in an international convention designed to protect human dignity and respect for human life should have any legal or moral force.


Addressing this issue requires more than tag lines. We must engage in a constructive regional dialogue and must first work to find durable policies in the source countries. We must use diplomacy and work with our neighbours in the region to address the common concerns about refugee flows, not just to resolve the political problems in Australia but to seek cohesive, humane policy for the region. This should include consultation with countries in the region to seek agreement to set up UNHCR approved regional processing centres and it should include a commitment by Australia to lift its refugee intake to a more realistic level. Under this process, people could not pick and choose a country to resettle in but would be allocated, as has been done successfully in the past, during the Indochinese conflict for example. I know that was slightly different, but there is no reason why this cannot be achieved. It is harder, it is slower but it is more sure.


Perhaps also it is time to discuss with the UNHCR the renegotiation of our humanitarian intake so we can relieve some of the pressures in the region, be good neighbours and take the bulk of our humanitarian intake from the immediate region, where the problem currently exists. These are matters worthy of discussion if we really want to stop people losing their lives crossing the ocean between Indonesia and Australia.


It will not be a quick political fix that resolves these matters. Rather, it will be the intelligent, diligent application of diplomatic skills and goodwill, and sensible policy making and sensible legislation. It may take longer but it will be surer and will produce a much improved humanitarian response.


I would like to finish with another quote from the article by Bill Maley and Penelope Mathew. The article begins:


Australia's refugee policy is now in a total mess. Rather than being guided by principles or even a measured pragmatism, it reflects the knee-jerk response of politicians who are desperate to win votes from the least informed parts of the electorate.


Like my colleague the member for McMillan, my heart is heavy when I have to come into this place and once again speak in this way about legislation being considered by this House.


In all conscience I cannot support this piece of legislation.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (18:54):  I acknowledge the contribution of my colleague the member for Pearce. She has been consistent in her views and certainly has cared sufficiently to express them.


Unfortunately the stark reality behind the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill is that the government has lost control of Australia's borders. It is a simple but inescapable conclusion demonstrating a serious policy failure, and after listening to the member for Pearce we can understand just how serious. This action represents the inability of the government to perform even the most fundamental function. A sovereign nation's borders are a part of its very definition. The first way we define a country of the world is to define its borders. This has been the way of human history. Nations have waxed and waned, and that has usually been measured by the expansion and contraction of their borders. Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome are historically defined by the borders they established and defended, and the same applies to civilisations around the world. Wars over borders have been fought throughout history—border issues are probably the cause of more wars than all the other causes combined. Throughout history leaders have been defined by their ability to manage and defend their nation's borders. So, when history reflects on the current government and its ability to manage Australia's borders, it will, unfortunately, only see dreadful, dismal failure.


Worse still, in my view, this has become not only a border protection failure but also a humanitarian, social and economic failure. When Labor came to power in 2008, purely driven by cheap politics it simply dumped a successful border protection policy. We did know that policy was a success—only four people were in the detention system at that time. But rather than build on that success the Labor government abandoned it—for all of the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, this has been done at a cost to the community. As I said, there is a social cost, there is an economic cost and there is a humanitarian cost. There is a border protection cost. It is interesting that the Labor government has come to this, given that it was a Democrat in the United States, John F Kennedy, who said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country'. That sentiment is important in this debate.


Most Australians are proud of their country and fiercely defensive of our borders. Most Australians do not agree with Labor's approach of abandoning our border protection. They are angry and frustrated. They are angry and frustrated not only because the government has jeopardised Australia's strong border reputation but also because of the financial blow outs that have been revealed. This does cause the social challenges in our community that I have referred to. It does impact on social cohesion, and people do become very concerned about what this approach is costing and who is paying for it. I am frequently asked, as I suspect many members of this House are, particularly in relation to aged care, about what has come out of the ACFI funding model for some of the smaller service providers as opposed to what this policy failure is costing. That is what this type of failure unfortunately causes in the community.


As I said earlier, this was a program that did cost, as we heard earlier, less than $100 million five years ago under the coalition government but it is now costing more than $1 billion under this government. The government said it would spend just $100 million in each of the years of 2010-11 and 2011-12, but they have spent $879 million and $1.2 billion respectively. The government went back to the parliament last year asking for another $295 million to cover the budget blow out, and the year before it needed an extra $120 million.


My constituents have got to the point where they do not believe that the Labor government can stop the boats or fix this mess. They know this is a dreadful policy failure, and I am concerned about its divisive nature in the community. The people do know that the coalition government had to deal with this in the 1990s. There was a dramatic increase in the number of boat people arrivals, from hundreds in 1998 to 1,000 in 1999—a tenfold increase since the early nineties. By 2001, the then coalition government made it clear that Australia needed to protect its borders and that it would take strong action to do so. In 2001, people smugglers made it to Australia 43 times. Thanks to the tough coalition policies of 2002, in 2002 they only made it once. Over the remaining years of the coalition government, 25 boats entered Australia illegally. That is an average of 3½ boats a year from 2002 to 2008.


As I said, there were only four people in the immigration detention system when Labor achieved government in 2007. But, in 2008, the Labor government cast aside that policy and basically threw open Australia's borders. In 2009, people smugglers reached Australia 61 times. In 2010, they earned their illegal income through 134 successful incursions. This basically put the vile people smugglers back in business, and I just cannot accept that. The floodgates reopened. Unfortunately, since Labor abolished the coalition government's Pacific solution, over 30,000 people have arrived on over 500 boats. When I look at that figure of 30,000-plus people, I see a city the size of Busselton, in my electorate. We also know of the tragedies that came with those boats—dreadful tragedies. At least 1,000 asylum seekers and crew have lost their lives at sea, and not one person to date has been processed offshore. Illegal boat arrivals are now occurring at the highest rate on record. We have gone from an average of three boat arrivals a year in 2002 to the arrival of, on average, 2,000 asylum seekers per month in recent times. It is just appalling, in my view, that people smugglers believe they are in control and in charge—and they are clearly making a fortune.


We need a solution to this problem, because the current approach is haphazard and just a mess, and we as a coalition have solutions to offer. The shadow minister for immigration, the member for Cook, has provided a bill this week that provides such a solution. The process that we are seeing from this government is in constant confusion. The re-establishment of temporary protection visas is an essential plank of a real response to people smuggling, and the member for Cook's bill will provide real action. Temporary protection visas were a vital and effective tool in ending the trade in human misery that is people smuggling.


The government of course has used a spurious argument in defence of its refusal of this effective tool. According to the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers released in August this year:


TPV grants from inception to abolition (1999-2007) was 11,206.86. Of the 11,206 people granted a TPV, 9,043 were irregular maritime arrivals. Of this number 8,600 (95 per cent) were eventually granted a permanent visa in Australia.


The Labor argument is that this somehow demonstrates that TPVs were ineffective. The reality is vastly different. TPVs did not prevent genuine asylum seekers coming to Australia, most of whom gained residency; but they did provide a real disincentive for those who were not genuine refugees.


The member for Berowra eloquently talked about the refugees waiting in camps who cannot afford to pay people smugglers exorbitant amounts of money, such as $10,000 or more. It is appalling that these TPV holders were able to gain priority over those who are in camps around the world and who have been denied access to Australia because we have people smugglers plying their vile trade and people who can afford to pay them. I do not support that at all. We need policies that address this but, with this government, that is exactly what we do not have. The Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers does not identify temporary protection visas as a failure, and the government should stop misleading the community in this way.


Of course, I understand why the government remain opposed to real solutions: they would have to acknowledge the successful policies of the coalition government. Most Australians understand that strong leadership involves acknowledging your mistakes and correcting them, but this government is not capable of that. Instead, the Labor government have brought another bandaid bill into this House to try and patch up what is a dreadfully failed policy—there is no doubt; we cannot cope with the 2,000 arrivals per month—and people simply do not trust them to get it right. How can you trust a government that cannot protect its borders, that cannot get border protection right? It is a fundamental responsibility of government.


To go back to where I started, there is no doubt that this is not only a border protection failure; it is also a humanitarian failure, a social failure and an economic failure of core government responsibility and core government policy.

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2012-11-27,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (19:06):  I rise to foreshadow an amendment I will be moving to the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 which would put into law the Bali process. I know I have been banging on about this all year, but I know it has the support of both major political parties in this chamber and, I would hope, the support of the vast majority of all members here.


The amendment will require an annual report from the minister, whoever that may be, on the Bali process and the work of government in the implementation of the Bali process, to be made to this House. It is good work that is being done, across party lines, offshore, that was started in 2002 by Alexander Downer and is continued under the current government, and, I understand, represented in the process by the minister at the table tonight, Minister Bowen.


The Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime is co-chaired by the governments of Indonesia and Australia. It brings together participants to work on very practical measures to help combat people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related transnational crimes throughout our Asia-Pacific region. It is the best we have in regard to the issues associated with slowing the movement of people within our region and trying to deal with issues of criminality associated with people-smuggling and trafficking. It is the mid- to long-term solution that so many people are looking for as the circuit-breaker to much of the short-term language that we hear dominating this debate in Australia today.


Even Paris Aristotle today in the Sydney Morning Herald again made the compelling case that only a mid-term, comprehensive, regional response will address the issues before the House. Speaking with reference to The Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, of which he was a member, Mr Aristotle said:


The panel presented an integrated package of 22 recommendations knowing it would take time to implement them … The report’s most important components were measures to establish an effective regional processing and protection framework that would build a safer system.


…      …   …


None of the measures are quick fixes, nor can they work on their own. The howls for immediate success and claims that it must have failed even though it has not been fully implemented are examples of the shrillness characterising this debate.


So that is one of the expert panel members in today's media in an opinion piece reflecting not so much on this legislation but on the ongoing debate that has gone off the rails in Australia today, and on the false expectations that are put to the Australian people from short-termism.


None of the issues in question and at stake that challenge public policy in this area will be nor can be fixed by short-term solutions. They need mid- to long-term solutions and they do require Australia to work with our near neighbours. If we try to go it alone in any particular policy way we will fail, and that is regardless of who is the minister of the day, and regardless of the government of the day, and regardless of which political parties are involved. Unless we work with our near neighbours in a coordinated way, as part of a regional process, we will fail. The recommendations that were made by the expert panel highlight that, and, again, people like Paris Aristotle have been highlighting that today. It is the reference point, the safe port, in all of this for public policy in regard to the Bali process, which is the bipartisan piece of work in all of this, and is something that I hope we can get codified into Australian law today.


So, like the expert panel, I am certain that regional cooperation and bilateral agreements will be central to the successful implementation of the recommendations of what is now known as the Houston report, and it is essential for the successful establishment of things such as offshore assessment and to protect against loss of life at sea. The movement of refugees in the Asia-Pacific region is not an issue that Australia can deal with in isolation in the absence of cooperation with other countries in our region. While Australia can establish regional processing arrangements in the short term, Australia's domestic policies alone will not easily deter those refugees who are desperately seeking protection from persecution.


The irregular movement of people affects many countries in our region, as much as if not more than it affects Australia. By and large, those who seek refuge in Australia have transited through the territory of one of Australia's neighbours before they arrive here. Movements into other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, on raw figures alone, are higher than movements into Australia. It is a myth that has made its way into the Australian community that it is any other way. Without a doubt, many of our Asia-Pacific neighbours are more challenged by more movements of asylum seekers than we in Australia are, largely because we are surrounded by water. That alone significantly slows the movement of people to Australia.


Therefore, we need to work with our near neighbours, not only on issues of people seeking asylum but also on issues that are equally challenging, if not more challenging, and which should challenge us as they should and do challenge our neighbours: issues of criminality associated with smuggling, and—for me, the most insidious of all crimes—the crime of trafficking in persons, a crime to which, in my view, Australia does not give the priority attention that it deserves as an issue of great prevalence throughout the Asia-Pacific region. As I say, in my view, if we are going to have a hierarchy of crimes then that is the worst one of all.


The countries of the Asia-Pacific region therefore share a substantial common interest in forming long-term strategies to regulate the movement of people. Indeed, this shared concern has already given rise to multilateral cooperation. As stated before, the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime provides the best regional mechanism through which Australia can encourage and cooperate with other countries in our region on matters relating to irregular migration and related issues.


The Bali process is particularly relevant in the context of this bill. It is committed to assisting other countries adopt best practices in asylum management in line with the principles of the refugee convention. Whilst there are countries involved in the Bali process that are not signatories to the refugee convention, this is our best chance as a region to put together a framework. Certainly Australia's obligations as a signatory would not allow us to act in a way that is in breach of our obligations under the refugee convention. Therefore, that is the standard that is set for the Bali process and the principles behind it.


Australia's ultimate long-term goal relating to refugees is to see the countries of the Asia-Pacific region treat all refugees in a way that is consistent with the principles of the refugee convention through this Bali process. Only through encouraging our neighbours to protect people from persecution can Australia truly discourage people from making dangerous boat journeys to Australia. That is done in a spirit of cooperation, not in a spirit of paternalism. This is an exercise in trying to work together on the full range of issues that challenge us all.


Mindful of this long-term imperative of the refugee issue, this House must acknowledge the central role of regional cooperation and the Bali process in informing sustainable and effective policies in this area. It is, therefore, my view—and, I hope, the House's view—that it is appropriate that we insert into this legislation the idea of having 12-monthly reports on the Bali process to the House. Certainly I hope it is an amendment that is considered in its spirit by all.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (19:16):  I thank members for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 in accordance with recommendation 14 of the report of the expert panel on asylum seekers which stated that arrival anywhere in Australia by irregular maritime means should provide individuals with the same status. That is, irregular arrival by sea anywhere in Australia should make a person liable to regional processing arrangements. At the forefront of the panel's reasoning in making this recommendation was the need to reduce any incentive for people to take even greater risks with their lives—such as staying longer on a boat to avoid Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef or some other excised place—in seeking to reach the Australian mainland and avoid being subject to regional processing arrangements.


As the panel emphasised, and as the government has acknowledged, the recommendations in this report are an integrated package. We have not accepted or rejected each recommendation; we accepted them all as a whole. Therefore, we are moving to implement every single recommendation. This is something that I have freely acknowledged many times publicly and it is indicative of the fact that we are the only party—not those opposite and not the Greens party—implementing all the recommendations of the expert panel's report.


Yes, this bill is directed squarely at boat arrivals, but so is the expert panel's report. As members would recall from the emotional but ultimately fruitless parliamentary debate of some months ago, the expert panel was prompted by people getting on boats and dying at sea. Hence the government implemented this as a circuit-breaker to get a breakthrough. We got the recommendations and we have been implementing them. Those arriving by plane are not the ones dying en route to Australia and are not the focus of this bill. Those arriving by plane are not risking their lives to get here. The very clear and universally agreed aim of the policy changes underlined by the expert panel's recommendations is the need to remove the incentive for people to take the dangerous journey by boat.


Clearly the expert panel makes a very strong recommendation for this bill, as I say, in order to remove what could be a perverse incentive to stay longer on boats. This bill is not about excising the Australian mainland from the migration zone. The definition of the migration zone is not being amended in this bill. Rather, a person will be subject to regional processing based on their status as an unauthorised maritime arrival—that is, by arriving in Australia, in the migration zone, by sea without a valid visa. This is in contrast to the current situation where an individual is only subject to regional processing if they enter Australia at an excised offshore place such as Christmas Island.


I have freely admitted and acknowledged that people will very obviously take a range of views on this issue—about this issue in particular and about the general issue more broadly. As I have said in other places, if after deeply considering all the issues people reach a different position and their moral compass points a different way, I will acknowledge and respect it. But people who argue entirely for onshore processing must acknowledge that that will continue to provide an incentive to come to Australia by boat. Without taking difficult decisions such as this, it would mean, inevitably, more deaths at sea. That is the simple fact.


I want to deal with the contribution of the member for Melbourne. In his speech he said that this government has not implemented extra pathways to Australia. He said, 'If only this government would implement some way for people to get to Australia more safely, if only this government would provide more places for those people in Indonesia, that would be the right thing to do.' The member for Melbourne seems unaware that we are doing exactly that. The member for Melbourne seems unaware or chooses to ignore the fact that this government has increased the humanitarian program to 20,000 places—the biggest increase in the humanitarian program in 30 years. As has been noted publicly this week, that is not a universal position across this chamber anymore. It was for a little while. It is not anymore. This government is committed to increasing the humanitarian program. In fact, we have done so. More visas have been issued offshore as a result of the increase to the humanitarian program.


What we will not do is focus that increase in the program entirely and exclusively on Indonesia. That would be to say that Australia's entire humanitarian program should be focused on those who can at least get to Indonesia, if not to Australia, because they can afford a people smuggler to get them to Indonesia or can get to Indonesia under their own steam. Our humanitarian program is about much more than that. It is about providing those alternative pathways, but it is also about providing hope to people who could not possibly afford a people smuggler—people in camps in Africa, people in camps in the Middle East, people in camps in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia—and other people who cannot make it to Indonesia. The Greens take a short-sighted approach that says, 'We're focused on Indonesia.' That is ignoring our moral responsibility to those in different parts of the world who deserve at least the chance of resettlement in Australia. So I completely reject the assertions of the honourable member for Melbourne, who just wilfully ignores the fact that this government has increased the humanitarian program to 20,000 places—yes, at some substantial cost to the budget because of the substantial resettlement support that we provide. The member for Melbourne seems to have not noticed this in the public debate in recent weeks, as the Greens regularly ignore things which are inconvenient to their argument. I suggest perhaps they are not alone there in this House occasionally.


The government continues to implement the panel recommendations and more. Today we saw another transfer of people back to Sri Lanka, people who are not exercising Australia's international obligations. We are swiftly returning them to Sri Lanka. So people who are coming to Australia for economic reasons are clearly being dealt with by our law and being returned to Sri Lanka—something that the Howard government was never able to achieve. Swift returns to Sri Lanka, in some cases within days of arrival, are being done by this government, because we have seen an increase in people arriving in Australia from Sri Lanka and a lot of this is clearly for economic purposes. But what we will not do is ignore our obligations under the refugee convention. We will at least hear the reasons for people's travel to Australia.


I know the opposition would turn boats around on the high seas—in my view, a breach of the refugee convention. We will not do that. But what we are doing is safely returning people to Sri Lanka. We are not conducting difficult and unsafe operations on the high seas but safely returning people by aeroplane to Sri Lanka. We have returned a very considerable number of people in recent weeks and we will continue to do so. We have also seen some voluntary returns, to Sri Lanka in particular but other nations as well—Iran in particular. But Sri Lanka is the nation which has received the most voluntary returns. Since 30 August more than 600 Sri Lankans have returned home, which I think underlines the point that people smugglers are selling false promises about what awaits people in Australia. They are selling the false promise of a fast track to a visa and what we are very clearly doing is giving the lie to that promise, taking action which is swift and which clearly shows the message. 


The Australian government's policy is clear. We want to resettle more refugees in Australia. We want to give more people the chance of life in Australia. We want to see 20,000 refugees resettled in Australia every year, which would make us the largest resettlement country in the world per capita and the second largest in absolute terms for UNHCR referred refugees. Certainly on some of the measures we are very close to Canada in terms of resettlement. It is this side of the House which is doing that. It is this side of the House which is committed to doing that. It is only this side of the House which is committed to giving more people the chance of life in Australia while also taking the difficult decisions to dissuade people from risking their lives to get to Australia by sea. It is very easy to say that that is not necessary. It is the government which has a responsibility to do so and we will continue to do so.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-11-27,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (17:41):  It is distressing to be here debating a bill that is similar for all intents and purposes to a step that was taken by the previous Howard government. Many of us had thought that we were no longer in an environment where we would start carving out bits of this country and saying that they did not count as properly being Australia for migration purposes. It is especially distressing because following the events that have happened this year—which everyone in this country would be aware of—where you could not fail to be moved by the tragedy of people drowning at sea as they were escaping to Australia to find a better life, we had in this parliament a unique opportunity to confront what is a difficult issue and what is a global issue; and that is the substantial movement of people around the world, and in this region, as they flee persecution, as they flee war, as flee torture and as they flee hunger. When we were presented with that opportunity, we could have had a rational debate about the kind of country that we want to be. Instead, in an environment that I have heard described as one of moral panic, where it was said that this parliament had to do something and it did not matter what it was as long as we did something, we found ourselves setting a course that would inevitably lead to bills like this.


I fear that we have gone where perhaps the right wing of the Labor Party has always wanted to take us, because Labor, instead of taking us back to Fraser, has taken us back to Howard. That is something that is a source of distress to many people in this country. We could have had inklings of that when we saw the first proposed Malaysia solution, which the High Court and the Angus Houston panel said did not contain sufficient protections for the most vulnerable people in the world as they fled, coming here and seeking our protection. Under the conventions that we had signed up to, it was not acceptable to take the people and then dump them in another country. We saw inklings of this desire of Labor to take us back to Howard from the recent announcement that people who have come here would not be allowed to work while they have their claims processed. We now see confirmation of it in a bill that, for all intents and purposes, excises the whole of Australia from the migration zone if you happen to arrive by boat. As we head into an election year we are seeing a distressing position increasingly being taken by the government. When there is a significant decision to be made on an important social issue, faced with the choice of whether to work with the coalition or to work with the Greens and other progressives in the parliament, the government is increasingly choosing to work with the coalition. We saw it recently on the Murray-Darling issue, and we are seeing it on the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.


There has been much talk about what alternatives we might have been able to come up with as a parliament—and there are many. But to have an alternative you need to shift your position and be willing to compromise. There was one fundamental issue on which the government was unwilling to compromise, and that was offshore processing: if someone finds their way here by boat after having escaped war, perhaps—after having fled, perhaps, halfway across the globe—then we want to take them to another country or an island; we do not want to process them here; we want to remove them from Australia, whether they are man, woman or child, and potentially lock them up indefinitely. That fundamental point was why the government chose to go and work with the coalition—and of course found a willing partner there. There is a road map for all of this, and that road map was set out by the Howard government.


Let us just consider for a moment someone who finds themselves in such a desperate situation that they will pay someone they have never met some money to get into a boat. This person may have been waiting in the camp in Indonesia, on our doorstep, for a number of years. There are over 8,000 people waiting there, with over 1,000 of them having been found to be refugees, but with no clear pathway out, and with Australia having taken only 50 or 100-odd people from the camp in the last year or two. If I were sitting in that camp, especially if I had been found to be a refugee, and I had seen others sitting near me waiting for years and years, and I did not see a pathway out, and someone came along and said, 'Give us a bit of money and I'll pop you on a boat and you'll get to Australia', well, I would do it. And I reckon anyone here would do it.


What are we doing with those people who come here? We are now putting them in a legal limbo. We are now saying to those people, who had no other clear pathway out, 'You are being put in legal limbo, because when you land you do not actually land in Australia; we reserve the right to now send you off somewhere else for an indefinite period of time.' The worst thing about this is that if the intention is to stop the boats—and I will come back to that in a moment—it will not work. We saw, under the Howard government, one of the biggest single maritime disasters, with 353 people dying at sea, at a time when offshore processing and the Pacific solution was at its height and in full force. And why is that? It is because unless Australia becomes as bad as Afghanistan under the Taliban, or unless Australia starts torturing its citizens, we are always going to be a better bet for people. And we are never going to become that bad, so people around the world, as they look for a safe haven, are always going to look to places like Australia.


We have signed up to the UN refugee convention and said that if people come here then we will look after and process them. If they are not found to be genuine refugees, we send them back; if they are, we find a way of helping them. We are not doing that for these people for whom we say we are going to insist on offshore processing. We will fail morally if we pass this bill, because we have not provided them with a safer alternative pathway. It is all well and good to talk about the no-advantage test. But really—morally—the only way you can say that that is a defensible proposal is if there is safe and quick pathway to come here other than by boat. If you are waiting in Indonesia or Malaysia the average processing time for you can be anything from four years upwards. If you want to take a mathematical average of the time in Malaysia, depending on the category you are in, it could be six or seven years.


We have an obligation—and this is what we could have done—to say, 'We will stop people drowning at sea by removing the risk and the incentive for them to get on a boat by providing safer pathways for coming to Australia.' We could have said—and this is what the Greens have been consistently proposing, even though others have sought to diminish our position as being simply about onshore processing—that if you start to take 1,000 people from the camps in Indonesia and beef up the processing we have there, whether through UNHCR or through Australia operating its own processing centre in Indonesia, and you do the same in Malaysia and increase our humanitarian intake, then all of a sudden the message that starts to go through those camps will be that Australia is taking people again. The message is that, if you are a genuine refugee and you wait your turn for long enough, you will find yourself either in Australia or being resettled somewhere else, so there is no point in getting on a boat. That is what almost all the experts who fronted up to the Houston inquiry, and who have spoken out since, have said is the answer. The people who are working on the ground in the camps in Indonesia and in Malaysia have said that the best thing you can do is give people in the camps hope that if they wait long enough they will find their way out to Australia. At the moment, there is no hope there.


There is lots of talk about the people smugglers' business model. The people smugglers' business model is based on the desperation and the lack of hope that people who are languishing in these camps feel. They feel that there is no other alternative. If we were serious—if this debate was really about saving the lives of refugees—we would have provided them with safer pathways. We have not done that at all. That is because this debate is about two old parties trying to out-tough each other. It is about the right wing of the Labor Party saying, 'When faced with a choice, we would rather go and work with the coalition than work with the Greens or the crossbenchers to find a solution.' Now we find ourselves in a situation in which history is repeating. Instead of going back to Malcolm Fraser, we have gone back to John Howard. The most disappointing thing about it is that there is a better side to Australians. In the years after the Vietnam War, we took in between 90,000 and 100,000 people from Vietnam. We saw them coming in boats. We saw the tragedy that that involved and we said that we needed a regional solution that involved looking after these people and taking our fair share. It was by no means pretty or necessarily the most humane thing. It was a very distressing time for very many people. And it involved people being held in processing centres for a while.


But what we did not do when they arrived here on boats was turn them around. What we did not do was say, 'You've made your way here by boat, so we're going to take you to another country and let them look after you.' Instead, we said to the whole country and to the refugees: 'This is a problem. We've played a role in it. There are people coming here after fleeing a war'—and we should recognise that echo with the people who are coming here after Afghanistan—'and we will come up with a solution that is not only going to stop you getting so desperate that you'll jump on a boat but that will be humane. We will not need to suspend our obligations under the refugee convention and we will certainly not need to say that the whole of Australia does not count as Australia if you arrive here by boat.'


If you ask people in this country whether or not it was a good thing that we did that, most will tell you that it was. Everyone can tell you the story of someone they know in their family, in their workplace or in their street who came here as a refugee and who has now made this country a better place by virtue of being here. There is a better side to each and all of us as citizens of this country. The choice for the leadership of the government is this: which side are they going to pander to? Are they going to pander to the worst in us, the most fearful in us, and embark on a battle that they can never win, which is to try and out-tough Tony Abbott on this question? Or are they going to say, 'No matter what kinds of walls we put up around this country, because we are a democracy people are always going to come here, so the question is how to manage it, not how to try and win votes out of it in outer suburban marginal electorates in New South Wales or Queensland'? The question should be: how do we make Australia better? I reckon if you asked people most would tell you that they would be up for that challenge. But it requires leadership.


We have not seen that leadership and as a result we find ourselves here yet again deciding that we are going to provide differential treatment and have different classes of people. If you had happened to have found your way here by boat 30 years ago, you would have been welcomed and made a part of Australia and would now be one of those people running a business, in a leadership position, in a parliament somewhere in this country or an archbishop. But now we are saying: 'Potentially you will find yourself on a prison island or somewhere else if the government approves that. You will be held for an indefinite period of time. We don't care what mental health consequences that is going to have for you. You are there as an example to be a deterrent for others.' That is not the kind of country that I want and it is not the kind of country that many other people here want either.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (17:56):  I am pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. We would not be here tonight debating this at all if this Rudd-Gillard government had not have changed the policies in 2007. We had policies that worked. People have said this many times, but it has to be said again: when the Rudd government took over in 2007, there were four people who had arrived by boat in detention. The policies worked. No matter how you spin it and no matter how you play with it, at the end of the day the changing of the policies that the member for Berowra put in, which included temporary protection visas, the offshore Pacific solution and the turning back of boats where it was safe to do so, worked. The number of people coming by boat dried up to a trickle.


Let us look at the history of this. I was in the parliament at the time when John Howard brought in these measures—the Tampa solution. I was elected in that year, 2001, so I remember it well. People wanted us to do something about this, and we did. It sent a very strong signal to people smugglers that we were not open for business. Unbelievably, the Rudd Labor government made a great fanfare of dismantling that policy. Western Australian Senator Chris Evans was the immigration minister at the time. I felt pretty cheated by the way he gloated at what he did to a successful policy. I will be reminding my electorate in Western Australia of the role of Senate Evans in this come the next election, because they need to know who was responsible for the dismantling of a successful government policy that saved this country a lot of money and saved a lot of lives.


Senator Evans gloated about dismantling not only the solution but the camps at Manus Island and Nauru. When this new solution was taken on by the Gillard government, they complained that the camp on Nauru had fallen into disrepair and was derelict. They talked in the same manner about Manus Island. The minister at the time, Senator Evans, should be castigated for having bragged about destroying government property or being a barracker for those who destroyed government property.


Eventually the message filtered through to the people smugglers that Australia was open for business again. This government saw a sudden and exponential increase in the numbers of people deciding to take the risky journey to Australia. I speak about this with a little bit of authority, because I have been to Afghanistan and seen the people there who want to come to Australia by any means. I have been to Sri Lanka recently and I met with those detained by the Sri Lankan navy and talked with them about their reasons for coming. And I can tell you, in Sri Lanka, not one person that I spoke to said they were coming here for humanitarian reasons—not one person. They said they were coming here because they knew they could get a good job and there was a lot of money in Australia. When I told them they would not get a visa they said to me, 'It doesn't matter; we'll try, and we'll try again.' Interestingly, the minister, who is at the table, probably does not want to be aware of this, but the money that they get to go home is worth about three years' salary to many Sri Lankans, particularly in the north. It is not much of a deterrent: $16 a week is what the guy serving me in Jaffna told me he earns. So it is not a bad lure to come here and be sent home with your three years' salary.


But let's get back onto this disgraceful backflip, as it has been described by everybody who has been speaking on this bill—even the Greens member, Adam Bandt, from Melbourne. This hypocrisy knows no bounds. At least the member for Melbourne is consistent. I do not agree with the Greens' policies—I think they are pretty whacky and out of touch with the reality of the Australian electorate, who want to see an orderly migration system, not the one that the Greens want where they say, 'We need to better facilitate their entry into Australia.' Unless you vote Greens, you just do not ascribe to that strange logic about getting people here.


I was in the parliament in 2006 when we were vilified, up hill and down dale, by everyone possible in this place, when John Howard wanted to do what this bill wants to do—that is, essentially excise Australia from being a migration zone. We first talked about the islands around Australia. Oh, shock horror! People said it was unconstitutional, it was un-Australian; and now the current government, as we did in 2006, suddenly, because it was recommended by the three members of their advisory panel, have decided to have a go at this. But let us just remember: they vilified us as well about the Pacific solution. They had to contract out their advice, and they got the Houston committee to then tell them, 'Yes, you should try Manus Island and Nauru'—too late; they are coming in their droves. You cannot build a camp big enough to accommodate the thousands of people who are coming per month.


So what has happened? Australia is full. Inverbrackie is full. Curtin is full. Northam is full. Leonora is full. They are opening up the centre at Tasmania. What is the next solution? 'Well, we tried to get people to take them as billets, and we wanted to pay them so much a week'—so all these poor ladies around Australia were happy to try and earn a quid by billeting a few refugees while they waited. That has not worked; it has not really cut through or taken off. So what are we going to do? We are going to let them come here, but, because there are so many of them, they can now get a bridging visa to stay in Australia but they cannot work. As I said, I remember the hypocrisy of what they were saying when we did what we did—and it worked.


It has been said, but I have to remind you: it was not only people like Senator Evans, and, of course, the minister at the table, Minister Bowen, who said that this was a 'dark stain on the character of Australia'—these people are not consistent. As I said, at least the Greens are consistent. We are consistent. The only inconsistent ones in this debate are the Labor Party, because they have had so many incarnations and conversions on the way to the Pacific solution—not on the road to Damascus, I can tell you; it is on the road to Nauru and Manus Island—that no-one believes them anymore. People came up to me when I hosted Tony Abbott in my electorate last week and they were saying to us, 'Are you certain you can stop this situation?' And we said, 'Yes, because we've done it before, and it works.'


I heard the member for Berowra in this place say that, when he brought in these measures, he did not know which would work the best of the suite of three measures, but he said that, when you put them all together, they worked. Unfortunately, this government has only got one real part of that suite, one leg of the three-legged stool—and that is the Pacific solution.


Temporary protection visas, which Tony Abbott wants to move a private members' bill on, will test the government to see if they are real in wanting to give a further deterrent. Because, as we know, and you have to explain to people in the electorate—which I do—temporary protection visas allow people to come here and, while their status is being determined as to whether they are genuine refugees or their countries are safe enough to return to, they can have some work rights.


And I tell you what is cutting through to the electorate also—Tony Abbott's enunciation of the fact that we should be allowing these people to be receiving Work for the Dole type payments, because people do not want those arriving here without a legal reason to do so getting on our welfare system. We know that this measure allows them to earn 89 per cent of Newstart. So there you are: you have people in my electorate who are doing it really hard, and I tell you what makes them really angry—and I would be pleased if the minister at the table would listen to some of these. I have people ringing up my electorate office, or emailing me on a daily basis, who are  trying to get here legitimately. A gentleman from the Boddington Gold Mine emailed me today. He has a good job, he pays a lot of tax—about $40,000 a year—he has married an overseas lady, who is pregnant, and he is having real problems getting her to Australia before the birth of the child. And then they see the fact that, if you turn up by boat, you can come straight in and live in the burbs and probably get a house out of it as well. That is what makes them really cross. The number of migration issues that come through my office from people legitimately trying to come here and bring their families, or to reunite or to bring their skills here—it is disgraceful. And yet they see thousands of people coming—30,000 since the government have been in office; 8,000 since they introduced their version of the Pacific solution. And they try to get one member of their family in. No wonder they are so cross and upset with the way the government are treating our immigration policies.


But going back to all of those who wanted to vilify us on this issue—the minister at the table has probably had his ears belted all day—there were right-wingers like the member for Watson, Tony Burke, saying, 'Australia is better than this bill,' 'The legislation before us today undermines our sovereignty,' 'It is offensive to our decency,' and, 'It makes a mockery of this parliament,' The member for Hotham said, 'Labor opposes it outright,' 'There is nothing you can do to this excision bill that will fix it,' 'We will not seek to amend it; we will oppose it in its entirety,' and, 'This bill is shameful and xenophobic.' What happened six years later? 'We are remade, morphed, reborn; we have a different view—we turned 180 degrees. We don't believe in anything we believed in before.' It is just woeful. Of course, we are not going to oppose the bill, because it is the bill we brought to this parliament six years ago.


I will be interested to see what some of the members of the Labor Party do if this comes to a vote—though it will probably be a mickey because we are supporting it. The member for Fremantle has been very outspoken on what a disgraceful set of measures these are, yet I imagine that, if it does come to a vote, she will vote for these measures. She tried to say before that she did not vote for them because there was a mickey, but she did not cross the floor and join those on the mickey vote. She told the Fremantle Herald, when I wrote to her newspaper, that she supported these measures, after saying she could not, would not and did not vote for them. The only reason she did not vote was that it was a mickey vote. I will be pointing this out in the Fremantle Herald when this vote comes up.


The electorates of other left-wing members of this parliament should know their duplicity on this issue as well. In 2006, the Leader of the House, when the parliament was debating the legislation last time, said:


Today this parliament is debating a bill that reduces us as a parliament and as a nation.


…   …   …


This bill is wrong in principle and it is wrong in motivation.


…   …   …


This bill is a disgraceful shirking of responsibility by Australia and it must be rejected. The Australian Labor Party rejects it.


That is what the member for Grayndler said. What do the people in the electorate think? As I said, there have been quite a few backflips. On Monday, 26 November, under the headline 'Charities will struggle to help refugees', the West Australian reported:


WA charity groups have condemned the Federal Government’s policy to dump thousands of refugees in the suburbs, saying they cannot deal with any extra demand on their already overstretched resources.


We know that the shortage of public housing in Western Australia is 20,000, so how will the demand be met? In that report, Anglicare Western Australia executive Ian Carter said the policy 'lacked foresight'. St Vincent de Paul said it was 'inhumane'. I could go on.


But suddenly there is another little crack in the wall. Today, Michael Gordon in the Sydney Morning Herald reported, under the headline 'Work rules for asylum seekers to be relaxed':


NEW rules denying asylum seekers the right to work for up to five years will be relaxed …


It quotes the minister, Chris Bowen, who, the article said:


… wanted over time to work out how people arriving by boat had 'appropriate support and care, and where appropriate they have some mechanism in place to be able to support themselves'.


That is code for, 'How are they going to get a job?' You are either going to give them a temporary protection visa—a decent, honest visa—or you are going to give them this mickey mouse visa that essentially allows them to cheat. I spoke on the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill yesterday, where the provisions against anyone who allows someone to work illegally are being toughened up. So the poor old employer cops all the hammering and fines and everything if he allows someone to work in this country who is not legally entitled to do so. This is only going to encourage people on the breadline to try to get work in the black economy.


This is a disgraceful exhibition of hypocrisy by the Labor Party. They are not doing it properly. They are not going to solve this problem unless they take a deep breath, realise they made a total mistake in 2007 and adopt the full suite of measures of the Howard government, which worked and stopped this evil trade.

"Thomson, Craig, MP",Ind.,2012-11-27,"



Mr CRAIG THOMSON
 (Dobell) (18:10):  This is not an easy issue for governments to deal with. It is not an easy issue for the community to deal with. It is a difficult question where time changes the way in which solutions should be looked at. There was a time when people would come to a parliament like this and argue that the White Australia policy was right. People changed their minds about that. Old policies were changed and new policies were adopted. So I understand that views that people may have had in the past have changed as circumstances have changed, but I do not agree with these changes. Obviously, while my politics are left of centre, they are not 'in the Left', and the characterisation by the previous speaker of people's views as fitting a particular grouping is simply not true.


My approach to policy has always been that we allow the markets to dictate what happens unless there is market failure. Can there have been a greater market failure than what has occurred with close to 40 million people seeking asylum around the world and not having a permanent place to live? There simply cannot be a greater issue that requires governments to act against the way in which society has broken down in some countries and left such large numbers, almost twice the population of Australia, looking for a permanent home because either their existing home is no longer safe or they have been kicked out and are no longer able to stay there. So I do not approach this necessarily with just a bleeding heart; I approach this matter in the same way that I approach every matter, and that is from the point of view of an absolute market failure and the question of how we deal with it. In that context, it is completely understandable that governments may change their minds on issues, but in this case they have done so wrongly.


There were two main reasons that I chose to enter parliament. One was to make sure we got rid of Work Choices and the terrible effects that was having on families, particularly families that commute a lot, as they do on the Central Coast. The second reason was the way in which we treat those people who are less fortunate than us but may not have been born in this country. I was concerned with how we deal with them in a humane way that does not affect the integrity of Australia's borders or make Australia a less secure place. So I am particularly disappointed. I understand the government is searching in a very difficult situation for a solution, but I am very disappointed that they have taken the step of supporting something that they quite rightly rejected in 2006.


Let's be very honest about this. It is just a tricky technical nonsense to actually say that Australia is not part of Australia for the purpose of people seeking asylum. But it is even more tricky than that because it is only not Australia if you have come by boat. And it is even more tricky than that, because if you get on a P&O cruise liner in Fiji and then come to Sydney Harbour and seek asylum, again, you are not affected by this legislation. So the government has picked a particularly inhumane and tricky way of trying to deal with what is a major global problem that requires not short-term political point scoring but long-term solutions that are going to make sure that the people who are in most need are looked after.


I can understand the pressure on the government when you have an opposition that has its head in the sand about these issues and will continually look at pointscoring rather than at positive solutions to this. I listened to the member for Melbourne's contribution and I think the Greens have also failed in this area. They had the opportunity to support the government in talking about regional processing and looking at solutions that go beyond one country. They failed in relation to that and they cannot come in here and say that what they are doing is right. They played the politics of this as well. So we have all parties playing politics with people's lives and ignoring the facts that are there.


Australia is not one of the most generous refugee intake countries in the world—we hear the opposite all the time, but it is simply not true. We are the 14th largest economy yet we accept 0.03 per cent of the world's refugees. I have heard other contributors, including the member for Melbourne, talk about what Australia did in the aftermath of Vietnam. We were accepting about six per cent of world refugees at that time. We are now taking in 0.03 per cent.


One of the other points that has been made—and both parties have made a lot of it—is that stopping the boats will save lives. Well, cutting off someone's last line of escape is no great favour. If you are killed by the Taliban you are just as dead as if you drown. People who are making this very difficult decision about getting on a boat are not doing it for any other reason than that this is their last hope. The argument is often put—and the member for Canning was trying to make this point—that the boat arrivals are not genuine refugees, they are here for economic reasons. That is simply just not true, and it does not hold out in terms of the acceptance of asylum seekers, ultimately, when their claims are processed. If you are looking at where the non-genuine overstayers are then it is clearly plane arrivals. Only between 20 to 40 per cent of plane arrivals who seek asylum in this country are successful. Compare that with the 85 to 90 per cent of people who arrive by boats; clearly, the argument that people are getting on boats to seek some economic advantage just cannot be made out. They are coming because they are desperate, and 85 to 90 per cent of them are successful in having their claims met. They are indeed genuine asylum seekers.


The argument is also put that these people are queue jumpers. Can I say that with close to 40 million seeking asylum in the world it is a terribly long queue. If there were a queue to join, it would take you 135 years to work your way through that queue before you were processed here. So that whole argument is absolute nonsense. It is a cover for people who are racist. That is simply what it is and it has to be said that that is what it is. People who say that there is a queue are actually saying, 'We do not want these people coming here. We do not care about what their circumstances are. We simply do not want them in this country. That is it.' That is a much more honest position to put. We hear, particularly from the coalition, people talking about hypocrisy and so forth. Well, put your argument that you do not want foreigners per se coming to this country, because there is no queue, and if there were one it would take 135 years.


Look at how someone from, say, Afghanistan would seek asylum in Australia. The argument would probably be that they would go to the Australian embassy to seek asylum. But the address of the Australian embassy is, for security reasons, quite clearly and obviously kept secret. So there is nowhere to go in Afghanistan if you want to seek asylum in Australia. It is an absolute nonsense that there is some queue that people can go to and line up in.


These are some of the issues that have been raised as to why we should not be taking people. I actually think that the minister in 2006 made a very good speech, and I know it has been quoted a lot. What he said in 2006 holds just as much now as it did then. He started by saying that in 1951 the United Nations Convention for the Protection of Refugees came into force. The world realised the mistakes of the 1930s, when many western nations turned their backs on Jews fleeing persecution in Germany. Collectively, we said, 'Never again.' I am sure that all of us involved in public life would like to think that we would have done the right thing in those circumstances and stood up for those facing the worst of circumstances, regardless of whether it was popular or unpopular. He went on to talk about the then Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, saying that if it passes parliament 'it will be the day that Australia turned its back on the refugee convention and on refugees escaping circumstances that most of us can only imagine'. He said:


This is a bad bill with no redeeming features. It is a hypocritical and illogical bill. If it is passed today, it will be a stain on our national character. The people who will be disadvantaged by this bill are in fear of their lives, and we should never turn our back on them. They are people who could make a real contribution to Australia.


That was true six years ago and it is equally true now. The government find themselves reacting to the politics and they need to be above that.


I represent the electorate of Dobell. The only time a Labor member lost the seat was in 2001, at the Tampa election. At that particular election there were big posters right around the electorate saying, 'We choose who comes to this country.' We were all saying what a terrible thing that was, yet here we are trying to reproduce almost exactly the same type of legislation—reacting to the same things that happened then. The government are doing it for political reasons. They think that if they are tough in relation to this area they will be rewarded at an election. They are simply ignoring history if they believe that. In 2001 we lost Dobell. We lost some seats even though the approach of the Labor Party at that time was to say: 'We will do everything that Prime Minister John Howard is saying. We support it all. We are not disagreeing with it.' We were trying to make sure there was no difference between us. The Labor Party have clearly not learnt their lesson. They have not learnt their political lesson and they need to get their moral compass back on track in relation to these issues. They did after a period of time in opposition. By 2006, they were fine, looking at these issues in a rational way. They are reacting to very difficult circumstances. They are reacting to a public policy issue that is not easy and does not have a magic bullet solution, but most of all they are reacting to the political bait that is being put by the opposition. It is wrong morally and it is wrong electorally for the Labor Party to go down this path.


I have thought a lot about what I am going to do in this. I will be opposing this legislation. I have thought a lot about it because of the way in which people in my electorate voted in 2001. Do you know what? Sometimes you have to do what is right. Chris Bowen, the minister, as the member for Prospect back in 2006, said, 'You've got to take a decision, even if it will be unpopular, as long as you're sure that it's right.' It is right that this bill is defeated. Australia is Australia. We cannot play tricky word games and try to pretend it is something it is not. We hold ourselves out to be part of the world community. We need to show that we are mature enough to take responsibility on a range of these issues and we should reject this bill wholeheartedly.

"Broadbent, Russell, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (18:26):  As a dear friend of mine often says, prefacing remarks in a political conversation: 'To know where we are today, we have to go back to where we began.' We began with the Australian community's outrage over women and children, and thousands of others, detained behind razor wire, languishing on temporary protection visas in a land where the liberty, freedom and the rule of law are a given, and taken for granted. This bill is yet another step to take us back full circle to a place of national shame. It directly offends the tenet, values and arrangements negotiated by me and others which were passed into law by the Howard government in 2004, then tested and reaffirmed under a set of different circumstances in 2006. That agreement went to the heart of protecting the most vulnerable individuals from life behind a razor-wire fence. It went to the heart of how we treat genuine refugees seeking solace within our shores. The wrongs that were righted removed a disgrace. This proposal is a disgrace and it bring disgrace upon us all.


I stand today more in sorrow than in anger. With injustice and indifference at its core, this proposal to excise the Australian mainland from the migration zone resurrects the legislation proposed in 2006 by the then Howard government. I opposed it then; I oppose it now. If this were not of such a serious nature I would have thought it were a joke. This legislation joins Tasmania with Christmas Island, 5,399 kilometres apart! Though we differ, my party has been entirely consistent in support of this policy position under the leadership of John Howard, Brendon Nelson, Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott. In stark contrast, other members of this House called the 2006 genesis of this bill as being immoral and xenophobic. They were right then. This policy reversal is wrong now. Today, these same representatives sit as members of executive government, parroting their predecessor's policy disgrace. That our leadership—and I am talking about both parties—has come to an enabling consensus on this matter is not a display of unity and bipartisanship; rather, it is a retreat from leading the national debate to a higher place for a greater purpose. I said in 2006 that my decision then to oppose similar legislation was made because it was in the national interest of this Great South Land that it continue to be a passionate protector of the rights of genuine refugees. My position is unchanged today for the sake of our national interests both at home and abroad. I oppose this legislation now as I did its predecessor because it is offends the stand—and it seems today that these words were spoken so long ago—I made in 2006, when I said that Australia should remain:


… a place where dreams come true, where the impossible becomes the possible and the probable becomes the inevitable … where people find a sense of belonging … a place of hope for generations of new immigrants.


I stand tonight in a place of discomfort and controversy in a debate that is complicated, divisive and polarising. In this moment I can choose to be either at peace with my party, unified in opposition to this poor excuse for a Labor government or at peace with my heart for this nation. I choose to be at peace with my heart for this nation. I oppose these Labor Party bills and all who join with them in their intent to enact unjust laws which while they are on our statutes will remain a blight on our national integrity.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (18:31):  Today is a rare day for the government. Today this government is doing something which makes sense, which has a chance of working, which might restore some integrity to Australia's borders and which might act as a deterrent to the repugnant trade of people smugglers who traffic in human misery.


The objective of the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 is to expand the existing offshore processing regime to apply to all persons who arrive unlawfully by sea to mainland Australia. You could be forgiven for thinking that the objective of this bill sounds familiar. That would be because it is familiar. This bill is almost a carbon copy of the bill passed by the House of Representatives under the Howard government in 2006 when it expanded offshore processing to apply to people arriving on mainland Australia. How embarrassing it must be for the government to introduce this bill into the House. Maybe the answer to the question of why the government is doing so lies in the difference between what the now Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, is saying now and what he had to say back in 2006 when he, along with his Labor colleagues, opposed the Howard government's introduction of the almost-identical bill. The now minister described that bill then as a 'stain on our national character'. But what is he saying today? Ms Ellis, who is now also a minister, said that the bill was 'ludicrous', 'harsh', 'inhumane' and 'gutless'—and it went on and on. The hypocrisy of the government's U-turn is absolutely breathtaking.


Tragic and unacceptable loss of life and unprecedented budgetary disaster have flowed from Labor's staggeringly incompetent border protection policies. Labor's border protection policies should be likened to an employment program for people smugglers. The Howard government put the people smugglers out of business; Labor resurrected their business. Since November 2007, when Labor announced that it was dismantling the coalition's border protection polices, there have been 30,000 unauthorised maritime arrivals. This is more people than live in cities such as Alice Springs, Warrnambool, Nowra, Albany, Maryborough and Devonport. It is about 1½ times the number of people who live in cities such as Goulburn, Armidale, Whyalla and Mount Isa.


Since November 2007, Labor's failures on our borders have got worse. The government's policies have been half-hearted, and it has made policy switches from one month to the next. The government is not up to the job, and it is not up to the commitments that it has made. More than half the number—that is, 15,403—of the 30,057 unauthorised maritime arrivals under this government have turned up this year, and more than a third—that is, 10,146—have turned up since 1 July. More people have turned up on more boats in 2012 alone than in the entire 11½ years of the Howard government yet Labor still refuses to acknowledge that it got it horribly wrong when it abolished the Howard government's policies, and it continues to get it wrong by refusing to restore them. This is what happens when intractable political incompetence blinds sensible decision making. Sadly, this dynamic occurs all too often in this government.


At the average rate of arrivals over the full term of the Howard Government, it would have taken John Howard more than 25 years as Prime Minister to reach the number of unauthorised maritime arrivals that have occurred under Labor in less than five years. Under the Howard government's policies, it would have taken more than 500 years to reach 30,000 unauthorised maritime arrivals. Labor's record on border protection shows breathtaking incompetence. It reads as follows. Since the last election, Labor's failures on our borders have increased threefold: in Labor's first term there were 7,349 illegal boat arrivals; so far in Labor's second term there have been more than 22,000. The average monthly rate of arrivals over Labor's second term is almost four times higher—and at current levels it is 10 times higher—than it was in Labor's first term. Absolutely tragically, under Labor's policies more than 1,000 people have perished at sea. At least 8,100 people who have been waiting offshore in desperate circumstances have been denied Australia's protection because they did not come on a boat.


I heard the member for Dobell expressing an interesting slant on border protection policy. He said that there is no such thing as people waiting in queues and no such thing as a United Nations humanitarian refugee waiting list. But I have been to refugee camps. I have spoken to people who have been interviewed. I have been to the Thai-Burmese border and seen the 140,000 people there who are waiting offshore and who are applying under the correct processes to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Also, the budget has blown out. It has blown out to $6.6 billion and counting, including $1.7 billion this year.


This Labor government's policy has done incredible damage to Australia's humanitarian and immigration programs. It has been a public policy disaster in humanitarian terms and also in budgetary terms. There is no other way to describe it. This will put an incredible pressure on public housing. There are agencies like the Red Cross and others who are doing an incredible job, but these numbers keep rising. There will be incredible pressures put on state governments in terms of health and education.


This bill will replace the concept of 'offshore entry person' with the concept of 'unauthorised maritime arrival'. It will mean that more persons who arrive on Australian soil by boat will be subject to removal to an offshore processing country and they will be processed according to that country's regime. What this means is that the bill will effectively excise the Australian mainland from the Migration Act, which is intended to be a disincentive for people to make the journey to Australia.


Labor continues to fail to implement the full suite of measures the coalition had in place. Every day, when they say they will bring out a policy, they keep retreating. Today we saw a retreat, again, on work rights. They were not going to introduce work rights; now they are softening on work rights with the temporary protection visa update and changes that they announced a few days ago. This policy keeps evolving and changing; no wonder people smugglers continue to send people here; they have absolutely no surety about what the government is going to say from one policy decision to the next, or what they are going to stick to.


This government has continued to change its policy from day to day. We introduced these measures in 2006. The impact of these measures would have been much more significant if this government had introduced the full suite of measures. This bill is a step in the right direction and the coalition will support it. The challenge for the Labor Party now is to embrace the complete policy and political honesty, adopt the remainder of the coalition's border protection policies and put people smugglers out of business.


But do not hold your breath for that one, Deputy Speaker. That is too much policy logic from Labor, and after five years of policy failure it is probably expecting a bit too much.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (18:40):  Before I speak to the bill I would like to acknowledge in this chamber the very courageous and wise words of the member for McMillan. I feel privileged indeed to count him as a friend and to have him as a colleague in this place.


The Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 gives effect to recommendation 14 of the Houston expert panel, which proposed excising the Australian mainland so that a person arriving by sea, without a visa, cannot apply for a protection or other visa unless the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship determines that it is in the public interest to lift that restriction.


The practice of excising parts of Australian territory started in 2001, and a bill to expand the excision of the Australian mainland was introduced and passed in the House of Representatives in 2006. As my colleague said, he and I and other colleagues, the former member for Cook, who is somewhere in the gallery, and the former member for Kooyong, opposed that bill at that time. But so concerning were the measures outlined in that bill that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, chaired by then government Senator Marise Payne, recommended that 'the bill not proceed'. It was withdrawn when it was clear it would not pass the Senate—not because of the terrible ramifications of that piece of legislation, but because it simply was not going to pass in the Senate, and that would have been an embarrassment to the government.


The report included a number of recommendations to limit the effects of the bill should the government still elect to introduce it. These were fairly extensive but went to transparency, procedural fairness, special consideration for women and children, parliamentary and/or ombudsman scrutiny of operations on Nauru and Manus Island and a sunset period of 18 months for the operation of the legislation.


This bill before the House has the same intent. It effectively warehouses people in a foreign country and continues a pattern of punitive, arbitrary, indefinite, mandatory detention. These are people: men, women and children who have not been convicted of any crime. May I say, that in looking at these issues over a lengthy time line—I think it has been a 10-year period—there has been more than one inquiry a year into the effects of mandatory detention, and all of them have warned government of the dire consequences of this policy. Yet governments of both persuasions have ignored all of those reports—some of them from their own parliamentary committees.


What really concerns me is that this legislation places these people out of reach of the Australian legal system and casts doubts as to whether any review process will ever be available to them. Our democracy is underpinned by the rule of law, which requires, as a minimum, access to judicial review of administrative action, the right to a fair trial, the right to private communication with a lawyer and access to the courts. This bill is a crack in each of those foundation stones of our democracy. That is why people out there ought to be concerned about the passage of such legislation in unseemly haste in this place. We should ask the question: who or what will protect these people from processing errors? Who or what?


In justifying these extreme measures, the expert panel report provided just two paragraphs of reasoning for such a draconian piece of legislation. On the statistics alone, it is difficult to justify the excision of the whole mainland. In the decade since 2001, a total of five boats have managed to get as far as the Australian mainland—and those five boats carried only 86 people. This is not an avalanche, a tsunami or an invasion. It is hardly a number to give rise to the implementation of such an extreme piece of legislation—a piece of legislation which discriminates against an asylum seeker simply on the basis of the mode of travel they used to come to this country.


Yet we continue along this path, with this bill being the final legal brick in the creation of fortress Australia. Let us be clear: Australia has signed the refugee convention, but it seems the government has no intention of meeting its obligations under that agreement. This bill, combined with the recently passed Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Bill, the existing legal framework, the memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru and Papua New Guinea, and the new no-advantage test, completes a cunning suite of legislation and international agreements devised by government to effectively avoid Australia's obligations under the refugee convention.


I read a wonderful article in the Canberra Times this morning. It was by Professor William Maley from ANU and Penelope Mathew and was entitled 'Bowen's asylum line is illegal.' They note:



First, international law is underpinned by the simple but powerful principle of 'pacta sunt servanda', namely that every treaty in force is binding on the parties to it and must be performed by them


in good faith. In the exercise of its sovereign capacity, Australia, when it acceded to the Refugee Convention, made a solemn set of 
commitments to other states. If it were to dishonour those commitments, it could hardly expect to be taken seriously if it then complained when other states chose to dishonour their commitments under a whole range of treaties and conventions from which Australians stand to benefit.


The article was worth reading in its entirety and I had a conversation just this afternoon with William Maley on these issues.


Under this new regime, asylum seekers will, at the very least, spend years languishing in detention in foreign countries even if they have been assessed as a refugee, and they may never be able to successfully apply for asylum in Australia. A dissection of the suite of measures uncovers the devil in the detail. Take, for instance, Nauru. The MOU states that refugees will be processed under Nauruan law. This is confirmed by Australia's Department of Immigration and Citizenship in material given to asylum seekers. But, to apply for an Australian refugee visa under regulation 866.21 of the Australian Migration Act regulations, the applicant must be a person to whom 'Australia has protection obligations under the Refugee Convention.'


This is an incredible sleight of hand. It is difficult to see how any asylum seeker can argue Australia's protection obligations are applicable when they are determined to be a refugee in Nauru, under Nauruan law, which is now a signatory to the refugee convention. When I speak to lawyers, it is clear that they can barely understand the complexities in this suite of legislation. Consider the consequences for just one moment. We have shovelled off these desperate people to a country which simply cannot absorb or resettle them, in the process potentially extinguishing any legal claim they have to resettle in Australia. They will, as a result of the government's deliberate policy choice, languish in detention centres offshore for years at Australian taxpayer expense.


I hear speeches in this place about the huge cost of our asylum program. We could avoid that by treating these people decently, resettling them quickly and processing their claims quickly and efficiently. I will not go into that right now, but there is no justification for the huge expense to Australian taxpayers of this flawed policy. We need to ask ourselves what value we place on the rule of law if we are prepared to extinguish it for a political purpose. There can be no other reason for the sweeping changes in this bill.


Consider, for instance, the fact that, from 1 July 1998 to 27 July 2012, there were 79,498 protection visa applications from people who arrived in Australia by air. This is more than double the total number of people arriving by boat over the same period and it is 924 times more people than have arrived on the Australian mainland. Yet this bill will not affect air arrivals. These people, some of whom arrive in Australia with no intention of returning to their country of origin, will not be removed to an overseas detention facility. They will have access to merits review and will live and work in the community despite the fact that, statistically, only about 20 per cent to 30 per cent of them qualify for refugee status. That compares to 90 per cent of the people who arrive by boat qualify. How can this glaring difference in the way people are treated be justified? Why do we continue to demonise and penalise people who arrive by boat? It is difficult to accept the argument that Australia's approach of stripping away the protections contained in an international convention designed to protect human dignity and respect for human life should have any legal or moral force.


Addressing this issue requires more than tag lines. We must engage in a constructive regional dialogue and must first work to find durable policies in the source countries. We must use diplomacy and work with our neighbours in the region to address the common concerns about refugee flows, not just to resolve the political problems in Australia but to seek cohesive, humane policy for the region. This should include consultation with countries in the region to seek agreement to set up UNHCR approved regional processing centres and it should include a commitment by Australia to lift its refugee intake to a more realistic level. Under this process, people could not pick and choose a country to resettle in but would be allocated, as has been done successfully in the past, during the Indochinese conflict for example. I know that was slightly different, but there is no reason why this cannot be achieved. It is harder, it is slower but it is more sure.


Perhaps also it is time to discuss with the UNHCR the renegotiation of our humanitarian intake so we can relieve some of the pressures in the region, be good neighbours and take the bulk of our humanitarian intake from the immediate region, where the problem currently exists. These are matters worthy of discussion if we really want to stop people losing their lives crossing the ocean between Indonesia and Australia.


It will not be a quick political fix that resolves these matters. Rather, it will be the intelligent, diligent application of diplomatic skills and goodwill, and sensible policy making and sensible legislation. It may take longer but it will be surer and will produce a much improved humanitarian response.


I would like to finish with another quote from the article by Bill Maley and Penelope Mathew. The article begins:


Australia's refugee policy is now in a total mess. Rather than being guided by principles or even a measured pragmatism, it reflects the knee-jerk response of politicians who are desperate to win votes from the least informed parts of the electorate.


Like my colleague the member for McMillan, my heart is heavy when I have to come into this place and once again speak in this way about legislation being considered by this House.


In all conscience I cannot support this piece of legislation.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (18:54):  I acknowledge the contribution of my colleague the member for Pearce. She has been consistent in her views and certainly has cared sufficiently to express them.


Unfortunately the stark reality behind the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill is that the government has lost control of Australia's borders. It is a simple but inescapable conclusion demonstrating a serious policy failure, and after listening to the member for Pearce we can understand just how serious. This action represents the inability of the government to perform even the most fundamental function. A sovereign nation's borders are a part of its very definition. The first way we define a country of the world is to define its borders. This has been the way of human history. Nations have waxed and waned, and that has usually been measured by the expansion and contraction of their borders. Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome are historically defined by the borders they established and defended, and the same applies to civilisations around the world. Wars over borders have been fought throughout history—border issues are probably the cause of more wars than all the other causes combined. Throughout history leaders have been defined by their ability to manage and defend their nation's borders. So, when history reflects on the current government and its ability to manage Australia's borders, it will, unfortunately, only see dreadful, dismal failure.


Worse still, in my view, this has become not only a border protection failure but also a humanitarian, social and economic failure. When Labor came to power in 2008, purely driven by cheap politics it simply dumped a successful border protection policy. We did know that policy was a success—only four people were in the detention system at that time. But rather than build on that success the Labor government abandoned it—for all of the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, this has been done at a cost to the community. As I said, there is a social cost, there is an economic cost and there is a humanitarian cost. There is a border protection cost. It is interesting that the Labor government has come to this, given that it was a Democrat in the United States, John F Kennedy, who said, 'Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country'. That sentiment is important in this debate.


Most Australians are proud of their country and fiercely defensive of our borders. Most Australians do not agree with Labor's approach of abandoning our border protection. They are angry and frustrated. They are angry and frustrated not only because the government has jeopardised Australia's strong border reputation but also because of the financial blow outs that have been revealed. This does cause the social challenges in our community that I have referred to. It does impact on social cohesion, and people do become very concerned about what this approach is costing and who is paying for it. I am frequently asked, as I suspect many members of this House are, particularly in relation to aged care, about what has come out of the ACFI funding model for some of the smaller service providers as opposed to what this policy failure is costing. That is what this type of failure unfortunately causes in the community.


As I said earlier, this was a program that did cost, as we heard earlier, less than $100 million five years ago under the coalition government but it is now costing more than $1 billion under this government. The government said it would spend just $100 million in each of the years of 2010-11 and 2011-12, but they have spent $879 million and $1.2 billion respectively. The government went back to the parliament last year asking for another $295 million to cover the budget blow out, and the year before it needed an extra $120 million.


My constituents have got to the point where they do not believe that the Labor government can stop the boats or fix this mess. They know this is a dreadful policy failure, and I am concerned about its divisive nature in the community. The people do know that the coalition government had to deal with this in the 1990s. There was a dramatic increase in the number of boat people arrivals, from hundreds in 1998 to 1,000 in 1999—a tenfold increase since the early nineties. By 2001, the then coalition government made it clear that Australia needed to protect its borders and that it would take strong action to do so. In 2001, people smugglers made it to Australia 43 times. Thanks to the tough coalition policies of 2002, in 2002 they only made it once. Over the remaining years of the coalition government, 25 boats entered Australia illegally. That is an average of 3½ boats a year from 2002 to 2008.


As I said, there were only four people in the immigration detention system when Labor achieved government in 2007. But, in 2008, the Labor government cast aside that policy and basically threw open Australia's borders. In 2009, people smugglers reached Australia 61 times. In 2010, they earned their illegal income through 134 successful incursions. This basically put the vile people smugglers back in business, and I just cannot accept that. The floodgates reopened. Unfortunately, since Labor abolished the coalition government's Pacific solution, over 30,000 people have arrived on over 500 boats. When I look at that figure of 30,000-plus people, I see a city the size of Busselton, in my electorate. We also know of the tragedies that came with those boats—dreadful tragedies. At least 1,000 asylum seekers and crew have lost their lives at sea, and not one person to date has been processed offshore. Illegal boat arrivals are now occurring at the highest rate on record. We have gone from an average of three boat arrivals a year in 2002 to the arrival of, on average, 2,000 asylum seekers per month in recent times. It is just appalling, in my view, that people smugglers believe they are in control and in charge—and they are clearly making a fortune.


We need a solution to this problem, because the current approach is haphazard and just a mess, and we as a coalition have solutions to offer. The shadow minister for immigration, the member for Cook, has provided a bill this week that provides such a solution. The process that we are seeing from this government is in constant confusion. The re-establishment of temporary protection visas is an essential plank of a real response to people smuggling, and the member for Cook's bill will provide real action. Temporary protection visas were a vital and effective tool in ending the trade in human misery that is people smuggling.


The government of course has used a spurious argument in defence of its refusal of this effective tool. According to the Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers released in August this year:


TPV grants from inception to abolition (1999-2007) was 11,206.86. Of the 11,206 people granted a TPV, 9,043 were irregular maritime arrivals. Of this number 8,600 (95 per cent) were eventually granted a permanent visa in Australia.


The Labor argument is that this somehow demonstrates that TPVs were ineffective. The reality is vastly different. TPVs did not prevent genuine asylum seekers coming to Australia, most of whom gained residency; but they did provide a real disincentive for those who were not genuine refugees.


The member for Berowra eloquently talked about the refugees waiting in camps who cannot afford to pay people smugglers exorbitant amounts of money, such as $10,000 or more. It is appalling that these TPV holders were able to gain priority over those who are in camps around the world and who have been denied access to Australia because we have people smugglers plying their vile trade and people who can afford to pay them. I do not support that at all. We need policies that address this but, with this government, that is exactly what we do not have. The Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers does not identify temporary protection visas as a failure, and the government should stop misleading the community in this way.


Of course, I understand why the government remain opposed to real solutions: they would have to acknowledge the successful policies of the coalition government. Most Australians understand that strong leadership involves acknowledging your mistakes and correcting them, but this government is not capable of that. Instead, the Labor government have brought another bandaid bill into this House to try and patch up what is a dreadfully failed policy—there is no doubt; we cannot cope with the 2,000 arrivals per month—and people simply do not trust them to get it right. How can you trust a government that cannot protect its borders, that cannot get border protection right? It is a fundamental responsibility of government.


To go back to where I started, there is no doubt that this is not only a border protection failure; it is also a humanitarian failure, a social failure and an economic failure of core government responsibility and core government policy.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (19:06):  I rise to foreshadow an amendment I will be moving to the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012 which would put into law the Bali process. I know I have been banging on about this all year, but I know it has the support of both major political parties in this chamber and, I would hope, the support of the vast majority of all members here.


The amendment will require an annual report from the minister, whoever that may be, on the Bali process and the work of government in the implementation of the Bali process, to be made to this House. It is good work that is being done, across party lines, offshore, that was started in 2002 by Alexander Downer and is continued under the current government, and, I understand, represented in the process by the minister at the table tonight, Minister Bowen.


The Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime is co-chaired by the governments of Indonesia and Australia. It brings together participants to work on very practical measures to help combat people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related transnational crimes throughout our Asia-Pacific region. It is the best we have in regard to the issues associated with slowing the movement of people within our region and trying to deal with issues of criminality associated with people-smuggling and trafficking. It is the mid- to long-term solution that so many people are looking for as the circuit-breaker to much of the short-term language that we hear dominating this debate in Australia today.


Even Paris Aristotle today in the Sydney Morning Herald again made the compelling case that only a mid-term, comprehensive, regional response will address the issues before the House. Speaking with reference to The Report of the Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers, of which he was a member, Mr Aristotle said:


The panel presented an integrated package of 22 recommendations knowing it would take time to implement them … The report’s most important components were measures to establish an effective regional processing and protection framework that would build a safer system.


…      …   …


None of the measures are quick fixes, nor can they work on their own. The howls for immediate success and claims that it must have failed even though it has not been fully implemented are examples of the shrillness characterising this debate.


So that is one of the expert panel members in today's media in an opinion piece reflecting not so much on this legislation but on the ongoing debate that has gone off the rails in Australia today, and on the false expectations that are put to the Australian people from short-termism.


None of the issues in question and at stake that challenge public policy in this area will be nor can be fixed by short-term solutions. They need mid- to long-term solutions and they do require Australia to work with our near neighbours. If we try to go it alone in any particular policy way we will fail, and that is regardless of who is the minister of the day, and regardless of the government of the day, and regardless of which political parties are involved. Unless we work with our near neighbours in a coordinated way, as part of a regional process, we will fail. The recommendations that were made by the expert panel highlight that, and, again, people like Paris Aristotle have been highlighting that today. It is the reference point, the safe port, in all of this for public policy in regard to the Bali process, which is the bipartisan piece of work in all of this, and is something that I hope we can get codified into Australian law today.


So, like the expert panel, I am certain that regional cooperation and bilateral agreements will be central to the successful implementation of the recommendations of what is now known as the Houston report, and it is essential for the successful establishment of things such as offshore assessment and to protect against loss of life at sea. The movement of refugees in the Asia-Pacific region is not an issue that Australia can deal with in isolation in the absence of cooperation with other countries in our region. While Australia can establish regional processing arrangements in the short term, Australia's domestic policies alone will not easily deter those refugees who are desperately seeking protection from persecution.


The irregular movement of people affects many countries in our region, as much as if not more than it affects Australia. By and large, those who seek refuge in Australia have transited through the territory of one of Australia's neighbours before they arrive here. Movements into other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, on raw figures alone, are higher than movements into Australia. It is a myth that has made its way into the Australian community that it is any other way. Without a doubt, many of our Asia-Pacific neighbours are more challenged by more movements of asylum seekers than we in Australia are, largely because we are surrounded by water. That alone significantly slows the movement of people to Australia.


Therefore, we need to work with our near neighbours, not only on issues of people seeking asylum but also on issues that are equally challenging, if not more challenging, and which should challenge us as they should and do challenge our neighbours: issues of criminality associated with smuggling, and—for me, the most insidious of all crimes—the crime of trafficking in persons, a crime to which, in my view, Australia does not give the priority attention that it deserves as an issue of great prevalence throughout the Asia-Pacific region. As I say, in my view, if we are going to have a hierarchy of crimes then that is the worst one of all.


The countries of the Asia-Pacific region therefore share a substantial common interest in forming long-term strategies to regulate the movement of people. Indeed, this shared concern has already given rise to multilateral cooperation. As stated before, the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime provides the best regional mechanism through which Australia can encourage and cooperate with other countries in our region on matters relating to irregular migration and related issues.


The Bali process is particularly relevant in the context of this bill. It is committed to assisting other countries adopt best practices in asylum management in line with the principles of the refugee convention. Whilst there are countries involved in the Bali process that are not signatories to the refugee convention, this is our best chance as a region to put together a framework. Certainly Australia's obligations as a signatory would not allow us to act in a way that is in breach of our obligations under the refugee convention. Therefore, that is the standard that is set for the Bali process and the principles behind it.


Australia's ultimate long-term goal relating to refugees is to see the countries of the Asia-Pacific region treat all refugees in a way that is consistent with the principles of the refugee convention through this Bali process. Only through encouraging our neighbours to protect people from persecution can Australia truly discourage people from making dangerous boat journeys to Australia. That is done in a spirit of cooperation, not in a spirit of paternalism. This is an exercise in trying to work together on the full range of issues that challenge us all.


Mindful of this long-term imperative of the refugee issue, this House must acknowledge the central role of regional cooperation and the Bali process in informing sustainable and effective policies in this area. It is, therefore, my view—and, I hope, the House's view—that it is appropriate that we insert into this legislation the idea of having 12-monthly reports on the Bali process to the House. Certainly I hope it is an amendment that is considered in its spirit by all.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (19:16):  I thank members for their contributions to the second reading debate on the Migration Amendment (Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This bill amends the Migration Act 1958 in accordance with recommendation 14 of the report of the expert panel on asylum seekers which stated that arrival anywhere in Australia by irregular maritime means should provide individuals with the same status. That is, irregular arrival by sea anywhere in Australia should make a person liable to regional processing arrangements. At the forefront of the panel's reasoning in making this recommendation was the need to reduce any incentive for people to take even greater risks with their lives—such as staying longer on a boat to avoid Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef or some other excised place—in seeking to reach the Australian mainland and avoid being subject to regional processing arrangements.


As the panel emphasised, and as the government has acknowledged, the recommendations in this report are an integrated package. We have not accepted or rejected each recommendation; we accepted them all as a whole. Therefore, we are moving to implement every single recommendation. This is something that I have freely acknowledged many times publicly and it is indicative of the fact that we are the only party—not those opposite and not the Greens party—implementing all the recommendations of the expert panel's report.


Yes, this bill is directed squarely at boat arrivals, but so is the expert panel's report. As members would recall from the emotional but ultimately fruitless parliamentary debate of some months ago, the expert panel was prompted by people getting on boats and dying at sea. Hence the government implemented this as a circuit-breaker to get a breakthrough. We got the recommendations and we have been implementing them. Those arriving by plane are not the ones dying en route to Australia and are not the focus of this bill. Those arriving by plane are not risking their lives to get here. The very clear and universally agreed aim of the policy changes underlined by the expert panel's recommendations is the need to remove the incentive for people to take the dangerous journey by boat.


Clearly the expert panel makes a very strong recommendation for this bill, as I say, in order to remove what could be a perverse incentive to stay longer on boats. This bill is not about excising the Australian mainland from the migration zone. The definition of the migration zone is not being amended in this bill. Rather, a person will be subject to regional processing based on their status as an unauthorised maritime arrival—that is, by arriving in Australia, in the migration zone, by sea without a valid visa. This is in contrast to the current situation where an individual is only subject to regional processing if they enter Australia at an excised offshore place such as Christmas Island.


I have freely admitted and acknowledged that people will very obviously take a range of views on this issue—about this issue in particular and about the general issue more broadly. As I have said in other places, if after deeply considering all the issues people reach a different position and their moral compass points a different way, I will acknowledge and respect it. But people who argue entirely for onshore processing must acknowledge that that will continue to provide an incentive to come to Australia by boat. Without taking difficult decisions such as this, it would mean, inevitably, more deaths at sea. That is the simple fact.


I want to deal with the contribution of the member for Melbourne. In his speech he said that this government has not implemented extra pathways to Australia. He said, 'If only this government would implement some way for people to get to Australia more safely, if only this government would provide more places for those people in Indonesia, that would be the right thing to do.' The member for Melbourne seems unaware that we are doing exactly that. The member for Melbourne seems unaware or chooses to ignore the fact that this government has increased the humanitarian program to 20,000 places—the biggest increase in the humanitarian program in 30 years. As has been noted publicly this week, that is not a universal position across this chamber anymore. It was for a little while. It is not anymore. This government is committed to increasing the humanitarian program. In fact, we have done so. More visas have been issued offshore as a result of the increase to the humanitarian program.


What we will not do is focus that increase in the program entirely and exclusively on Indonesia. That would be to say that Australia's entire humanitarian program should be focused on those who can at least get to Indonesia, if not to Australia, because they can afford a people smuggler to get them to Indonesia or can get to Indonesia under their own steam. Our humanitarian program is about much more than that. It is about providing those alternative pathways, but it is also about providing hope to people who could not possibly afford a people smuggler—people in camps in Africa, people in camps in the Middle East, people in camps in Thailand and elsewhere in Asia—and other people who cannot make it to Indonesia. The Greens take a short-sighted approach that says, 'We're focused on Indonesia.' That is ignoring our moral responsibility to those in different parts of the world who deserve at least the chance of resettlement in Australia. So I completely reject the assertions of the honourable member for Melbourne, who just wilfully ignores the fact that this government has increased the humanitarian program to 20,000 places—yes, at some substantial cost to the budget because of the substantial resettlement support that we provide. The member for Melbourne seems to have not noticed this in the public debate in recent weeks, as the Greens regularly ignore things which are inconvenient to their argument. I suggest perhaps they are not alone there in this House occasionally.


The government continues to implement the panel recommendations and more. Today we saw another transfer of people back to Sri Lanka, people who are not exercising Australia's international obligations. We are swiftly returning them to Sri Lanka. So people who are coming to Australia for economic reasons are clearly being dealt with by our law and being returned to Sri Lanka—something that the Howard government was never able to achieve. Swift returns to Sri Lanka, in some cases within days of arrival, are being done by this government, because we have seen an increase in people arriving in Australia from Sri Lanka and a lot of this is clearly for economic purposes. But what we will not do is ignore our obligations under the refugee convention. We will at least hear the reasons for people's travel to Australia.


I know the opposition would turn boats around on the high seas—in my view, a breach of the refugee convention. We will not do that. But what we are doing is safely returning people to Sri Lanka. We are not conducting difficult and unsafe operations on the high seas but safely returning people by aeroplane to Sri Lanka. We have returned a very considerable number of people in recent weeks and we will continue to do so. We have also seen some voluntary returns, to Sri Lanka in particular but other nations as well—Iran in particular. But Sri Lanka is the nation which has received the most voluntary returns. Since 30 August more than 600 Sri Lankans have returned home, which I think underlines the point that people smugglers are selling false promises about what awaits people in Australia. They are selling the false promise of a fast track to a visa and what we are very clearly doing is giving the lie to that promise, taking action which is swift and which clearly shows the message. 


The Australian government's policy is clear. We want to resettle more refugees in Australia. We want to give more people the chance of life in Australia. We want to see 20,000 refugees resettled in Australia every year, which would make us the largest resettlement country in the world per capita and the second largest in absolute terms for UNHCR referred refugees. Certainly on some of the measures we are very close to Canada in terms of resettlement. It is this side of the House which is doing that. It is this side of the House which is committed to doing that. It is only this side of the House which is committed to giving more people the chance of life in Australia while also taking the difficult decisions to dissuade people from risking their lives to get to Australia by sea. It is very easy to say that that is not necessary. It is the government which has a responsibility to do so and we will continue to do so.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Health) (19:28):  I thank members for their contributions to the debate on this bill. The bill makes minor amendments to the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 to correct referencing inconsistencies and improve the readability of the act. The bill also amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to specialist trainees. It is the government's policy to increase access to high-quality clinical training capacity for all medical professionals by working closely with states and territories, funding additional training capacity and facilitating innovative and flexible training models. The proposed legislation takes an innovative training arrangement that has been available to trainee specialists from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and expands it so that trainee specialists from all recognised medical colleges have access. The legislation permits a trainee specialist from any recognised medical college to conduct a procedure under the direct supervision of a specialist in a private setting and have that service attract a Medicare rebate for the supervising surgeon. The procedure will be considered to have been performed by the supervising surgeon, who will retain the right to any bulk-billed Medicare benefits in relation to the procedure. This further expands the country's training capacity for specialists, at a time when clinical training capacity for all health professionals in our health system is under significant stress, and it does so with no additional cost to the government.


The bill will make changes to section 41C of the Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973, the Medicare act, and these are being progressed to ensure that Medicare Locals and other bodies seeking to use the term 'Medicare' are able to apply for an authorisation to use the term without breaching the Medicare act. Medicare Locals will help to drive improvements in Australia's primary healthcare system. Medicare Locals have been established through a staged implementation process, with all Medicare Locals now having commenced operations, the final ones by 1 July 2012. The government is aware that there are a range of views about the use of the name 'Medicare Local', and I want to thank the member for Lyne for his thoughtful contribution in that regard. I am pleased to advise the House that a national evaluation of Medicare Locals, already planned to start early next year, will consider the degree to which the name 'Medicare Local' is suitable for its purpose. Provisions will be made for the evaluator to specifically look at community acceptance of the name.


Finally, the bill will make changes to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989. The objective of the minor technical amendments to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act is to correct an inaccurate description of how chemicals are kept under control of Customs during transshipment. The proposed amendment allows industry to utilise more short-term storage options, while maintaining health and safety. It does not place any restriction on competition and does not place any additional requirements on business. I would like to acknowledge the support of stakeholders for the proposed amendment. 


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (19:33):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) to (3), as circulated, together:


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 4), omit “items 20 to 23”, substitute “item 23”.


(2) Schedule 1, page 5 (line 14), omit the heading.


(3) Schedule 1, items 20 to 22, page 5 (line 15) to page 6 (line 26), omit the items.


These amendments will ensure the name 'Medicare' is protected into the future. This bill seeks to correct another botched implementation by Labor. They created primary healthcare organisations operating under the name 'Medicare Locals', a name which is technically unlawful under Commonwealth legislation. Nothing could better highlight this government's incompetence. Nothing could better highlight the fact that this government was merely after a headline as opposed to a health outcome. Nothing could better highlight the fact that this government has stumbled from one disaster to the next when it comes to the health portfolio. What competent government could enlist the assistance of primary healthcare organisations and insist on them being called Medicare Locals, bearing in mind that the government, in their Medicare Locals, do not provide any Medicare assistance? You cannot go into a Medicare Local office to have your Medicare claim processed. You cannot go into a Medicare Local office to see a doctor or a nurse or to seek medical advice or attention. You cannot go into a Medicare Local office and ask for advice in relation to Medicare matters. Medicare Locals have nothing to do with Medicare whatsoever. Why did this government decide to call them Medicare Locals? Because it thought it could fool the Australian people into believing that somehow this was a network of retail services, which of course it is not. That this government, in the height of its incompetence, would allow the use of the word 'Medicare' in the title of these primary healthcare organisations, knowing that it contravenes federal legislation, just speaks to the absolute continuing incompetence of the Gillard government.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (19:35):  I want to speak in support of the amendments that have been moved by the member for Dickson, the shadow minister for health. Going back to the summing-up that the Minister for Health just made: I was a bit disturbed to learn that the government are already thinking about changing the name of Medicare Locals.




Ms Plibersek:
  Oh! Why are you moving an amendment?




Dr SOUTHCOTT:
  Minister, could you just listen for a second, because we listened to you. I would like the House to hear from the minister how much the government has spent on developing the Medicare Local brand and the logos, only to look at a change for this. I would like to hear from the minister at what point she was aware that the use of the name 'Medicare Locals' was in breach of Commonwealth legislation. I think the former Prime Minister and the former minister of health had a sort of light bulb moment when a recommendation came out of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission to have primary healthcare organisations and some bright spark said, 'Why don't we call them Medicare Locals?'


The House really needs to hear from the minister at what point they were advised that there was a problem with the use of the name Medicare Locals—namely, that using the name Medicare Locals was illegal, was in breach of Commonwealth legislation—because this policy was announced in April 2010. The first Medicare Local was established on 1 July last year, so we need to hear from the minister: when did she or the previous minister become aware that there was a problem with using 'Medicare' in the name of Medicare Locals?

Mr CRAIG THOMSON (

Dobell
) (
21:24
):  Madam Deputy Speaker O'Neill, you and I both come from a region where we have a lot of clubs that do a great deal for the community. In fact, there are about 300,000 people who live on the Central Coast and there are about 340,000 people who are members of clubs in the region. So, obviously, there are quite a few of us who are members of more than one club. That shows that on the Central Coast we have the highest per capita membership of clubs in Australia. Clubs are part of our community. They play a role in sport, in education and in helping out in the community, and they have done so for some time. Unfortunately, they also facilitate and, to a great extent, rely on gambling.


The difficult issue that we have before this parliament is how we deal with the people who find it difficult to deal with their addiction to gambling. Over the last couple of years, there has been a great deal of debate in this parliament about what is appropriate, how we should be dealing with it and what measures need to be adopted. In terms of the contributions so far, and I imagine as they continue, there is some right on both sides about this. I agree with some of the coalition members that this is an issue that should be correctly dealt with by state governments, and that is where this naturally falls. But that in itself does not mean that we should not do anything, and there are competing things that need to be done.


My personal view is that we need to be looking at what measures we can take so that clubs and hotels that rely on gambling for their revenue have the time and opportunity to change their business models. It is going to take some time for them to move away from that. Ideally, the best way to do that would be to start reducing the number of poker machines, which is something that is entirely within the purview of state governments. We do not have the power in this parliament to deal with those matters. So, we have to look at how we do deal with this issue and how we deal with people who have a gambling problem.


This legislation looks at voluntary precommitment by people who identify themselves as having a gambling problem. There are clearly some issues with that, and the most obvious one is—at what stage will someone decide that their problem is serious enough that they will put themselves forward and voluntarily admit that they have a gambling problem. The experience of the industry and people I know personally is that, unfortunately, usually by the time they are prepared to voluntarily say that they have a problem, they have already lost the house, they have already displayed the problems of gambling addition to their children, and there is not much left. It is usually when someone has reached rock bottom that they get to the stage of asking for help. We need to look at whether voluntary precommitment is an appropriate measure to deal with these issues.


I was talking to Paul Barnett last week. He is the CEO of the largest club on the Central Coast, the Mingara Recreation Club. They have some 45,000 members and look after over 200 sporting, health and education and welfare groups to whom they contribute over $2 million. While I was quick to praise the work that Mingara does in the community, I also pointed out to Paul that in 10 or 15 years time we cannot have this same conversation about his club doing good work but relying largely on gambling for money; something needs to be done. Mingara is one of those clubs that is prepared to do more than many other institutions that look at gambling. For example, they are already doing an intervention trial at the club with the Salvation Army who are there full-time. It is being monitored and they are seeing how the intervention works. They already have voluntary precommitment on their machines, so they have taken some steps. We then started to talk about some other clubs that have more difficulty, because this is always going to be an issue of weighing up the merits of the potential impact on the club by imposing a form of regulation, as opposed to doing nothing and the cost that that may have for the community. We were able to talk about the Norah Head Bowling Club, which is a small club in my electorate that is having trouble raising the money for resurfacing the bowling green. They have made an application to council for $100,000 which is the cost of that resurfacing. They have estimated that the precommitment technology will cost them five or six times that amount, and they are saying, 'We cannot afford to do our bowling green, which is what we are about; how are we going to be able to do that?' Those are legitimate issues that clubs should be, and are, raising. At the end of the day they have to be balanced against the alternative of, 'Is there a greater good in making sure that there is some intervention there?'


For those reasons I was looking at moving amendments in relation to the timing of these issues. I understand that the member for New England, who is in the chamber, is going to move such an amendment and it is an amendment that I would support in that it gives a little extra time to make sure that these clubs can balance their expenditure and the costs of bringing this in, and that they are prepared to do that. That is an amendment that I understand the member for New England will be moving and, if he does, it is one that I will support. 


I also have some concerns in relation to the timelines for the changeover of the technology for the ATMs. I have seen the government's amendments in relation to that and they certainly meet the concerns I have. They are looking at a one-year period of that coming in as well.


Another concern that I was looking at moving an amendment to involved the cap on the supervisory levy. I am happy to see that the government will be moving amendments in relation to that as well. They are sensible amendments. It is important that the cap be part of the legislation and shown as that, rather than purely being left for the regulations. That is a good move and it is something that I will support.


These are difficult issues to balance. We all have stories and know about the dangers, the costs and the way in which gambling can rip families and communities apart. The choice that we have in this legislation, particularly in this parliament, is whether we are ever going to be able to get something through that does something to set us on a path for making sure that there is some assistance for this, or whether we are going to continue to argue, disagree, try to make this a political issue of pointscoring and make it an issue that is beyond resolution. I hold the view that we are better to get something, which is why the amendments that I have indicated that the member for New England is going to be putting and the government is going to be putting are amendments that I will be supporting. If I had been able to get support there were more amendments that I think should have been put but, quite simply, I cannot get that support from the crossbenchers or either of the major parties.


We are left with some legislation that is designed to help and assist people who have such a serious problem that governments should intervene to be part of that solution. At the end of having a long think about how and what I should do about this I decided that every member should say that the conclusion that they can reach is that we are better off doing a small amount of good, even if it is not ideal, than to leave this totally alone. I imagine that there are many members like my crossbench colleague in front of me, who would much prefer that a very different approach had been taken. I think we owe it to the Australian community to say that we are putting down a marker here. We are making some changes. They are important changes and they indicate that there is something that this parliament is prepared to do to assist problem gamblers.


For those reasons I will be supporting the amendments to be moved by the member for New England and the amendments that the government has. If I had been able to get more support there would be other amendments. In the absence of that, I will be supporting the legislation, hopefully, as amended by the very sensible amendments that have been put forward so far.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (16:01):  I would like to acknowledge the outstanding achievements of the Gold Coast Master Rowers at the recent Pan Pacific Masters Games rowing regatta that was held on 3 and 4 November on the Gold Coast. They achieved an outstanding result, leaving the event with 40 medals—which was more than any other club participating at the games. The club actually finished the regatta with a final medal tally of 14 gold, 15 silver and 11 bronze medals, and there was only one other team that managed to leave the regatta with more gold medals. It was a fantastic achievement and each of the rowers from the club who took part in that event should be proud of their results. I know that I certainly am proud on their behalf.


Originally founded in 2004, the Gold Coast Master Rowers Club has been based at the Varsity Lakes Sports House for over three years and has more than 40 registered members from a variety of age groups, although many of the active rowers are over 40 years old. The club actively supports and promotes rowing as a sport and supports the rowing activities of students from nearby Varsity College as well as community members who want to keep fit and healthy or want to develop their rowing skills for competition. I was fortunate last year to have attended the opening of the club's new boatshed, and it is wonderful to see the club's members excelling in the face of fierce competition. The boatshed is actually located adjacent to the water, as you would imagine, behind the Varsity Lakes Sports House, which was recently established and is doing a great job fostering sports activities and developing those in the local area.


Dale Salmon, who is the sports and recreation coordinator of Varsity Lakes Community Ltd is actually part of the McPherson Local Sporting Champions Committee, along with Ron Workman OAM, the chairman of Currumbin RSL, Dr Danny O'Brien, from Gold Coast Surf City Inc., and Alf Duval, who is a former Olympic rower. We met recently to discuss nominations for scholarships and we decided that the most worthwhile recipients this time were Ellie Pobar for soccer; Jade Horcicka for soccer; Jack Hulyer for golf; Ellie Papalexiou for soccer; Rebecca Kay for golf; Alexander Crnokrak for tennis; Simioluwa Thomsen-Ajayi for track and field events; Cory Beaman for track and field; Dextar Muskens for surf riding; Krystle McKenzie for basketball; and Joanne Parker, representing the Gold Coast under 16 girls Waves basketball team. The under-16 girls Waves Gold Coast team won the team award for this most recent round of scholarships. I congratulate all the recipients.

Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (16:31):  It is my pleasure to sum up this debate and to thank all honourable members for their contribution. However, I do have to correct a number of falsehoods and fallacies peddled by the honourable members who spoke opposite. Despite the contribution of several of their speakers, this bill does not, as those opposite would have you believe, create a new requirement on business, create any further obligations on business or create any red tape for business that does not currently already exist. What this bill does do is amend the Migration Act to create a graduated series of tiers for infringement notices, non-fault civil penalty provisions and non-aggravated and aggravated criminal offences—the employer sanctions provisions. This is all about providing the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with the necessary tools to make sure that people who are working illegally and employers who are hiring illegally can be dealt with under the law.


This set of measures was recommended to the Howard government many years ago, and it was rejected by the Howard government. This government commissioned Mr Stephen Howells to review the act, and he made a series of recommendations which this bill reflects. The Howells review is a very good one, and although the bill is about to pass I would nevertheless recommend it to those honourable members who have not read it—which I suspect is most honourable members opposite, because if they had read it then they would not have made the silly contributions that they made in this debate. The Howells review goes through the very serious issues of illegal work in Australia. It goes through some of the links to organised crime. It goes through some of the exploitation and underpayment of workers that occurs. Illegal work in Australia is a serious issue. It is very true that it is a very small minority of employees and employers who engage in this, but nevertheless it is serious.


This is an opposition which talks tough when it comes to so-called illegal immigration and which goes out there and beats its chest when it suits it about certain forms of migration, but where you have frankly much larger numbers of employees working illegally, whether they be visa overstayers or people working in breach of visa conditions, the opposition is struck dumb. More than being struck dumb, it wilfully opposes this legislation, trying to stop the government and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship having the ability to successfully prosecute employers who wilfully ignore their responsibilities. Checking to see if somebody is a legal worker in Australia is not an onerous responsibility. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship has the VEVO system, which works well and enables employers to check quite easily whether somebody is entitled to work in this country. Yet this opposition stands to oppose a bill which makes hiring illegal workers and exploiting illegal workers more difficult for employers by making it easier to prosecute.


I stress: there is not one extra requirement on employers, not one piece of red tape, not one process that employers have to go through. 'Just follow the law and don't hire people illegally.' That is what the law currently says. That is what the law said yesterday. It is what the law will say tomorrow. It is what the law will say after this bill passes the Senate. Yet, we see this opposition opposing this legislation which is hypocrisy at its worst. They are happy to issue press releases on a daily basis about illegal migration to Australia, but when it actually comes to an opportunity to do something about people working illegally in Australia—illegal migrants who are working in breach of their visa conditions or after their visa has expired—they choose to do nothing. And they choose to do worse than nothing: they choose to oppose the government's bill.


When I first announced this, the shadow immigration minister said, 'The government will have no problems with us on this bill.' Something changed on the way to Parliament House. I am not sure what changed, but what I am sure of is their position is illogical and hypocritical, and it underlines their cheap and opportunistic approach to all these matters and their complete refusal to engage in matters of substance.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (17:57):  I am very pleased to talk about Corporal Daniel Keighran, the third soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross for service in Afghanistan. We know that the Victoria Cross is awarded for conspicuous bravery, some daring or pre-eminent act of valour, self-sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy. In the 2010 battle of Derapet in Uruzgan province—yet another battle where Australian soldiers were significantly outnumbered—we saw Daniel, as part of Delta Company, 6th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, do exactly what the Victoria Cross acknowledges. 


Daniel's story, and the Delta Company story, is in my view quintessentially Australian. It is just a great story. It is one that epitomises the true Anzac spirit—one that, like the Battle of Long Tan, may well be told and retold throughout history. I think that is what it is going to happen with this particular story. Not only is it a true Australian story; it is actually one that deserves by its very nature, by the actions of Daniel and others in Delta Company, to be told again and again—not least because of the courageous actions of Corporal Keighran and his comrades but also because of the inherently Australian circumstances in which Daniel was made aware that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross.


Last year, Daniel had been transferred to the active reserves, who are affectionately known as 'chockos'. He was in a new career and was someone who, to his workmates, seemed to be a quiet, ordinary bloke, working with them 12 hours a day in an underground goldmine in the Kalgoorlie Boulder goldfields of Western Australia. That is where he was. He is someone who, by his own admission, does not like to talk about himself. So no-one knew what Daniel had done. This is the man who is described by his driller workmates at La Mancha's Frog's Leg underground goldmine—and you might recognise this description—as unassuming, an average bloke, laid back, humble, a good bloke and an absolute champion. They are all descriptions that have been made of Daniel. And that is what most of us would think: 'This is a quiet, unassuming, seemingly ordinary man working in an underground mine.' But he has done extraordinary things.


Then at the time he gets a call to a meeting at Kalgoorlie airport during a work break—down the mine and now we are off to the airport. This is where it is such a great Australian story, not only what happened in the battle of Derapet but this. I can only imagine the reaction of the patrons at Angies Bar and Kiosk at the outback airport terminal when Lieutenant General David Morrison delivered the letter on approval by the Queen from Government House to Dan. It is also quintessentially Australian that Daniel's wife Kathryn knew nothing about his actions or his bravery at that time.


Not surprisingly, you might think—and there might be a movie made about this one day, where Kathryn will see what happened at Derapet—Kathryn was not impressed. It reminds me of the movie A Town Like Alice. You remember how that movie started? This I think is the script for another movie. She was not really impressed. You can see the movie starting with Kathryn and Dan going to the airport and then we will see the battle unfolding after that. I should be a movie producer. Kathryn was not really impressed when she first heard exactly what he had done at Derapet. She was not impressed, I suspect, with the risks he had taken and probably not impressed that she knew nothing about it. She did not know about his actions or his bravery either. Again typically Australian, when asked how Daniel had taken the fuss and publicity surrounding the Victoria Cross, Kathryn said she expected him to be back behind the wheel of his truck: 'We have to pay the bills.' There are some pretty good Australian comments in that one. I want to read the citation into the record. This is what the Victoria Cross citation says:


FOR the most conspicuous acts of gallantry and extreme devotion to duty in action in circumstances of great peril at Derapet, Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan as part of Mentoring Task Force One on Operation Slipper.


Corporal Daniel Alan Keighran deployed to Afghanistan in February 2010 with the 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment.


On 24 August 2010 he was a member of a partnered fighting patrol with soldiers of the Afghan National Army's 1st Kandak, 4th Brigade, 205th (Hero) Corps which was engaged by a numerically superior and coordinated enemy attack from multiple firing points in three separate locations.


The attack was initiated by a high volume of sustained and accurate machine-gun and small arms fire which pinned down the combined Australian and Afghan patrol and caused a loss of momentum.


In the early stages of the attack, and upon realising that the forward elements of the patrol needed effective fire support, Corporal Keighran and another patrol member moved under sustained and accurate enemy fire to an exposed ridgeline to identify enemy locations and direct the return fire of both Australian and Afghan machine guns.


On reaching this position and with complete disregard for his own wellbeing, Corporal Keighran deliberately drew enemy fire by leaving the limited cover he had and moved over the ridgeline in order to positively identify targets for the machine gunners of the combined patrol.


After identifying some of the enemy firing positions, Corporal Keighran, under persistent enemy fire, continued to lead and mentor his team and move around the ridge to both direct the fire of the Afghan and Australian machine gunners and to move them to more effective firing positions.


As the intensity of enemy fire grew, Corporal Keighran returned to the crest of the ridgeline to identify targets and adjust the fire of Australian light armoured vehicles.


His actions resulted in the effective suppression of enemy firing points, which assisted in turning the fight in the favour of the combined patrol.


Moving to a new position, Corporal Keighran deliberately and repeatedly again exposed himself to heavy enemy fire to assist in target identification and the marking of the forward line of troops for fire support elements whilst simultaneously engaging the enemy.


Realising that the new position provided a better location for the patrol's joint fire controller, Corporal Keighran moved over 100 metres across exposed parts of the ridgeline, attracting a high volume of accurate enemy fire, to locate and move the fire controller to the new position.


He then rose from cover again to expose his position on four successive occasions, each movement drawing more intense fire than the last, in order to assist in the identification of a further three enemy firing points that were subsequently engaged by fire support elements. During one of these occasions, when his patrol sustained an Australian casualty, Corporal Keighran with complete disregard for his own safety, left his position of cover on the ridgeline to deliberately draw fire away from the team treating the casualty. Corporal Keighran remained exposed and under heavy fire while traversing the ridgeline, in order to direct suppressing fire and then assist in the clearance of the landing zone to enable evacuation of the casualty.


Corporal Keighran's acts of the most conspicuous gallantry to repeatedly expose himself to accurate and intense enemy fire, thereby placing himself in grave danger, ultimately enabled the identification and suppression of enemy firing positions by both Australian and Afghan fire support elements. These deliberate acts of exceptional courage in circumstances of great peril were instrumental in permitting the withdrawal of the combined Australian and Afghan patrol with no further casualties. His valour is in keeping with the finest traditions of the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force.


That description, whilst extensive, explains very graphically exactly what Daniel did. We do know that Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney, who was killed in this battle, was one of Daniel's mates.


Since this event, Daniel has been nicknamed Prince Harry. I suspect it is something to do with the red hair and something to do with the exploits. Having been to Afghanistan and to Uruzgan province, and having seen the conditions that our Defence members work and operate in, and knowing exactly what Daniel did and how he did it, I think he is a very worthy recipient of the Victoria Cross. We measure the value and worth of our Australian Defence Forces not only because of their good work on the ground in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world but because of the fact that when they come home, they act like ordinary blokes. Daniel fit right back into his community and went back to work, with nobody having any idea of what he had gone through. I think that is a measure of the man. I am very proud of what Daniel achieved and the fact that he has been awarded the Victoria Cross.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (18:07):  I want to thank the previous speaker for her contribution and for outlining the heroism and great gallantry of Corporal Daniel Keighran, who was awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia on 1 November this year. I am honoured to say that I was present—it was a great privilege—when he was at the investiture for his VC. We know that he was awarded this distinguished, highest of military honours by demonstrating the most conspicuous gallantry and extreme devotion to duty in 2010 at Derapet in Uruzgan province in Afghanistan. His was an act which demonstrated again the commitment of our men and women deployed overseas as well as here at home.


Corporal Keighran grew up in Nambour in Queensland and enlisted in the Army in December 2000. He completed his initial training at the School of Infantry. He was based in 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, based at Enoggera Barracks in Brisbane. During his military career, Corporal Keighran was deployed to Malaysia, East Timor, Iraq and, most recently, Afghanistan. That was the deployment for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.


He is the 99th Australian to be rewarded the Victoria Cross. It should be noted, importantly, that he is distinguished by the fact that he is the first member of the Royal Australian Regiment to receive this magnificent honour. A member of Delta Company from the 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, Corporal Keighran has continued the proud and distinguished history of those men. Delta Company is most famously remembered for fighting in the Battle of Long Tan during the Vietnam War, so it has a proud record. Having visited Afghanistan on several occasions I, like others, have witnessed the bravery, sacrifice and professionalism that our young sailors, soldiers and air men and women demonstrate on a daily basis. Like many other battalions deployed in Afghanistan the 6th Battalion suffered several casualties, sadly some fatal, during 2010. Despite this they endured and they achieved for us. They demonstrated numerous acts of bravery and enormous devotion to duty.


On 24 August 2010 the valour demonstrated by Corporal Daniel Keighran was so courageous, bold and selfless that his actions earned him Australia's highest military honour. As we know from other contributions on that day Corporal Keighran and his patrol came under fire from a numerically superior enemy in Derapet. Under intense fire, the combined Australian and Afghan patrol was forced into a defensive position causing a loss of momentum and initiative. Corporal Keighran acted decisively and deliberately by repeatedly exposing himself to heavy enemy fire. His actions enabled the remainder of his patrol to regain the tactical initiative and coordinate their collective firepower to force the enemy from the battlefield.


The success of this engagement can be attributed directly to the bravery of Corporal Keighran. A typically humble Australian, a humble country lad, Corporal Keighran chose not to burden his wife, Kathryn, with the story of his actions until the weeks preceding his investiture at Government House. I was talking to the Chief of Army, Lieutenant-General Morrison, who retold his trip to Kalgoorlie when he went there to inform Corporal Keighran that his award had been approved by the Queen. That was when he was forced to tell his wife the story. Explaining this, Daniel said: 'It wasn't that I couldn't talk about it, it's just that what happened over there is for me and for the boys. But she knows now and she wasn't too impressed at first.' Can you imagine why? Aren't those words telling? That demonstrates very clearly one of the key attributes of Australian fighting men and women. They see themselves as part of a team, part of a group, where individuals are not singled out in the way in which we do appropriately single out such brave men and women. Clearly, at that point at least, he did not want to be seen to be doing something different or enormous; he was doing his job with his mates.


This story is not without sorrow because on this dreadful day Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney lost his life in that same battle. I well recall the previous motions of condolence made in reference to the death of Lance Corporal MacKinney in 2010. His death deeply affected and will continue to affect his family, his mates in the Defence Force, the Defence Force generally and the wider community. As his citation describes, Corporal Keighran's bravery significantly contributed to the medical evacuation of his mate Jared to Tarin Kot. From his citation:


Corporal Keighran remained exposed and under heavy fire while traversing the ridgeline, in order to direct suppressing fire and then assist in the clearance of the landing zone to enable the evacuation of the casualty.


The young gentleman here is a man who has been to war. As I have said before in this place, it is relatively easy for us in the serenity of these surrounds to talk about war. The fact is we have not experienced it. To understand precisely what confronted Corporal Keighran in those moments can only be for those who have had that experience. We wonder at their valour, we wonder at their selflessness and we wonder at their bravery and their commitment to one another. As with generations past, the current generation of men and women in the Defence Force are members of an extremely honourable profession. They deserve our adulation for the work they do for us. They serve their nation with distinction and forever place duty ahead of their own personal safety. That is amplified magnificently by the heroism of Corporal Keighran. It is because we have such men and women like Corporal Keighran, prepared to sacrifice so much of themselves, that Australians enjoy the freedoms we have.


It is an unofficial but moving tribute to the importance of the Victoria Cross that all members of the Defence Force salute a Victoria Cross winner, from the Chief of the Defence Force right through to the ranks. Perhaps the most telling moment of the investiture was when the Chief of the Defence Force fronted up to Corporal Keighran; Corporal Keighran stood and the Chief of the Defence Force saluted him. A very moving occasion. I work closely with the Defence Force, and I know the value they place on a salute. To see our foremost military officer, the CDF, offer a salute to a corporal, is a remarkable and moving moment. This mark of respect recognises the extreme courage and valour of those few men who have demonstrated their bravery under the most telling of circumstances and been awarded a Victoria Cross.


It is really difficult for us who have not been there to understand the circumstances that may have confronted this brave man on that day. I see a weapon and I shake. To have one pointed at me and to have a group of people firing at me, to be under heavy fire—I am not sure what I would do. But this man, trained as he was, a competent, confident professional, was able to achieve something magnificent.


Today, on behalf of a grateful nation, I am pleased to join the members of the Australian Defence Force in saluting Australia's latest Victoria Cross winner, Corporal Daniel Keighran.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-11-27,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:17):  I rise tonight to support the speeches given by the member for Lingiari and the member for Forrest. Those two speeches are the only two I have heard on this motion, but I commend both speakers for the way that they have spoken about an Australian hero: Daniel Keighran, our latest VC winner.


I will not go into the detail that both those previous speakers have gone into, but I will add a couple of points. The first is that, to me, what Daniel Keighran showed above all else was true leadership, in that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for his mates. I do not think you can get stronger leadership than that. It was done in a humbling way; it was done in a self-effacing way; it was done in a way where he just did what he thought was right and what he thought any Australian should do in the same circumstances.


What he did was put his life at risk. It is quite clear from the descriptions of the battle that he did that, and he did it on more than one occasion. He also did it to try to save the life of his mate. He was prepared to risk his life, to put his life on the line, to save the life of his mate who lay injured, wounded and dying on the battlefield. That is leadership. Having done all that, there was no skiting, no returning to Australia to be a hero and boasting to his mates, and telling everyone how great he was; it was return to Australia and carry on with his life. As far as he was concerned, what he had done was what anyone else should do in that situation. Whether they would or not is the big question. The reason he has received the VC, I think, is the answer to that question. He showed unique qualities in what he did on that battlefield and he deserves to be recognised and rewarded for that. As the previous speaker mentioned, he deserves to have the head of the Army salute him for what he did that day.


It is extraordinary to look at other VC winners and see what they have done. When I heard of Corporal Keighran's story, it reminded me of the VC winner from my electorate, Ted Kenna, who next year will be commemorated in Hamilton with the unveiling of a statue in his honour. Ted Kenna was awarded the VC and his citation states: 


Near Wewak, New Guinea, when fire from a Japanese bunker was holding up the company's advance, Private Kenna stood up in full view of the enemy less than 50 yards away and engaged the bunker, firing his Bren gun from the hip. The enemy returned the fire and bullets actually passed between Private Kenna's arms and body. He remained completely exposed and went on firing until his magazine was exhausted, when he continued with a rifle. As a result of his gallantry the bunker was taken without further loss.


Once again, we see a VC winner who was prepared to put his life on the line to protect his fellow mates. I cannot wait for the unveiling of the statue for Ted Kenna. I place on record my thanks to the local RSL for pushing ahead with the initiative. I congratulate the state government for putting in a contribution, some $25,000 to help with this statue. I mention in a very non-political way to the member for Lingiari that the local RSL has written to the federal government seeking a contribution. I would like them to give a contribution. I think that this statue and what the VC winner has done deserves the federal government to also play its part. The community is doing the same. The local Rotary club has launched a framed picture of Ted Kenna, which local community members can buy for $500. The community has been doing its bit and purchasing these commemorative photos. It would be fantastic if the federal government could support the community, the local RSL and the state government and make its contribution as well. There is a reason that the federal government should think about that. I would like to leave the chamber with a poem written by Arthur Haskell, in June 2011, called True Valour. It was written for what Ted Kenna did, but it could also have quite easily been written for our latest VC winner, Daniel Keighran.




True Valo

r:



How courageous the man,


Who true valour can find;


Who can cast all the vipers


Of doubt from his mind.


 


To be brave without fear, 


Is a blind contradiction,


For true bravery comes


From subduing affliction.


 


Power to hold tenets true


And o'ercome trepidation,


Is displayed by but few,


Without profound dedication.


 


Ted Kenna the soldier,


Did not seek acclamation,


For courage displayed,


In defence of our nation.


 


So we gather today,


To praise our brave son, 


To give thanks to Ted Kenna,


For all he has done.


And can I add Daniel Keighran and give thanks for all he has done.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:25):  I rise today to express the gratitude of the Ryan electorate to Corporal Daniel Keighran and to congratulate him on receiving the high honour of the Victoria Cross for Australia. While this honour has been bestowed on him for a number of acts of bravery in the Battle of Derapet, there is one act in particular which resonates in the hearts of the residents of Ryan. Many speakers before me have highlighted the details of the battle and Corporal Keighran's bravery, but today I wish to focus on the corporal's efforts to save a soldier from our own Ryan military family: Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney. Corporal Keighran chose to risk his life to draw insurgent fire away from soldiers treating the wounded lance corporal. Although, tragically, Lance Corporal MacKinney did not make it, we are grateful for Corporal Keighran's brave efforts to help his fellow soldier, who was a husband, father, son and brother and a member of the Gallipoli Barracks community.


Since 1856, the Victoria Cross has been awarded to servicemen who have shown gallantry in action, through self-sacrifice and extreme devotion to duty in the face of the enemy. Australia has a deep respect for and pride in the Victoria Cross, with 99 Australian recipients in the award's history. Our Australian War Memorial has 61 of these medals on display, in what is the largest publicly held collection in the world. This award has deep meaning and significance for our nation. It is fitting that Corporal Keighran, who has exemplified the qualities recognised by the Victoria Cross, be the 99th Australian recipient. The corporal follows in the footsteps of a fellow Queenslander, Keith Payne VC, OAM, who is the last living Australia recipient of the original Victoria Cross before the change to the Victoria Cross for Australia in 1991.


With the Gallipoli Barracks in my electorate and also being a military mother, I am proud of the achievements of all of our soldiers who consistently show honour and dedication to the service of our nation. During this parliamentary term, we have mourned the loss of many Australian heroes. Today we are able to celebrate the courage of a young man who fought alongside some of those we have lost and who, despite the grief and trauma of losing his colleagues, was able to persevere with the vital work being done in Afghanistan. Corporal Keighran has continued to serve Australia with pride and dedication. He will remain a strong role model for young Australians. His qualities of comradeship, duty and honour in extraordinary circumstances have been recognised with this prestigious award.


Our mission in Afghanistan has at times been controversial in its purpose and its duration. However, the work of Australian forces is unquestionably of vital importance to ensuring freedom and security for the Afghan people. Corporal Keighran fought for this liberty and peace against the insurgents, and he has made a significant contribution to the Australian mission and to the lives of many people in Afghanistan. It is with great respect and admiration for the acts of bravery of Corporal Keighran in assisting Lance Corporal MacKinney, and for the corporal's contribution to the overall effort in Afghanistan, that I congratulate Corporal Keighran on his high honour.


I am sure that Lance Corporal MacKinney's family—including his wife, Beckie, daughter, Annabell and son, Noah—and the Gallipoli Barracks community are grateful for the efforts of Corporal Keighran. He has shown tremendous strength of character through his unwavering mateship in protecting his fellow Australians and furthering the mission for peace in Afghanistan. The Victoria Cross for Australia, our nation's highest military honour, is well deserved. I congratulate him and I thank him and his family for their sacrifice and service to our nation.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:29):  Australians are justifiably proud of all of our service men and women. We recognise the dangers they face and we admire their commitment, courage under fire, professionalism, skill and capability. We all grieve when we lose one of them. We honour them for their remarkably brave and ongoing efforts in the quest for a better, safer and more peaceful world. In recent months Australians have seen and endured the heartache of what serving our country can bring to those brave men and women. We have had eight Australian soldiers die in Afghanistan in 2012, taking the total to 39 deaths since Operation Slipper began in 2001. However, many, indeed any, brave action comes with the element of risk. On 1 November 2012, Royal Australian Regiment Corporal Daniel Keighran, 29 years of age, received the nation's highest military honour for his actions in repeatedly drawing enemy fire during a 2010 battle in which one of his comrades, one of his mates, one of his friends was killed.


Corporal Daniel Keighran is the third soldier to be awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia and the first member of the Royal Australian Regiment, the first outside of the Special Air Service. According to the citation, the 6RAR soldier exposed himself with complete disregard for his own safety, breaking cover repeatedly to identify enemy locations when his patrol was engaged by numerically superior forces.Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney of 6RAR was shot and, sadly, killed during the battle.


Queensland born Keighran joined the Army in 2000. Prior to Afghanistan, he served in East Timor and Iraq. He was promoted to Lance Corporal in 2005 whilst within Mortar Platoon of the support company 6RAR. He was promoted to Corporal with the same unit in 2009. In 2011, he transferred to the active reserve. A real hero, Corporal Keighran chose not to speak of what happened in respect of his fallen comrade, only telling his wifeKathrynabout the circumstances of the battle 13 days before his award was given. Corporal Keighranput that great Anzac spirit of mateship first—a superb example of the fact that the tradition well and truly endures in a new generation, a generation showing itself to be every bit as brave and every bit as selfless as the long line of khaki who preceded it. 


The Victoria Cross for Australia was inaugurated in 1991. It is the highest Australian award in the Australian system of awards and honours. It was first awarded in January 2009 to Trooper Mark Gregor Donaldson, 40 years after the award to the last Australian recipient of the Imperial Victoria Cross, Warrant Officer Keith Payne in Vietnam in 1969. I had the pleasure of meeting Warrant Officer Payne VC at the unveiling of Wagga Wagga's Korean war monument on 20 February. The first Australian to receive a Victoria Cross was Captain Neville Howse, during the Boer War in 1900.


The people of the Riverina, a region which has a proud military history, know all about the importance of the awarding of a VC. All three arms of the military operate out of Wagga Wagga and the many monuments erected in cities and towns across the region bear remembrance and respect from grateful communities for those who served, and especially those who fell in past conflicts. Among the Riverina's VC recipients is unmistakably Tumut's greatest hero, Private Edward John Francis Ryan, known sentimentally as Jack. His medal is proudly on display where it belongs, in the Australian War Memorial's Hall of Valour, alongside those awarded to other diggers, who by their selfless actions earned an honoured place in history. Jack Ryan earned his VC during an assault on the fabled Hindenburg Line as the 55th Australian Infantry Battalion attacked near Villacourt, France, on 30 September 1918. He had enlisted on 1 December 1915 at Wagga Wagga, and marched out that same day with 87 others, known as Kangaroos, passing through Harefield, Junee, Illabo and on to Sydney, arriving on 7 January. 


That famous march is the subject of considerable discussion now by the Wagga Wagga Anzac Centenary Committee, organised by Petrina Quinn, as to how best to commemorate its impending centenary. The committee has talked about enhancing the inner sanctum of the memorial arch in the aptly named Victory Memorial Gardens as well as a partial re-enactment of that famous march. A replica banner of the original Kangaroos recruitment colours, which was carried all the way on that 1915 march, has been made with the help of the Wagga RSL club and is presently housed at the local RSL sub-branch. It was proudly paraded for the first time at this year's Wagga Wagga Anzac Day march along Baylis Street. Dr Quinn had the honour of meeting Daniel Keighran VC at this month's Remembrance Day commemoration in Martin Place, Sydney, describing him as a 'most modest and unassuming individual'.


Other VC recipients with Riverina links include John William Alexander Jackson, from Gunbar. He was just 19 years of age when he was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1916 for courage under heavy fire while rescuing his comrades near Armentieres in France.


Private Jackson was the youngest Australian to be awarded a Victoria Cross and his was the first VC to be won by an Australian on the Western Front. Other VC recipients with links to the Riverina include Walter Ernest Brown at Villers-Bretonneux, in France, in 1918.


A VC was also won by John Hurst Edmondson from Wagga Wagga, who was awarded his VC posthumously after he died rescuing his officer who was under attack in Tobruk, in Libya, in 1941. There was also Reg Roy Rattey, from Barmedman, whose actions in South Bougainville in 1945 earned him, rightly, the highest honour for valour.


Daniel Keighran joins those celebrated heroes and, although his service is now as a reservist while he works in a Kalgoorlie mine, his military exploits stand as the epitome of heroism. Well done, Corporal Keighran VC. You are indeed a fine example to all who wear the military uniform and to all who enter the Army Recruit Training Centre at Kapooka, near Wagga Wagga, hoping  for a soldier's career. A grateful, proud nation salutes you.

 (
McMahon
—
Minister for Immigration and Citizenship
) (
18:36
):


I wish to add my personal condolences to the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the chamber yesterday on the death of Joe Riordan. Much has been said about Joe Riordan in recent days in this House, in the other house and in other places. It has been said that he was a loyal son of the labour movement. That is true. It has been said that he was a loyal son of the trade union movement. That is true. It has been said that he was a good family man. That is very true. It has been said that he was a good Catholic. I understand that to be true. All these things are true. But what I want to say today is that he also had a first-class intellect. He was a deep thinker, a fine communicator, an adornment to the labour movement and an adornment to this parliament.





He served in the parliament for only three years. He was elected in 1972 and defeated in 1975. In 1975 he served briefly as Minister for Housing and Construction in the Whitlam government. His work for working people, for the Labor Party and for the labour movement would have justified a much longer term in parliament, as would his work for the people of the then seat of Phillip. But it was not to be. The sands of political fortune often do not discriminate against good people and hardworking members of parliament and, when that tide turned against the Labor Party, Joe Riordan's political career came to an end. But his working life certainly did not come to an end and his commitment to Australia did not come to an end.





He went on to serve as head of the New South Wales Department of Industrial Relations, as Senior Deputy President of the Australian Workplace Relations Commission, or the Industrial Relations Commission as it was then known. He served in a number of capacities as chair and deputy chair of government boards and instrumentalities, all of which he put a great effort into and made a great contribution to. He saw none of them as a reward for effort or services rendered; he saw all of them as an opportunity to continue to contribute.





In a previous capacity before entering parliament I had the opportunity to work tangentially with Joe Riordan when he conducted a review of the hire car industry in New South Wales. I actually recommended him to the then government to conduct that review, along with the Hon. Milton Morris, a former Liberal Minister for Transport in  New South Wales, because I knew he would bring rigour, intellect and thought to that process.





I did not know Joe Riordan well but I do know his family well, particularly two of his sons, Peter and Bernie, both of whom I would regard as friends. Joe Riordan instilled in both of 
them the Labor ethos and the commitment and service to the nation as well as of course family values and, I am sure, the faith which is shared in the family.



So I do wish, personally in this chamber, as I have done directly to Bernie, to extend my condolences to his widow, Patricia, and to their children, John, Peter, Michael, Bernie, Kathy and Maureen, who I know would be feeling the loss of their father deeply, feeling the loss of his presence in their family and his ongoing guidance. But they can also justly be proud of his contribution not only to their family but to our nation, a contribution which is not duly recognised by his three years of service, which was actually much deeper and longer lasting than that. Frankly, for many of those people who served in this parliament for a short time of three years, 40 years later it would be unusual for them to be recognised in significant speeches in this House and in the other House, but Joe Riordan's contribution in a short period in this House was enormous. His contribution throughout his life was remarkable. He will be missed but his life will also be celebrated and remembered by many.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-11-27,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (18:41):  We mourn the death, yet celebrate the life of Joseph Martin 'Joe' Riordan, AO. Sydney-born Riordan was educated at Patrician Brothers School and Marist Brothers College. He had a Labor pedigree. He was the nephew of Darby Riordan, the Labor member of the House of Representatives for Kennedy from 1929 to 1936. Joe married Patricia Watkins in 1955, and they had six children. From 1958 to 1972 he was the federal secretary of the Federated Clerks Union, a bastion of anticommunist social democrats. Riordan was elected as the Australian Labor Party member for the federal seat of Phillip at the 1972 election. He was the Minister for Housing and Construction from June 1975 until the dismissal of the Whitlam government.


I spoke this afternoon to the Country Party member for Riverina at that time, John Sullivan, who at age 83 has just been re-elected to the Narrandera Shire Council. John wanted me to record his comments about his former colleague. He said he was old-style Labor. He said he was there on behalf of the people. 'He was a gentleman who always had reasoned debate. He was never vitriolic about anyone or anything.' Mr Sullivan was quite fond of Joe Riordan, as were—as we have heard in many of the eloquent speeches in this place—many of the people who knew him. They may not have served with him, but they certainly knew of him and they knew the great contribution he made to the Commonwealth parliament. They knew of his great contribution to the Australian Labor Party. May Joe Riordan rest in peace.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Mr McCLELLAND
 (Barton) (18:43):  I compliment the speakers to the motion and the member for Riverina. Indeed, Joe Riordan was an old-style Labor representative. But, like so many of his generation, Joe was and remained a true believer, a genuine believer, of the Labor movement and all that it stood for. He was a staunch trade unionist all his life, and he was devoted to the welfare of his fellow Australians. Joe was a legend. He was a remarkable man. His service to Australia and Australians can now be written into Labor's folklore. For his outstanding service to this parliament and Australia he, quite properly, was made an Officer of the Order of Australia. Most appropriately, his AO was given pride of place on his coffin last Friday, and he would have been very proud. No-one could have been more deserving of such an honour than Joe Riordan.


Today I want to speak about Joe, the man who I came to know so well. People before me have already mentioned the tremendous heights he climbed to in his career. Really, that continued until his 82nd year in the service of the people of Australia. Because of time constraints, suffice it for me to say that Joe always remembered his humble beginnings. He never forgot where he came from or who he represented. His enormous achievements are now renowned and we in the labour movement, but most especially his loving wife Pat, his four sons, two daughters and numerous grandchildren, have every reason to be enormously proud of his accomplishments.


Joe left school at 15 years of age and in his lifetime through long experience, hard work and perseverance he graduated with an honours degree from the university of hard knocks. Indeed, may I say, it was touching to see not only every one of his immediate family at our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church at Caringbah last Friday but also the hundreds of others from all walks of life, from former prime ministers Hawke and Keating to an old knockabout from a long way back who Joe had helped in his capacity as a member of parliament to obtain a pension all those years ago. They all came to pay their respects.


I want to speak about Joe as the man I knew. My father, Doug, and Joe were close friends from the 1950s. In the early days of their political lives they did not always agree with each other. They would often sit and discuss various options for the road ahead but they always remained good and loyal friends despite a few areas of disagreement. My dad and mum last visited Joe in Kareena Private Hospital at Caringbah about a fortnight ago. According to them, Joe's short-term memory was poor but his ability to recall longer-term events, they said, was really quite amazing. In talking about the old days, Joe dug out from the back of his mind comments on his old friends like Pat Hills, his predecessor in the seat of Phillip, Joe Fitzgerald, Fred Campbell, Charlie Oliver, Terry Sheahan and also his colleagues from the Whitlam times: Lionel Bowen, Les Johnson, who was also at the funeral, and Bill Morrison and of course not forgetting Gough himself.


Joe rekindled to my mother and father what is now quite a famous story. In the last months of the Whitlam government, Gough went up to Queensland to kick the football off in a game between New South Wales and Queensland—before the formal state of origin clashes. In those dying months it is fair to say that the Whitlam government was not the most popular government in Australia. After Gough kicked the ball off there were resounding boos and cries from the audience. Apparently, on the way back from the stadium, Gough said to Senator Ron McAuliffe, 'Comrade, we will have to look at your endorsement up here. I did not know you were so unpopular.' Joe apparently laughed with great gusto at the tale that he delivered to them. He also talked about the time that Pat and he visited my mother and father when they were residing in England. They were very content that that conversation had brought so much happiness to him.


I am proud to say that one of Joe's sons, Bernie, is one of my closest friends and with our respective families we often meet up and Joe would often attend. He was always very much part of the scene but in any discussion he would never hesitate to communicate his point of view, which was always pretty sound and pretty solid, and you walked away with no misunderstanding of what his point of view was. Terry Sheahan, the former president of the ALP, and Bernie last Friday gave two of the best eulogies I have ever heard and I compliment them on their wonderful tributes to Joe.


The last time I saw Joe was when Bernie was sworn in as a commissioner for Fair Work Australia. I know Joe was tremendously proud of him and indeed of all his children and grandchildren. Joe was also a great friend of my former boss and mentor as a lawyer, Roy Turner, who started up the firm of what became Turner Freeman. In fact they were born and reared not far from each other in Surry Hills. I am proud and privileged to have had both of them involved in my early career as a lawyer. I could not have had two finer mentors than I had in such fine men.


All of us who knew Joe Riordan are going to miss him terribly. People of his strength and quality are hard to find today. As the member for Riverina said, he was genuinely old Labor. His life was one of outstanding service, of devotion to his family and dedication to his fellow human beings. Joe was indeed a deeply religious man. He did not wear that on his sleeve but rather it was self-evident from his character and deeds.


Joe, I know your wife, Pat, and every one of your family loved you. Your friends respected you for your sincerity of purpose, your enormous strength of character and your devotion to your fellow Australians. I thank you for your friendship to me and also for your wise counsel and I thank you for the enormous contribution you have made to Australia. You have indeed served us well.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2012-11-27,"



Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (18:50):  I rise to pay my respects to Joe Riordan. The member for Barton so eloquently spoke and I know how close he was to the family and to Bernie in particular, one of the six children. I first met Joe Riordan in 1971. I had commenced with the Federated Storemen and Packers' Union, as it then was. I was a research officer and Joe was the secretary then of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. He was New South Wales based. He was one of those people who always struck me as being prepared to take on and nurture the younger generation coming on. I was fortunate in my career in the trade union movement that there were many of those mentors and supporters from all around the country. When we look at where the trade union movement went in the eighties and nineties, it was because of the foundation that was laid in the seventies—and Joe Riordan was an essential part of that foundation.


He became secretary of the clerks union in 1970, having been its assistant secretary for a very long period before that. He made sure that the clerks union represented not just its members' interests; he grew the membership base of that union. He was not frightened by the advent of technology. I can remember in the early seventies people not wanting technological change because they thought it would put people out of work. This was a very common strain. But Joe, as the secretary of his union, not only understood the importance of it but also believed it should be accessible to all. He would have applauded, and did applaud, what this government has done with the National Broadband Network, enabling the whole of the country to be better connected and better served as a result.


Joe went into the federal parliament in 1972 with the election of the Whitlam government. There was another overlap because while we lost Joe from the trade union movement he became an essential part of the Whitlam team, and my father was the Treasurer and subsequently Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam government. Interestingly, Sunday is the 40th anniversary of the election of that government and a great milestone, and our caucus talked about that today.


Joe was a product of the Depression. He was a Sydney boy who grew up during that Depression, and that forged—like so many of them—the strong conviction for social justice and lifting people out of poverty, ensuring that those dreadful strains of recession/depression, no jobs and loss of dignity should not be repeated. If you listen to all the speeches that have been made about Joe, this commitment to social justice comes through.


He became the minister for housing. He succeeded Les Johnson. His parliamentary term was all too short: two terms; three years. He lost in the 1975 election. On the day of the Dismissal, when the then Governor-General had dismissed Gough Whitlam, Fraser began a censure motion in the parliament against the government of the day. Immediately the parliament resumed after lunch, my father was on his feet having to defend the government against this censure motion. We—and when I say 'we' I mean the Labor Party, the then government; we still considered it to be the government—turned the censure against Fraser. The government passed a lack of confidence motion against Fraser when the penny dropped as to what the Governor-General had done. Interestingly, Joe Riordan said that when he came into the parliament—he had come in to sign ministerial correspondence—my father was on his feet and someone next to Joe said: 'Don't sign any more of that correspondence. You're sacked.' The commission had been withdrawn; he no longer had the authority. When we talk about pennies dropping, there were lots of them dropping all around the place. I will not go into the history of how all of that could have been avoided and what wrongs were done, except to make the point that it was a traumatic time.


Joe did lose his seat. I think the parliament lost a great contributor—someone whose time was cut all too short. After that election, he went on to head up the New South Wales Department of Industrial Relations. Between 1986 and 1995, he was a senior member of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. These were two areas in which I had a lot to do with him.


There was Joe's time before parliament, his engagement whilst he was in parliament, particularly through my dad, and then his life after parliament in the industrial relations sphere. The whole period from 1983 through to 1996 was spent on the development of the accords. The labour movement was engaged in advancing the social wage, superannuation, minimum wage rates, enterprise bargaining and transfer payments as part of the wages trade-off. There was all of that agenda, and we needed a framework in which to do it. The Industrial Relations Commission was an important part of that framework, and Joe Riordan played an essential role as a senior member of the industrial commission.


Fittingly, his career ended as it started: he held the position of chair of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales. Joe was a person who gave a lifetime of commitment not just to the labour movement but also to the betterment of working Australians. This was a man who was always prepared to engage and who had the passion, the commitment and the conviction. He took the defeats and the successes, but he always moved on.


I pay tribute to his lifetime of service not just to the labour movement but also to the country. I also offer my condolences to Joe's widow, Pat, and his six children—and Bernie is the one of them whom I know best of all. I offer my sincere condolences to them in the knowledge that Joe's was a proud contribution to a nation at a vital time. He went into all of these jobs with the very best of intentions: to serve the public. That was his conviction from his early childhood, and he discharged it with great vigour and with great distinction.
