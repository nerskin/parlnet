"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-03-30,"—My question is to Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. I refer the minister to the words of Dr Ken Henry, the head of the Treasurer's tax task force, in the Senate GST committee. He said:
We have not attempted to develop a model which would be capable of analysing this package, and that is really for the reason I have already indicated. No such model exists anywhere else—nothing that we would say is quite up to the task, given the complexity of the package.
Is the minister aware that such modelling is in fact possible and that even the Prime Minister's preferred modeller, Mr Chris Murphy, has provided information to the tax inquiry, along with Professor Dixon, about shifts in the economy in terms of employment levels, something that Dr Henry denied was possible? Why has Treasury consistently refused to investigate the wider ramifications of this tax package?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Tax Package: Modelling</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,1999-03-30,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, it is a fact that Treasury did not conduct any modelling in terms of this package. Why is the government so reluctant to have the tax package examined properly? Is it because Mr Costello does not want the truth about the GST to get out?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Tax Package: Modelling</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-30,"—I was at that hearing, Senator George Campbell—and I suspect that you were not at that hearing—when evidence was given by Dr Ken Henry. Senators should be aware that Dr Ken Henry was extremely supportive of the package—not surprisingly, given the way the package was constructed. He was subjected to considerable questioning by the Labor Party on this package; the questions were not very good and I think they left the hearings feeling rather bruised, and quite rightly so. We have made it very clear that modelling shows that the tax package—
—What modelling?
—Let me quote the Labor Party's preferred modeller of choice, the so-called Dixon model. Before Professor Dixon accepted the assumptions which were fed in by the Labor Party, before he accepted the assumptions which the non-government 
 members of the committee insisted he feed into his model, even he, the Labor Party modeller of choice, said he believed that it would have a beneficial effect on employment in the economy to the tune of, if I remember correctly, some 30,000 people.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Would senators on my left please cease shouting.
—If we leave the modelling and the evidence from Professor Dixon, Access Economics in their a AEM model forecast report of December 1998 indicated that, as a result of the tax package, there would be an additional 190,000 jobs created in the long term. The research undertaken by the Melbourne Institute shows that the tax changes could increase the number of jobs by 50,000. So there is plenty of evidence on the record. Plenty of evidence has been presented to the Senate committee which shows that the tax package has very beneficial effects on the Australian economy and employment.
It is a great pity that Senator George Campbell did not listen closely to the evidence Dr Henry gave to that committee when he explained the assumptions behind that particular question the senator asked me. The evidence that is on the record, the evidence that has been produced by a wide variety of other models, including evidence presented to the Senate committee by Professor Dixon, shows that this package is very good for jobs. It is very surprising that the Labor Party refuses to support this package. I would have thought that, as a party that holds itself out as the representative of employees—which is of course untrue; it is the representative of trade union bosses and trade union interests—it would have strongly supported this tax package.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Tax Package: Modelling</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-30,"—Again Senator Campbell's question contains a very misleading statement. Senator Campbell meant to say that the employment effects of the tax package were not modelled. I suspect that is what he meant to say. I have pointed out to Senator George Campbell that there is a range of other models around, all of which show that this tax package is very good for the economy and very good for jobs.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Tax Package: Modelling</title>,Questions Without Notice,0,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-30,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Newman), to questions without notice asked today, relating to the proposed new tax system.
I particularly want to concentrate on the answer Senator Newman gave to my question about the concerns of people with disabilities regarding the impact of the GST on their standard of living, their quality of life and the barriers that the GST will erect to their full participation in the community. It was very clear from the minister's answer today that 
 the government has done no modelling and conducted no impact studies on the effect of the GST on the lives of people with disabilities and the organisations that support them.
It was very clear from answers to questions during the committee inquiry process that the Department of Health and Aged Care and the Department of Family and Community Services have done no work to try to influence Treasury's modelling and Treasury's compensation packages for people with disabilities. This means that the government has no idea of the impact of its GST tax package on people with disabilities. We think this is deplorable. We think the government stands condemned for failing to do the work, for failing to take enough interest to work out what the impact will be and to work out whether or not the compensation packages offered in conjunction with the tax package will be sufficient to assist those people through the changed taxation regime.
It is just not good enough for the government to say they do not know. They have an obligation to care, they have an obligation to do the work to ensure that the tax package is fair for those persons. What is clear today from the press release from the Joint Church and Community Services Alliance Group is that they reject the government's often asserted claim that the tax package is fair. It clearly is not fair, and one of the key groups disadvantaged by the tax package is people with disabilities, but of course that also includes pensioners and a whole range of other people on fixed incomes who will be severely disadvantaged by the totality of the tax package.
It is clear that the government have taken the attitude that we will throw everyone into a pot, work out the average and the average will do for all: the average compensation package, the average outcome in terms of housing, the average outcome in terms of cost of living. People are not averages. People do not eat averages. People's lives are different, their experiences are different and their needs are different. One of the key groups that is very different in terms of their needs is people with disabilities, because they have very different needs from others in the community.
One of the things that is clear about people with disabilities is that they have a very different consumption pattern. They are large consumers of services and they need extra services. They need assistance with personal services—and most of those look like they will be GST free. But there is a range of other services which they consume in greater quantities than other people do—things like transportation, home help services, handyman services, home maintenance. All those things that we are able to do ourselves, very often people with disabilities have to employ someone to do. They use services that are largely discretionary for other people.
In introducing a goods and services tax, the government are introducing a tax on services, in most cases, for the first time. People who use a lot of services have a disproportionate impact placed upon them by the imposition of this tax. The services part of the new taxation regime will seriously impact on the quality of life of people with disabilities. In general, these people are doing it tough already—surviving on low incomes and having to overcome huge barriers to their full participation in the community. And we are adding another 10 per cent barrier to their participation in the community, their enjoyment of life and their ability to participate in the things that other people take for granted.
The services that people with disabilities use are widespread and costly, and they spend a disproportionate amount of their income already on services. By taxing services, we increase the cost of that consumption and we increase their inability to fully participate in the community, because the costs of the services they need are increased.
The government have done nothing to appreciate that. They have done nothing to examine the impacts of the GST on the lives of people with disabilities. All the groups have been before the GST Community Affairs Committee making this very case. They have provided the detailed information on consumption patterns, and the government say, `You will all be better off because, on average, it will all be okay.' But, with every average, there has to be someone above the average and someone below the average. And 
 the people below the average are the people with disabilities—the people who will have to consume large amounts of services. They are going to be taxed a disproportionate amount, and there will be a much more adverse effect on their lifestyles as a result of the government's taxation package.
The government must do some modelling. The government must address the issues of people with disabilities and ensure that they have a much better result from this tax package than they currently look like getting if the government is successful in having this legislation passed.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Disabled People</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-03-30,"—Again we are hearing the opposition trying to justify why they will not support the taxation reform—something they realised has been needed since 1985. Because they did not have the gall or the guts to do it, they left it languishing and they left us with a ramshackle wholesale sales tax system with a labyrinth of taxes on food, personal items and many other goods. I find it amazing that members on the other side can come into this chamber and go on and on peddling myths. Senator Evans just said that people with disabilities will be paying 10 per cent more on every item. That is absolutely outrageous.
—How can you say that?
—I can say it because none of those on the other side understand the system that they currently support. They have no policies—not a policy between them. There are a couple of ways: third ways, fourth ways, fifth ways, halfways—with Latham and some of the—
—Pathways.
—Oh, pathways.
—Why don't you say something of substance?
—Senator Lundy never says anything of substance in this chamber. What we have is a party on the other side with no policies. The only policies they have is that they support a wholesale sales tax system which is ramshackle. It is a system which has tax on some items of food 
 and most of the things you see in the supermarket: dog food, gladwrap, birthday cards—all those sorts of things. When Labor put up the wholesale sales tax, by an enormous amount, was there one penny of compensation? No.
Gary Johns, a former minister in the Labor Party, tells us what they did. During the 1993 election, they promised that they would not raise taxes and that they would reduce income taxes. They promised l-a-w tax cuts. They raised wholesale sales taxes, they delivered only half the income taxes and they gave no compensation to people on pensions and no compensation to any individual whom they are pretending to represent. What absolute hypocrisy!
Gary Johns said that they should realise what they should be doing and support taxation reform, because that was what was identified by Paul Keating in 1985. He said there are three main advantages of a consumption tax: it would allow a more rational indirect tax system than the wholesale sales tax system, it would allow greater tax revenues to be generated for the benefit of individuals and tax rate reduction, and it would generate tax from those who evade or avoid income tax. It would provide a useful net dividend for distribution to the rest of the community.
The other thing they forget to remind people about is that we have a tax system, the base of which is becoming narrower and narrower. In fact, what we have not got is a party on the other side with a vision for the future, that asks, `How are we going to support health? How are we going to support social security? How are we going to support benefits for people with a disability into the future?' Under current Labor Party policy—I can only presume that their policy is to support wholesale sales tax and increases in wholesale sales tax—
—That was their past.
—That was their past, as Senator Hill said. They have no pathway for the future so they have no plans for how they are going to provide pensions, support for people with disabilities and health care into the future. As our dependence on goods narrows and our economy depends 
 more and more on services, our tax base is narrowing. They have no plans at all for the future.
—This whole program means no extra revenue.
—Senator Crowley keeps shouting across the chamber. You have nothing to say. You are going to have a chance to get up and respond but you have no policies and nothing to offer. Let me say to you that the Australian public—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Gibbs, Senator Hill and Senator Crowley. I want some order in this chamber, please.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. It was a bit of a challenge. I was trying awfully hard to talk over the top of those people on the other side, who are supporting a system which is totally insupportable. No wonder they need to shout across the chamber.
Senator Hill interjecting—
—Senator Hill!
Senator Gibbs interjecting—
—Order! Senator Gibbs, you are not helping either. If the three of you were to remain silent, Senator Patterson might have some chance.
Senator Eggleston interjecting—
—Senator Eggleston, you will get a go later on.
—Taxation reform is not just about a GST, it is about righting the mistakes of the previous government and providing a fair and more equitable system. That is what we are about—a system which is sustainable into the future, which is something that you know nothing about.

"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1999-03-30,"—We have here today answers from a minister that show very clearly that this government, at best, does not know what its new tax package is about, does not know the impact of the GST, because it has done no 
 modelling except in Treasury. Senator Newman's department has done no modelling. The health department has done no modelling, and it could answer no questions when we asked it in our committee, `What will be the impact?' But many of the witnesses who came before our committee knew the impact.
Many of those are back today as an alliance of the Australian Council of Social Service, the Uniting Church, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Women's Electoral Lobby, the Australian Catholic Health Care Association, the Australian Consumers Association, the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, Anglicare, the Catholic Social Welfare Commission, St Vincent de Paul and some elements of the Salvation Army. No way are these paid up stoolies for the Labor Party, and no way are they are a bunch of ratbags. They brought excellent evidence before our committee, and they have brought it back again today. They say what is clear to anybody who is serious about looking at this bill—that this tax package is very unfair, and it will entrench inequality in Australia well into the future if it should pass. It will divide Australia into the haves and the have-nots. It is based on a trickle-up effect, where the poor pay the tax and the rich take it home. It is quite outrageous.
The government over there pretend that they know it is about something else. Those people whose names I have listed have all done the serious work. They got groups of reliable, responsible accountants like Ernst and Young and Arthur Andersen to do the work for them—to make sure that they have not got it wrong—and they are clear: low income families in Australia will have grossly inadequate compensation.
It is very interesting that, at the very time that legislation was introduced that will divide Australia into the haves and the have-nots, the Prime Minister went before large sections of corporate Australia last weekend to say, `I've got $50 million of precious taxpayer money, and I'm going to set that aside as tax deductions for corporate Australia to encourage them to become philanthropists.' For the first time ever, he is taxing the charitable institutions in this country—if he has $50 million to 
 spare, why doesn't he give it to the charities that do the work on the ground, instead of giving tax cuts to corporate Australia in case they are generous?
It is a very big irony that the Prime Minister should be encouraging philanthropy with massive tax cuts when at the same time he is introducing for the first time ever taxes on the charitable and not-for-profit sector in this country. It is completely against the fabric of Australian society to tax charitable and not-for-profit institutions. How about this: for the first time ever, a tax on the Girl Guides and a tax on the Boy Scouts. We have seen how the government says, `Well, we didn't mean it on bob-a-job.' What about bob-a-job week? What about the Girl Guide biscuits? What about the surf lifesavers and St Vincent de Paul? What about the GST on the lamington cake stall? That is what this government is introducing.
Government senators interjecting—
—You may bay, but it was those institutions that brought this evidence before us—not the Labor Party. For the first time ever, you are taxing the charitable and not-for-profit sector, and at the same time your Prime Minister has found $50 million, which he is setting aside for institutions in this country should they get into further philanthropy. It is an extraordinary piece of legislation. It takes no regard of the sort of Australia that we have become—a society where people want to put in their pennyworth and contribute through voluntary activity and through charitable and not-for-profit institutions. Now that is under attack.
More importantly than anything, it is an unfair, ungenerous bill that is going to make the poor and the low income families poorer and worse off than ever before. Under law, that poverty and that lack of income will be there forever. We all know that any compensation, small as it is, will not last. In every other country the GST has risen. It will rise in this country because there is no extra revenue out of these bills. It is just a different way of making the money go round. What is happening is the poor are paying for the rich.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1999-03-30,"—I must say that Senator Crowley made a lot of very strong assertions there which have absolutely no basis in fact whatsoever. She said, for example, that the minister did not understand what the government's tax package was about. It is absolute nonsense to think that the Minister for Family and Community Services would not understand how the tax package impacts on the 1.5 million Australians who have some disability and need personal care and assistance. Of course the minister understands that. Senator Crowley's assertion that the government did no modelling to work out what the impact on people with disabilities would be is absolute nonsense, as was her first assertion that the minister did not understand what the package had for people with disabilities and what compensation it provided.
In formulating its draft goods and services tax legislation, the government accepted the recommendations of the Vos committee report and made the vast bulk of disability services available GST free to people who need them. Additionally, because we are a caring and sensitive government that makes sure that people with disabilities are not in any way unfairly dealt with, the government has made available a comprehensive list of medical aids and appliances used by people with disabilities which are to be GST free. So, in following the recommendations of the Vos report, the government has made sure that the services available to people with disabilities and the mechanical and other aids they need are GST free.
It is true that the commercial activities of charities and business services run by organisations involved with disabled people will attract a GST. However, just as with any other organisation or business, they will be able to claim back the GST paid on all inputs and will receive an input tax credit.
—What about the services?
—Furthermore, the government's tax reforms are expected to reduce the cost of community services by 2.7 per cent due to the abolition of 10 existing and inefficient taxes. Those taxes pervade the whole work environment. So the answer to 
 `What about the services?' is that the services will be cheaper and that people with disabilities who are on disability service pensions will be compensated by the four per cent increase in pensions and by the other compensation means available through the tax package. An essential theme of this tax package is that people with disabilities should not be disadvantaged at all. For that reason, the government has gone out of its way to make sure that, as I have said, the services and mechanical aids required by people with disabilities are GST free.
Senator Crowley mentioned a long list of people and organisations who made submissions to the committee. I attended hearings of this committee, along with Senator Crowley and a number of other members of the Senate, and I must say that my impression was that many of the people who made submissions displayed a great lack of knowledge and understanding of the tax package. This was in spite of the fact that the government distributed a comprehensive community sector briefing kit which covered most of the issues raised. All this goes to show that, like the opposition and like many other organisations who appeared before the various GST committees, the bill had not been read, that the proposals had not been understood and that most of the evidence given and the complaints made were in ignorance of how the proposed tax package will work and, in particular in terms of disabled people, in ignorance of the fact that the government has gone out of its way to ensure that the disabled of Australia are not disadvantaged and are adequately compensated by this package.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Disabled People</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1999-03-30,"—I have never heard such waffle in all my life. First of all, we had Senator Patterson slagging off, talking about anything and everything apart from people with disabilities.
Senator Patterson interjecting—
—Yes, you were, Senator Patterson—slagging off, just like you always do; you talk about anything apart from the subject.
—Order! Senator Gibbs, would you address the chair 
 and, Senator Patterson, cease interjecting, thank you.
—We then had Senator Eggleston defending the minister and saying that of course the minister knows about this legislation and of course the minister knows about modelling. But Senator Eggleston was actually on this inquiry with us, and he was there when the department of social security and the department of health gave evidence that they were not consulted by Treasury or by the minister, that they had absolutely no input into what would happen with people with disabilities, with aged care or with people in need of health services.
Senator Eggleston interjecting—
—You were actually there, Senator Eggleston.
—Please address the chair, Senator Gibbs.
—Madam Deputy President, time and time again the witnesses before the Community Affairs GST inquiry stressed that the four per cent compensation was not adequate, that it was not going to be enough to cover the costs that would impact with the introduction of the GST.
People with disabilities suffer higher unemployment rates and have lower incomes than people in the community generally. Their cost of living is much higher due to the specialised living expenses they have, including housing, transport, medical, pharmaceuticals, disability equipment, personal care and miscellaneous costs. Transportation in particular is vital to people with disabilities. We were given evidence that taxis are commonly used because people with a disability are often unable to access public transport or drive a car and so have no other option. A normal person can get into their car or can catch a bus, train or plane. Whatever they want to do, they have that choice. But these people do not have an option.
They do not have an option with the services they have to have in their homes. If people choose to live independently, they have maintenance costs—the lawnmower man has to come, they need house maintenance and cleaning and gardening services and the 
 car has to be washed. These people must even employ someone to fit a light bulb—something which is nothing to us. This is a service and the GST applies to services. They do not have a choice; their expenses are enormous. They have special needs in areas that we take for granted.
Let me quote something:
The Physical Disability Council of NSW submitted an analysis of the effect of the GST on people with a disability. The council contended that the CPI effect on people with disabilities will be greater than the 1.9—2.2 per cent Treasury calculations and could be as high as 2.4—2.7 per cent.
—They will get four per cent.
—Four per cent is not going to cover it, Senator—absolutely not. To show the inequity of this tax, a single person on $75,000 will receive a benefit of $68.55 per week. This is equivalent to 38 per cent of the total disability support pension, which will increase by merely $2.54 a week. It is not enough to cover their expenses. They are going to pay GST on services that have no tax now; you are going to put a GST on these people. Do you know what you are going to do? Do you care what you are doing to these people?
—No, they do not care.
—No, you do not care. Have you any idea how these people have to live?
—Tell the truth.
—I am telling the truth. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Disabled People</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-03-30,"—What is really extraordinary in this debate is the fact that, if there were any compelling evidence at all that the compensation package is inadequate, the government could address it. But we have had four months of a travelling roadshow—the inquiry into the GST—which has turned out an absolute mishmash of criticisms without very much foundation at all. That is the problem—look at today's report of the litany of organisations that joined in the criticism that ACOSS made of the GST. As Senator Newman said, ACOSS's criticisms do not seem to 
 have changed much since the very beginning. You have to understand that ACOSS was never, ever going to support the model because it shifts tax from a direct to an indirect base and that is just something that ACOSS will not support.
By the same token, and this must be said, ACOSS supports tax reform because it realises—I would suggest it is an absolutely self-evident proposition—that unless there is fundamental tax reform there is a serious problem for the social security base—it is put totally at risk. It is self-evident that ACOSS does support tax reform; it might not like the model, but it was never going to like it. If you accept these fundamental assumptions then you can put the criticisms in context.
It is very easy to criticise the GST package and to not really expose your own conclusions. Although I have not been on the GST committees, I suspect that that is very much what has happened over these past four months. There has been a barrage of criticism with very little foundation and very little to support conclusions.
I find quite offensive the suggestion made this afternoon that the government is unsympathetic to people who are adversely impacted by the GST, by any reform package or by any policy position. The fact that there is a generous compensation package clearly underscores the fact that the government is concerned about people on low incomes, people with disabilities and certainly the elderly. Proof of that is not only in the compensation package but also in the fact that, in the formulation of the draft GST legislation, the government has accepted recommendations of the Vos committee's report and made the vast bulk of disability services available GST free to people who need them. That does not seem to me to be a government that is not concerned about how a package will impact on people with disabilities.
A comprehensive number of medical aids and appliances used by people with disabilities will also be GST free. As Senator Newman pointed out, commercial activities and business services of charities will be liable for a GST because they are just that—they are commercial activities—but they will be able 
 to claim back, as indeed any other business can, any GST paid on inputs for these activities as an input tax credit. No convincing case has been made as to why there should be any different treatment for commercial activities.
The government's tax reforms are expected to reduce the cost of community services by about 2.7 per cent due to the abolition of 10 existing and inefficient taxes which pervade the whole system and which, I strongly suggest, impact much more strongly and much more unfairly on people with disabilities. They are hidden taxes that everyone in the community has to deal with.
Pensions for people with disabilities will rise by four per cent to assist with the impact of tax reforms. There has not yet been one convincing bit of modelling or evidence before any GST committee, so far as I know, that proves that that is inadequate. If somebody can come forward with convincing evidence, then you would be talking to a government that would be prepared to listen, but so far no-one has come forward. (Time expired)

Ministerial Statement by Hon Bruce Scott MP
Success of Government Mission to Sandakan
Tuesday 30 March 1999
During the period 13-22 March it was my privilege, and I might add, a very real pleasure—to lead on behalf of the government a visit by former prisoners of war, widows and next of kin to Sandakan, in the State of Sabah, Malaysia.
The shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator the Hon. Chris Schacht, also accompanied the mission party representing the federal opposition.
Members may have seen television or press coverage of the events undertaken during the mission tour.
The mission was formally farewelled by the Prime Minister at the historic Victoria Barracks in Sydney. The first stop for the mission group was Singapore where ceremonies were held at Kranji War Cemetery and Changi Chapel. These ceremonies commemorated all those who died or were captured at the fall of Singapore and were imprisoned and died at Changi and buried at Kranji.
The mission party then moved to Sandakan for the two major ceremonies of the mission program. 

These were the opening at the Sandakan Memorial Park of a commemorative pavilion and the dedication of a memorial stone, in memory of those who suffered and died as prisoners of war of the Japanese at Sandakan, on the death marches and at Ranau during World War II.
There was no worse worst wartime atrocity to affect Australian servicemen than the Sandakan-Ranau death marches, yet relatively few Australians know of the events.
In 1942, more than 2,700 prisoners of war were moved from Singapore to Sandakan to construct an airfield for the Japanese. During the latter part of 1943, following the breaking of an underground intelligence ring in the camp, almost all of the prisoner of war officers were moved to Kuching.
As the tide of war turned, and fearing an allied invasion, the Japanese marched most of the Sandakan POWs to Ranau, 250 kilometres to the west. By September 1945, all but six of the POWs were dead—and these survived only because they had escaped. As well, the Japanese destroyed the POW camp at Sandakan in an effort to hide evidence of their brutality.
Among the Sandakan mission party was Mr Owen Campbell, now the only one of those six escapees still alive.
The commemorative pavilion contains a number of panels which set out in full detail the background and history of the camp. At one end of the building is a stained glass window, which helps provide an appropriate setting for contemplation.
The Sandakan Memorial, an imposing monolith measuring some three metres tall, also offers visitors a place where floral tributes or other tokens of remembrance may be laid.
The structures are part of a $750,000 upgrade to the Sandakan Memorial Park, which follows a 1995 memorandum of understanding between the Australian government, the Sandakan Municipal Council, the Returned and Services League of Australia and the Sabah State Forestry Department.
Following an emotional ceremony at the Sandakan Memorial Park, which included many local dignitaries and local veterans, the mission group travelled to Ranau, closely following the death march route.
At Ranau a commemorative ceremony was held at the Gunner Cleary Memorial on the site of the old POW camp. The story of Gunner Cleary is a particularly poignant one and it has come to symbolise the fate of all those who suffered and died at Sandakan and on the death marches.
Gunner Cleary was recaptured after trying to escape. He was chained by the neck at a stake, brutally beaten, spat upon and starved for almost eleven days. When he was at the point of death he 
 was given to his mates who cleaned his wounds and comforted him before he died in their arms.
The final destination of the mission group was the Labuan War Cemetery. Here in the tranquil surrounds of the carefully tended Commonwealth War Graves cemetery, lie the remains of all those who died at Sandakan, on the death marches and at Ranau.
Along the walls at the entrance to the cemetery are the names of those with no known grave. The ceremony at Labuan was a fitting commemoration to all those who had suffered and died during that tragic period. Attended by local dignitaries, local citizens and expatriate Australians living in Malaysia, the final ceremony was a fitting tribute to those who suffered and died.
What are the benefits of missions such as this?
The main objective is to raise awareness within the community through the publicity that surrounds such a visit. Far too many Australians are unaware of events at Sandakan and I trust that through this visit many will have come to know about this enormous tragedy.
The impact on those who took part in the mission was quite overwhelming. No-one on the mission could fail to be moved by the emotion surrounding the commemorative ceremonies.
For some there was a healing of the heart that for far too long had carried the hurt and pain of the loss of a husband, brother or father. For others, there was, as described by one, `a sense of peace from having, at last, stood by his grave to say goodbye'.
It is regrettable of course, that not every person who suffered loss at Sandakan could take part in this particular mission. But it is my fervent hope that many more widows and next of kin will undertake the journey to Sandakan to view the new memorial as part of their experience of remembering and honouring the loved ones who never returned.
May I also here express the thanks of the Australian government to the government and people of Malaysia, and in particular the State of Sabah, for the very warm welcome we received. We also appreciate the assistance provided during the planning stages and during the visit by the mission party.
The mission was funded under the government's commemorative program Their Service—Our Heritage  which, as members know, offers all Australians the opportunity to acknowledge the debt of gratitude we owe to our veterans in helping preserve the freedom we enjoy today.

"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1999-03-30,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In opening my remarks I would particularly like to thank the community affairs committee secretariat—Christine McDonald, Peter Short, Leonie Peake, Ingrid Zappe and Elton Humphrey—who have done a tremendous job in getting this report written in spite of the very tight time lines we have had to deal with. The select committee's first report was not published until 19 February, we have had visits to all of the capital cities except Darwin, and we have had to write a report in that very tight time frame. So I thank the secretariat very much for their achievement in this area.
The committee considers that this government's tax package is unfair, complex, confusing and significantly flawed in many areas. Evidence presented to the committee over two months confirms that this tax package will entrench inequality. It will divide the community and ensure and entrench that division in the community, if it should pass, for years to come. It will divide Australia into the haves and the have-nots. High income earners will get generous tax cuts and low income households will have paltry compensation. It 
 is, if you like, a trickle-up effect: the poor shall pay the tax cuts for the rich.
It has often been said that this is just the Labor Party being negative and mean. This report is not the Labor Party's view; it is the Labor Party and Democrat conclusion as a majority report on the evidence given to the committee. That evidence was given by any number of witnesses, some of whom had gone to the bother of finding organisations—firms like Ernst and Young or Arthur Andersen—to examine the legislation and its impact on their organisations and the people they represent. So in no way are these a bunch of paid stoolies coming to run a Labor line; these are people who for the first time have had the opportunity to look in detail at the impact of the GST legislation. They have found it wanting—particularly wanting in its compensation for low income and middle income households.
The package's compensation is very unfair and very unjust. More than that, any number of people of significance have reminded us that that compensation will be eroded over a very short time. The last to do so was Professor Geoff Carmody, certainly not a renowned spokesperson for the Labor Party. His evidence needs to be taken very seriously. The compensation is insufficient. It takes no account of the expenditure patterns of low income households—that they spend at least 25 to 30 per cent of their income on food, which for the first time will have a 10 per cent GST, and that they spend about another 25 to 30 per cent of their income on the cost of rent and housing. The government itself admits that that will rise by 2.3 per cent, and the evidence given to us is that it will rise by far more. We need to remember that people on pensions and fixed incomes, but particularly pensions, usually have a requirement that they pay 25 per cent of their income for rent. The minute they get another four per cent, one per cent of that automatically goes through to rent. So they have much less as disposable income to spend on their requirements.
The other point that I find very disappointing is that, at the very same time as Prime Minister Howard is meeting with corporate 
 Australia urging them to practise philanthropy and telling them that he will find $50 million to assist them if they should choose to do that, his government has introduced for the first time ever a tax on the charities and not-for-profit sector in this country. This is the first time we have seen a tax on the Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides, the surf lifesavers and St Vincent de Paul. They know that, as a result of this tax, to maintain their services they will have to make significant cuts. But what they also realise is that to maintain their organisations' viability they will have to cut services at precisely the time that low income people affected by the GST will have an even larger need for the services they provide.
Lest people say, as some people have said in this place and in evidence to our committee, `Oh well, these people do not know what they are talking about,' the Boy Scouts, for example, were acting on written advice from Treasury. We know of other examples. The funeral directors were told on written advice that they should introduce the 10 per cent GST on prepackaged funerals right now. So it is not that this committee made it up. It is not that people are running amok out there. It is the first time that the community, these organisations and the witnesses before our committee have had the opportunity to look at this legislation in detail, and they have found it very significantly wanting.
At its core, what lots of witnesses say is that it is unAustralian. It will enshrine that divide of the poor and the rich. It will legislate to ensure that we have that division forever, and that has never been the case in the past and it is very unAustralian. For the first time we have seen a tax on charities. That is also very unAustralian. It is important that we recognise the contribution of the not-for-profit and voluntary sector and the charities to the fabric of Australian society. For the first time, that is now significantly under threat and significantly changed.
The compensation that people worry about needs to be considered like this. If you earn $75,000, you will get about $86 a week in tax cuts. If you are a single pensioner, you will get $2.89. If you are a pensioner couple, you 
 will get $4.81—as one witness said to us, just enough for the price of a package of cereal.
Finally I would just like to make a few comments about the way our inquiry was conducted. In her report and in her other contributions Senator Knowles argues that the government has a mandate for this legislation, but she spends significant pages of her minority report explaining that many of the witnesses did not understand it. How can you claim a mandate when you can point out that the witnesses do not understand the legislation? If you have a mandate, people have voted for what they know about. Indeed, what is clear is that when people do know about it they vote against it in significant numbers.
The other thing is that the inquiry, as I have said, has done the work for government. For the first time ever, these organisations and the witnesses before our committee in health, welfare, child care, aged care and local government have finally realised the detail that is now available to them that was never available during the election. Senator Knowles attacked people for what they did not know. She refused to admit that the departments of relevance had done no modelling, that the community had no evidence. And I take this opportunity to apologise to all those witnesses who were directly offended by Senator Knowles's very unsenatorial attacks on them on many occasions. This is a critically important report. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,14,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1999-03-30,"—It is interesting, in speaking to this Community Affairs References Committee report today, that Senator Crowley concluded by doing what she did throughout the entire hearing—that is, sledging. It has been a great shame because, while this committee inquiry was taking place—and Senator Crowley now leaves the chamber because she does not want to hear this contribution—she continually sledged anything that was put to the witnesses in terms of explanation.
It needs to be put clearly, once and for all, that this process was flawed right from the start. The Labor Party and the minor parties decided to send legislation to the references committee instead of sending it to the legislation committee. Legislation should rightly go 
 to the legislation committee. But no; they wanted to control it—and that they did. That is why, whenever I tried to explain to witnesses where their assertions were wrong, I was told I was then badgering the witnesses.
One witness said, `I'm not here to hear what you've got to say; I'm here to tell you what I think.' I suppose, to a degree, that is true, but it was sad that they did not want to know the reality, because there was a lack of understanding about the embedded taxes that are being paid right throughout the system, from Labor's reign in office.
The claim that there was lack of consultation is pretty remarkable, given the fact that there have been thousands of consultations, both prior to the election and following it, through the tax task force chaired by Senator Gibson, of which I was a member, through the Vos committee and through subsequent consultations with ministers and members of parliament generally.
Following those consultations, there has been this continuing misrepresentation of a lot of the information that is available. Most people had not read the bill. I asked a lot of people, considering that this inquiry was into the bill, `Have you read the bill?' Most people said, `No, I haven't.' There were some very decent, honest, well-intentioned people who simply had it wrong. They begged for GST-free status. The legislation clearly showed that they had already been given GST-free status, but they had not read the bill.
There was also a lack of understanding of how people would get the tax credits, and that they would get the money back. Some places, such as the child-care industry, for example, have the best of both worlds: they do not pay the GST and they do not charge it. They came along and said, `We're going to increase our fees.'
The non-commercial activities of charities will not be taxed. They are GST free. Once again, they do not pay the tax and they do not charge it. Local government said that they did not understand it. I have personally met with local government dozens of times, as have various committees and ministers. Local government stands to be about $70 million 
 better off, to say nothing of the diesel fuel rebates as well.
Witnesses talked about compliance costs as though they were not keeping any records whatsoever at the moment. For a goods and services tax, they know their outgoings and their incomings. All they have to do is work out one-eleventh of both—if they are paying a GST and charging a GST—and submit the difference at the end of the reporting period. It is not particularly complex. When I asked witnesses, `Are you keeping records at the moment?', they said, `Yes.' I asked, `What is difficult about calculating one-eleventh of it?' Their eyes glazed over as if to say, `Is it that simple?'
This whole process has been badly misrepresented. It needs to be noted that Senator Evans regularly let the cat out of the bag, saying, `I'm from the Labor Party; we're voting against it.' The obvious question then is: why on earth did we have the inquiry? Clearly, the opposition parties were never going to change their minds. They did not really want to know what was going on; they were just going to vote against it.
Some witnesses, some of whom I would have thought should have known better, claimed there would be a cascading effect of the tax throughout the system. Precisely the reverse will happen. Yet Senator Crowley, as chairman, kept egging them on, saying, `Yes, that's right.' She clearly had not read the bill, and to this moment she has not read the bill.
On some occasions—Senator Abetz did it once in Tasmania and I did it regularly—I referred to page 79 of the bill, regarding various health professionals who will be GST free. Senator Crowley raised her eyebrows as if to say, `Is that so?' I referred to the list of medical aids and appliances. She did not have a clue what was contained in that list.
There are many calculations that are simply wrong. Senator Crowley referred earlier to the wonderful work done by accountants on behalf of some of these organisations. In many cases, I have to say, Madam President, I think they wasted their money. The Australian Catholic Health Care Association has written to say that the figures presented in Arthur Andersen's report to the committee 
 were wrong and they have had to be revised down. There were more and more examples of evidence given by accounting firms on behalf of their clients—for which, presumably, they paid very good money—which was simply wrong. I cannot understand how that can happen.
Many witnesses and Labor consistently claimed that food and services would go up by 10 per cent. They will not and cannot understand that that will not be the case. Nothing will go up by 10 per cent. They refuse to understand that there will be compensation, that the worst case scenario presented to the committee was that price increases would be 3.9 per cent. This package offers four per cent compensation plus 1½ per cent consistently above the CPI. Senator Crowley argued at the time that during their term in government the CPI was adequate on its own. We are offering 1½ per cent above the CPI plus the four per cent. So many of those calculations were wrong. They would consistently forget about that.
I think it is very sad, and it is equally sad that my time has run out. I commend to the Senate the minority report, because it does set out the facts yet again.	I encourage people from these various community groups and organisations to read the minority report if they do not want to read the legislation. I do encourage them to read the legislation, but if they do not want to read the legislation, they should at least read this report. Their minds will be put at rest, because in fact they will be better off. They will not be paying the embedded taxes that they are currently paying and most of them will not be paying the taxes that have burdened them in the past.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-30,"—I thank all the people who put in submissions and appeared as witnesses before the inquiry. They provided a great deal of information which was very helpful to me and to the Democrats. I express my disappointment at the very inadequate information provided by government departments that appeared before the Community Affairs References Committee—the Department of Aged Care and the Department of Family and 
 Community Services. Clearly, they had done very little in the way of investigating the implications of the tax package on a whole range of people that came under their responsibility. I think that is a great shame.
One of the main issues the Democrats want to emphasise is that of housing. I draw people's attention to the supplementary report. Housing has received very little notice to date, but it is a serious matter which will clearly impact on people—particularly those in the private rental sector and in the public and community housing sector—more heavily than has previously been realised. Some action must be taken on this significant area. The treatment of charities has also received some attention to date. This is an area which, on the whole, should not cost the government money. It is simply applying a tax system in a more logical way and not penalising non-profit organisations that provide a community service because, if they did not exist, it would cost the taxpayer a hell of a lot more. That is an area that obviously needs close attention.
The other key area under the responsibility of the committee is that of health. There are many anomalies, particularly in relation to what nowadays are called complementary medicines and complementary services. There are massive problems and clear inconsistencies concerning acupuncturists and also some other health practitioners like massage therapists and others in the complementary medicine field. Again, this is an area which, in totality, should save the government money if they addressed it, rather than cost them money.
Those areas, apart from the broader concerns that the Democrats have expressed time and again since the package was brought down, are ones that we believe need closer attention. We have outlined them in our supplementary comments on this report. We urge the government to take them more seriously than they appeared to do in the course of the inquiry. I know they are having discussions privately with groups, and that is certainly to be welcomed, but it would be better if there was some acknowledgment that perhaps the package as it was handed out prior to the election is not the Ten Command 
 ments written in stone and it can be significantly improved. Indeed, it must be significantly amended in many areas, including some that have been outlined in this report, if there is any prospect of the package being in any way fair, particularly for lower and middle income earners which, from the Democrats' perspective, are the group of people that must be assisted by any tax reform before we ensure that people on higher incomes are adequately looked after by any tax reform.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,14,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-30,"—In July last year the Greens warned that there would be a comprehensive loss to low income earners, women in the work force, non-profit organisations and charities if a GST as mooted by the government were brought in. We pointed to the tax being an impost on a whole range of community activities aimed at helping those people who are least advantaged in our society—things such as raffles, ordinary fundraisers. Larger fundraising organisations would face—
—They are GST free.
—Larger organisations' income activities are not going to be GST free, as the interjector opposite says. Subscription fees, grants, sponsorships and fundraising events will have a GST applied.
The Greens went to the election totally opposed to the GST because of the impact it would have across the board in dividing the gap between rich and poor in this country. We are well aware, for example, that $3 billion was going to be handed on a platter in tax rebates to wealthy corporations, including transport, mining and woodchipping corporations, at a time when poor people were going to face the brunt of this tax. Community organisations, charities and non-government organisations, such as sporting and environment organisations, were going to have to not only face the tax but also face the difficulties involved in collecting the tax. Whereas it may have been all right to use an honorary accountant in the past, they will now need professional, paid accountants to deal with the much more complex system coming down the line. 
The problem was that the Democrats said, `We will make the GST fair.' Many people in the Australian community thought that, if the government were re-elected, the Democrats would be there as a backstop to ensure that the taxation system would not damage non-government organisations, charities and the interests of the poorer people in our community. Now we find that what the Greens warned is true. In the report released today we find the Democrats either calling for a massive overhaul of various parts of the GST package or implying that the GST package should be rejected.
A broad band of community organisations, from Anglicare Australia to the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition—a large range of people who work, give their life, their spare time and their money to helping people who are disadvantaged, who are in minority groups or who have special interests in our society—today have endorsed what the Greens were saying last year. Let me read from the community call that they have made today:
. . . the Government's Tax Package as it now stands is unfair and unacceptable. It needs substantial changes to make it fairer and do justice to people on low incomes.
The proposed GST, by unnecessarily raising the costs of necessities of life, would be very harmful to people on low and fixed incomes such as pensioners, unemployed people, and most young people and people with disabilities. It would also cause major problems for families with children on modest incomes. Women would be disproportionately affected by the large increase in taxes on consumption due to their different work patterns and family responsibilities.
These groups representing a diversity of Australians who work for the good of this nation went on to make these observations. First of all: `keeping food GST free is critical'. The government says it will not. The groups say:
. . . removing other essentials or providing adequate compensation for them, are crucial necessary steps to protect people on low and modest incomes and to improve fairness.
The government says it will not. The groups say that the government's tax reform proposals need to be redesigned to take account of these concerns and to transparently safeguard 
 the interests of all Australians. The government will not.
With the government standing firm, these groups say that the current legislation should be rejected. I say to the Democrats: where do you stand in this? The information is now in. Are you now going to make it public—too late, as I would have it? Are you going to vindicate the stand of the Greens and say that, unless the government makes comprehensive changes to the tax package as called for by these community groups, this tax package should be rejected because it is so unfair to the Australian community, because it advantages the rich and disadvantages the poor, because it advantages those who have, and that includes wherewithal and access to government, but it disadvantages those who do not have, and that includes those who are cut off from government and from the power that comes through political connections?
The Democrats fostered this legislation through the last election by saying that they could make it fair. It is now manifestly clear that the Democrats cannot make this legislation fair. The government is not going to go into comprehensive rearrangement of the package. The Democrat senator who has just spoken said that in housing this legislation needs some action. There are other areas which need close attention. What is the action? What is the attention?
I can tell the Democrats that they have to reject this legislation. We said that all the way down the line. They enabled it to get through the last election because they said, `We'll cushion it, we'll make it fair.' It is time now for the Democrats to agree that they can do nothing of the sort, that they have consorted with a GST package and have fostered it through the last election—a GST package which is going to be an invidious package for the interests of poorer Australians and, I think, for average Australians as well. It is going to help divide the gap between the haves and the have-nots in this nation. It is time for the Democrats to say, `We were wrong. We reject this package.'

Lest people say, as some people have said in this place and in evidence to our committee, `Oh well, these people do not know what they are talking about,' the Boy Scouts, for example, were acting on written advice from Treasury. We know of other examples. The funeral directors were told on written advice that they should introduce the 10 per cent GST on prepackaged funerals right now. So it is not that this committee made it up. It is not that people are running amok out there. It is the first time that the community, these organisations and the witnesses before our committee have had the opportunity to look at this legislation in detail, and they have found it very significantly wanting.
At its core, what lots of witnesses say is that it is unAustralian. It will enshrine that divide of the poor and the rich. It will legislate to ensure that we have that division forever, and that has never been the case in the past and it is very unAustralian. For the first time we have seen a tax on charities. That is also very unAustralian. It is important that we recognise the contribution of the not-for-profit and voluntary sector and the charities to the fabric of Australian society. For the first time, that is now significantly under threat and significantly changed.
The compensation that people worry about needs to be considered like this. If you earn $75,000, you will get about $86 a week in tax cuts. If you are a single pensioner, you will get $2.89. If you are a pensioner couple, you 
 will get $4.81—as one witness said to us, just enough for the price of a package of cereal.
Finally I would just like to make a few comments about the way our inquiry was conducted. In her report and in her other contributions Senator Knowles argues that the government has a mandate for this legislation, but she spends significant pages of her minority report explaining that many of the witnesses did not understand it. How can you claim a mandate when you can point out that the witnesses do not understand the legislation? If you have a mandate, people have voted for what they know about. Indeed, what is clear is that when people do know about it they vote against it in significant numbers.
The other thing is that the inquiry, as I have said, has done the work for government. For the first time ever, these organisations and the witnesses before our committee in health, welfare, child care, aged care and local government have finally realised the detail that is now available to them that was never available during the election. Senator Knowles attacked people for what they did not know. She refused to admit that the departments of relevance had done no modelling, that the community had no evidence. And I take this opportunity to apologise to all those witnesses who were directly offended by Senator Knowles's very unsenatorial attacks on them on many occasions. This is a critically important report. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,14,2,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1999-03-30,"—It is interesting, in speaking to this Community Affairs References Committee report today, that Senator Crowley concluded by doing what she did throughout the entire hearing—that is, sledging. It has been a great shame because, while this committee inquiry was taking place—and Senator Crowley now leaves the chamber because she does not want to hear this contribution—she continually sledged anything that was put to the witnesses in terms of explanation.
It needs to be put clearly, once and for all, that this process was flawed right from the start. The Labor Party and the minor parties decided to send legislation to the references committee instead of sending it to the legislation committee. Legislation should rightly go 
 to the legislation committee. But no; they wanted to control it—and that they did. That is why, whenever I tried to explain to witnesses where their assertions were wrong, I was told I was then badgering the witnesses.
One witness said, `I'm not here to hear what you've got to say; I'm here to tell you what I think.' I suppose, to a degree, that is true, but it was sad that they did not want to know the reality, because there was a lack of understanding about the embedded taxes that are being paid right throughout the system, from Labor's reign in office.
The claim that there was lack of consultation is pretty remarkable, given the fact that there have been thousands of consultations, both prior to the election and following it, through the tax task force chaired by Senator Gibson, of which I was a member, through the Vos committee and through subsequent consultations with ministers and members of parliament generally.
Following those consultations, there has been this continuing misrepresentation of a lot of the information that is available. Most people had not read the bill. I asked a lot of people, considering that this inquiry was into the bill, `Have you read the bill?' Most people said, `No, I haven't.' There were some very decent, honest, well-intentioned people who simply had it wrong. They begged for GST-free status. The legislation clearly showed that they had already been given GST-free status, but they had not read the bill.
There was also a lack of understanding of how people would get the tax credits, and that they would get the money back. Some places, such as the child-care industry, for example, have the best of both worlds: they do not pay the GST and they do not charge it. They came along and said, `We're going to increase our fees.'
The non-commercial activities of charities will not be taxed. They are GST free. Once again, they do not pay the tax and they do not charge it. Local government said that they did not understand it. I have personally met with local government dozens of times, as have various committees and ministers. Local government stands to be about $70 million 
 better off, to say nothing of the diesel fuel rebates as well.
Witnesses talked about compliance costs as though they were not keeping any records whatsoever at the moment. For a goods and services tax, they know their outgoings and their incomings. All they have to do is work out one-eleventh of both—if they are paying a GST and charging a GST—and submit the difference at the end of the reporting period. It is not particularly complex. When I asked witnesses, `Are you keeping records at the moment?', they said, `Yes.' I asked, `What is difficult about calculating one-eleventh of it?' Their eyes glazed over as if to say, `Is it that simple?'
This whole process has been badly misrepresented. It needs to be noted that Senator Evans regularly let the cat out of the bag, saying, `I'm from the Labor Party; we're voting against it.' The obvious question then is: why on earth did we have the inquiry? Clearly, the opposition parties were never going to change their minds. They did not really want to know what was going on; they were just going to vote against it.
Some witnesses, some of whom I would have thought should have known better, claimed there would be a cascading effect of the tax throughout the system. Precisely the reverse will happen. Yet Senator Crowley, as chairman, kept egging them on, saying, `Yes, that's right.' She clearly had not read the bill, and to this moment she has not read the bill.
On some occasions—Senator Abetz did it once in Tasmania and I did it regularly—I referred to page 79 of the bill, regarding various health professionals who will be GST free. Senator Crowley raised her eyebrows as if to say, `Is that so?' I referred to the list of medical aids and appliances. She did not have a clue what was contained in that list.
There are many calculations that are simply wrong. Senator Crowley referred earlier to the wonderful work done by accountants on behalf of some of these organisations. In many cases, I have to say, Madam President, I think they wasted their money. The Australian Catholic Health Care Association has written to say that the figures presented in Arthur Andersen's report to the committee 
 were wrong and they have had to be revised down. There were more and more examples of evidence given by accounting firms on behalf of their clients—for which, presumably, they paid very good money—which was simply wrong. I cannot understand how that can happen.
Many witnesses and Labor consistently claimed that food and services would go up by 10 per cent. They will not and cannot understand that that will not be the case. Nothing will go up by 10 per cent. They refuse to understand that there will be compensation, that the worst case scenario presented to the committee was that price increases would be 3.9 per cent. This package offers four per cent compensation plus 1½ per cent consistently above the CPI. Senator Crowley argued at the time that during their term in government the CPI was adequate on its own. We are offering 1½ per cent above the CPI plus the four per cent. So many of those calculations were wrong. They would consistently forget about that.
I think it is very sad, and it is equally sad that my time has run out. I commend to the Senate the minority report, because it does set out the facts yet again.	I encourage people from these various community groups and organisations to read the minority report if they do not want to read the legislation. I do encourage them to read the legislation, but if they do not want to read the legislation, they should at least read this report. Their minds will be put at rest, because in fact they will be better off. They will not be paying the embedded taxes that they are currently paying and most of them will not be paying the taxes that have burdened them in the past.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-30,"—I thank all the people who put in submissions and appeared as witnesses before the inquiry. They provided a great deal of information which was very helpful to me and to the Democrats. I express my disappointment at the very inadequate information provided by government departments that appeared before the Community Affairs References Committee—the Department of Aged Care and the Department of Family and 
 Community Services. Clearly, they had done very little in the way of investigating the implications of the tax package on a whole range of people that came under their responsibility. I think that is a great shame.
One of the main issues the Democrats want to emphasise is that of housing. I draw people's attention to the supplementary report. Housing has received very little notice to date, but it is a serious matter which will clearly impact on people—particularly those in the private rental sector and in the public and community housing sector—more heavily than has previously been realised. Some action must be taken on this significant area. The treatment of charities has also received some attention to date. This is an area which, on the whole, should not cost the government money. It is simply applying a tax system in a more logical way and not penalising non-profit organisations that provide a community service because, if they did not exist, it would cost the taxpayer a hell of a lot more. That is an area that obviously needs close attention.
The other key area under the responsibility of the committee is that of health. There are many anomalies, particularly in relation to what nowadays are called complementary medicines and complementary services. There are massive problems and clear inconsistencies concerning acupuncturists and also some other health practitioners like massage therapists and others in the complementary medicine field. Again, this is an area which, in totality, should save the government money if they addressed it, rather than cost them money.
Those areas, apart from the broader concerns that the Democrats have expressed time and again since the package was brought down, are ones that we believe need closer attention. We have outlined them in our supplementary comments on this report. We urge the government to take them more seriously than they appeared to do in the course of the inquiry. I know they are having discussions privately with groups, and that is certainly to be welcomed, but it would be better if there was some acknowledgment that perhaps the package as it was handed out prior to the election is not the Ten Command 
 ments written in stone and it can be significantly improved. Indeed, it must be significantly amended in many areas, including some that have been outlined in this report, if there is any prospect of the package being in any way fair, particularly for lower and middle income earners which, from the Democrats' perspective, are the group of people that must be assisted by any tax reform before we ensure that people on higher incomes are adequately looked after by any tax reform.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,14,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-30,"—In July last year the Greens warned that there would be a comprehensive loss to low income earners, women in the work force, non-profit organisations and charities if a GST as mooted by the government were brought in. We pointed to the tax being an impost on a whole range of community activities aimed at helping those people who are least advantaged in our society—things such as raffles, ordinary fundraisers. Larger fundraising organisations would face—
—They are GST free.
—Larger organisations' income activities are not going to be GST free, as the interjector opposite says. Subscription fees, grants, sponsorships and fundraising events will have a GST applied.
The Greens went to the election totally opposed to the GST because of the impact it would have across the board in dividing the gap between rich and poor in this country. We are well aware, for example, that $3 billion was going to be handed on a platter in tax rebates to wealthy corporations, including transport, mining and woodchipping corporations, at a time when poor people were going to face the brunt of this tax. Community organisations, charities and non-government organisations, such as sporting and environment organisations, were going to have to not only face the tax but also face the difficulties involved in collecting the tax. Whereas it may have been all right to use an honorary accountant in the past, they will now need professional, paid accountants to deal with the much more complex system coming down the line. 
The problem was that the Democrats said, `We will make the GST fair.' Many people in the Australian community thought that, if the government were re-elected, the Democrats would be there as a backstop to ensure that the taxation system would not damage non-government organisations, charities and the interests of the poorer people in our community. Now we find that what the Greens warned is true. In the report released today we find the Democrats either calling for a massive overhaul of various parts of the GST package or implying that the GST package should be rejected.
A broad band of community organisations, from Anglicare Australia to the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition—a large range of people who work, give their life, their spare time and their money to helping people who are disadvantaged, who are in minority groups or who have special interests in our society—today have endorsed what the Greens were saying last year. Let me read from the community call that they have made today:
. . . the Government's Tax Package as it now stands is unfair and unacceptable. It needs substantial changes to make it fairer and do justice to people on low incomes.
The proposed GST, by unnecessarily raising the costs of necessities of life, would be very harmful to people on low and fixed incomes such as pensioners, unemployed people, and most young people and people with disabilities. It would also cause major problems for families with children on modest incomes. Women would be disproportionately affected by the large increase in taxes on consumption due to their different work patterns and family responsibilities.
These groups representing a diversity of Australians who work for the good of this nation went on to make these observations. First of all: `keeping food GST free is critical'. The government says it will not. The groups say:
. . . removing other essentials or providing adequate compensation for them, are crucial necessary steps to protect people on low and modest incomes and to improve fairness.
The government says it will not. The groups say that the government's tax reform proposals need to be redesigned to take account of these concerns and to transparently safeguard 
 the interests of all Australians. The government will not.
With the government standing firm, these groups say that the current legislation should be rejected. I say to the Democrats: where do you stand in this? The information is now in. Are you now going to make it public—too late, as I would have it? Are you going to vindicate the stand of the Greens and say that, unless the government makes comprehensive changes to the tax package as called for by these community groups, this tax package should be rejected because it is so unfair to the Australian community, because it advantages the rich and disadvantages the poor, because it advantages those who have, and that includes wherewithal and access to government, but it disadvantages those who do not have, and that includes those who are cut off from government and from the power that comes through political connections?
The Democrats fostered this legislation through the last election by saying that they could make it fair. It is now manifestly clear that the Democrats cannot make this legislation fair. The government is not going to go into comprehensive rearrangement of the package. The Democrat senator who has just spoken said that in housing this legislation needs some action. There are other areas which need close attention. What is the action? What is the attention?
I can tell the Democrats that they have to reject this legislation. We said that all the way down the line. They enabled it to get through the last election because they said, `We'll cushion it, we'll make it fair.' It is time now for the Democrats to agree that they can do nothing of the sort, that they have consorted with a GST package and have fostered it through the last election—a GST package which is going to be an invidious package for the interests of poorer Australians and, I think, for average Australians as well. It is going to help divide the gap between the haves and the have-nots in this nation. It is time for the Democrats to say, `We were wrong. We reject this package.'

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,1999-03-30,"—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. I move:
That the committee does not press its request for an amendment not made by the House of Representatives but, as an alternative to the request, the committee reconsider Schedule 1, Part 5.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-30,"—When the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  was first considered by the Senate last week, a number of sensible amendments were made to it. A request was also made to the House of Representatives to overcome the deficiency that the proposal for surgery to be permitted outside a hospital or day procedures centre setting should be made available to public patients as well as to those who are privately insured. The House has declined to act on this request.
After further discussions, the government has now accepted that the objections and issues raised by the opposition and other non-government senators need further consideration. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care—through the Parliamentary Secretary to Cabinet in his stead—for deciding to withdraw 
 part 5 of the bill, which contained the provisions for approved facilities for out-of-hospital surgery.
As the shadow minister foreshadowed in the debate in the House over the request, this is the action that the opposition would have taken. We will now agree with the government. If the minister wishes to persist with out-of-hospital surgery, he should come back with a more developed proposal which clarifies exactly which procedures will be carried out, what the fees are likely to be, how public patients will be catered for, how quality standards will be set and enforced, how many approved facilities he envisages being established and how approved facilities will operate to complement the existing services provided in day surgeries.
I will conclude by briefly summarising our position on the rest of the bill. The opposition agrees with the proposal in part 1 of the bill to discount rates of contributions where there are administrative savings. The opposition also agrees with the proposals in part 2 to provide for loyalty bonus schemes. The proposals in relation to waiting periods in part 3 are acceptable with the amendments that the government accepted when the bill was last debated in the Senate. The opposition supports the inquiry announced by the government into the pre-existing ailment rule. This is a positive response to the anomalies in that rule that were raised by Senators Margetts and Harradine.
The opposition has supported the amendments in part 4 in relation to coverage of pharmaceutical gap payments. In the debate we made a series of points on how such a scheme needs to be confined to avoid rorting if large quantities of pharmaceuticals are prescribed whilst the person is in hospital and the person is then taken home. This proposal is limited to situations where the medicines are provided on a policy providing for no gaps. There should not be an extension of the provision to allow any wider coverage being given to pharmaceutical gap payments. It is understood that it is the government's intention to maintain this limit and that the problem of misuse will be dealt with by regulations. We also welcome the deletion of 
 schedule 3, which dealt with deregulation of private health insurance premiums, and part 6, which provided for a poorly thought through scheme to allow specialists to cover gap payments through private health insurance if they entered into contracts with health funds.
In summary, the opposition will be voting for the motion not to press the request and to reconsider the bill. We will be voting for parts 1 to 4 standing as part of the bill; we will be voting against part 5 standing as part of the bill; and we will be voting to substitute a new schedule 2, which I think the government will move, to replace the existing schedule 2.
—The first question is that the motion moved by Senator Heffernan be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—The question now is that part 5 of schedule 1 stand as printed.
Question resolved in the negative.
Amendment (by Senator Patterson) agreed to:
(2)	 Schedule 2, page 15 (line 3) to page 18 (line 6), omit the Schedule, substitute:
Schedule 2—Amendment of the National Health Act 1953 related to the amendments made by Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 1

	 Insert:
5AB Changes in the instruments of a registered organization relating to rates of contribution

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-03-30,"—I have put myself forward for membership of the Select Committee on Information Technologies and for this ballot because I bring to that committee a very necessary added even hand and open mind.
Mr Acting Deputy President, as you will know from the debate a couple of days ago, the terms of reference of the committee have caused some concern to the Greens and indeed the Democrats. But I bring balance, I believe, to the narrowness of the specific terms in paragraph (c) of the committee's terms of reference. As you know, this committee is a re-established one. It sat before and has looked at a wide range of issues regarding information technology.
The committee has been set up again to further the work of previous committees in evaluating the development of self-regulatory codes in the information industries and to monitor the personal, social and economic impact of continuing technological change created by industries and services utilising information technologies. The committee is to inquire into and report on other matters referred to it by the Senate. That, I believe, is a very important purpose.
We have a need in Australia, with the onrush of information technology, to put a priority on such things as the need for all homes to have access to information technology. We must ensure that all students, indeed all schools, are well serviced by information technology. This is a critical matter because we know that many homes and schools in Australia do not have such access.
We also need to look at the impact of this technology on the community at large. Many 
 people feel left out. They feel bewildered by modern information technology. Many Australians are disadvantaged. I would add that the disadvantage in information technology runs fairly roughly along the lines of those who are already poor and those who are already in minority groups—for example, groups for whom English is not their first language.
I will bring an open mind to this committee. In particular, I will be keen to see that the specific term of reference which has led to the establishment of this committee is kept in place. I refer to paragraph (c), which follows upon Senator Alston's announcement of the government's move to establish through, amongst other things, legislation coming before the parliament a means of restricting—without going into the technological terms—what can be shown and purveyed on the Internet, especially matters that encompass pornography.
There is a widespread feeling in the community that this committee is being established to clamp down on what Australians might see, hear or turn to on the Internet. Let me state at this point for the Senate's deliberation that I have concerns that, in particular, gratuitous violence ought to be kept in check. I am totally opposed to any form of entertainment or other transmission which involves the abuse of any person and the infringements of their rights and wellbeing. That said, I am not in the business of following—
—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I think you should draw the honourable senator's attention to the relevant standing order. I understand that his remarks should be related to why he should be elected, rather than how the committee should operate.
—I do not uphold the point of order.
—I will not speak for much longer because I know there is some anxiety to have a vote before too long. I refer to the make-up of the committee as it stands. It is a committee of eight. There are already four government appointees. There will be two from the Labor Party and a Democrat. 
 That leaves the vital eighth position to either Senator Harradine, as nominated, or myself.
I do not want to speak for Senator Harradine on this, but I think few would argue that he is very much closer to Senator Alston and Mr Howard's point of view—that is, the government's point of view—on regulation of the Internet than I am. Therefore, it would seem, on the face of it, a very good thing to help balance the weight of this committee—not to lead to further imbalance. Already half the committee members represent the government. If Senator Harradine were elected rather than me, it would be five-three. I think the committee would lose an open mind, an inquiring mind, but a very necessary balance to the more narrow viewpoint of Senator Alston and the government appointees. On that ground, it would be judicious of the Senate to put a Green onto this committee.
There is another added ground. Both Senator Harradine and I come from Tasmania and will represent various components of the Tasmania community, but I also have a wide access through the Greens to with the whole of the Australian community. We are a vigorous, forward looking, fresh entity in politics. We are particularly concerned and open about the impact of information technology not just on this generation but on future generations. The words of Ralph Nader, the great consumer advocate who came to Launceston in 1980 during the Franklin Dam debate, are ringing in my ears. He said, `Information is the currency of democracy.' In so far as we trammel information, we trammel democracy. It is very important that we do not stray into unnecessary censoriousness or any close-down of point of view with one citizen putting his or her viewpoint across those of other citizens to censor what they may see, hear, listen to or indeed disseminate.
I am not a regular visitor to the Prime Minister's office. I am not negotiating with, nor will I be indebted to, Senator Alston or to anybody else in the government. Moreover, I have declared my hand on both the sale of more of Telstra and on the GST package. So the government has no tradeable entity with me. I ask the Senate to consider that seriously 
 in this important vote and ensure that Green representation is the outcome.
The bells having been rung—
—The Senate will now proceed to a ballot. I would ask that all senators sit in their allocated places for the conduct of the ballot. There are two nominations for the one available position. The candidates for the position are Senator Brown and Senator Harradine. Ballot papers will be distributed to honourable senators who are requested to vote for one candidate by striking out the name of the candidate they do not wish to vote for.
The ballot papers having been distributed—
—Has every senator received a ballot paper? The Clerks will now collect the ballot papers. I invite Senator Calvert and Senator O'Brien to act as scrutineers.
The ballot having been taken—
—The result of the ballot is as follows: Senator Bob Brown, 17 votes; Senator Harradine, 48 votes. Senator Harradine is therefore elected as the member of the Select Committee on Information Technologies nominated by an Independent or a Green senator.
—I presume the ballot papers are to be destroyed, are they?
—The ballot papers are retained as part of the record of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Information Technologies Committee</title>,Committees,19,1,speech

Moreover, I have declared my hand on both the sale of more of Telstra and on the GST package. So the government has no tradeable entity with me. I ask the Senate to consider that seriously 
 in this important vote and ensure that Green representation is the outcome.
The bells having been rung—
—The Senate will now proceed to a ballot. I would ask that all senators sit in their allocated places for the conduct of the ballot. There are two nominations for the one available position. The candidates for the position are Senator Brown and Senator Harradine. Ballot papers will be distributed to honourable senators who are requested to vote for one candidate by striking out the name of the candidate they do not wish to vote for.
The ballot papers having been distributed—
—Has every senator received a ballot paper? The Clerks will now collect the ballot papers. I invite Senator Calvert and Senator O'Brien to act as scrutineers.
The ballot having been taken—
—The result of the ballot is as follows: Senator Bob Brown, 17 votes; Senator Harradine, 48 votes. Senator Harradine is therefore elected as the member of the Select Committee on Information Technologies nominated by an Independent or a Green senator.
—I presume the ballot papers are to be destroyed, are they?
—The ballot papers are retained as part of the record of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Membership</title>,Committees,19,2,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-30,"—I seek leave to withdraw government amendment No. 15 and substitute it with a new amendment No. 15.
Leave granted.
—I move new government amendment No. 15:
(15)	 Schedule 2, item 8, page 19 (lines 7 to 12), omit subsection (5GC), substitute:
	 (5GC)	 The employer must give the employee 2 copies of the form completed under subsection (5GA) no later than 14 July in the calendar year after the calendar year in which the employee ceased to be employed by the employer.
		 Note:	 For employees described in subsection (5GA), the maximum time between the employee ceasing to be employed by the employer and the employer giving the employee copies of the group certificate will be no longer than 15 months and 2 weeks.
Amendment No. 14 and new amendment No. 15 remove the requirement for employers to issue group certificates earlier than the end of the financial year in cases where the employee will have a fringe benefits amount shown on their group certificate. The existing provision, subsection 221F(5CA) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, allows employees to request an early group certificate if they cease to be employed. Amendment No. 14 removes the requirement for employers to issue an early group certificate where the employee will have a fringe benefits amount shown on their group certificate.
Item 8 of schedule 2 of the bill provides for an additional group certificate to be issued to an employee who leaves employment between 1 April and 30 June where the employee has a reportable fringe benefits amount on or after 1 April. The need for this additional group certificate arises because of the non-alignment of the FBT and income tax years.
Item 8 also includes a provision to allow employees to request an early group certificate if they cease to be employed. In line with amendment No. 14, the new amendment No. 15 removes from item 8 the requirement for an employer to issue an early group certifi 
 cate. Of course, neither of these amendments prevents an employer providing an early group certificate to an employee who has ceased to be employed where the employer is able to calculate the reportable fringe benefits amount. In addition, employees who cease to be employed and who do not receive any fringe benefits, or who receive fringe benefits with a total taxable value of less than $1,000, continue to be able to request an early group certificate.
The amendments have the effect that, for a very small number of employees, the maximum time between the employee ceasing to be employed by the employer and the employer giving the employee copies of the group certificate will be no longer than 15 months and two weeks. Not having the amendments would subject employers to more complex and expensive record keeping systems just to calculate an employee's reportable fringe benefits amount partway through a year.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech

"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-03-30,"—by leave—We are just sorting out a few matters here right now. As I understand it, these particular bills are not on the red. I wonder if I could be advised as to what exactly is the issue at stake here. I understand that it is the Senate appropriation and that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate told us that in fact it was the fourth item that he moved we go to. I do not have that at all here on the red. As a consequence of that, it is pretty difficult for us over here to deal with this particular matter. In the spirit of cooperation, I wonder if we could be told a little more about this in case there are in fact some speakers.
—I will seek leave to make a statement.
—I would be very happy with that, thank you.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-30,"—by 
 leave—I appreciate the assistance of the opposition deputy whip on this matter because the alternative quite often for the Senate when they get to these impasses in programs, when things actually start moving more quickly than people expect, is that people call a quorum to see if a speaker comes down, and that disrupts a lot of senators who are otherwise working in their offices.
I think the next item on the red as I saw it today was to be the regional forest agreements legislation. It is obviously an issue of genuinely great importance to a lot of senators, but there is a speakers list of something like 18 people. So the government made a decision earlier today that it would be better in the very limited time available to us prior to Easter—we only have a Wednesday sitting day before us and only a few minutes of Senate time left to us tonight; we also have a couple of contentious disallowance of regulation debates to be conducted tomorrow, one to be moved by Senator Bolkus and one by Senator Bartlett, and both of those could take some time—to move to the consideration of some bills that could be dealt with and completed prior to the luncheon matters of public interest debate tomorrow.
It was quite clear from the speakers list that, in the time available between now and the Easter adjournment, the regional forest agreements legislation would get only a part of the way through the second reading, whereas dealing with something like the appropriation bills could actually see that matter brought to a conclusion. We did inform parties of the decision some time ago, and I think we already have a speakers list for the appropriation bills. I am not sure whether there is an opposition speaker or a Democrat speaker. I think there has been an amendment distributed in the name of the opposition.
—I will be seeking the call.
—You are ready to speak in this debate?
—Yes.
—So I hope that explanation is of assistance to the deputy whip and members opposite. That was the reason—we moved a little quicker. The 
 Senate sometimes does that. I do appreciate dealing with it in this way instead of calling a quorum; it is a big help.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No. 2) 1998-99</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-03-30,"—by leave—My statement is actually in the form of a question, and it relates to the comments of the parliamentary secretary a moment ago that this change had been brought about in part as a result of the extensive time that might be required for the second reading speeches at least on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998, let alone the committee stage. From that, do I take it that it is not the government's intention to seek to bring on that bill for debate at all before we rise tomorrow night?

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-03-30,"—by leave—What I said earlier is the full explanation of what we are doing. Quite clearly, with the limited time available between now and 12.45 p.m. on Wednesday we would make little progress through an extensive second reading list and we would not be able to finalise that bill. What we thought we would do is get something like the appropriation bills dealt with—which do need to be dealt with before the budget.
Certainly, if there is time available after these bills then we could make a start on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill debate. It is very high on the government's list of priority bills. We want to see the Regional Forest Agreements Bill dealt with as quickly as we can. There are a number of bills that we have identified that need to be dealt with before the end of the financial year and we will be seeking to deal with not only the Telstra bill and all the bills associated with the new tax system but also bills like the RFA and a number of others. So we have a heavy program.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-30,"—The Senate is debating 
 the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1998-99  and associated bills. I draw the attention of the Senate to an amendment to the motion for the second reading to be moved by Senator Faulkner which is to add at the end of the motion the words, `But the Senate is of the view that the $19.433 million spent on the community education and information program on the tax system is an improper use of public money.'
I want to address that issue and some of the other issues that have arisen as a consequence of the government's ANTS package—or in shorthand terminology, the GST legislation—coming before this Senate chamber. On the weekend I saw a news report of the Prime Minister at, I think, a Liberal Party function in Melbourne. He had once again thumped the lectern and told his assembled audience of true believers that as far as he was concerned he was not going to put up with any Senate delay and that he was going to confront the Senate about dragging out any debate on the GST legislation. He claimed a government mandate to proceed.
To that proposition I say: the Senate is not delaying. Those remarks by the Prime Minister were so much hot air in terms of public positioning of expectations—expectations, I believe, that are aimed at casting a wrong impression of what the Senate is up to. Let us resort to the facts to defend what I have just said. The decision to hold an inquiry into the government's GST legislation was a decision arrived at in this chamber, but it had its genesis in an agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats with some input, I understand, from Senator Harradine. Only after the die was cast between those players were the Labor Party brought into the story. We proposed some modifications. We were not successful in doing that and, at the end of the day, voted for the inquiry.
The important first fact deduced from the foregoing is that the initiative arose from a joint government and Australian Democrat desire to hold an inquiry in whatever form. Irrespective of the reluctance with which the government were dragged to such a decision, the truth is that they were part of it. For the 
 Prime Minister to say the Senate is dragging the chain is to deny the historic circumstances of how the inquiry arose at all.
The second salient feature of all this is that the inquiry overall was to report by the 19th of next month. It was constituted just before Christmas; it has 16 bills of legislation to examine, all involving complex legal matters concerning taxation law, and it has a range of other bills—12 or so, I think—that have since been put on the table in the Senate. Overall, the number of bills constituting this package adds up to 28. The Senate would be derelict, in my submission, in its duty if it did not proceed to examine the devil that is in the detail of such a vast number of bills introducing such sweeping changes to the tax act. The Senate inquiry mechanism has enabled the Senate for the first time to listen to the voice of the Australian community.
What we saw before the last election was a declaration by the Prime Minister that he would embark on a great new tax adventure for Australia—an adventure of his making. We saw, in secret, the preparation by the Department of the Treasury of the contents of that package. We heard, just before the Prime Minister rang the bell and said that the election was on, the content that he was proposing to the electorate. We saw then a government advertising campaign, referred to in the motion from Senator Faulkner and costing the Australian taxpayer $19.433 million, explaining to the Australian electorate or educating them on—to use the euphemistic terms employed by the government—the contents of the government's tax package. One can be cynical, but the truth about that expenditure of public moneys is that it was to put down, advertise and put in every letterbox in Australia a document which was, at the end of the day, nothing more than government propaganda on the central plank of the election campaign it called forthwith. There was no attempt to have a public debate about tax reform in Australia.
To label what the government has done—introduce a comprehensive set of bills changing the tax law—as `reform' obviously flies in the face of the proper use of that word. It is not reform; it is tax change. Whether you 
 think it is reform depends on your standpoint. Do you support the government? Do you support the welfare sector? Do you support any number of organisations that have argued in the Senate hearings against the changes? Or do you support the view of the Labor Party or the Australian Democrats in terms of calling for the massive change or the defeat of this legislation? The government cannot call it reform. Reform is not a matter of fact; it is a matter of opinion. Nonetheless, we have had shoved down our throats in the public debate that this is reform. Reform backed by a cheque for $19.433 million signed by the Australian taxpayer is indeed a piece of propaganda that kicked off the election campaign.
In the election campaign, what was the outcome? Of course, the government was returned. In terms of votes, Labor got close to 52 per cent of the total votes cast and the government got close to 48 per cent of the total votes cast. If this were a referendum on a GST, Labor would have defeated the government, because the government did not get a majority of votes in a majority of states. So, if it were a referendum, the government would not have had a mandate. Whether or not all those people who voted for either party voted solely on this matter is a matter for subjective assessment. I cannot say that it is true that they did, but there is no doubt that this was the centrepiece of the election campaign. So, to the question of whether or not the tax package is fairly before us with a mandate, I say it is not and that this Senate chamber, which has to deal with the legislation, ought not approach it as if there were a cast-iron, watertight mandate for the government. If there is delay, the delay is in the government agreeing to the inquiry before it consulted us, in the face of whatever our views were. So it is not right for the Prime Minister to make the public allegation about Senate delay that he has made, but I do expect that we will hear a lot more of that sort of thing before the Senate settles down and considers this legislation.
I want to canvass fairly briefly but in short summary to give an overview of the sort of evidence that has come before the Senate 
 committee that I have chaired, the Senate select committee into this legislation. Of course, the full report of this committee will come down on 19 April and comprehensively express the views of the various participants in the inquiry. I do not speak for anyone other than myself and I do not speak in completion of a full consideration of all the evidence, because key evidence is yet to be educed. Some of that key evidence, which I think will be fundamental and on which will turn a lot of judgments in the Australian community, is evidence from work commissioned by the Senate inquiry into the distributional effects of the GST; in other words, let us look at how the government package affects middle and low income earners, not according to the way the government put it out in the package, financed by this $19.433 million election campaign, but rather how independent modelling, taking the most reasonable assumptions, values the government package. We can see then whether or not the assertions made to the electorate before the election are held to be true under independent scrutiny and analysis. But that is yet to come, and I do not know what that survey will find. I do expect, though, that it will not be comfortable for the government. That is a view of mine which may or may not be borne out.
The evidence given to our inquiry which I think ought to be the first stop for any analysis up to this stage of the inquiry is that given by the Taxation Institute of Australia. The Taxation Institute of Australia is a body which consists of professional experts in taxation. It is not a political body; it owes no political allegiance anywhere. It actually concentrates on being professional and expert in assessing the implications of tax law. Its membership is made up of people who have got the necessary qualifications to be taxation advisers, accountants and experts in helping in the preparation of taxation returns and understanding the implications of tax law.
They do not in their evidence express a view one way or another about the legislation the government proposes. They shrink from doing that lest their opinion be used in political debate. They prefer to be experts, saying, `If that is what the community has decided 
 then we will comment on whether the translation of that intent into legislation effectively and adequately succeeds in delivering what was meant in the first place.' That is, they are experts on technicality and they are experts on the detail. They do not make value judgments on what motivates the legislation, they look at its effectiveness.
What evidence did they give to our hearing? They gave this evidence. They said that there is so much devil in the detail of this legislation that if you supported the government's view then you would in fact defer the operative date of this legislation by between six and 12 months so that there could be a proper assessment of sorting this sort of detail out, and make sure that the government's intentions as enunciated were in fact properly translated into legislation to come before the parliament. They believe there is considerable devil in the detail. They believe that the bills that we will have to consider are not what the government intended and would introduce a whole range of complexity, a whole range of costs and a whole range of interpretative difficulty in working out what the true meaning is, if they were to come forward in their present form.
They are still in the process of going through this and articulating carefully and professionally what that detail is. They do expect to be in conference with the government to explain their views and they do expect, as they said in evidence before us, that there will be a number of substantive amendments to the government legislation as well. We cannot inquire into what those amendments will be, because they are likely to arise after we have reported. But the bills before us, on their evidence at least, are going to be changed and changed in ways that at this stage we do not know about, and that is an important consideration. But the fundamental point I want to educe from all the above is that the expert body in this nation that comments on these things regards the legislation as flawed, and flawed in a manner that would require any earnest advocate of it to delay until those changes were made and the legislation was sorted out. That is the first and I think most important piece of evidence 
 given to us by the Taxation Institute—as I was saying, an expert body.
The next piece of evidence that I would like to refer to is that given by the Insurance Council of Australia. The Insurance Council of Australia is an industry body consisting of insurance companies and brokers in Australia. The council simply represent their point of view. They in fact said on the record that they support the intent of the government in its legislation, so they are favourable to the government about this legislation. But they identified a cost to their industry of $2.5 billion if the legislation were to go ahead in its present form. That $2.5 billion is not a trifling amount, I would submit; $2.5 billion is a rather large figure. In their view, the legislation would impose that cost on them if the government did not heed the transitional arrangements that were necessary to protect the insurance industry from that sort of cost.
They said that in their view it was not intended by the government that this level of cost be imposed and that they had argued to the government that level of cost should be removed. At the point of giving evidence and since—because they are under an obligation to notify us if the facts change—the government had not notified them as to whether it would accept their view. If the $2.5 billion had to be met by the insurance industry, would they meet it by rifling their profit and taking it out of that? Would they meet it by cutting down their costs and sacking workers? Would they meet it by passing on that cost to their policy holders or their consumers? Would they meet it by any one of the combination of all of the above? We asked them that question. They said that they would meet it by passing on the costs to their policy holders. That is to say, those people who have insurance in Australia would face an extra cost because of the transitional costs of this legislation to that industry—$2.5 billion all up.
The government has made much of what I think is a quite fraudulent argument, and this is a way of demonstrating how fraudulent it is. The government has campaigned up and down this country, saying, `These are the tax cuts that we offer Australians and, if you vote 
 for our package, you will get these tax cuts.' They have quoted the flamboyant figures set out in their ANTS report—as part of the tables for families ranging from single income earners on low incomes up to families on high incomes with multiple dependants—and they have identified what people at each level would get. Of course the government propaganda concentrates on what middle Australia would get, because middle Australia is the voting population that has been targeted for the government as the swing vote in this issue.
What the government keeps quoting to Australians on the package of tax cuts is the gross figure of tax cuts; that is, the figure that they will pay you if they pass their legislation. But I emphasise the word `gross'. Everyone in Australia knows the difference between gross income and net income—income before tax and after tax. When you start going around and looking at the submissions we have received, time after time industry groups which support the government's intentions have raised objections to the way in which they are done, transitional difficulties, difficulties about compliance or difficulties about special areas of their industry that have pointed to extra costs—and one of the biggest areas where that has arisen has been in local government.
Every time extra costs have been pointed to, government members of our committee have said that in the case of those extra costs there is the compensation package and there are the tax cuts, and very soon you begin to realise that the gross figures—proselytised around this country as what people would get if this package went through—get degraded at every turn with extra hidden costs.
I have not done the sums yet but I promise this chamber I will before the debate comes on. But the overwhelming impression one now gains, given what else we have not been told about what the package will have to meet, is that the tax cuts at gross level, when reduced by the amount of extra and hidden costs that will have to be paid, are nowhere near substantial and are probably in most 
 cases in the negative for most Australians. In other words, give with one hand, take with the other; the net outcome—what is the real gain—is  in fact a real loss.
As I said, I have not done the sums but I promise the chamber I will do them before we get to the debate on this. But I stand by my remarks that, as for the overwhelming impression—taking the business, local government and other objections raised to this package on the basis that they have been given to us—that is the outcome. So next time any Australian hears from a government spokesperson what is the value of the tax cuts, remember: that is what they are giving you up-front, but what they are taking away behind the scenes is another thing entirely and you will probably end up in the negative.
The worst example of this blatant misrepresentation occurred last month when on the front page of the Sydney Telegraph newspaper there was a photograph of Senator Harradine and Senator Margetts with the newspaper saying, `These people are denying you these tax cuts.' What a fraudulent argument. What an absolutely despicable—
