Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (09:31):  The Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017 moves away from the fundamental objective that Labor enshrined in the legislation:


All students in all schools are entitled to an excellent education, allowing each student to reach his or her full potential so that he or she can succeed, achieve his or her aspirations, and contribute fully to his or her community, now and in the future.


Labor opposes both the principles and the practical effect of this legislation, which has continued to unravel every day that it has been subject to public scrutiny. The bill is fundamentally unfair to Australian children, and, consequently, I move:


Omit all words after ""That"", substitute ""the Senate notes that the bill:


(a) would result in a $22.3 billion cut from Australian schools, compared with the existing arrangements;


(b) removes extra funding agreed with states and territories for 2018 and 2019, which would have brought under-resourced schools to their fair funding level;


(c) locks in sector-specific payments of 80% Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) for non-government schools and just 20% for government schools, the very opposite of a sector blind model;


(d) sees the Commonwealth Government abandon all responsibility for ensuring that Australian students reach, at a minimum, 95% of the SRS;


(e) reduces funding to some wealthy overfunded schools, which Labor supports – however, it also increases funding for other overfunded schools, while cutting funding to some of our most vulnerable school students;


(f) would particularly hurt public schools, which receive less than 50% of funding under the Government’s proposal, compared to 80% of extra funding in Labor’s school funding plan; and


(g) results in only one-in-seven public schools reaching their fair funding level after 10 years"".


Let me repeat that point (f), because that is the point that seems to be lost when commentators suggest that the NERA, the National Education Reform Agreement, is dead. What the act and that agreement delivered was 80 per cent of extra funding for public schools, which this proposal brings down to just 50 per cent. I had prepared a traditional opposition second reading speech to present when we commenced consideration of this bill. But, I have to say, where we are now and where we are today is a complete and utter farce. Reading the commentary, reading the media, listening to the minister's statements leaves the opposition in the position now that there is simply no point in reflecting on the substantive provisions in the bill, because we do not know what this bill will turn into. The government has not been clear about what it is we are dealing with here now. Today, in the situation where we are in now, as the government engages in further negotiations, possibly with senators who are not fully appraised of the impact of the proposals that the government is putting to them, is just a short part, a small part of that picture.


So let me revisit the week before the budget, when the government first put these proposals into the public realm. Actually, let me take one step further back from there. Let me take you back to the ministerial council meeting ahead of that. This minister turned up to the ministers' council and suggested to them, on the basis of two case studies, that he needed to engage in what I would call a radical market experiment. That is what this government is doing in moving away from the core principle of the Gonski report. Senators might recall that I mentioned that core principle when I quoted a speech from David Gonski yesterday but let me remind you again today. This was the speech of David Gonski on 21 May 2014. He said:


Lost in the discussion for more money were the central tenets of our review. We advocated:


A. Funding to be unified i.e. given by state and federal governments to the different sectors together rather than states substantially only funding their school system and the bulk of Commonwealth funding being as a consequence paid to independent and faith-based schools. 


Embedded in this bill at 80 per cent. This was David Gonski's review's central—capital A—tenet, and this is what this bill moves away from. As I have said in my proposed second reading amendment, the consequences of that, the impact of that, is that what was planned to be 80 per cent of additional funding going to public schools will now—and remember it is less additional funding—be only 50 per cent of additional funding going to public schools.


But let me remind the Senate where we were before the Abbott government failed to proceed with the Gonski reform agenda. We had a consensus. We had public education—non-government education; both Catholic and independent, together. We had settled the school funding wars. But what has happened here now is those wars have indeed been reignited. I am described as a 'veteran' senator; I have been around here for more than 20 years, but I have never seen some of the sectarian debate that has occurred. I will get to what happened in the committee inquiry in a moment, but I have never seen something like yesterday's point of order during Committee of the Whole, talking about senators being ghosts of the DLP. As I said at the time, the DLP, which would have been relevant to my political participation concluded in 1978; I was 16 years of age. I was not a member of the DLP; I have member never been a member of the DLP. The only political party I have ever been a member of is the Australian Labor Party.




Senator Fifield:
  Did you hand out for them?




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I do not see how that is relevant, Senator.



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Here we go again! We are continuing it. Senator Fifield, I do not think you understand what this minister has unleashed. For you to suggest that what any senator here now might have done as a young child is at all relevant is appalling, and you are continuing the appalling behaviour which I will come to with Senator McKenzie soon.




Senator Fifield:
  I just thought it was funny.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  You might think it is funny, but sectarianism is not very funny. Let's move on to the important issue here, which is what a farce—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Collins. Senator Fifield?




Senator Fifield:
  On a point of order, Madam Deputy President: Senator Collins is misrepresenting my interjection. It was a lighthearted reference to whether she had, as a child—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  It is on the record.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Fifield, that is a debating point. Senator Collins.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Senator Fifield will have his opportunity in this debate. It is unfortunate that he did not take his opportunity in the cabinet. That is the problem. That we are now in this farce is the problem.


I was talking about the settlement that had been achieved during the Gonski 1.0 process, which was seriously damaged by the Abbott government's refusal to move beyond the four years of the six-year transition plan—the six-year transition plan that would have got most schools, in partnership with the states and territories, to a common student-resourcing standard. Mr Turnbull and Senator Birmingham have come in here with the glossy rhetoric that they are on the same path, and that is simply untrue. What Senator Birmingham has done is take what was a combined funding approach and turn it into a Commonwealth-share-only approach, which will never achieve the outcome that is needed here. It will never achieve the standard, the resources, for Australian schools that is required.


Senator Birmingham, Senator Brandis and others have verballed various of the players in this debate, but the best example of where we are today, which I saw in this morning's press in an opinion piece in the Australian newspaper, is that by Peter Goss, who basically at one stage says: we have got to accept that the National Education Reform Agreement is dead, but the Senate should seriously fiddle with Gonski 2.0 and add a national education reform agreement. So he is saying on the one hand that we have to get over the fact that this government killed the National Education Reform Agreement—and he tries to make comparisons solely on the act itself and suggests that our only option is the act as it currently stands and this bill—but then says, 'Oh, but we should go back to a national education reform agreement.' Of course we should! And that is where it should have stayed. 


This government criticised Labor for funding over the four years of the forward estimates, and it has been new to some senators in this debate to understand that states and territories do not have four-year forward estimates and it is a very difficult process to make states commit to ongoing funding over the forward years. This has been new information to many senators considering this debate. But look at this government's hypocrisy with this plan: 10 years, with only four years funded over the forwards. When you think about the rhetoric that was put on Labor about our four-year forward estimates of our six-year plan, you only need to reflect on this plan to see what hypocrisy that was.


So even if this government brings their plan—as has, again, been canvassed by commentators—down to eight years, or to seven or six years, it will still be four to six years too late; it will still be less funding that should be available; and there will be no commitment from states and territories to make their contributions. Let me remind people who are listening to this debate: for the contribution that was achieved with the states who became participating states and the other states that the government failed to bring into the package—the Abbott government failed to bring states who had agreed into the package—the offer there was two Commonwealth dollars for one state dollar. That is not on the table. How on earth does this government propose that we are going to bring the states into this arrangement? We do not know, and all that they say is, 'Um—we've deferred that till COAG next year.' What a farce!


The other element of this farce is the process farce, of course. The Senate inquiry: now, I accept the will of the Senate. Labor argued that we needed more time to address these matters in detail, and I thank senators for supporting my order for production of documents. To me, that does reflect that senators do now understand that there has not been adequate information and that there has not been proper consideration of the detail.


But, of course, another element of that Senate inquiry was the farce about how it was conducted. Firstly, and back to my point about sectarianism, for me to be accused on Twitter by the chair as running a protection racket for private schools which was eventually, after the hearing, finally withdrawn, is a joke. But add to that joke that the chair thinks that she can walk and chew gum at the same time. To me that is quite unethical chairing.


The other part of the joke, I think, was best represented by Crikey.com—not usually a friend of mine—which suggested that Senator McKenzie and Senator Hanson-Young were operating a tag team against me defending Catholic education. Since when does the Australian National Party form a tag team with the Greens to try to deny the Senate an opportunity to explore the details of a bill before it? This is, Senator Fifield, the sectarianism that I am referring to.


There has been a range of other commentary that is better not revisited. The point here is that these wars had been settled back in 2013, and should have been left that way. This government is not settling the education wars: it has reignited them! As I said, when we have a clearer picture of what the provisions in this bill are we will deal with those in detail during the committee stage. But until such time as we understand what this bill is going to contain there really is no point in commentating further, other than to ask senators to reflect on their position on these issues in the past.


In closing at this stage, I will ask Senator McKenzie to refer back to a press release she made on 13 March 2013, where she said:


Results show that the Federal Labor Government’s fundng model, which is supposed to address inequity, will result in 25 per cent of the lowest SES Catholic schools losing funding.


Senator McKenzie, that is actually today.


But then, for all these stories about scaremongering, let me remind Senator McKenzie of this one, again, from her press release:


Under the Gonski recommendations, the average fees for Catholic Schools could rise between 200 - 300 per cent.


And yet she and other members of the coalition attack Catholic education for highlighting what the changes in this bill do to assumptions around what level of fees, low-fee—particularly Catholic primary school—parents would need to pay. That is the example of the farce occurring here.


Government senators, other than a few, are being incredibly hypocritical. Senator Fifield and his colleagues should get their act together in cabinet and fix this!

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-06-21,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (09:50):  The Australian Greens have been abundantly clear all the way through this debate, since we saw the government's legislation, that we do not support the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017 in its current form. We have given effect to that by voting against it in the House of Representatives when the member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, as a representative of our united party room on this issue voted against the legislation.


I am going to speak at some length in my speech about the principles with which the Australian Greens are approaching this issue, but before I do I want to briefly respond to some of the comments made by Senator Collins, who just resumed her seat. Firstly, she is claiming that Labor, when in government, 'settled the school funding wars'. I have rarely heard a piece of spin that bears so little relationship with reality.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Tasmania signed on when you were in cabinet!




Senator McKIM:
  I will take that interjection because I was actually the Minister for Education and Skills in Tasmania at the time.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I know, and you signed on!




Senator McKIM:
  We did sign on.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Thank you!




Senator McKIM:
  That is right. Exactly. But what that does is give me an almost unique position in this chamber to know exactly what was going on at the time. I am going to tell you now, Senator Collins, what went on at the time. What went on at the time was that David Gonski, in his landmark, groundbreaking report, recommended a range of things, including a sector-blind, needs-based funding model. What Labor delivered was about as far away as you could get from a sector-blind, needs-based funding model. There were agreements with different sectors, different jurisdictions and different states and territories. Obviously, the one I was part of negotiating on Tasmania's behalf at the time was one of those. I have not actually counted those agreements, but there were a lot of them. The government is saying there were 27.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Twenty-seven!




Senator McKIM:
  I think Senator Collins, by interjection, has just agreed with that. That sounds about right.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  No, that is what they are saying.




Senator McKIM:
  It sounds about right: 27 separate agreements that were negotiated bilaterally.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You haven't fallen for this line, have you, Nick?




Senator McKIM:
  Senator Collins, I am going to continue here and I will not be shouted down by you.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! I just remind senators to make their comments to the chair. I remind other senators that it is disorderly to continue to interrupt.




Senator McKIM:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I will not be shouted down by Senator Collins here because I am going to place on the record what happened. There were 27 separate deals across sectors and across jurisdictions. They were negotiated bilaterally and no-one got to find out what any of the negotiations were with any of the other sectors in the education system in Australia or with any other of the states and territories. What we ended up with I think would be accurate to describe as a mishmash of different agreements where some sectors won and some did not travel so well, and where some states and territories had outcomes that they were happy with and some states and territories had outcomes they were not happy with.


Of course, during this process and ultimately before that process had finished, Labor called a federal election. I will remember the day they called that federal election because there were still negotiations ongoing and at least some states and territories ultimately did not finally and formally conclude their negotiations. That is what Labor left us with. History shows that the government changed and the Liberal government came into power.


That was a long time ago. I have to say that the current government—the Liberal-National government—in this country have been derelict in their responsibilities on education since then. This has dragged out in terms of the government arriving at a position for far too long. Now, typically, when they have arrived at a position they want to bring this bill on for debate here today to put pressure on this Senate to pass it. Ultimately, I want to say that the government's tactic of bringing this bill on today to commence the debate is a tactic clearly designed to place pressure on this chamber.


I also want to say that the government has been derelict in its duties in regard to the way that it has negotiated with the Australian Education Union—or, should I say, failed utterly not only to negotiate but even to respectfully communicate with the Australian Education Union. When I was minister in Tasmania, I had a face-to-face meeting with the president of the Tasmanian branch of the AEU once a month. I would sit down face to face with them, and we would talk about a range of issues that existed from both sides of the table. I am very confident to say that I had a very good relationship with the AEU in Tasmania, because of course the Greens view education principally as a public good. We also believe that federal funding into Australia's school system, whatever the sector, needs to be done on the basis of need and equity to ensure that all Australian children have the opportunity to fulfil their best educational opportunities.


Before I leave the subject of the Labor Party—and this was raised by Senator Collins herself in her speech where she swallowed the grenade and denied that we were seeing a return of the DLP in this place—I have sat for two question times in here this week, and Labor has asked question after question after question on behalf of the Catholic education system in this country and not one question on public schools from the Labor Party.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  A point of order.




Senator McKIM:
  The DLP is back. Do not worry about that.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, resume your seat, please.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  The senator is misleading the Senate. That is simply not true.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is a debating point, thank you, Senator Collins.




Senator McKIM:
  We have all sat here and listened to question after question after question asked on behalf of the Catholic education system in this country. Labor will go out to the Australian people and claim to be champions of the public education system. But the true champions of the public education system in this place are the Australian Greens. Every time, we will attempt to do what is in the best interests of the public education system in Australia, because the people that we care about in the context of education debates are students in the public education system. We have been very clear about that. Our track record speaks for itself. If you look at the 27 different deals that Labor stitched up when they were last in government—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  That is what the AEU want.




Senator McKIM:
  a reasonable interpretation—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You can't even represent them properly.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator McKIM:
  Senator Collins, I will not be shouted down by you. I will not be shouted down by you, Senator Collins—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator McKIM:
  I simply will not be. Once Senator Collins is able to control herself, Deputy President, I will be happy to continue. All right. Thank you.


As I was saying about the 27 separate and disparate agreements stitched up by Labor when they were last in government, in no reasonable assessment can it be claimed that those 27 agreements—as Senator Collins is claiming—'settled the school-funding wars'. Any reasonable person watching the question times that we have had in the Senate this week will understand clearly who the Labor Party are operating on behalf of in this place. Believe me, they are not operating on behalf of the public school system, students at public schools and parents who choose to send their children to public schools. They are operating on behalf of the Catholic education systems in this country. I invite anyone who may be listening or may be reading theHansardof my speech later to go and check the record. It is all on the Hansard. Labor's questions have been designed to advocate on behalf of the Catholic system and prioritising that system to a far greater degree than they did the public system.


We are approaching this matter and the discussions that we are having at the moment based on the principles that we believe in and the policies that have been developed through our membership—in fact, by our membership. Uniquely in this place we have a set of policies designed and delivered to us by our membership, and also in broad consultation with key education stakeholders. These are the principles that we are taking into our discussions and consideration on this matter. Primarily for us, education is principally a public good. We also believe very, very clearly that differences in educational outcomes should never be a result of differences in wealth, differences in income, differences in power, differences in what possessions people have or differences in where people live.


We have always believed, and always will, in the Australian Greens that universal access to high-quality education is fundamental to Australia's economic prosperity, it is fundamental to our environmental sustainability, it is fundamental to our wellbeing as a people and it is fundamental to the social fulfilment of Australians. We believe, as a principle, that everyone in this country is entitled to a free, well funded, high-quality, lifelong public education and training system. We also believe that it is a primary responsibility of government to fund all levels of the public education system to a high quality, from early childhood education through to our schools system. This includes VET—vocational education and training—and tertiary education. We believe that because, as I said, we have a view and a principle that everyone is entitled to a free, well funded, high-quality public education and training system.


It is also a key principle of the Greens that federal funding to Australia's school education system, which includes both public and non-government sectors, should be done on the basis of need and equity, to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to maximise their educational outcomes. As I said, David Gonski, when he released his landmark report, recommended a sector-blind needs-based funding model. That is not what we got from Labor at the time. It is just not. And no matter how loudly and at how much length the Labor Party try to claim that what they delivered was in line with what David Gonski recommended, no matter how loudly, no matter what spin Labor put on it, any reasonable, fair-minded person, if they have a look at what Labor delivered when they were last in government at the Commonwealth level, is going to conclude that what Labor delivered was not a sector-blind needs-based funding model.


In fact, when I was minister in Tasmania I introduced a new funding system for government schools in Tasmania—the Fairer Funding model. That was, and perhaps still is—I have not done an analysis, but at the time that was the funding model, of anywhere in Australia, that was the most faithful to David Gonski's principles. It only applied to the way we distributed money within the public school system in Tasmania, but it was a genuine needs-based funding model that allowed us, with the extra money that was flowing to Tasmania as a result of the agreement that we signed with Labor, to deliver significant school funding increases to every single public school in Tasmania. The minimum funding increase in the school resource packages of public schools in Tasmania, once we had implemented that model, was five per cent. Some schools got up to 40 per cent more money in their school resource packages—nearly half as much again as they had the previous year. I introduced, as minister, a genuine needs based funding model for distributing money amongst public schools in Tasmania, because I believe in a needs based funding model. I believe in it. I believed in it to the degree that I implemented it when I was minister in Tasmania. I still believe today that what Australia should have is what David Gonski recommended: a genuine needs based funding model. That is not what we have in this country at this time. It is just not.


Another principle that the Australian Greens have is that when decisions are made by government in the context of our education system and our school system, those decisions should be arrived at as a result of input from teachers and their representatives, from academics and experts in education, from unions representing teachers and academics, and ultimately, most importantly, through consultation with parents of children in Australia's education system, and, in fact, those students themselves.


We want to see—and this is the way we are approaching this issue—a public school system that is recognised as amongst the best in the world. There is no reason why this country cannot have a public system that is the envy of the rest of the world, but we are a long way from that. If you look at the way we have journeyed through the PISA rankings in recent times, we are heading in the wrong direction.


No-one who knows their way around education would suggest that simply by throwing funding at the school system we can achieve the outcomes that we want. The challenges are more complex than that, and there are a range of public policy measures that need to be put in place in order for us to deliver what the Greens want to see, which is a public education system in Australia that is recognised as amongst the best in the world. However—and this is important—extra funding certainly helps. It certainly helps.


One of the reasons we were not prepared to back the government's legislation in the House of Representatives, and why I am very comfortable rising here today in the Senate and saying the Greens do not support this legislation in its current form, is that the funding that was concurrent with this legislation simply was not enough. It is no secret that funding increases are one of the things that are front and centre in our minds as we work through this issue. As I said, we want to see schools' funding provided on the basis of equity and need, and we also want to see funding levels based on a transparent standard that recognises the real costs of educating students to a high level. We acknowledge and we want to see public schools being fully funded at a high level, including the full cost of addressing disadvantage. The mechanism to deliver that, of course, is the mechanism recommended by David Gonski, which recommended loadings based on specific areas of disadvantage, whether that be a location or whether that be, for example, a student with disabilities.


Our principles on this issue are abundantly clear. They are the principles that will guide us as we work through this issue in whatever time remains available to us, but Australian people can rest assured. The evidence is there from question times this week that the Australian Greens, front and centre, are the party, when you compare it with Labor, that has public education at the front of its mind. When you look at question times, as I said, the evidence of where Labor are coming from on this issue is abundantly clear. They are asking question after question about the Catholic sector in this country. The party that always champions itself as the party of public education, I am sorry to say, is morphing before our eyes. I am at a loss to understand why question after question from Labor was about the Catholic system in this country. (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:10):  I rise to make a brief contribution to this debate on the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017. We have been hearing a lot about education funding and the need to reform, for the simple reason that children around Australia, for some years now, have been funded differently, with some 27 different agreements that have been struck by the previous Gillard government with states and territories. The community has been calling for some time for a fair and transparent system that will provide an equitable funding base for students. Speaking from a South Australian perspective, the agreement that was reached in South Australia—and I have spoken to a range of school sectors there—has seen many sectors with a very flat trajectory and increases only in the very latter part of what the agreement with the Gillard government had promised. They have maintained for a number of years that South Australian schools have not been treated well, for the simple reason that the level of funding has not been on par with interstate colleagues. What this agreement looks to do is to find and define a new baseline and bring all students from all states to a common point. Over a number of years, you will get that transition of increasing funding for students.


It is important to realise that, whilst there is the independent sector, the Catholic sector and the state sector, it is not only the federal government that provides funds to these schools. There are two particular concerns that I would like to briefly address as we look at this funding. First off, for state schools, it is state and territory governments that actually provide the majority of funding to those schools. So, when people see figures that highlight what the federal government provides to the different sectors and many people ask me why it is that the state schools seem to receive so little, it is because the primary responsibility for those state schools rests with the state governments. So if you look in net terms at what the taxpayer pays, whether that is through GST given to the states who then pass it on to the schools or whether that is funding given directly from the federal government to state schools, the state system is completely, or almost completely, funded by the taxpayer, whereas private schools do not receive the same extent of funding from states, and the majority of taxpayer subsidy for them comes through federal funding, with parents—often not high-income parents—working hard to make sure that they raise the additional funding to give children the schooling of the parents' choice. For many parents, it may come down to academic issues. For some, it may come down to issues of a faith-based education. But what we see is that all parents who are taxpayers pay money through their taxes, and the state and federal governments each make a contribution. But those who choose to pay extra not only take stress off the state system but pay for the quality and type of education that their children want.


The second point I would make, particularly around this current debate, is on the funding for Catholic schools. I have received a number of emails from people in the last few days talking about the funding for Catholic education. I just remind people who are listening to this debate that it was actually the Liberal Party and the coalition government who originally championed and pushed for the ability of parents to make that choice, and we have been a consistent supporter of funding schools of various kinds so that parents can make the choice as to where their children go. Those who wish for them to go to an independent or Catholic school top that up with fees.


The Catholic school system also makes its choices about where it allocates that taxpayer funding. So, part of the confusion in this debate is twofold. One aspect is that when people see some of the computer models that forecast the amount of funding that will be provided to a school they are seeing the SES based funding, such that the demographic of that school leads to the level of funding that will be attracted. That does not necessarily equate to the funding the school receives under the Catholic system. Under the Catholic system they receive a bulk payment, if you wat to simplify the term, from the federal government, and they can then distribute that funding as they see fit within their school system. Some of the people who have contacted me have looked at what their school has been receiving through the Catholic system and then compared it with what is on the website for an estimator and saying, 'We appear to be receiving less funding.' But the way the Catholic system has always worked is that they have taken a bulk payment from the federal government and then distributed it across the schools in their diocese or in their network according to how they have calculated the need of the school. So you cannot necessarily say that there will be less funding, because it depends very much on what the Catholic system wants to distribute.


The fact of the matter is that the Catholic system as an aggregated whole is receiving more funding year on year from the federal government under these arrangements, which is why you cannot say that schools are going to have to increase their fees as a result of federal government decisions, because the federal government is actually giving the Catholic system more money. If the Catholic system chooses to distribute that differently, that is up to them, but they have more money from the federal government to distribute to their school, so there is no school in any system—and certainly I can say this for South Australia—that will receive less money as a result of these changes. Every school in South Australia receives more money as a result of the changes this government is making.


The last area that is important to highlight is around what people have been saying in the media and in some of the letters I have received, particularly responding to comments from members opposite—that there have been cuts. Well, the reality is that the forward estimates—the four-year period—has in Australia's history always been the period when governments lock in and commit to spending, because the amount we have to spend should surely be based on what we can reasonably expect to have coming into the government, through individual corporate tax and through a range of revenue-raising measures. How far out can you predict that? If we said, 'Look, we think that in 100 years this will be happening,' people would laugh. In 50 years? People still would be pretty uncertain, or if we said in 20 years. You can bring it back four years. That, for many decades, has been the period for which governments can reasonably predict what our income will be and therefore what expenditure will be.


Prior to the 2013 election the Gillard government made promises going well into the future about very large amounts of money that they had not actually budgeted for. They could not explain where it might come from and could not give any guarantees. But that is the benchmark they are now claiming in saying that the record funding this government is giving to education is somehow a cut. So, people in the public are often—rightly—confused, because they hear one side of politics talking about cuts and the other side saying, 'Well, no, we're actually increasing funding.' I think it is really important for people who are listening to this debate to understand this. And I think Senator Xenophon made the comment that this is comparing apples with mythical pears. That funding in 2013 was a mythical pear that was held out as a promise but it was completely unfunded and there was no justifiable basis for how the Labor Party could ever deliver it. Yet, that is what people are now trying to say is the basis upon which the coalition government—they are saying—is cutting funding. That is just not correct. 


We are delivering record amounts of funding this year to education. Every sector is receiving more funding. In South Australia's case, every single school is receiving more funding, which is why we have seen organisations such as the South Australian Primary Principals Association come out and say that this is a good deal for South Australian children. We have seen Catholic colleges, like Nazareth Catholic College, come out and say that this is a fair deal and a good deal, and we have seen independent schools and Christian schools come out and say that this funding model is good for South Australia. Because it is good for South Australian children and restores equity and transparency around the nation, I support this bill.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-06-21,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:21):  The Australian Conservatives believe in evidence based spending of government funding and resources. We are rightly concerned about the evidence that has been put forward by the minister with respect to this funding. We are rightly concerned about the principles applied by the minister in determining this policy position. And, as a former longstanding member of the Liberal Party, I am deeply concerned about the complete abandonment of Liberal values and principles by the government. 


This bill, this policy mix, is yet another example of how the Liberal Party has completely lost the plot and jumped into bed with the big spending, big taxing ideas from the other side of the chamber. Their selling point to me to convince me to vote for this bill is: 'It would be worse under Labor. We are slightly less bad than the Labor Party. If we can't do a deal with you, Senator Bernardi, we will do one with the Greens and it will be worse.' All of those things may be true. But it does not negate the fact that that is not how we should be deciding public policy in this place. We should be looking at outcomes and this is an expenditure which violates, I think, the most basic principles of governance. 


They have dressed it up in the guise that it is going to lock in security for the next 10 years for schools funding. That is absolutely nonsense, because whatever they decide they want to lock in can be changed by subsequent governments. They have adopted exactly the same process, which is a smoke-and-mirrors load of baloney that the other side put up under Gonski 1.0. They are saying: 'We're going to lock this money in. It won't be changed.' Then, when the opposition become the government, they seek to change it. Of course they can. It is unfunded beyond the forward estimates. We are fooling ourselves if we think a government can bind future governments on a recurrent expenditure process like this. It is a con. It is a 'conski'. It was 'conski 1.0'; it was rightly criticised by the Liberal Party and the coalition. Now they have 'conski 2.0', which is exactly the same thing but 'slightly less bad'. That does not cut the mustard. 


They are saying they are 'slightly less bad' and they are going to do a better job. But they neglect to reflect on what I would call the key performance indicators: literacy and numeracy. Their policy is, 'We're going to throw money at this and hopefully it will turn out better for students'. There is zero accountability built into this program. 'Let's get the money, throw it in, and then we will decide how it's going to impact our students and our children later on'. 


Much has been said in this place in recent years about record funding for education, yet the statistics are quite damning. We are ranked 25th in maths, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Program for International Student Assessment, which ranks 15-year-olds. That is barely above the OECD average and trails Vietnam and Russia. We are ranked 16th in reading, behind Poland and Slovenia. We are 14th in science. If you look at the trends of the international rankings in maths and science, we trail many countries, including Russia and Kazakhstan. In fact, we are ranked 28th for nine- and 10-year-olds. That is a fall of 10 places from the same survey five years earlier. We are ranked 18th for 13- and 14-year-olds in mathematics, 26th for nine- and 10-year-olds and 17th for 13- and 14-year-olds in science. In almost every ranking we trail New Zealand. 


So, more money is not the answer—yet both sides of this chamber boast about record spending on education. The big problem we have in education is that they are not teaching our children how to read and write. Children are not learning the literacy and numeracy that they need. That traditional teaching ethos has been abandoned in favour of things like Safe Schools, which I note the education minister defended from pillar to post, notwithstanding the evidence that was presented to him. He had a mock review of it, which was a dud, and he still went into bat for it. It is not about the outcomes; there is an agenda here, an ideology, that is underpinning this, and it is a fraud. It is a fraud because it is failing our students and it is conning the Australian people, suggesting that anyone who is opposed to this funding is apparently somehow for poorer outcomes for students. That is absolutely wrong—but Australian taxpayers do deserve value for money.


I also reject the notion that some students are more deserving than others. If we want our children to achieve the best possible education outcomes then each child should be equal. Each child should be funded equally. I note that the education minister, in his first speech—of course, you are full of bravado in your first speech; you can say what you think—said, 'Why don't we trial education vouchers?' The problem is he has abandoned that. He is now in a position to do something about it and he has abandoned that value, he has abandoned that principle, just like the Liberal Party have abandoned their criticism of 'conski' 1.0. What a metamorphosis we have seen. It was a con, and then at an election you had then education minister Christopher Pyne, the mentor for Senator Birmingham, promising that Gonski 1.0 would be funded and that they were absolutely committed to it. Now here they are trying to pull their own 'conski' on the Australian people. This is a complete abandonment of principle.


I suspect that there are some hardheads in the coalition who recognise they are staring down the barrel of electoral defeat because of the decisions that they have made in recent years, and they have decided that if you can't beat them, you might as well join them. I am not joining them in their socialist nirvana. They can have that to themselves. The Australian Conservatives will stand alone as principled conservatives that are determined to get good taxpayer value for money and good outcomes. We are determined to have key performance indicators to measure the success of programs rather than throw money at them and hope the problems all go away into the politically too-hard basket—and that is precisely what has happened here. Two wrongs do not make a right, and for the coalition government to be aping the Labor Party and the Greens party and chasing this unfunded 'Starship Conski', as I would call it, is absolutely wrong.


We, the Australian Conservatives, will be seeking to improve very bad legislation by saying that the funding for this program should exist only as far as the government has budgeted for it. That means over the forward estimates. It is nonsensical to promise a 10-year program. What is next—a 20-year program to education? We could play at one-upmanship the whole time. We could operate a 50-year program of $500 billion going into education. We will not spend any of it, or very little of it, now; but I promise you that in years 45, 46 and 47 we will put $100 billion into education in those years. It is nonsensical. No-one would believe it. Why would we believe this now? It is a con. Shame on those who are perpetrating this on the Australian people. On the one hand they say the Catholic sector will not be disadvantaged, and yet the evidence in the modelling suggests that $4 billion is going to be taken out of the Catholic sector and put into the public sector. Even though the minister denies that again and again, he will not release the modelling. I have had a senior minister come to me and say that the Labor Party's $40 billion Gonski 1.0 is legislated and there is nothing they can do about it; so unless I support this bill the Australian taxpayers will be $20 billion worse off. But when I raised that with the education minister, he said, 'No, that is not entirely true.' So in the same cabinet room they do not even know what they are trying to convince us of. 


I know the minister is making the point that he has the crossbench all locked away. The threat is, 'We'll do a deal with the Greens and it will be much worse.' What sort of policy program is this? It is blackmailing over a system that is going to impact every child in this country. There are no key performance indicators in it. There is not one basis that says that if the school does not achieve a higher literacy or numeracy rate, the funding will diminish. There are no performance indicators. You might as well just throw it into a big black hole and say, 'Let's hope it comes out the other end.'


I am not buying that. I think it is absolutely wrong that governments think they can borrow money from future generations and scatter it wildly and hope that some of the seeds take root. It is a flawed thing. It was flawed when the Labor Party did that. I remember, when the coalition government had some principles left, they identified it as a con. It was underfunded; it was undemocratic; it was absolutely false. And now they are doing exactly the same thing. This has become a witch's brew of leftist policies in this place, and everybody is having their sip of it—eye of newt and tongue of ox, or whatever they want to put in there.


But in this little wedge—and it is a tiny wedge; there is only me right now, but I welcome anyone else—we are rejecting the witch's brew. We are going to continue to put forward ideas that are responsible, that are funded, that will get meaningful outcomes, that will ensure that parents have choice, that will ensure that education standards rise and that our children are not being done a long-term disservice because we feel that by simply throwing money at a problem it will go away. If money were the answer to success, then Collingwood would probably win a grand final every second year, because they spend more than anyone else. But it does not work like that. It does not work in education and it does not work in government. 


I feel that I cannot trust anything that is being put to me in respect to this funding by members of the government. That is a very hard thing to say, but I do not believe what they are telling me. Their own people do not believe what they are being told. They tell me that they have been told one thing and then one of their colleagues is told something different. I reckon it is a massive con job. It is designed to fix a political problem rather than solve an education issue.


And it is an issue, because I think the education system is failing our kids. Yes, they might learn about gender theory or this or that, but it is not much good if they cannot write a sentence coherently. It is not much good if they cannot be literate and numerate and they cannot calculate the change from $5 when they are buying a cup of coffee or tea, which is the lived experience. When I was running a business, I employed a year 12 graduate who could not mentally calculate the change from $5 for a cup of coffee. You just ask yourself: how did we get to that circumstance? And they graduated year 12 with good marks, and they got entry to university! But no matter what it qualifies you to do in academia, if you do not have those practical skills, it is a dud. And we are getting worse. This is the great problem. We are getting worse by any standard, as we saw when I went through the trends in international maths and science.


So I am deeply concerned about this. I will try and improve it by limiting the indexation, which is an amendment that I think Senator Leyonhjelm is going to produce. I will support the funding model if it is limited to the forward estimates, where the government is accountable and has to budget for it. But I will not support some random figure that is unfunded and unaccountable and has no measurable statistics. I encourage those on the crossbench, those who are serious about getting positive outcomes, to get the government to rethink this policy—not to do a deal with the Greens or with Labor but to rethink this policy so that it actually has some bite; so that it places some responsibility on the school system to do better by our students; so that it is responsible with taxpayers' money; so that it does not lock in a three per cent funding rise if inflation is only one per cent; so that it does not lock in guaranteed ongoing funding for particular schools if they are failing our students just because parents do not have a choice about where they can send them; and so that it does not provide funding if schools are not delivering absolutely positive results for our kids. These are the problems that we face. This is a very expensive fix for a political problem that the government has. It does not want to fight a campaign against the AEC or the Labor Party about being different on education. It is preparing for its next election and it is doing taxpayers a massive disservice in the meantime.


I cannot foresee a way, based on what I know, where I can support this bill. It is because I do not trust the government, who have abandoned their principles; I do not trust the information I have been given; and I do not respect a policy that is going to promise to spend borrowed or taxpayers' money with no meaningful outcomes.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-06-21,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:37):  We are talking about the educational program, which is very important to all Australians. I can understand what Senator Bernardi is saying about the funding. One Nation has been having extensive talks not only with the government but with interested groups like Catholic schools, education, parents and Labor. We have sat down to try and find some common sense in where we are headed with this. We will be supporting the government's Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017, but I do have a few things to say about it.


The Labor Party have been talking about there being a cut under this bill of $22 billion. My understanding is that it is a lie. There is no cut of $22 billion. It is like Labor have gone out there and promised: 'We were going to be putting an extra $30 billion into the educational funding. Now the government is bringing it back to $18.6 billion, so therefore Australians have lost $22 billion.' No, you can have your wish list; you can go out there and say, 'We're going to give you this money,' but unless it is actually there on paper, in black and white—I can go out and say, 'I'm going to give you $1,000,' when I only have $500 to give. Unless you produce it, don't go out there telling lies to the public. That is exactly what they are doing now.


They are out there making these robocalls around Queensland saying, to all the workers at the coalmines there: 'This is the CFMEU and we're ringing you to tell you that Pauline Hanson's One Nation is supporting the Liberal Party and they're going to cut $22 billion out of government funding. This is a real cut to you. She's destroying educational funding.' This is another lie. This is basically like Labor's 'Mediscare'. You lie to people, you are not up-front with people, you are hypocrites. I would suggest, if you have to pull these dirty tactics and stunts on people to get back the votes in Queensland, that if you were honest with people, if you were up-front with people, you might do a better job than you are doing now. But the people are waking up to you.


My concern about this is: why do we need another $18.2 billion thrown at this when the federal funding for education now is just under $88 billion? On top of that there is state funding as well as parents who pay fees to send their kids to schools. When I went to school we did not have all this money thrown at us. Our education levels are dropping. Australia used to be very high on the list of educational standards, but we are dropping. People say it is because of lack of money—'Let's throw more money at it.' Throwing money at it is not always the answer, and I do not believe it is the answer now. We have lost control over our classrooms. But I think the main issue here is that we have lost the quality of teachers, because over the years these do-gooders who want everyone to feel good about themselves have come into the education system saying to kids: 'You're all right; you don't have to compete in the classroom, you don't have to have grades, you don't have to perform to be top of the class, so we're going to take grading away. We're not going to tell your parents whether you got 40 per cent or 85 per cent, because we want you to feel good about yourselves.' They are not competing.


I am telling you, that is what the real shock in our society is, because the kids are not competing in the classrooms and they are not competing when they get out of the classrooms either. When they get out into the real world and into the workforce, there is no competition, and life is about competition; it is about striving to do the best you can. Unless you know what standard you are at, how do you know how much further you have to strive? I have spoken to the education minister about this—that things need to change. It is not about throwing more money at it; it is about how we can improve our educational standards.


It is absolutely pathetic, seeing the way children write—or that they cannot write. We used to have a decent standard of handwriting called 'running writing'. Now kids are flat out even learning how to write, let alone do maths. And maths is not a prerequisite in every classroom. They cut out maths. In some schools you do not necessarily have to learn maths, science or even English. They are the basics that we need as part of our education for the rest of our life. And as Senator Bernardi said, kids cannot add up. How right that is. In my shop, we had the till there, and the till would tell you what change to give, but when we had blackouts the young staff did not even know how to count money out. Unless the till tells them how to do it, they cannot calculate—they cannot work out anything in life—because they are not taught the maths. We are relying for everything on computers, on calculators, and in real life that is not always at your fingertips to use.


We need to go back to the basics. In the classroom there is a lack of discipline. The teachers are told that they cannot discipline the kids. And our educational system is now teaching the kids their rights. They say, 'Your parents can't tell you what to do, because you have your rights.' Then when the kids go home their parents tell them something and the kids say, 'You can't tell me that; I know my rights.' Parents have that right. This is what the problem is in our education system. Kids need to know that if they do the wrong thing they will be disciplined, and teachers should have control over their classrooms. A lot of teachers want that.


Regarding the push for Safe Schools, most parents I talk to don't want that. They think it is a load of rubbish and they do not want their kids to be confronted with this. Yes, it has been forced onto the kids in some schools.


I hope this whole package works for our kids and for our education system. It will be brought before the board and I will continue to talk to the education minister with regard to bringing in maths and science and on the issue of the quality of our teachers, and stopping pushing them through the education system. What we especially need to stop is this attitude that everyone must go on to university. No, they do not. If you have kids who are not academically minded it would be better to get them on the tools or in the trade. Why don't we push that? Why don't we give them a better understanding so that businesses can go to classrooms and tell them what it is like to be a plumber, an electrician or an IT professional, or something else, rather than peer pressure saying to them that they must go on to university.


At the end of the day the is no real qualifying level you need to get into university. We have peer pressure making everyone feel they have to go to university. It will be a cost to the taxpayer and the student will never pass. It is like, 'I've been to university. Which one did you go to?' without there being a standard for education. Let's give kids the opportunity to choose other professions. Let them leave at year 10, if they are not academically minded, instead of keeping them in the education system just to bolster the figures so that they are not on Newstart or youth allowance and are not in the unemployment queues. Give them opportunity to go on to other trades.


That leads to TAFE colleges. TAFEs are being shut down. They are not getting the funding that is so important to a lot of young people who do not want to go on to further education in our universities. It needs to be funded and looked after. I will be supporting that for the TAFE colleges, and the government will look at it. I know the TAFEs have been under a lot of pressure.


The Catholic schooling systems have been concerned about this issue. They take up a lot of the slack—not only the Catholic schools but a lot of other non-government education centres. They are trying to do their best to educate a lot of people across the country. There has been talk about who is getting money and who is losing money and where the funding is coming from. The government is going to give non-government schools 80 per cent of this funding—they do not get state funding—and the state schools will be getting 20 per cent of the funding. On average, for each child at primary school there will be just over $10,000 and for each child at high school there will be approximately $13,000 funding. This package will give around 3.7 per cent in extra funding per child.


I thank Senator Back for the issues he has raised and which he spoke to us about. The government needs to look at whether this funding is going to have an impact on some schools, especially those in the lower socioeconomic areas, and whether will they close. That concerns me greatly. I am pleased to hear that they are actually going to put in place a requirement that that be reviewed in a year's time. I think that is very important as it will give it time to settle in and see that it is working. Senator Bernardi said that he does not want to take it over the 10 years. My concern is that schools and everyone else needs to know what is happening in the future. They plan further ahead than that.


If you only do it at four years, my concern is that, if Labor gets in at the next election, it will blow completely out of proportion. They will make all these wishes and throw billions more dollars at it without dealing with the real problem. There will be money spent that we will not have. I hate to think what Labor would throw at funding for the schools, because we cannot afford it. Like I said, it has been a real issue for One Nation to come to a decision on whether to support this at an extra $18.6 billion to the Australian taxpayers. But I hope that this will improve our educational standards if it is addressed in the classroom. I think that is what is very important about it. 


There is another thing that we need to address, and I will go back to the classrooms again. I hear so many times from parents and teachers whose time is taken up with children—whether they have a disability or whether they are autistic—who are taking up the teacher's time in the classroom. These kids have a right to an education, by all means, but, if there are a number of them, these children should go into a special classroom and be looked after and given that special attention. Because most of the time the teacher spends so much time on them they forget about the child who is straining at the bit and wants to go ahead in leaps and bounds in their education. That child is held back by those others, because the teachers spend time with them. I am not denying them. If it were one of my children I would love all the time given to them to give them those opportunities. But it is about the loss for our other kids. I think that we have more autistic children, yet we are not providing the special classrooms or the schools for these autistic children. When they are available, they are at a huge expense to parents. I think we need to take that into consideration. We need to look at this. It is no good saying that we have to allow these kids to feel good about themselves and that we do not want to upset them and make them feel hurt. I understand that, but we have to be realistic at times and consider the impact this is having on other children in the classroom. 


We cannot afford to hold our kids back. We have the rest of the world and other kids in other countries who are going leaps and bounds ahead of us. Unless we keep up a decent educational standard in this country we will keep going further backwards and backwards, and our kids will not be the ones who are getting the good jobs in this country. They will be bringing in people from overseas and filling positions in this country that belong to our children. Our education is very important, and I feel that it needs to be handled correctly and we need to get rid of these people who want everyone to feel good about themselves. Let us get some common sense back into our classrooms and into what we do. Like I said, One Nation has spoken to many areas. Have we got it right? I hope we have got it right, because it is very important. 


I see so much in this place. It is the blame game, and Labor opposes so much all the time just because they are in opposition. It is a pity that parliamentarians in this place do not sit down and really have clear discussions with each other and find what is best for the people, because they are sick and tired of this. Labor, you said that you wanted to throw money at this. I think the $18.6 billion is a good start. It is a start. Why can't you work with the government on this, and then build on that? If this money is not going to the place where it is supposed to, and if it does need more funding, then work together to increase the funding. Stop opposing things just because of the fact that you are in opposition. It is about working together for the future of this nation. I just get so frustrated with the whole lot here, because I know people want the right answers. Not everyone—and I have heard it from those who are Liberal voters—is entirely happy with this package, whether they are hearing the right message not. 'What is right?' is a tough decision to make, but at least this is a step in the right direction, and that is what we are trying to do. One Nation is trying to handle this in a way that gives assistance to all those parents and schools, and extra funding for educational policy. That is One Nation's stance on it. We will be supporting the government on this bill.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2017-06-21,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:54):  It gives me great pleasure to stand in this chamber this morning and speak to the government's Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017. I chaired the Senate committee that was tasked to perform an inquiry into this bill, just as I sat on the Senate committee that was tasked to inquire into the original Australian Education Bill, where unfortunately we saw the implementation of David Gonski's panel's recommendations corrupted, in the name of panel members, corrupted by a Gillard government desperate to maintain power and desperate to get a deal done with the states and different systems. Now, a few years down the track, that sees Australian students treated very differently depending on where they live. 


As somebody who has come from the education sector—I was a secondary teacher and a lecturer in the Bachelor of Education at an institution in my home state of Victoria—I have a deep and abiding interest in ensuring that every single Australian student, no matter where they go to school, receives an excellent education. The people that I represent, the constituency at the very heart of the National Party's ethos, is rural and regional Australia. Of the nearly one million country kids attending school outside capital cities, the vast majority are attending state schools at the primary and secondary level. What we see right now, under the existing act and its provisions, is that state school students in one state, for instance Western Australia, are being treated very differently by the Commonwealth government than students with the same level of need by the New South Wales government. 


For us here in the Commonwealth parliament, in the Senate chamber, that brings all states together, that is just is not fair. Let the states argue their specific vested interests in their space and for their specific education budgets; but here in this place we need to take a national review. We need to ensure that every Australian child is treated the same by this place. What we have been able to achieve in the provisions of this bill is to ensure that if you attend your local Catholic primary school, your small independent Christian school, your local Jewish school or your local state primary school, you will be treated the same by the Commonwealth government according to your needs. That is only fair and just, and that is how we should be approaching education policy in this country.


We know that we have been spending record amounts of funding over time. In the report released by the OECD even as late as last week we are not doing well when it comes to quality education and student outcomes. At the end of the day, this is not about staff student ratios; it is not about how long school goes for how shiny your building is or who has the equestrian centre and who has not. This is about the outcomes for Australian students. We need to ensure that they have a high-quality education equipping them for the jobs of the 21st century. It should not matter which school they go to in determining that. 


What we do know and what research tells us is that students come into classrooms with a different set of needs. These needs affect their capacity and ability to engage in the schooling system. So Gonski and the former Labor government identified, and indeed it is reiterated in our own bill here today, that there are a series of loadings that ensure that those levels of need are actually funded, so that those students who are of Indigenous descent, who attend rural and regional schools, or who have to attend school with a disability—all of those factors are taken into account in the needs based funding model. The only people complaining about this bill and the enactment of a needs-based, sector-blind funding model of those people who have had sweetheart deals for way too long. Like we stand up and critique vested interests in the business sector and in the union sector, so too we call out vested interests in this area which are actually undermining the delivery of a high-quality, needs-based, sector-blind funding model to every Australian student.


These changes get rid of the opaque and unfair system entrenched by the previous government. I note Dr Ken Boston, a panellist for the original Gonski review in 2011, has described what occurred under the previous, Labor government as a 'corruption of the Gonski report'. You would think the Labor Party would be getting on board the rectification of that corruption right here, right now, today. However, they continue to do what they always do and play cheap political games with the lives of Australian students, and it is simply not on. I commend every senator in this place who is seriously considering why this Commonwealth parliament should not treat every Australian student the same.


To illustrate the consequences of this regime, I turn to a small country primary school in Victoria, 40 kilometres north of my electorate office, with 41 students. It currently attracts Commonwealth funding of $26,731 per student per annum. A comparable school in New South Wales, with 42 enrolments, attracts $11,039 per student per year. That is a massive differential between small primary schools in country New South Wales and those in country Victoria that just should not be occurring but has been able to under the Labor Party's iteration of the Gonski deals. They have similar needs, yet there is a gulf in funding between them. That shows everything that is wrong with the act as it stands and why it needs amendment right now.


Another example is that 530 of the schools with the highest proportion of Indigenous students are in remote or very remote areas. These changes will ensure their particular needs are met. 


We need to have a more granular approach to students with a disability to ensure that a teacher in the classroom is able to assess a student's need and the amount of resources required to address that student's learning outcomes, because that is what we are talking about—learning outcomes, not just money from money's sake but how we are going to help those individual students reach their potential and learn to the best of their capacity. And that is by having a much more granular approach to how we deal with students with a disability loading, and that is something we are absolutely committed to.


I also want to go to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee inquiry on the bill. We received overwhelming evidence about the need to 'end the funding wars' when it came to education funding in this country, including from the Grattan Institute, who, typically, does not side with our side of politics, but wanted those issues put to bed. I think the most telling evidence was from ACSSO, which represents the parents of the over two-thirds of Australian students that attend state schools in this country. The ACSSO president, Mr Spratt, came to our hearings. Whilst it was great to hear from the smaller sectors and the different systems, it was great to hear from somebody that represented two-thirds of our nation's students' parents. As the chair said:


You have been very clear in your desire to end the funding wars—to get it sorted—


to support this bill. We have to take on board and ensure that the Commonwealth government treats every single Australian student fairly and justly.


Another issue that we are addressing is the need for states to maintain their contribution levels. Over recent years, while the Commonwealth government has been chipping in more money, we have seen states decreasing their rate of investment in their constitutional responsibility to educate the students within their state boundaries. That is simply not acceptable. If the Commonwealth government is going to invest record funding—I know others in this place have gone into the actual level of funding that will be distributed under these initiatives—then it is imperative that state governments stop playing politics with those students who are attending non-government schools within their boundaries and treat every student the same within their own boundaries. I hope this legislation will put their feet to the fire and help them get on board with focusing on how they can treat all students and maintain parental choice, which is a core fundamental aspect of our education system here in this country.


Again, I could go into the different deals and how they impact time and again on how different students are treated differently. One of the things that struck me about the Senate inquiry we conducted was that there were no questions from the Labor Party senators about public school funding. Every single question from the Labor Party senators was about how the private schools, the non-government sector, were going to fare under the changes being suggested. That beggars belief. I am a public school teacher and a lot of my kids went to public schools and the children of my constituents, en masse, attend state schools, so I want to see a very strong state school system—and this bill does what Labor's bill could never do. They are too busy playing footsies with premiers leading up to an election rather than considering outcomes for Australian students.


I want to put on the record some critiques that have been made in recent days on the guarantee, particularly for those private schools that operate as systems, that private schools will be getting an increased level of investment. We are the side of government that does support parental choice, but we also recognise that that should not come at a cost to investing in all students' education. I specifically go to the Catholic education sector. Between 2018 and 2021 the average annual per student funding to the Catholic sector will increase by 3.7 per cent and by a total of $2.8 billion between 2018 and 2027. That is a phenomenal amount of increased funding, and I am confident, as I travel around regional Victoria and I talk to Catholic principals, I talk to state school principals and I talk to independent school principals, that they are desperate for this money to enter their schools so they can provide the resources that their students need. It is absolute hypocrisy for people to stand up here today and talk about cuts in funding when, in a needs based system, if you have a need it will be funded. That is how it works. If you do not have a need, you are going to miss out. I have no objection whatsoever to ensuring that incredibly overfunded schools under the current system get a cutback. I would much rather see increased investment in rural and regional state schools across this country than see North Shore Sydney privates continue to get the level of funding that they are getting under the Labor Party's agreements right now. That is the level of unfairness that this bill seeks to undo, and I encourage all senators who care about equity and fairness to support it. 


People often mention the Finnish system—why aren't we more like Finland? Do you know what makes the Finnish system so great? It is not about the buckets of money; it is about a bipartisan approach to education over two decades rather than this argy-bargy 'he said, she said, we do it better, no you don't' argument. Our future is dependent on the educational outcomes of every Australian student right now. 



Senator Marshall interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  We know we are not achieving in international—




Senator Williams:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I am very interested in listening to Senator McKenzie's presentation. Senator Marshall, who is a very good Deputy President of this chamber—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Do you have a point of order?




Senator Williams:
  I don't know why they dumped him on that side—would keep order in this place, but he is being very disorderly, and I ask you to bring it to his attention or instigate standing order 203.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Marshall, on the point of order—and let's make it relevant, if possible.




Senator Marshall:
  Of course. Senator McKenzie is suggesting that there is hypocrisy and there are double standards.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not relevant to the point of order.




Senator Marshall:
  It goes exactly to the point. If Senator McKenzie is going to be so provocative, she expects—



Senator McKenzie interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Marshall, please resume your seat. Senator McKenzie, I do not need any assistance. You do not have the call yet. Senators are entitled to be heard in silence in this place, and it becomes particularly difficult when we have a small chamber with only a limited number of people. I would ask that that covenant be respected. Senator McKenzie, you have the call.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Thank you very much. No, you do not need any help from me in chairing or anything else.


It was the majority view of the committee examining all of the evidence before it to support this bill notwithstanding there were issues raised. I think the minister in his public commentary and other senators have dealt fairly and squarely with those concerns. It is our view that, if fully enacted as presented here today, this bill will create a system for public funding of schools that is fair and transparent. That has been one of the great critiques. The Commonwealth tips a lot of money—a record bucket of money—into certain systems, whether they be state systems, whether they be private school systems such as the Catholic education system, and has no real understanding or visual oversight of where that is going. To have a transparent system where parents and taxpayers can actually hold state governments and education systems more generally accountable for where they spend their money and who is getting that share of the funding is appropriate. It is absolutely the right policy position to take.


The bill will also ensure the highest levels of funding growth will occur where the need is greatest. Isn't that fantastic? Where you have some out-of-school needs which are actually going to impact how you engage with the education sector, the Commonwealth is prepared to back that and to ensure that the school has a level of funding to assist with overcoming those barriers. What I know about representing rural and regional Australians is the level of educational disadvantage is incredible. On any measure—NAPLAN results, PISA results, participation in higher education, you name it—rural and regionality is an issue with educational engagement. That must change. It is why our government has initiated an in independent review into rural and regional education and it is why one of the loadings is about the location and size of a school.


Similarly, so is SES. We know that the 10 electorates in this country with the lowest median income levels are in rural and regional Australia. This not only deals with inequity right now and over the coming 10 years but backs in the investment we need in my communities to ensure we have the skilled, engaged, educated young people and ongoing workforce that we need to fully participate in all the opportunities that the 21st century brings for us in agriculture and across the board.


It also puts an end to students with the same needs being treated differently depending on where they live. Anyone that is interested in fairness, do not listen to the opposition. If they are talking about fairness on one side and Gonski on the other, full stop turn it off. You are not hearing the truth. I sat and had a bit of a listen to the opening couple of lines of the shadow minister for education in her speech on this bill's second reading, and it was absolutely unbelievable. The level of falseness that she pursued through that speech was very concerning. The ABC Fact Check is not always great for my side of politics, but I tell you: they got it right on the Labor Party's claims about the Gonski funding—that the Labor Party was misleading not just the parliament but the entire nation around any talk of the $22 billion cuts—and yet we allow that conversation to go on. I see you nodding, Senator Marshall—




Senator Marshall:
  I'm laughing.




Senator McKENZIE:
  But we continue to let it go on. The AEU, which has spent $20 million on a Gonski campaign, when presented with a model that is going to end the inequity, cannot come to the party. During the Senate inquiry, when asked, 'Are you happy for students in WA state schools to continue to receive different levels of funding to students with the same need in my home state of Victoria?' the AEU refused to answer, but it made it very clear that it wanted to keep the entrenched disadvantage inherent in the 27 different deals as part of the policy of the Commonwealth government. It is absolutely an abomination. I commend this bill to the Senate. I thank the crossbenchers who are actually putting Australian students first in their consideration. (Time expired)

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-06-21,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (11:15):  It is with quite a deal of interest—interest and curiosity—that I am rising to speak to the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017 today, because I think we still do not yet quite know where this bill is going to land. It is of concern that the government has brought on this bill for debate today while negotiations are still ongoing, for this is a critical issue for the future of Australia and our education systems. Achieving equity, fairness and the best outcomes for kids at all schools across Australian is fundamentally critical to the future of our country. 


There is one thing that is clear in terms of the way that the Greens are approaching this: front and centre we are being completely guided by what is in the best interests of all school students at all schools across the country. We particularly have the interests of children who are going to public schools, and we want to make sure, in particular, that we achieve the best outcomes for the neediest public schools. We have a great opportunity to reform schools funding so that it is genuinely needs based and sector blind. That is not where our schools funding is at the moment. Schools funding currently is a complete dog's breakfast. Schools funding under the deal that is supposedly the result of the last reviews led by David Gonski is supposedly needs based and sector blind. It clearly is not. There are carve-outs all over the place. It is not fair. It is not equitable if you are a school student in the Northern Territory compared to a school student in the ACT, for example. So we have a really important opportunity now, and it is up to us to make the most of that opportunity.


There are some good things that the government has put on the table now, such as the changes to the architecture to make it more genuinely needs based and sector blind. But the Greens are not going to support the model that is on the table at the moment, if that is the one we end up voting on, because it is not a model that delivers what we need for our schools. Clearly there is not enough money on the table at the moment. The mechanisms are not there to make sure that the states are going to continue to pay their fair share. In our federation responsibility for education is shared between the Commonwealth and the states, and it is not going to be any use at all if the Commonwealth increases its funding but allows the states to squib their part of the deal—that we get extra money from the Commonwealth, but the states go, 'Oh, that's good. Right. Terrific. We'll go and pocket it and not spend it.' Clearly we have to maintain that nexus. We have to make sure that the increase in funding that is required comes from both the Commonwealth and the states.


The other critical factor that the Greens have been arguing for, which was part of the original Gonski review, is having an independent body to overview schools funding into the future so that it can be genuine and we can trust that we know that it is absolutely going to continue to be fair, equitable, needs based and sector blind. So that is what the Greens are continuing to fight for, and we will continue to fight for that and continue to put the needs of every school student in Australia at the forefront of our negotiations.


As I said, the critical issue is what is in the best interests for all kids in all schools, but particularly the kids of those families who frankly do not have the resources to be paying private school fees. They should not have to. Those children, as much as any other children in the country, deserve a gold-standard education. Our country needs them to receive that gold-standard education because it is in our national interest. If you look at how the Australian education system is currently performing on the world stage, our best schools are up there with the best schools in the world. The kids that are going to those best schools are achieving the outcomes that we can be really proud of. But, sadly, that does not extend through to all of our schools.


What we do not have is equity in education. That is what we need to achieve. The best performing school systems in the world, such as the Finnish system, are the ones that have that equity so that you know, no matter what the background of a child is—what their family background is, how much income their family has or whether they are Indigenous or not Indigenous—they are getting the resources that are required to enable them to achieve their full potential. That is what the Greens are fighting for—improving equity in our education. That means making sure that more resources are going to go to the most needy of public schools.


I have visited many schools across Victoria in my three years as a senator. The most recent one I visited, just a couple of weeks ago, was Tarneit Senior College. Tarneit Senior College is in one of Melbourne's growth areas—the outer western suburbs—and, despite being in a growth area and despite being a relatively new school that has only been built within the last decade, it is struggling. It has not had put into it the resources that are required. Usually, when you arrive at most schools you visit, they at least have the resources and feel that they have to be able to market themselves. There will be a grand entrance, even at a lot of our public schools. But, no, the entrance to Tarneit Senior College is off the car park. There is a little sign on the gate saying, 'All visitors, please report to the office.' You look and think, 'Where's the office?' There is no building that is obviously going to be one that has an office there. You follow the signs, and the office is in a portable building—and they expect it to be in a portable for many years to come. It has been in a portable for the whole life of the school.


I had a terrific meeting with the principal, who showed me around the school and showed me where they are still lacking in funding, where they need more funding to be able to provide the resources to make sure that all of their kids can achieve their potential and what they have been able to do with the extra money that has been put into their school over the last two years. In particular, I met their wellbeing team—their social workers and other staff working to ensure the welfare of all of their students. They told me some pretty amazing statistics. There are quite a lot of issues that Tarneit as a growth area is facing. It is actually an area that has a high turnover in population because of the unaffordability of housing right across our cities, even in growth areas. The people who move to Tarneit hoping to find affordable rent find, after a while, that they cannot afford to pay the rent there, and they move even further out and they move to regional Victoria.


So, there is lots of transience. There are low-socioeconomic families there, and huge multicultural diversity—lots of newly arrived families. There are major, major student needs. This is reflected in the fact that they now have a student wellbeing team of five staff, whereas two years ago they had only one. They have 420 students in years 10 to 12. Of those 420 students, 317 last year accessed the services of their student wellbeing team—three-quarters of the students. This is a school that is struggling, that needs more resources put into it. This is the type of school I have in my mind when we as Greens are negotiating to get the best outcomes for students and families.


The other issue which is, again, so critical—why we need to ensure that schools like Tarneit Secondary College get the level of funding they deserve—is that if they do not we know the pressure that puts on families, feeling that this school actually is not going to give their kids the best education. They have competition from local private schools. Then there are families that can afford to pay private school fees but may have to dig really deep and miss out on other things because they feel that in order to get the best education they have to send their children off to private schools. So then you get the segregation of the wealthier families who are sending their kids to private schools and those that have no option and so are sending their kids to the state high school. That is not in the interests of the wellbeing of our community. That is not going to be delivering the best educational outcomes.


We need to have the resources of all of the community feeding into and supporting our public education system. But in order to do that we have to make sure that schools like Tarneit Secondary College are funded appropriately. As a Victorian senator, that is what I am going to be fighting for: to make sure that those schools get the resources they need, that they are not going to be disadvantaged. Under any needs based, sector-blind model, with an adequate quantum of funding, they are the schools we are going to be fighting for. All children deserve the best education possible to set them up for a bright future. Their educational outcome should not depend on their family's wealth or income or on the state they live in. And parents should not have to shop around because they are worried that their local public school does not have the resources to educate their kids. Public education should be the gold standard, not a safety net.


I experienced this as well. My two kids both went to local high schools in the western suburbs. One went to Williamstown High School and one to Footscray Secondary College. They were great schools, but I was under a lot of pressure when we were choosing schools for my kids, who are reasonably bright kids: the number of my friends who said, 'Oh, you should be sending them off the private schools, because the local secondary schools aren't going to be able to deliver for them.' And we said: 'No, we're going to send them off the public schools. We are absolutely, philosophically committed to sending them off to public schools.' And they did brilliantly.


But many of their fellow students at Footscray and at Williamstown came from families from the outer western suburbs and were travelling long distances, where they could, to go to what their parents thought was a better public school. That is not a good outcome. We should be ensuring that the families living in St Albans, the families living in Werribee, the families living in Tarneit have a school they can be proud of. That is why we really need to have this genuine Gonski model of funding. It is absolutely critical for our students. We need that genuine, sector-blind, needs based model that is prioritising funding to look after the needy schools and kids. And we need to get that investment sooner.


One of the current concerns we have with the government's legislation is that although more funding would be flowing it is not going to be delivering outcomes to the most needy of schools until 10 years into the future. That is not good enough. It means that a kid who is in grade 3 today will not have the full funding going to their school until they are at the end of high school. We need to make sure that we get that greater investment sooner so that we can give every child the opportunity to reach their potential.


We have never had that genuine model. The current Gillard Gonski model is clearly not needs based. It is locked-in funding to the wealthy private schools at the expense of public schools. The current Turnbull Gonski 2.0 is not sector blind. It is offering certainty to private schools but it leaves the neediest public schools little chance to catch up after years of neglect. 




Senator Marshall:
  What's your position now? Are you voting for it?




Senator RICE:
  The Greens position is that we are continuing to negotiate. There are some advantages that the government's model is offering, improving the architecture—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Order! 



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Interjections while senators are speaking is disorderly and interjections while the chair is talking is even more disorderly. Senators are entitled to be heard in silence, and that is how we are going to proceed. Senator Rice, you have the call. 




Senator RICE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Clearly, we have got a dog's breakfast at the moment. We are being failed by both parties, with both of the models that are on offer. A continuation of the old system is not good enough. The government's model that is currently on offer is also not good enough. The Greens will continue to negotiate to get the best outcome that we need, and that means having a genuine Gonski. It means putting kids before politics. It means making decisions on where we stand on the basis of what is the best policy outcome—not playing political games. 


What Labor are supporting at the moment is not the genuine Gonski. Labor walked away from the central premise that all schools should be funded on the basis of need. They promised that no school would lose a dollar, which sounds great, but it actually means that the wealthiest schools will continue to get more and more money, while those with scarce resources, the least well-off, will be deprived of funds. It means that we would have the continuation of the disparity, of the inequity, in our education system. The indexation that is on offer under Labor, which is locked into the legislation, means that poorer schools would take more than 100 years to catch up to those schools that are underfunded—let alone 10 years. It will be 100 years before they will be able to catch up to those that are underfunded. That inequality of opportunity is currently what is locked into law. Clearly, that is not a system that we would want to see continue. 


An analysis by the Grattan Institute says that Labor's education plan taken to the 2016 federal election would have added mega bucks but still not achieve consistent needs based funding for over 100 years. The Labor Party claim that the Turnbull government's cutting of $22 billion from schools over the decade is also a widely inaccurate claim. It is simply the difference between what Labor promised at the last election; it is not what is in law right now. Labor are currently not in government, so their promises sounds great but they actually mean nothing now. In order to have certainty over that, Labor should have locked in that funding before the 2013 election, but they chose not to do that. They chose not to lock in that amount, because they wanted to use our schools, our education, and the funding for schools in political game-playing in the election campaign. We could have had fairer funding locked in place if the Labor government in the lead-up to 2013 had chosen to do so, but they chose not to. On the other hand, the Turnbull government is claiming that there is a boost in funding of $16 billion over the decade, but this is based on the low level of funding that former Prime Minister Abbott stripped it back to. Neither of the parties are delivering fair, equitable and honest statements about our education system. The two parties are playing politics while our public schools are losing out. We need to be putting kids before politics. We need to be making sure that we have a system that is genuinely needs based and sector blind. 


We also have these claims that public schools are going to be receiving a cut under the government's Gonski 2.0 proposal, but, in fact, no public school system in Australia will receive a cut under the proposed funding model. The only notionally overfunded public schools in Australia are those in the Northern Territory, and they have been given additional funding under the government's proposed plan so their funding is not going to backwards. Government schools in every state will see their funding increase. Because they are all funded at different rates by the Commonwealth currently, the rate that they increase will be different. Historically underfunded states will increase at a faster rate than those that are closer to the target. 


Again, there are some good things that, as Greens, we want to be building upon. The best outcome is for us to negotiate an agreement that ends up with a genuine needs based, sector-blind funding system that will deliver the best outcomes, equitable and fair outcomes, that will give every kid the opportunity to achieve their potential. We are going to do that by changing the architecture so that it is genuinely needs based and sector blind, and by putting in the resources so that all schools will be up to the standard that is required to allow kids to fully achieve their potential.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-06-21,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (11:36):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak to the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017. This bill seeks to make a range of changes to the Gillard-era Australian Education Act 2013 to implement the government's so-called Gonski 2.0 education changes. These include a range of funding changes that seek both to increase education funding overall and to reapportion funding between and within the public and private school systems. 


Pauline Hanson's One Nation will be supporting the government's amended legislation; however, the key issues that need to be highlighted are accountability and choice. At Pauline Hanson's One Nation, we continue to listen widely. We appreciate very much the input from New South Wales Labor senator Deb O'Neill, whose passion and commitment to education is certain. We also appreciate the commitment and the passion with which Senator Chris Back, the Liberal senator from Western Australia, spoke to us this morning. Both are clearly knowledgeable and passionate about education; that came through with both of them. We listened to Senator David Leyonhjelm and Senator Cory Bernardi, and we will be considering their amendments for increasing the rigour and accountability of this bill as it is implemented. We listen, most importantly, to constituents, and we live ourselves in local communities with diverse state, Catholic and private schools. These vary from New South Wales with Senator Burston, to Queensland with Senator Hanson and me, to Western Australia with Senator Georgiou. 


In my early years as a child in India, I went to a school for expats run by Italian nuns using the acclaimed Montessori philosophy. I then went to state schools in New South Wales and then to a boarding school in Queensland. So I have sampled the private school sector and the independent school sector and I have also sampled state schools. My wife and I have two children who are now adults. Our kids went to a private primary school, based on the needs of the child, using the Montessori philosophy with parents paramount in the running of that school, albeit through an elected board appointing a principal. So there is yet another model. Then my children went to a state high school that had a history of respect for children. My understanding is that it was the only Queensland state high school with no uniform. What we want is for our kids to think for themselves and to discover as they wish. They have different interests, not just because one is a boy and one is a girl, but because they have different experiences and spirits when they came into this world, and different interests and passions.


Let me tell you a story. I want comment on the Greens. Before getting to that, I want to comment on one of their funders—the CFMEU. The CFMEU put a robocall around Queensland yesterday. They are saying that our party, Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, is calling for cuts to education spending. That is false. What would we expect from the CFMEU? It is a dishonest statement trying to hurt Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. The CFMEU is above all a political organisation. It is no longer a union that looks after its members. The union bosses are disconnected. It is these people from whom the Greens take their money. 


It is not true at all that Pauline Hanson's One Nation wants to cut education spending. We are actually in favour of strong education funding. No money has been taken out in this bill. The CFMEU's puppets, the Greens, say we need equity in education, as they often do. I am going to tell you a little story about two countries pretty soon. We do not want equity—sorry, equality—of opportunity; we want choice—equality of opportunity, because that gives choice. When choice is available it leads to accountability, and it leads to progress. That comes from accountability and choice—when humans are free to exercise our free will, our human spirit, in a way that enables us to take responsibility.


I would like to talk about the basics of education. That is a right of every child, with rigorous, effective education being the foundation for our nation's future economic prosperity and moral, spiritual and social health. There are three topics I would like to raise. First of all, state responsibility. Under our Constitution, the responsibility for education is with the states. That is where it should have been and should have stayed, and that is where it needs to be returned. We operate under competitive federalism—or rather, we used to. Centralisation has led to the politicisation of schools and has led to travesties such as the Safe Schools program, which is initiated federally and spread through some of the states, notably the Victorian Andrews government with its ridiculous Safe Schools policy. This is what centralisation gives us—United Nations driven ratbag propaganda such as Safe Schools, that are nothing more than brainwashing and propaganda exercises levied on the young and impressionable. Safe Schools are not about safe schools; Safe Schools are about violent schools—emotionally violent schools. Safe Schools are about intimidating young boys and girls from the age of four onwards—intimidating and confusing them.


The second thing I would like to talk about is individual choice—not state mandated social engineering, but choice, through vouchers. That leads to accountability.


The third thing I would like to talk about is effective education preparing boys and girls for the real world, so that boys and girls can pursue their dreams, their interests and their passions. We do not need boys especially sitting in school from the age of four or 5 to 18. That is not what many boys want to do. Boys in particular, but also girls, humans in general, learn by doing. Boys in particular learn by doing and by implementing what they learn. I have been to two universities and I am a graduate from two universities, one of them recognised as one of the finest in the world. I do not want every person to go to university—only those who want to go to university.


Let me tell you a story of two countries: East and West Germany. After the Second World War, West Germany was liberated from the American government by Ludwig Erhard, the Treasurer under the Chancellor at the time. East Germans and West Germans worked together in the Second World War and came up with a remarkable industrialisation and a remarkable inventiveness. The East Germans were restricted by socialism after the Second World War. The West Germans were liberated under Ludwig Erhard and free markets.


As a result of that simple difference, the East Germans over 50 years produced the Trabant car, a little papier-mache box with a smelly, dirty, polluting and noisy engine. People had to line up in East Germany to get that car because there were not enough of them available. The East Germans were a basket case. The West Germans, at the same time, produced Mercedes, Porsche, Volkswagen, Audi and Opel. The West Germans produced the world's most aspired-to cars.


Today we have a Trabant education system, and it is producing Trabants. The Greens love Trabants. They want Trabant energy, and we can see the cost of energy in this country. They want Trabant science, which is not science at all. They want a Trabant environment, which is hurting our environment. They want, you see, what the East Germans wanted, which was control, yet they cannot see the results of denying the human spirit.


What we want to see, though, is states delivering education and, within that education, states enabling individuals to have their choice of education. We accept a national minimum standard that makes it simple for standards to be accepted around the country, but we want to see the states implement their own curricula because only then will we see a development of curricula from one state to the next with superior curricula rising to the fore and other states copying those.


We need a certain level of qualification before people can be accepted into trades and universities. That is now dwindling. We need to restore that. We need teachers with authority, with responsibility, with a specialty where it suits them and with a real job, not childminding, as it has become in some parts of our country. We need an emphasis on maths, English, science and history, and we need a return to teaching about the Constitution. We must send education back to the states. That will end the waste and duplication, and it will liberate the human spirit to improve education.


Within the state system we need to recognise the complexity involved in delivering education across a diverse continent and across many diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. It is a fact, as Senator Back said to us this morning, that many of the towns in Northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia do not have a state school. They have no state school at all and rely entirely on the Catholic system. That Catholic system has grown up over many years and become so adapted to suiting the needs of individual communities. It brings values, it brings basics in education and it brings education to the disadvantaged. That must be protected. We understand from Senator Back that the government will be putting a one-year moratorium and a delay on implementing some of the provisions in this legislation thanks to Senator Back and his advocacy. If Catholic schools were to be shut, there would be huge burdens on state systems around this country.


Then Senator Back went on to discuss the system weighted averaging used by Catholic schools in Western Australia, recognising the parents' ability to pay. He compared two schools in the same town, Cathedral Grammar and St Joseph's, with vastly differing fee levels. That is not possible under a government mandated bureaucracy. It is possible under the Catholic system, which shoulders an enormous burden in this country. He explained that system weighted averaging is far superior to the socioeconomic-standing system that the government proposes based on postcodes. He explained that Gonski and another key designer of education both say that the system weighted average is, in fact, far superior. We acknowledge many benefits to what the government is proposing. Thirty per cent of the kids in Catholic schools, according to Senator Back, are not Catholic. They are there by choice, with the exception of schools in northern Australia, where there is no alternative. We must recognise the Catholic system. There are regional and rural towns with no state school system that rely entirely on Catholic schools. Without Catholic schools there would be an enormous increased burden on state schools. Ninety-five per cent of state school capital costs were paid for by parents. That needs to be honoured. The Catholic school system, above all, provides parents with choice. 


Vouchers would also provide parents with choice—even wider choice. That would enable many more people to have input into education, into how the schools their kids are attending and being instructed at are run. Then we would have liberation from the Trabant of education. We would have not only diversity of education curricula but diversity of education delivery systems and diversity of educational administrative systems. And, as each one improved, they would be copied by surrounding schools, and we would have an ever-escalating improvement. We would start having the Porsches, the Mercedes, the BMWs of education. We would have a liberation of the human spirit. 


The final thing I want to discuss is the need to look at the merits of the German apprenticeship model, which gave us the apprenticeship system—the trade system. As I said, boys—and, indeed, girls—are not built to sit in school all day. Education needs to be for the real world to give people the opportunity to develop the ability to think for themselves. That is real education—not just to pick up the three Rs but the ability to pick up the responsibility for learning, the responsibility for discovery, the responsibility for self-awareness and consciousness, and the responsibility for life. Real education is also about them being able to focus on their interests, not what the state mandates and not what the UN mandates through our central government in this country. We need to stop setting boys up for failure. The German apprenticeship model has proven highly successful.


 In America, I was given instruction by a well-known educational expert, Michael Strong. He has had an outstanding career across the country from Alaska through to Hawaii through to the desert states of New Mexico. Michael Strong has developed schools with many different curricula under many different philosophies. He said that in America people talk about sending their kids to university. Only one-third get to university, which means that two-thirds are under the pressure of feeling like they have failed. A university education is not for everyone. We need a country that values education other than at universities. We need a country that sets up boys and girls for trades and careers outside universities. We need to be able to give people a foundation in entrepreneurial activities. That needs a free market. We need to unshackle this country from the clutches of central government—ever-growing central government. We need to stop setting up boys for failure. We need to release the school system for individual initiative. We need to give people choice in schools—not only whether or not they go to a school but what sort of school they go to. We need to really think ahead, but, for now, we are anticipating supporting the government's bill.

Senator XENOPHON

 (
South Australia
) (
11:54
):  It is impossible to overstate the importance of this bill because, whatever the outcome of our consideration, it will have a far-reaching effect on a generation of children and their educational outcomes. It is not hyperbole to say that the future prospects of a generation of children are in our hands. The importance of education cannot be overstated, because education is one of the strongest tools to tackle poverty, reduce welfare dependency and improve health outcomes. Education is about the future of our children and of our nation. My team and I have taken consideration of what is dubbed Gonski 2.0 very seriously. I commend the work that my colleague in the other place, the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie MP, has done on this. She has done a tremendous amount of work. Her diligence and forensic approach to this are to be commended. She has spoken about the bill in the other place and gave the legislation our cautious support, pending satisfactory resolution of our reservations and the outcome of the Senate inquiry. The majority report of that inquiry predictably said it should be passed, but it did set out various concerns with the bill.


Before I discuss in detail how our reservations have been addressed, I want to congratulate the government for its determination to implement a purer form of the Gonski sector-blind needs based funding model. This took courage because, if you level the playing field, inevitably there will be some losers. But if it goes to the neediest schools, those that deserve it the most, then that is a good outcome. For confirmation that the government's model is closer to the original Gonski review's intent we need look no further than the enthusiastic support from members of the original Gonski review expert panel. Who could forget the image of David Gonski standing alongside the Prime Minister on 2 May and saying he supports this package? He was pleased that the government had adopted the recommendations of a needs based funding model. I look forward to the report of his review into how Commonwealth funding should be invested to improve school and student achievement, because outcomes are very important, but we also need to get the funding model right. Ken Boston, a fellow Gonski review expert panel member, went even further to say recently:


It will be a tragedy if the school funding bill is voted down in the Senate … Five years after the release and subsequent emasculation of the Gonski report, Australia has a rare second chance.


Kathryn Greiner, another member of the original Gonski review expert panel, said:


… it would be a disaster for Australian education if this doesn't pass. This is the first time a government in this country has drawn a line in the sand, removed the funding anomalies and got everybody on the same page.


The former Labor government, when trying to implement the Gonski model—this is not a criticism of them—were racked by needing a whole range of different funding deals to get the states on board. There were something like 27 different agreements. The requirement that no school should lose a dollar hobbled the implementation from the beginning and resulted in a distorted model. Instead of a level playing field, the starting point was each sector's then current funding level, which included historical funding anomalies and past deals. It was built on a flawed foundation of inequitable funding. The special deals done during the negotiation to cajole various states into signing up for Gonski sealed its fate as an inequitable model. It was not needs based and sector blind. Arguably it was not Gonski at all but a knock-off brand trying to look the same as the real thing.


I strongly support the intent of the legislation, but that does not mean there was no room for improvement. I mentioned earlier that we had some real reservations, and I want to cover how the negotiations we have had with the government address these. The first was the time frame. In our view a 10-year transition is too long, particularly for jurisdictions that have been underfunded for the past four years. The reduction of the transitional time frame from 10 years to six years is a big development. It goes much further towards bringing these funding anomalies to an end and putting schools on a more level playing field. If we all agree that reaching the SRS is the goal then getting there faster will benefit more children more quickly, particularly those who have already started secondary school.


Our second reservation was that the legislation as originally drafted only required states and territories to maintain their 2017 funding levels plus indexation. This lets states and territories off the hook too easily, so there must be measures—as I understand it, amendments will be tabled that will ensure real accountability on the part of states and territories to reach their share of the SRS by 2023. That will ensure accountability of the new funding model. That is fair, and if the states do not place a priority on appropriately funding their schools then they should be exposed.


The introduction of a national school resourcing body, something that the Australian Greens have long advocated, and I congratulate them for advocating, is also a very welcome addition. We need to have enhanced transparency and accountability, so I strongly support an independent body that can monitor all elements of the needs based funding model and suggest improvements. For example, I support that one of the first tasks is to examine the appropriateness of the current SES determination methodology. I know that the Catholic sector has been concerned about this, and I congratulate Senator Chris Back for his advocacy in this regard.


I have previously stated publicly that this might not be the full Gonski, but it is still the Gonski. At that time I was drawn into the focus on the quantum of funding, not the methodology. My position is now a bit more nuanced. Earlier, I alluded to the fact that Labor's Gonski was not really a Gonski at all, but rather a more expensive knock-off from a flawed methodology. I understand why there has been so much focus on the debate about the quantum of funding and not the methodology, but we can do both. If you scratch beneath the surface, the model that we saw before perpetuated historical funding inequities. The extra funding that Labor promised would have been allocated unfairly. 


Labor and the AEU have described this as a $22 billion cut. The $22 billion was Labor's funding promise, but they have not had to follow through on it. My colleague Rebekha Sharkie describes this as comparing apples with imaginary pears. Let us be clear: we are talking about $22 billion worth of imaginary pears. With the compression of the time frame to six years the difference has been reduced to $17 billion of imaginary funding. It is also important to note that the differences in the funding level between Labor's much-lauded years five and six of Gonski and the proposal is less than six per cent.


I am a pragmatist, as are my colleagues. We have a bill in front of us that will provide, in effect, $23 billion of extra funding to our schools over the next 10 years with the compression of getting up to the SRS standard within six years. I am not going to vote against a bill that provides extra funding and addresses the inequities of the failed Gonski implementation previously, given that David Gonski himself and his panel members believe it would be a grave mistake not to pass this bill. If the Labor Party is still committed to providing an extra $22 billion in funding, they can take that to the next election and it can be an election issue. 


I will talk about what this means for South Australia in due course in the committee stage. I believe that this is a very welcome bill in terms of the additional funding. I believe that if we knock this off, if we do not vote for this bill, it will lead to fundamental inequities and inequalities in the funding system being perpetuated. This is about getting the methodology right. The fact that David Gonski and the members of his panel are so enthusiastically fact in favour of this legislation is fundamental. 


I support this bill, as do my colleagues, with the improvements that we have been able to negotiate. I note that other crossbenchers have been working in good faith to improve this legislation. This bill will also lead to much more increased transparency, which is fundamental. That is something that I will speak about in the committee stages of this bill. In closing, I support the second reading stages of this bill. There are amendments that will even further improve it. This will be a good outcome for students around the country. I do not want to the perfect to be the enemy of the good, because this has very many good elements. It should be passed.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2017-06-21,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (12:03):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017, which provides for needs based school funding. This debate is not just about school funding, though. It is about our children. It is about equal opportunity and it is about our future. Today I speak on this bill to remind my colleagues to broaden their thinking beyond the here and now. In fact, I am asking my colleagues to think beyond the next 10 years. Constant squabbling amongst ourselves over issues as important as education funding, making changes to the education system every three or four years, only damages our children and, therefore, Australia's future. 


The Liberal government would have had an easier time negotiating with colleagues had the government included the opposition and the crossbench and the key stakeholders in the conversation a lot sooner. As I read through the submissions to the committee, the one thing most submissions had in common was a concern that there had been little to no consultation. I am thankful Minister Birmingham took time out of his busy schedule to fly to Tasmania to hear my concerns, but, if the schools and Minister Birmingham's colleagues in this place had been kept in the loop while this bill was put together, it would have received feedback sooner, allowing the minister to draft a solid bill.


This lack of consultation speaks to larger cultural issues within the Liberal government's ranks. The feedback I receive on a daily basis from key industry stakeholders on a variety of bills is that this government does not consult. This is a pattern of behaviour that has been allowed to develop, turning the Liberal government into its own worst enemy. Its consistent refusal to consult with key industry stakeholders and with its opposition and crossbench colleagues creates a mad rush to get the bill passed, as we have experienced this week. Instead of blaming our chaotic or feral Senate when bills do not pass, perhaps the Liberal government should sit down with its colleagues in the Senate to discuss our concerns well before bills are presented to the House. This prevents political games and mistakes being made. The point of a democracy is that all views are represented in parliament. As long as the Liberal government ignores those views, it will continue to have problems in the Senate. This culture of last-minute negotiations and decision-making is not conducive to considered and well-thought-out legislation and gives senators very little time to draft and present amendments to make for much better legislation and to give us a fair go.


Labor is not interested in this Gonski debate either. For me as an Independent, it is frustrating to see funds invested into a lengthy evidence based report and for the government of the day to bastardise the recommendations or cherry-pick recommendations to suit its political agenda. It is devastating to see governments play with the futures of our children, and therefore the future of our nation, for political gain. It is ironic that Labor proudly claims to roll out the full Gonski when it was the Labor government that compromised the true Gonski.


Do not get me wrong. I gave Labor the chance and the time to see Gonski through. A few years ago, I was approached by the Education Union when I expressed my disappointment in student outcomes, especially in Tasmania. They begged me to give it a couple more years. Well, I have done that. Oh, dear, I have done that! The NAPLAN results show there is no measurable improvement for Tasmania—absolutely none. It has not moved up a notch. In fact, there is negligible improvement across the nation. A media statement released by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority said:


… in recent years NAPLAN results have largely plateaued.


It asked the question, 'Is this good enough?' This is a good question. What are the major parties' ambitions for our children? Is the word 'okay' good enough, or should we have higher expectations for the young people who will eventually lead this nation? The education we give our children directly impacts nation-building and Australia's future. I would like to see our children reach their potential to be effective and ensure Australia continues to be the great country that it is. We now know that throwing enormous amounts of money at education is not the answer, but you do not throw out a broken model until you know the new one is better.


While I look forward to seeing a truly needs based, equal opportunity funding rollout, it still is not the answer to improving student outcomes. The answer lies in our teachers, who work hard and try their best but are not always provided with the support or resources to explore teaching students in a capacity that supports students' individual learning needs. As a start, the teaching degree must be treated with more respect. After all, teaching is circular in nature. If a teacher is taught well, that teacher is more likely to teach well. By providing a high-quality teaching degree, we encourage that sense of respect, and our teaching students will fulfil greater potential. By asking our students to complete postgraduate study, we create a greater knowledge base from which to teach our children.


While our teachers are studying at university, it should be a requirement that, on top of their practical work, they volunteer as a teacher aide every day, five days a week, from 10 to two. It is time for on-the-job training to begin again. We have lost this, and we are suffering because of this. Get them out of those universities in their second year, and get them on the job. During my time as a senator many schools have approached me about their need for more teacher aides and agonised over the lack of funding. Well, there is your answer: get them out of those universities and get them into schools. They will get on-the-job training and mentoring all in one. We are getting two for the price of one here. If university students were required to volunteer to be a teacher's aide they would not only receive real world experiences and develop mentor relationships with experienced teachers; they would also observe a variety of class behaviours and incidents. This would give them the tools and experience they need to deal with such behaviours as new teachers when they graduate. In addition, the schools and their students will receive the one-on-one support they need in the classroom without breaking the budget.


I emphasise that some things must be beyond politics. The Labor Party and the Liberal Party must stop playing games with issues that are vital to our country and our people. Education and health must be exempt from the political games that seem to be entrenched in this place. The good of the people and the future of Australia should be treated with greater consideration and sincerity.


I want to speak about children with disabilities. In the past—whether it be Veterans' Affairs or the NDIS—you have always underestimated the cost. I do not blame you for this; many of you have probably not experienced being sick and down and out, and what that costs. When you have not been on both sides of that game you underestimate terribly, and that is where you run into trouble. I want to make sure that our kids with disabilities are fully funded at all times. I do not want to see the divide in this country made any greater than it already is. That worries me terribly. If you cannot get this right in this model then I will be coming forward on the NDIS. I will be brutally honest with you: there are gaps in that, and I will push student funding for disabled students really hard and really fast. I want them well catered for and I want them to get the opportunity to be in normal classrooms if they are able to. It is not only great for them; it is also great for those students who do not have disabilities. They learn compassion. They learn how to deal with these matters. It gives them coping mechanisms for the rest of their lives. Everybody wins out with this. So I am really having a good look at this.


When it comes to the Catholic education system, I hope that they will continue on the same trajectory they are on right now until the review is over. I hope that what I have been told in that matter is the truth: for the next 12 to 18 months they will maintain everything they already have.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2017-06-21,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (12:13):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Amendment Bill. Around this time last year, before the federal election, I travelled 11,250 kilometres around country Victoria and New South Wales, and not once was the word 'Gonski' mentioned in that time. Of course, in recent weeks here that is all we have heard and in the past few hours that is all we have heard. I do not intend to speak very long; I just want to say that I will be endorsing, supporting and voting for this bill. When I first heard of the Gonski amendments, I had some doubts—and I think they were legitimate ones—especially relating to Labor's scare campaign about $22 billion; they turned me off with that. In the election campaign, I was talking about justice issues. As a senator, I am now forced to vote on education and other issues which were not part of my party platform and not what people put me here for; they put me here to do such things as a passport ban for paedophiles. But I am in this position and I may be one of those who ends up swinging this vote one way or the other. Frankly, the $22 billion Labor scare campaign was a lie. I do not like either side when you lie to me. I watched those TV commercials and talked to various people on the opposition bench. It was like me coming in here today and making a promise that, in 2045, I will give $60 billion to gambling casinos—because I am in favour of gambling—and then a new government comes in and decides they will cut $50 billion of that $60 billion and will not give it. So I then run a TV campaign saying the government are bastards; they have cut $50 billion from James Packer's coffers—$50 billion that was not there in the first place.


Now, I have said I will support this. I have had meetings with many interested parties. I sat down with two very inspiring mothers from the Broken Bay diocese to listen to their concerns about the SES and the discrepancies in it, and I have had assurances that these things will be looked at. Those women came all the way here and paid their own hotel bills because they are concerned about their kids. I am pleased to announce that I am going to support the Gonski bill, with the changes that I and others from the crossbench have actively advocated. I am proud to see that the changes will come into effect more quickly for those schools that so desperately need extra support and need it now. I am proud that an additional $4 billion or so will be invested in the Gonski program.


I am also pleased that we will be holding the state and territory governments to account to make sure that they uphold their end of the bargain in the years going ahead. I am pleased that the 10-year plan will be pushed back to six or seven years—six years, I think. I am also very pleased to acknowledge the Greens' idea, which is to have an independent body to provide a very much needed layer of transparency. I know the Greens have had to fight amongst themselves, but for some of these changes they have advocated very strongly indeed. So, I will be supporting this bill. I think we will get some extra money for Victorian schools. The money will come faster than was planned, better than was planned. It is a needs based scheme. And before I sit down, to steal from Neil Armstrong's apocryphal story about what he really said when he walked on the moon: good luck, Mr Gonski!

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (12:30):  Having not had the opportunity to make a couple of comments at the closing stages of the second reading debate, I do want to reflect upon the vote that was just taken. I am very pleased that the Senate has voted to bring this important bill into the committee stage, because that is a demonstration that this parliament is working and is committed to delivering the type of consistent, fair and needs based funding that Australian schools deserve. It is a demonstration that the members of this Senate have heard the arguments over the last few weeks and months, which have been clear-cut in terms of what the model is and what David Gonski himself and Gonski panellists like Kathryn Greiner and Ken Boston have advocated, and many other independent experts have argued for—and that is, that we are delivering a fairer model of needs based funding that is more consistent than the one the Labor Party put in place previously and which will strip away the 27 different special deals and disparate agreements that the Labor Party had in place. 


What we are putting in place now delivers increased support to Australian schools—$18.6 billion of additional funding that the Turnbull government committed this year—which will be distributed fairly and according to need, and will be used to drive real reform across the Australian education landscape and drive the types of reform that will ensure that schools, whether they are government schools, Catholic systemic schools or independent schools, receive the funding relevant to need for their individual circumstances. That, of course, is exactly what the Gonski report has been on about for a long period of time. Six years ago we saw the Gonski report handed down, which, at that time, demonstrated that there was an argument for putting in place a more consistent model of needs based funding around Australia. The Gonski report recommended that there should be a base level of funding for all Australian students, a schooling resource standard, that should, in the case of non-government education, be discounted according to the capacity of that school community to contribute. It recommended that there should be loadings for additional support for students with disability, for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, for Indigenous students, for students from language backgrounds other than English and indeed for smaller rural, regional and remote schools. All of those factors are reflected in the bill the Turnbull government has before us and in the model we are seeking to implement. 


But the Gillard government, as it was then, rather than going forward and deciding that they would truly work to adopt the Gonski model, decided that they could not possibly apply fewer models or a consistent funding model for Australian schools. Instead, as has been noted by Gonski panellist himself Ken Boston, what we saw was Mr Shorten, as the then education minister, and prime ministers Gillard and Rudd running around the country, stitching up different deals in what was described as 'a corruption' of the Gonski model. The Turnbull government has come to the rescue of the Gonski model of needs based funding. The Turnbull government is implementing what was envisioned would be the case, and we are doing so regardless of state boundaries and sectoral differences in education. We are putting in place a funding model that ensures that that schooling resource standard with its base funding and additional loadings is applied consistently right across the country.


We know from evidence that individual schools at present can receive thousands of dollars less in one state relative to another state, even if they have exactly the same levels of need within their school systems. That, of course, is a completely unfair and unacceptable circumstance. Why should a school student in Western Australia be treated at a disadvantage to a school student in New South Wales by the national government—the Australian government—just because they happen to be in a different state or territory? Why should a student in the Catholic education system in Tasmania be treated at a disadvantage to a student in the Catholic education system in Victoria just because they are in a different state or territory? What we want to ensure is that all are treated according to the need of their individual school and their individual circumstances and based on a consistent approach and methodology by the Commonwealth government.


What we have proposed to the Senate is a 10-year transition period for this. I anticipate, as we move through the debate, that there may be some variations to that and that those variations, if implemented, could see even greater benefits for school systems of all stripes. I anticipate that the types of amendments that have been mooted in the discussions with various members of the crossbench—and I thank them for their engagement—will deliver an even greater rate of funding growth in a shorter period of time to government schools across Australia. They will deliver an even greater rate of funding growth in an even shorter period of time to Catholic education systems across Australia, and they will deliver an even greater rate of funding growth in a shorter period of time to the neediest independent non-government schools in Australia.


Importantly, we are also looking at proposals that structurally would not change the long-term consequences for the budget and that structurally would still ensure that, although we will get to a consistent, fair and needs based model of funding in a shorter period of time, the long-term impact will be as the Turnbull government's proposals originally forecast. But it will provide faster support if these proposals are adopted by the Senate.


I want to reflect on the thoughtful engagement and contributions to date from the various elements of the crossbench. The Greens have been thoughtful contributors in the public debate on this issue, and I appreciate the fact that they have continued those discussions. I would welcome them continuing those discussions further to ensure that we have and will deliver needs based funding across Australia. The Australian Greens have shown the willingness that the Labor Party has lacked to actually adopt a sensible approach to these reforms.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  We have no confidence in you, Simon—that's why!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Collins and the noisy voices on the Labor Party side decided that just saying no was the best thing. Why have they done that? They have done that because they would much rather play politics with this issue than actually get an agreement and actually get needs based funding. What has become apparent with the Labor Party's handling of school reform is that it has never been, for them, about actually applying needs based funding consistently across Australia. It has been about using that as a political wedge instead. For Labor, it has always been about, 'How much more money can we spend and how do we use that as a political wedge?' Through this debate, they have been exposed. Their hypocrisy has been exposed and the reality that they were never genuine all along has been exposed. For them, it is about buying off different constituencies through special deals and putting in place something that ultimately serves their electoral advantage rather than the advantage of Australian school students.


Our intention is to ensure that there is a real model in place that does deliver for Australian school students—a model that delivers according to their need and treats them consistently. But, importantly, also, it is a model of reform that looks to how it is we can guarantee that education investment also gets the best possible results in the future, because it is really critical that, as we continue to see a growth in funding for schools right around Australia, we also see that that is invested in the best possible way. That is why the Turnbull government was delighted that David Gonski himself agreed to engage and to undertake a further body of work, the review, to achieve excellence in Australian schools—to ensure that the real problems and challenges in our schools are addressed and that the record growing funding that the Turnbull government will provide is actually record growing funding used to best effect of ensuring that our schools get the support they need, but also that they use those dollars as carefully and wisely as is possible to ensure educational advancement of their students in those schools around Australia.


That report will be critical to ensuring that next year states and territories in receipt of the second Gonski report, which identifies evidence based reforms and opportunities to maximise educational excellence in Australia, actually sign on to deliver those types of standards and reforms. We know that teacher quality is an essential component, the most important ingredient of school performance and in-school factors. We equally know that parental engagement is the most important other factor. We need to make sure that with additional funding flowing into the system we lift the quality of teachers, we enhance the engagement of parents, we ensure the relevance of the curriculum, we apply the support that is there to arrest what has been in some cases a stagnation and in others a decline of Australia's overall educational performance, and that this additional funding is used to the best possible effect for the future. I look forward to seeing many different parties engage with that second Gonski review.


I want to reflect on what it is that we are expecting state and territory governments to do as a result of these reforms. Our expectation is that state and territory governments must maintain the funding they have committed into their schools in order for additional funding to flow into the future. We want to make sure that there is no wriggle room for the states or territories to cost-shift, as has been the case previously; that there is certainty in relation to those state and territory governments and making sure that they pull their weight. In recent years we have seen at times that as the federal government has given more to state and territory governments for the neediest public schools in Australia, the states and territories, rather than investing that and ensuring there is additional support, have instead simply withdrawn an element of the funding support that they provide, which has provided no net advantage to those needy schools. We want make sure that if the Commonwealth is doing as we propose and increasing support, then the states and territories maintain their real effort as well. Through the mechanisms in this legislation and through our reforms we will achieve that.


We also want to ensure that states and territories are accountable for whether or not they are putting in fair support for their schools. Our approach of applying the same formula consistently across the country will allow people to hold state and territory governments to account and for those state and territory governments to justify their decisions about relative spending. The estimates are that with the Commonwealth government providing a 20 per cent share of the Schooling Resource Standard across the country consistently, that would see that school resource standing formula met in Western Australia and the ACT, and very nearly met in Tasmania; that South Australia would receive around 95 per cent of that standard; but that some other states and territories would fall short. We are keen to ensure that the transparency of this means that constituent bodies in those states or territories can question their state governments about why it is that they do not invest as much as another state or Territory, and those state governments can explain their rationale and in doing so justify that to their constituencies. For too long now there has been this notion of continually shifting the pressure and the blame onto Canberra in relation to school funding. Our model puts in place something that ensures consistency but also proposes what is a fair share of support from Canberra and then makes clear that is up to the states and territories to take responsibility in their systems, as the Constitution dictates. So by applying that type of approach we are confident that we can ensure state and territory governments themselves also have some accountability for their responsibility in school systems that they have run throughout the history of Federation.


But I want to emphasise to the Senate the government's gratitude for those who have supported entry into the committee stage. I want to emphasise that we are committed—

 (Victoria) (09:31):  The Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017 moves away from the fundamental objective that Labor enshrined in the legislation:


All students in all schools are entitled to an excellent education, allowing each student to reach his or her full potential so that he or she can succeed, achieve his or her aspirations, and contribute fully to his or her community, now and in the future.


Labor opposes both the principles and the practical effect of this legislation, which has continued to unravel every day that it has been subject to public scrutiny. The bill is fundamentally unfair to Australian children, and, consequently, I move:


Omit all words after ""That"", substitute ""the Senate notes that the bill:


(a) would result in a $22.3 billion cut from Australian schools, compared with the existing arrangements;


(b) removes extra funding agreed with states and territories for 2018 and 2019, which would have brought under-resourced schools to their fair funding level;


(c) locks in sector-specific payments of 80% Schooling Resource Standard (SRS) for non-government schools and just 20% for government schools, the very opposite of a sector blind model;


(d) sees the Commonwealth Government abandon all responsibility for ensuring that Australian students reach, at a minimum, 95% of the SRS;


(e) reduces funding to some wealthy overfunded schools, which Labor supports – however, it also increases funding for other overfunded schools, while cutting funding to some of our most vulnerable school students;


(f) would particularly hurt public schools, which receive less than 50% of funding under the Government’s proposal, compared to 80% of extra funding in Labor’s school funding plan; and


(g) results in only one-in-seven public schools reaching their fair funding level after 10 years"".


Let me repeat that point (f), because that is the point that seems to be lost when commentators suggest that the NERA, the National Education Reform Agreement, is dead. What the act and that agreement delivered was 80 per cent of extra funding for public schools, which this proposal brings down to just 50 per cent. I had prepared a traditional opposition second reading speech to present when we commenced consideration of this bill. But, I have to say, where we are now and where we are today is a complete and utter farce. Reading the commentary, reading the media, listening to the minister's statements leaves the opposition in the position now that there is simply no point in reflecting on the substantive provisions in the bill, because we do not know what this bill will turn into. The government has not been clear about what it is we are dealing with here now. Today, in the situation where we are in now, as the government engages in further negotiations, possibly with senators who are not fully appraised of the impact of the proposals that the government is putting to them, is just a short part, a small part of that picture.


So let me revisit the week before the budget, when the government first put these proposals into the public realm. Actually, let me take one step further back from there. Let me take you back to the ministerial council meeting ahead of that. This minister turned up to the ministers' council and suggested to them, on the basis of two case studies, that he needed to engage in what I would call a radical market experiment. That is what this government is doing in moving away from the core principle of the Gonski report. Senators might recall that I mentioned that core principle when I quoted a speech from David Gonski yesterday but let me remind you again today. This was the speech of David Gonski on 21 May 2014. He said:


Lost in the discussion for more money were the central tenets of our review. We advocated:


A. Funding to be unified i.e. given by state and federal governments to the different sectors together rather than states substantially only funding their school system and the bulk of Commonwealth funding being as a consequence paid to independent and faith-based schools. 


Embedded in this bill at 80 per cent. This was David Gonski's review's central—capital A—tenet, and this is what this bill moves away from. As I have said in my proposed second reading amendment, the consequences of that, the impact of that, is that what was planned to be 80 per cent of additional funding going to public schools will now—and remember it is less additional funding—be only 50 per cent of additional funding going to public schools.


But let me remind the Senate where we were before the Abbott government failed to proceed with the Gonski reform agenda. We had a consensus. We had public education—non-government education; both Catholic and independent, together. We had settled the school funding wars. But what has happened here now is those wars have indeed been reignited. I am described as a 'veteran' senator; I have been around here for more than 20 years, but I have never seen some of the sectarian debate that has occurred. I will get to what happened in the committee inquiry in a moment, but I have never seen something like yesterday's point of order during Committee of the Whole, talking about senators being ghosts of the DLP. As I said at the time, the DLP, which would have been relevant to my political participation concluded in 1978; I was 16 years of age. I was not a member of the DLP; I have member never been a member of the DLP. The only political party I have ever been a member of is the Australian Labor Party.




Senator Fifield:
  Did you hand out for them?




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I do not see how that is relevant, Senator.



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Here we go again! We are continuing it. Senator Fifield, I do not think you understand what this minister has unleashed. For you to suggest that what any senator here now might have done as a young child is at all relevant is appalling, and you are continuing the appalling behaviour which I will come to with Senator McKenzie soon.




Senator Fifield:
  I just thought it was funny.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  You might think it is funny, but sectarianism is not very funny. Let's move on to the important issue here, which is what a farce—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Collins. Senator Fifield?




Senator Fifield:
  On a point of order, Madam Deputy President: Senator Collins is misrepresenting my interjection. It was a lighthearted reference to whether she had, as a child—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  It is on the record.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Fifield, that is a debating point. Senator Collins.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Senator Fifield will have his opportunity in this debate. It is unfortunate that he did not take his opportunity in the cabinet. That is the problem. That we are now in this farce is the problem.


I was talking about the settlement that had been achieved during the Gonski 1.0 process, which was seriously damaged by the Abbott government's refusal to move beyond the four years of the six-year transition plan—the six-year transition plan that would have got most schools, in partnership with the states and territories, to a common student-resourcing standard. Mr Turnbull and Senator Birmingham have come in here with the glossy rhetoric that they are on the same path, and that is simply untrue. What Senator Birmingham has done is take what was a combined funding approach and turn it into a Commonwealth-share-only approach, which will never achieve the outcome that is needed here. It will never achieve the standard, the resources, for Australian schools that is required.


Senator Birmingham, Senator Brandis and others have verballed various of the players in this debate, but the best example of where we are today, which I saw in this morning's press in an opinion piece in the Australian newspaper, is that by Peter Goss, who basically at one stage says: we have got to accept that the National Education Reform Agreement is dead, but the Senate should seriously fiddle with Gonski 2.0 and add a national education reform agreement. So he is saying on the one hand that we have to get over the fact that this government killed the National Education Reform Agreement—and he tries to make comparisons solely on the act itself and suggests that our only option is the act as it currently stands and this bill—but then says, 'Oh, but we should go back to a national education reform agreement.' Of course we should! And that is where it should have stayed. 


This government criticised Labor for funding over the four years of the forward estimates, and it has been new to some senators in this debate to understand that states and territories do not have four-year forward estimates and it is a very difficult process to make states commit to ongoing funding over the forward years. This has been new information to many senators considering this debate. But look at this government's hypocrisy with this plan: 10 years, with only four years funded over the forwards. When you think about the rhetoric that was put on Labor about our four-year forward estimates of our six-year plan, you only need to reflect on this plan to see what hypocrisy that was.


So even if this government brings their plan—as has, again, been canvassed by commentators—down to eight years, or to seven or six years, it will still be four to six years too late; it will still be less funding that should be available; and there will be no commitment from states and territories to make their contributions. Let me remind people who are listening to this debate: for the contribution that was achieved with the states who became participating states and the other states that the government failed to bring into the package—the Abbott government failed to bring states who had agreed into the package—the offer there was two Commonwealth dollars for one state dollar. That is not on the table. How on earth does this government propose that we are going to bring the states into this arrangement? We do not know, and all that they say is, 'Um—we've deferred that till COAG next year.' What a farce!


The other element of this farce is the process farce, of course. The Senate inquiry: now, I accept the will of the Senate. Labor argued that we needed more time to address these matters in detail, and I thank senators for supporting my order for production of documents. To me, that does reflect that senators do now understand that there has not been adequate information and that there has not been proper consideration of the detail.


But, of course, another element of that Senate inquiry was the farce about how it was conducted. Firstly, and back to my point about sectarianism, for me to be accused on Twitter by the chair as running a protection racket for private schools which was eventually, after the hearing, finally withdrawn, is a joke. But add to that joke that the chair thinks that she can walk and chew gum at the same time. To me that is quite unethical chairing.


The other part of the joke, I think, was best represented by Crikey.com—not usually a friend of mine—which suggested that Senator McKenzie and Senator Hanson-Young were operating a tag team against me defending Catholic education. Since when does the Australian National Party form a tag team with the Greens to try to deny the Senate an opportunity to explore the details of a bill before it? This is, Senator Fifield, the sectarianism that I am referring to.


There has been a range of other commentary that is better not revisited. The point here is that these wars had been settled back in 2013, and should have been left that way. This government is not settling the education wars: it has reignited them! As I said, when we have a clearer picture of what the provisions in this bill are we will deal with those in detail during the committee stage. But until such time as we understand what this bill is going to contain there really is no point in commentating further, other than to ask senators to reflect on their position on these issues in the past.


In closing at this stage, I will ask Senator McKenzie to refer back to a press release she made on 13 March 2013, where she said:


Results show that the Federal Labor Government’s fundng model, which is supposed to address inequity, will result in 25 per cent of the lowest SES Catholic schools losing funding.


Senator McKenzie, that is actually today.


But then, for all these stories about scaremongering, let me remind Senator McKenzie of this one, again, from her press release:


Under the Gonski recommendations, the average fees for Catholic Schools could rise between 200 - 300 per cent.


And yet she and other members of the coalition attack Catholic education for highlighting what the changes in this bill do to assumptions around what level of fees, low-fee—particularly Catholic primary school—parents would need to pay. That is the example of the farce occurring here.


Government senators, other than a few, are being incredibly hypocritical. Senator Fifield and his colleagues should get their act together in cabinet and fix this!

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-06-21,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (09:50):  The Australian Greens have been abundantly clear all the way through this debate, since we saw the government's legislation, that we do not support the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017 in its current form. We have given effect to that by voting against it in the House of Representatives when the member for Melbourne, Adam Bandt, as a representative of our united party room on this issue voted against the legislation.


I am going to speak at some length in my speech about the principles with which the Australian Greens are approaching this issue, but before I do I want to briefly respond to some of the comments made by Senator Collins, who just resumed her seat. Firstly, she is claiming that Labor, when in government, 'settled the school funding wars'. I have rarely heard a piece of spin that bears so little relationship with reality.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Tasmania signed on when you were in cabinet!




Senator McKIM:
  I will take that interjection because I was actually the Minister for Education and Skills in Tasmania at the time.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  I know, and you signed on!




Senator McKIM:
  We did sign on.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Thank you!




Senator McKIM:
  That is right. Exactly. But what that does is give me an almost unique position in this chamber to know exactly what was going on at the time. I am going to tell you now, Senator Collins, what went on at the time. What went on at the time was that David Gonski, in his landmark, groundbreaking report, recommended a range of things, including a sector-blind, needs-based funding model. What Labor delivered was about as far away as you could get from a sector-blind, needs-based funding model. There were agreements with different sectors, different jurisdictions and different states and territories. Obviously, the one I was part of negotiating on Tasmania's behalf at the time was one of those. I have not actually counted those agreements, but there were a lot of them. The government is saying there were 27.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Twenty-seven!




Senator McKIM:
  I think Senator Collins, by interjection, has just agreed with that. That sounds about right.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  No, that is what they are saying.




Senator McKIM:
  It sounds about right: 27 separate agreements that were negotiated bilaterally.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You haven't fallen for this line, have you, Nick?




Senator McKIM:
  Senator Collins, I am going to continue here and I will not be shouted down by you.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! I just remind senators to make their comments to the chair. I remind other senators that it is disorderly to continue to interrupt.




Senator McKIM:
  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I will not be shouted down by Senator Collins here because I am going to place on the record what happened. There were 27 separate deals across sectors and across jurisdictions. They were negotiated bilaterally and no-one got to find out what any of the negotiations were with any of the other sectors in the education system in Australia or with any other of the states and territories. What we ended up with I think would be accurate to describe as a mishmash of different agreements where some sectors won and some did not travel so well, and where some states and territories had outcomes that they were happy with and some states and territories had outcomes they were not happy with.


Of course, during this process and ultimately before that process had finished, Labor called a federal election. I will remember the day they called that federal election because there were still negotiations ongoing and at least some states and territories ultimately did not finally and formally conclude their negotiations. That is what Labor left us with. History shows that the government changed and the Liberal government came into power.


That was a long time ago. I have to say that the current government—the Liberal-National government—in this country have been derelict in their responsibilities on education since then. This has dragged out in terms of the government arriving at a position for far too long. Now, typically, when they have arrived at a position they want to bring this bill on for debate here today to put pressure on this Senate to pass it. Ultimately, I want to say that the government's tactic of bringing this bill on today to commence the debate is a tactic clearly designed to place pressure on this chamber.


I also want to say that the government has been derelict in its duties in regard to the way that it has negotiated with the Australian Education Union—or, should I say, failed utterly not only to negotiate but even to respectfully communicate with the Australian Education Union. When I was minister in Tasmania, I had a face-to-face meeting with the president of the Tasmanian branch of the AEU once a month. I would sit down face to face with them, and we would talk about a range of issues that existed from both sides of the table. I am very confident to say that I had a very good relationship with the AEU in Tasmania, because of course the Greens view education principally as a public good. We also believe that federal funding into Australia's school system, whatever the sector, needs to be done on the basis of need and equity to ensure that all Australian children have the opportunity to fulfil their best educational opportunities.


Before I leave the subject of the Labor Party—and this was raised by Senator Collins herself in her speech where she swallowed the grenade and denied that we were seeing a return of the DLP in this place—I have sat for two question times in here this week, and Labor has asked question after question after question on behalf of the Catholic education system in this country and not one question on public schools from the Labor Party.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  A point of order.




Senator McKIM:
  The DLP is back. Do not worry about that.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McKim, resume your seat, please.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  The senator is misleading the Senate. That is simply not true.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is a debating point, thank you, Senator Collins.




Senator McKIM:
  We have all sat here and listened to question after question after question asked on behalf of the Catholic education system in this country. Labor will go out to the Australian people and claim to be champions of the public education system. But the true champions of the public education system in this place are the Australian Greens. Every time, we will attempt to do what is in the best interests of the public education system in Australia, because the people that we care about in the context of education debates are students in the public education system. We have been very clear about that. Our track record speaks for itself. If you look at the 27 different deals that Labor stitched up when they were last in government—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  That is what the AEU want.




Senator McKIM:
  a reasonable interpretation—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You can't even represent them properly.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator McKIM:
  Senator Collins, I will not be shouted down by you. I will not be shouted down by you, Senator Collins—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator McKIM:
  I simply will not be. Once Senator Collins is able to control herself, Deputy President, I will be happy to continue. All right. Thank you.


As I was saying about the 27 separate and disparate agreements stitched up by Labor when they were last in government, in no reasonable assessment can it be claimed that those 27 agreements—as Senator Collins is claiming—'settled the school-funding wars'. Any reasonable person watching the question times that we have had in the Senate this week will understand clearly who the Labor Party are operating on behalf of in this place. Believe me, they are not operating on behalf of the public school system, students at public schools and parents who choose to send their children to public schools. They are operating on behalf of the Catholic education systems in this country. I invite anyone who may be listening or may be reading theHansardof my speech later to go and check the record. It is all on the Hansard. Labor's questions have been designed to advocate on behalf of the Catholic system and prioritising that system to a far greater degree than they did the public system.


We are approaching this matter and the discussions that we are having at the moment based on the principles that we believe in and the policies that have been developed through our membership—in fact, by our membership. Uniquely in this place we have a set of policies designed and delivered to us by our membership, and also in broad consultation with key education stakeholders. These are the principles that we are taking into our discussions and consideration on this matter. Primarily for us, education is principally a public good. We also believe very, very clearly that differences in educational outcomes should never be a result of differences in wealth, differences in income, differences in power, differences in what possessions people have or differences in where people live.


We have always believed, and always will, in the Australian Greens that universal access to high-quality education is fundamental to Australia's economic prosperity, it is fundamental to our environmental sustainability, it is fundamental to our wellbeing as a people and it is fundamental to the social fulfilment of Australians. We believe, as a principle, that everyone in this country is entitled to a free, well funded, high-quality, lifelong public education and training system. We also believe that it is a primary responsibility of government to fund all levels of the public education system to a high quality, from early childhood education through to our schools system. This includes VET—vocational education and training—and tertiary education. We believe that because, as I said, we have a view and a principle that everyone is entitled to a free, well funded, high-quality public education and training system.


It is also a key principle of the Greens that federal funding to Australia's school education system, which includes both public and non-government sectors, should be done on the basis of need and equity, to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to maximise their educational outcomes. As I said, David Gonski, when he released his landmark report, recommended a sector-blind needs-based funding model. That is not what we got from Labor at the time. It is just not. And no matter how loudly and at how much length the Labor Party try to claim that what they delivered was in line with what David Gonski recommended, no matter how loudly, no matter what spin Labor put on it, any reasonable, fair-minded person, if they have a look at what Labor delivered when they were last in government at the Commonwealth level, is going to conclude that what Labor delivered was not a sector-blind needs-based funding model.


In fact, when I was minister in Tasmania I introduced a new funding system for government schools in Tasmania—the Fairer Funding model. That was, and perhaps still is—I have not done an analysis, but at the time that was the funding model, of anywhere in Australia, that was the most faithful to David Gonski's principles. It only applied to the way we distributed money within the public school system in Tasmania, but it was a genuine needs-based funding model that allowed us, with the extra money that was flowing to Tasmania as a result of the agreement that we signed with Labor, to deliver significant school funding increases to every single public school in Tasmania. The minimum funding increase in the school resource packages of public schools in Tasmania, once we had implemented that model, was five per cent. Some schools got up to 40 per cent more money in their school resource packages—nearly half as much again as they had the previous year. I introduced, as minister, a genuine needs based funding model for distributing money amongst public schools in Tasmania, because I believe in a needs based funding model. I believe in it. I believed in it to the degree that I implemented it when I was minister in Tasmania. I still believe today that what Australia should have is what David Gonski recommended: a genuine needs based funding model. That is not what we have in this country at this time. It is just not.


Another principle that the Australian Greens have is that when decisions are made by government in the context of our education system and our school system, those decisions should be arrived at as a result of input from teachers and their representatives, from academics and experts in education, from unions representing teachers and academics, and ultimately, most importantly, through consultation with parents of children in Australia's education system, and, in fact, those students themselves.


We want to see—and this is the way we are approaching this issue—a public school system that is recognised as amongst the best in the world. There is no reason why this country cannot have a public system that is the envy of the rest of the world, but we are a long way from that. If you look at the way we have journeyed through the PISA rankings in recent times, we are heading in the wrong direction.


No-one who knows their way around education would suggest that simply by throwing funding at the school system we can achieve the outcomes that we want. The challenges are more complex than that, and there are a range of public policy measures that need to be put in place in order for us to deliver what the Greens want to see, which is a public education system in Australia that is recognised as amongst the best in the world. However—and this is important—extra funding certainly helps. It certainly helps.


One of the reasons we were not prepared to back the government's legislation in the House of Representatives, and why I am very comfortable rising here today in the Senate and saying the Greens do not support this legislation in its current form, is that the funding that was concurrent with this legislation simply was not enough. It is no secret that funding increases are one of the things that are front and centre in our minds as we work through this issue. As I said, we want to see schools' funding provided on the basis of equity and need, and we also want to see funding levels based on a transparent standard that recognises the real costs of educating students to a high level. We acknowledge and we want to see public schools being fully funded at a high level, including the full cost of addressing disadvantage. The mechanism to deliver that, of course, is the mechanism recommended by David Gonski, which recommended loadings based on specific areas of disadvantage, whether that be a location or whether that be, for example, a student with disabilities.


Our principles on this issue are abundantly clear. They are the principles that will guide us as we work through this issue in whatever time remains available to us, but Australian people can rest assured. The evidence is there from question times this week that the Australian Greens, front and centre, are the party, when you compare it with Labor, that has public education at the front of its mind. When you look at question times, as I said, the evidence of where Labor are coming from on this issue is abundantly clear. They are asking question after question about the Catholic sector in this country. The party that always champions itself as the party of public education, I am sorry to say, is morphing before our eyes. I am at a loss to understand why question after question from Labor was about the Catholic system in this country. (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (10:10):  I rise to make a brief contribution to this debate on the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017. We have been hearing a lot about education funding and the need to reform, for the simple reason that children around Australia, for some years now, have been funded differently, with some 27 different agreements that have been struck by the previous Gillard government with states and territories. The community has been calling for some time for a fair and transparent system that will provide an equitable funding base for students. Speaking from a South Australian perspective, the agreement that was reached in South Australia—and I have spoken to a range of school sectors there—has seen many sectors with a very flat trajectory and increases only in the very latter part of what the agreement with the Gillard government had promised. They have maintained for a number of years that South Australian schools have not been treated well, for the simple reason that the level of funding has not been on par with interstate colleagues. What this agreement looks to do is to find and define a new baseline and bring all students from all states to a common point. Over a number of years, you will get that transition of increasing funding for students.


It is important to realise that, whilst there is the independent sector, the Catholic sector and the state sector, it is not only the federal government that provides funds to these schools. There are two particular concerns that I would like to briefly address as we look at this funding. First off, for state schools, it is state and territory governments that actually provide the majority of funding to those schools. So, when people see figures that highlight what the federal government provides to the different sectors and many people ask me why it is that the state schools seem to receive so little, it is because the primary responsibility for those state schools rests with the state governments. So if you look in net terms at what the taxpayer pays, whether that is through GST given to the states who then pass it on to the schools or whether that is funding given directly from the federal government to state schools, the state system is completely, or almost completely, funded by the taxpayer, whereas private schools do not receive the same extent of funding from states, and the majority of taxpayer subsidy for them comes through federal funding, with parents—often not high-income parents—working hard to make sure that they raise the additional funding to give children the schooling of the parents' choice. For many parents, it may come down to academic issues. For some, it may come down to issues of a faith-based education. But what we see is that all parents who are taxpayers pay money through their taxes, and the state and federal governments each make a contribution. But those who choose to pay extra not only take stress off the state system but pay for the quality and type of education that their children want.


The second point I would make, particularly around this current debate, is on the funding for Catholic schools. I have received a number of emails from people in the last few days talking about the funding for Catholic education. I just remind people who are listening to this debate that it was actually the Liberal Party and the coalition government who originally championed and pushed for the ability of parents to make that choice, and we have been a consistent supporter of funding schools of various kinds so that parents can make the choice as to where their children go. Those who wish for them to go to an independent or Catholic school top that up with fees.


The Catholic school system also makes its choices about where it allocates that taxpayer funding. So, part of the confusion in this debate is twofold. One aspect is that when people see some of the computer models that forecast the amount of funding that will be provided to a school they are seeing the SES based funding, such that the demographic of that school leads to the level of funding that will be attracted. That does not necessarily equate to the funding the school receives under the Catholic system. Under the Catholic system they receive a bulk payment, if you wat to simplify the term, from the federal government, and they can then distribute that funding as they see fit within their school system. Some of the people who have contacted me have looked at what their school has been receiving through the Catholic system and then compared it with what is on the website for an estimator and saying, 'We appear to be receiving less funding.' But the way the Catholic system has always worked is that they have taken a bulk payment from the federal government and then distributed it across the schools in their diocese or in their network according to how they have calculated the need of the school. So you cannot necessarily say that there will be less funding, because it depends very much on what the Catholic system wants to distribute.


The fact of the matter is that the Catholic system as an aggregated whole is receiving more funding year on year from the federal government under these arrangements, which is why you cannot say that schools are going to have to increase their fees as a result of federal government decisions, because the federal government is actually giving the Catholic system more money. If the Catholic system chooses to distribute that differently, that is up to them, but they have more money from the federal government to distribute to their school, so there is no school in any system—and certainly I can say this for South Australia—that will receive less money as a result of these changes. Every school in South Australia receives more money as a result of the changes this government is making.


The last area that is important to highlight is around what people have been saying in the media and in some of the letters I have received, particularly responding to comments from members opposite—that there have been cuts. Well, the reality is that the forward estimates—the four-year period—has in Australia's history always been the period when governments lock in and commit to spending, because the amount we have to spend should surely be based on what we can reasonably expect to have coming into the government, through individual corporate tax and through a range of revenue-raising measures. How far out can you predict that? If we said, 'Look, we think that in 100 years this will be happening,' people would laugh. In 50 years? People still would be pretty uncertain, or if we said in 20 years. You can bring it back four years. That, for many decades, has been the period for which governments can reasonably predict what our income will be and therefore what expenditure will be.


Prior to the 2013 election the Gillard government made promises going well into the future about very large amounts of money that they had not actually budgeted for. They could not explain where it might come from and could not give any guarantees. But that is the benchmark they are now claiming in saying that the record funding this government is giving to education is somehow a cut. So, people in the public are often—rightly—confused, because they hear one side of politics talking about cuts and the other side saying, 'Well, no, we're actually increasing funding.' I think it is really important for people who are listening to this debate to understand this. And I think Senator Xenophon made the comment that this is comparing apples with mythical pears. That funding in 2013 was a mythical pear that was held out as a promise but it was completely unfunded and there was no justifiable basis for how the Labor Party could ever deliver it. Yet, that is what people are now trying to say is the basis upon which the coalition government—they are saying—is cutting funding. That is just not correct. 


We are delivering record amounts of funding this year to education. Every sector is receiving more funding. In South Australia's case, every single school is receiving more funding, which is why we have seen organisations such as the South Australian Primary Principals Association come out and say that this is a good deal for South Australian children. We have seen Catholic colleges, like Nazareth Catholic College, come out and say that this is a fair deal and a good deal, and we have seen independent schools and Christian schools come out and say that this funding model is good for South Australia. Because it is good for South Australian children and restores equity and transparency around the nation, I support this bill.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-06-21,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (10:21):  The Australian Conservatives believe in evidence based spending of government funding and resources. We are rightly concerned about the evidence that has been put forward by the minister with respect to this funding. We are rightly concerned about the principles applied by the minister in determining this policy position. And, as a former longstanding member of the Liberal Party, I am deeply concerned about the complete abandonment of Liberal values and principles by the government. 


This bill, this policy mix, is yet another example of how the Liberal Party has completely lost the plot and jumped into bed with the big spending, big taxing ideas from the other side of the chamber. Their selling point to me to convince me to vote for this bill is: 'It would be worse under Labor. We are slightly less bad than the Labor Party. If we can't do a deal with you, Senator Bernardi, we will do one with the Greens and it will be worse.' All of those things may be true. But it does not negate the fact that that is not how we should be deciding public policy in this place. We should be looking at outcomes and this is an expenditure which violates, I think, the most basic principles of governance. 


They have dressed it up in the guise that it is going to lock in security for the next 10 years for schools funding. That is absolutely nonsense, because whatever they decide they want to lock in can be changed by subsequent governments. They have adopted exactly the same process, which is a smoke-and-mirrors load of baloney that the other side put up under Gonski 1.0. They are saying: 'We're going to lock this money in. It won't be changed.' Then, when the opposition become the government, they seek to change it. Of course they can. It is unfunded beyond the forward estimates. We are fooling ourselves if we think a government can bind future governments on a recurrent expenditure process like this. It is a con. It is a 'conski'. It was 'conski 1.0'; it was rightly criticised by the Liberal Party and the coalition. Now they have 'conski 2.0', which is exactly the same thing but 'slightly less bad'. That does not cut the mustard. 


They are saying they are 'slightly less bad' and they are going to do a better job. But they neglect to reflect on what I would call the key performance indicators: literacy and numeracy. Their policy is, 'We're going to throw money at this and hopefully it will turn out better for students'. There is zero accountability built into this program. 'Let's get the money, throw it in, and then we will decide how it's going to impact our students and our children later on'. 


Much has been said in this place in recent years about record funding for education, yet the statistics are quite damning. We are ranked 25th in maths, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Program for International Student Assessment, which ranks 15-year-olds. That is barely above the OECD average and trails Vietnam and Russia. We are ranked 16th in reading, behind Poland and Slovenia. We are 14th in science. If you look at the trends of the international rankings in maths and science, we trail many countries, including Russia and Kazakhstan. In fact, we are ranked 28th for nine- and 10-year-olds. That is a fall of 10 places from the same survey five years earlier. We are ranked 18th for 13- and 14-year-olds in mathematics, 26th for nine- and 10-year-olds and 17th for 13- and 14-year-olds in science. In almost every ranking we trail New Zealand. 


So, more money is not the answer—yet both sides of this chamber boast about record spending on education. The big problem we have in education is that they are not teaching our children how to read and write. Children are not learning the literacy and numeracy that they need. That traditional teaching ethos has been abandoned in favour of things like Safe Schools, which I note the education minister defended from pillar to post, notwithstanding the evidence that was presented to him. He had a mock review of it, which was a dud, and he still went into bat for it. It is not about the outcomes; there is an agenda here, an ideology, that is underpinning this, and it is a fraud. It is a fraud because it is failing our students and it is conning the Australian people, suggesting that anyone who is opposed to this funding is apparently somehow for poorer outcomes for students. That is absolutely wrong—but Australian taxpayers do deserve value for money.


I also reject the notion that some students are more deserving than others. If we want our children to achieve the best possible education outcomes then each child should be equal. Each child should be funded equally. I note that the education minister, in his first speech—of course, you are full of bravado in your first speech; you can say what you think—said, 'Why don't we trial education vouchers?' The problem is he has abandoned that. He is now in a position to do something about it and he has abandoned that value, he has abandoned that principle, just like the Liberal Party have abandoned their criticism of 'conski' 1.0. What a metamorphosis we have seen. It was a con, and then at an election you had then education minister Christopher Pyne, the mentor for Senator Birmingham, promising that Gonski 1.0 would be funded and that they were absolutely committed to it. Now here they are trying to pull their own 'conski' on the Australian people. This is a complete abandonment of principle.


I suspect that there are some hardheads in the coalition who recognise they are staring down the barrel of electoral defeat because of the decisions that they have made in recent years, and they have decided that if you can't beat them, you might as well join them. I am not joining them in their socialist nirvana. They can have that to themselves. The Australian Conservatives will stand alone as principled conservatives that are determined to get good taxpayer value for money and good outcomes. We are determined to have key performance indicators to measure the success of programs rather than throw money at them and hope the problems all go away into the politically too-hard basket—and that is precisely what has happened here. Two wrongs do not make a right, and for the coalition government to be aping the Labor Party and the Greens party and chasing this unfunded 'Starship Conski', as I would call it, is absolutely wrong.


We, the Australian Conservatives, will be seeking to improve very bad legislation by saying that the funding for this program should exist only as far as the government has budgeted for it. That means over the forward estimates. It is nonsensical to promise a 10-year program. What is next—a 20-year program to education? We could play at one-upmanship the whole time. We could operate a 50-year program of $500 billion going into education. We will not spend any of it, or very little of it, now; but I promise you that in years 45, 46 and 47 we will put $100 billion into education in those years. It is nonsensical. No-one would believe it. Why would we believe this now? It is a con. Shame on those who are perpetrating this on the Australian people. On the one hand they say the Catholic sector will not be disadvantaged, and yet the evidence in the modelling suggests that $4 billion is going to be taken out of the Catholic sector and put into the public sector. Even though the minister denies that again and again, he will not release the modelling. I have had a senior minister come to me and say that the Labor Party's $40 billion Gonski 1.0 is legislated and there is nothing they can do about it; so unless I support this bill the Australian taxpayers will be $20 billion worse off. But when I raised that with the education minister, he said, 'No, that is not entirely true.' So in the same cabinet room they do not even know what they are trying to convince us of. 


I know the minister is making the point that he has the crossbench all locked away. The threat is, 'We'll do a deal with the Greens and it will be much worse.' What sort of policy program is this? It is blackmailing over a system that is going to impact every child in this country. There are no key performance indicators in it. There is not one basis that says that if the school does not achieve a higher literacy or numeracy rate, the funding will diminish. There are no performance indicators. You might as well just throw it into a big black hole and say, 'Let's hope it comes out the other end.'


I am not buying that. I think it is absolutely wrong that governments think they can borrow money from future generations and scatter it wildly and hope that some of the seeds take root. It is a flawed thing. It was flawed when the Labor Party did that. I remember, when the coalition government had some principles left, they identified it as a con. It was underfunded; it was undemocratic; it was absolutely false. And now they are doing exactly the same thing. This has become a witch's brew of leftist policies in this place, and everybody is having their sip of it—eye of newt and tongue of ox, or whatever they want to put in there.


But in this little wedge—and it is a tiny wedge; there is only me right now, but I welcome anyone else—we are rejecting the witch's brew. We are going to continue to put forward ideas that are responsible, that are funded, that will get meaningful outcomes, that will ensure that parents have choice, that will ensure that education standards rise and that our children are not being done a long-term disservice because we feel that by simply throwing money at a problem it will go away. If money were the answer to success, then Collingwood would probably win a grand final every second year, because they spend more than anyone else. But it does not work like that. It does not work in education and it does not work in government. 


I feel that I cannot trust anything that is being put to me in respect to this funding by members of the government. That is a very hard thing to say, but I do not believe what they are telling me. Their own people do not believe what they are being told. They tell me that they have been told one thing and then one of their colleagues is told something different. I reckon it is a massive con job. It is designed to fix a political problem rather than solve an education issue.


And it is an issue, because I think the education system is failing our kids. Yes, they might learn about gender theory or this or that, but it is not much good if they cannot write a sentence coherently. It is not much good if they cannot be literate and numerate and they cannot calculate the change from $5 when they are buying a cup of coffee or tea, which is the lived experience. When I was running a business, I employed a year 12 graduate who could not mentally calculate the change from $5 for a cup of coffee. You just ask yourself: how did we get to that circumstance? And they graduated year 12 with good marks, and they got entry to university! But no matter what it qualifies you to do in academia, if you do not have those practical skills, it is a dud. And we are getting worse. This is the great problem. We are getting worse by any standard, as we saw when I went through the trends in international maths and science.


So I am deeply concerned about this. I will try and improve it by limiting the indexation, which is an amendment that I think Senator Leyonhjelm is going to produce. I will support the funding model if it is limited to the forward estimates, where the government is accountable and has to budget for it. But I will not support some random figure that is unfunded and unaccountable and has no measurable statistics. I encourage those on the crossbench, those who are serious about getting positive outcomes, to get the government to rethink this policy—not to do a deal with the Greens or with Labor but to rethink this policy so that it actually has some bite; so that it places some responsibility on the school system to do better by our students; so that it is responsible with taxpayers' money; so that it does not lock in a three per cent funding rise if inflation is only one per cent; so that it does not lock in guaranteed ongoing funding for particular schools if they are failing our students just because parents do not have a choice about where they can send them; and so that it does not provide funding if schools are not delivering absolutely positive results for our kids. These are the problems that we face. This is a very expensive fix for a political problem that the government has. It does not want to fight a campaign against the AEC or the Labor Party about being different on education. It is preparing for its next election and it is doing taxpayers a massive disservice in the meantime.


I cannot foresee a way, based on what I know, where I can support this bill. It is because I do not trust the government, who have abandoned their principles; I do not trust the information I have been given; and I do not respect a policy that is going to promise to spend borrowed or taxpayers' money with no meaningful outcomes.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-06-21,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (10:37):  We are talking about the educational program, which is very important to all Australians. I can understand what Senator Bernardi is saying about the funding. One Nation has been having extensive talks not only with the government but with interested groups like Catholic schools, education, parents and Labor. We have sat down to try and find some common sense in where we are headed with this. We will be supporting the government's Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017, but I do have a few things to say about it.


The Labor Party have been talking about there being a cut under this bill of $22 billion. My understanding is that it is a lie. There is no cut of $22 billion. It is like Labor have gone out there and promised: 'We were going to be putting an extra $30 billion into the educational funding. Now the government is bringing it back to $18.6 billion, so therefore Australians have lost $22 billion.' No, you can have your wish list; you can go out there and say, 'We're going to give you this money,' but unless it is actually there on paper, in black and white—I can go out and say, 'I'm going to give you $1,000,' when I only have $500 to give. Unless you produce it, don't go out there telling lies to the public. That is exactly what they are doing now.


They are out there making these robocalls around Queensland saying, to all the workers at the coalmines there: 'This is the CFMEU and we're ringing you to tell you that Pauline Hanson's One Nation is supporting the Liberal Party and they're going to cut $22 billion out of government funding. This is a real cut to you. She's destroying educational funding.' This is another lie. This is basically like Labor's 'Mediscare'. You lie to people, you are not up-front with people, you are hypocrites. I would suggest, if you have to pull these dirty tactics and stunts on people to get back the votes in Queensland, that if you were honest with people, if you were up-front with people, you might do a better job than you are doing now. But the people are waking up to you.


My concern about this is: why do we need another $18.2 billion thrown at this when the federal funding for education now is just under $88 billion? On top of that there is state funding as well as parents who pay fees to send their kids to schools. When I went to school we did not have all this money thrown at us. Our education levels are dropping. Australia used to be very high on the list of educational standards, but we are dropping. People say it is because of lack of money—'Let's throw more money at it.' Throwing money at it is not always the answer, and I do not believe it is the answer now. We have lost control over our classrooms. But I think the main issue here is that we have lost the quality of teachers, because over the years these do-gooders who want everyone to feel good about themselves have come into the education system saying to kids: 'You're all right; you don't have to compete in the classroom, you don't have to have grades, you don't have to perform to be top of the class, so we're going to take grading away. We're not going to tell your parents whether you got 40 per cent or 85 per cent, because we want you to feel good about yourselves.' They are not competing.


I am telling you, that is what the real shock in our society is, because the kids are not competing in the classrooms and they are not competing when they get out of the classrooms either. When they get out into the real world and into the workforce, there is no competition, and life is about competition; it is about striving to do the best you can. Unless you know what standard you are at, how do you know how much further you have to strive? I have spoken to the education minister about this—that things need to change. It is not about throwing more money at it; it is about how we can improve our educational standards.


It is absolutely pathetic, seeing the way children write—or that they cannot write. We used to have a decent standard of handwriting called 'running writing'. Now kids are flat out even learning how to write, let alone do maths. And maths is not a prerequisite in every classroom. They cut out maths. In some schools you do not necessarily have to learn maths, science or even English. They are the basics that we need as part of our education for the rest of our life. And as Senator Bernardi said, kids cannot add up. How right that is. In my shop, we had the till there, and the till would tell you what change to give, but when we had blackouts the young staff did not even know how to count money out. Unless the till tells them how to do it, they cannot calculate—they cannot work out anything in life—because they are not taught the maths. We are relying for everything on computers, on calculators, and in real life that is not always at your fingertips to use.


We need to go back to the basics. In the classroom there is a lack of discipline. The teachers are told that they cannot discipline the kids. And our educational system is now teaching the kids their rights. They say, 'Your parents can't tell you what to do, because you have your rights.' Then when the kids go home their parents tell them something and the kids say, 'You can't tell me that; I know my rights.' Parents have that right. This is what the problem is in our education system. Kids need to know that if they do the wrong thing they will be disciplined, and teachers should have control over their classrooms. A lot of teachers want that.


Regarding the push for Safe Schools, most parents I talk to don't want that. They think it is a load of rubbish and they do not want their kids to be confronted with this. Yes, it has been forced onto the kids in some schools.


I hope this whole package works for our kids and for our education system. It will be brought before the board and I will continue to talk to the education minister with regard to bringing in maths and science and on the issue of the quality of our teachers, and stopping pushing them through the education system. What we especially need to stop is this attitude that everyone must go on to university. No, they do not. If you have kids who are not academically minded it would be better to get them on the tools or in the trade. Why don't we push that? Why don't we give them a better understanding so that businesses can go to classrooms and tell them what it is like to be a plumber, an electrician or an IT professional, or something else, rather than peer pressure saying to them that they must go on to university.


At the end of the day the is no real qualifying level you need to get into university. We have peer pressure making everyone feel they have to go to university. It will be a cost to the taxpayer and the student will never pass. It is like, 'I've been to university. Which one did you go to?' without there being a standard for education. Let's give kids the opportunity to choose other professions. Let them leave at year 10, if they are not academically minded, instead of keeping them in the education system just to bolster the figures so that they are not on Newstart or youth allowance and are not in the unemployment queues. Give them opportunity to go on to other trades.


That leads to TAFE colleges. TAFEs are being shut down. They are not getting the funding that is so important to a lot of young people who do not want to go on to further education in our universities. It needs to be funded and looked after. I will be supporting that for the TAFE colleges, and the government will look at it. I know the TAFEs have been under a lot of pressure.


The Catholic schooling systems have been concerned about this issue. They take up a lot of the slack—not only the Catholic schools but a lot of other non-government education centres. They are trying to do their best to educate a lot of people across the country. There has been talk about who is getting money and who is losing money and where the funding is coming from. The government is going to give non-government schools 80 per cent of this funding—they do not get state funding—and the state schools will be getting 20 per cent of the funding. On average, for each child at primary school there will be just over $10,000 and for each child at high school there will be approximately $13,000 funding. This package will give around 3.7 per cent in extra funding per child.


I thank Senator Back for the issues he has raised and which he spoke to us about. The government needs to look at whether this funding is going to have an impact on some schools, especially those in the lower socioeconomic areas, and whether will they close. That concerns me greatly. I am pleased to hear that they are actually going to put in place a requirement that that be reviewed in a year's time. I think that is very important as it will give it time to settle in and see that it is working. Senator Bernardi said that he does not want to take it over the 10 years. My concern is that schools and everyone else needs to know what is happening in the future. They plan further ahead than that.


If you only do it at four years, my concern is that, if Labor gets in at the next election, it will blow completely out of proportion. They will make all these wishes and throw billions more dollars at it without dealing with the real problem. There will be money spent that we will not have. I hate to think what Labor would throw at funding for the schools, because we cannot afford it. Like I said, it has been a real issue for One Nation to come to a decision on whether to support this at an extra $18.6 billion to the Australian taxpayers. But I hope that this will improve our educational standards if it is addressed in the classroom. I think that is what is very important about it. 


There is another thing that we need to address, and I will go back to the classrooms again. I hear so many times from parents and teachers whose time is taken up with children—whether they have a disability or whether they are autistic—who are taking up the teacher's time in the classroom. These kids have a right to an education, by all means, but, if there are a number of them, these children should go into a special classroom and be looked after and given that special attention. Because most of the time the teacher spends so much time on them they forget about the child who is straining at the bit and wants to go ahead in leaps and bounds in their education. That child is held back by those others, because the teachers spend time with them. I am not denying them. If it were one of my children I would love all the time given to them to give them those opportunities. But it is about the loss for our other kids. I think that we have more autistic children, yet we are not providing the special classrooms or the schools for these autistic children. When they are available, they are at a huge expense to parents. I think we need to take that into consideration. We need to look at this. It is no good saying that we have to allow these kids to feel good about themselves and that we do not want to upset them and make them feel hurt. I understand that, but we have to be realistic at times and consider the impact this is having on other children in the classroom. 


We cannot afford to hold our kids back. We have the rest of the world and other kids in other countries who are going leaps and bounds ahead of us. Unless we keep up a decent educational standard in this country we will keep going further backwards and backwards, and our kids will not be the ones who are getting the good jobs in this country. They will be bringing in people from overseas and filling positions in this country that belong to our children. Our education is very important, and I feel that it needs to be handled correctly and we need to get rid of these people who want everyone to feel good about themselves. Let us get some common sense back into our classrooms and into what we do. Like I said, One Nation has spoken to many areas. Have we got it right? I hope we have got it right, because it is very important. 


I see so much in this place. It is the blame game, and Labor opposes so much all the time just because they are in opposition. It is a pity that parliamentarians in this place do not sit down and really have clear discussions with each other and find what is best for the people, because they are sick and tired of this. Labor, you said that you wanted to throw money at this. I think the $18.6 billion is a good start. It is a start. Why can't you work with the government on this, and then build on that? If this money is not going to the place where it is supposed to, and if it does need more funding, then work together to increase the funding. Stop opposing things just because of the fact that you are in opposition. It is about working together for the future of this nation. I just get so frustrated with the whole lot here, because I know people want the right answers. Not everyone—and I have heard it from those who are Liberal voters—is entirely happy with this package, whether they are hearing the right message not. 'What is right?' is a tough decision to make, but at least this is a step in the right direction, and that is what we are trying to do. One Nation is trying to handle this in a way that gives assistance to all those parents and schools, and extra funding for educational policy. That is One Nation's stance on it. We will be supporting the government on this bill.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2017-06-21,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:54):  It gives me great pleasure to stand in this chamber this morning and speak to the government's Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017. I chaired the Senate committee that was tasked to perform an inquiry into this bill, just as I sat on the Senate committee that was tasked to inquire into the original Australian Education Bill, where unfortunately we saw the implementation of David Gonski's panel's recommendations corrupted, in the name of panel members, corrupted by a Gillard government desperate to maintain power and desperate to get a deal done with the states and different systems. Now, a few years down the track, that sees Australian students treated very differently depending on where they live. 


As somebody who has come from the education sector—I was a secondary teacher and a lecturer in the Bachelor of Education at an institution in my home state of Victoria—I have a deep and abiding interest in ensuring that every single Australian student, no matter where they go to school, receives an excellent education. The people that I represent, the constituency at the very heart of the National Party's ethos, is rural and regional Australia. Of the nearly one million country kids attending school outside capital cities, the vast majority are attending state schools at the primary and secondary level. What we see right now, under the existing act and its provisions, is that state school students in one state, for instance Western Australia, are being treated very differently by the Commonwealth government than students with the same level of need by the New South Wales government. 


For us here in the Commonwealth parliament, in the Senate chamber, that brings all states together, that is just is not fair. Let the states argue their specific vested interests in their space and for their specific education budgets; but here in this place we need to take a national review. We need to ensure that every Australian child is treated the same by this place. What we have been able to achieve in the provisions of this bill is to ensure that if you attend your local Catholic primary school, your small independent Christian school, your local Jewish school or your local state primary school, you will be treated the same by the Commonwealth government according to your needs. That is only fair and just, and that is how we should be approaching education policy in this country.


We know that we have been spending record amounts of funding over time. In the report released by the OECD even as late as last week we are not doing well when it comes to quality education and student outcomes. At the end of the day, this is not about staff student ratios; it is not about how long school goes for how shiny your building is or who has the equestrian centre and who has not. This is about the outcomes for Australian students. We need to ensure that they have a high-quality education equipping them for the jobs of the 21st century. It should not matter which school they go to in determining that. 


What we do know and what research tells us is that students come into classrooms with a different set of needs. These needs affect their capacity and ability to engage in the schooling system. So Gonski and the former Labor government identified, and indeed it is reiterated in our own bill here today, that there are a series of loadings that ensure that those levels of need are actually funded, so that those students who are of Indigenous descent, who attend rural and regional schools, or who have to attend school with a disability—all of those factors are taken into account in the needs based funding model. The only people complaining about this bill and the enactment of a needs-based, sector-blind funding model of those people who have had sweetheart deals for way too long. Like we stand up and critique vested interests in the business sector and in the union sector, so too we call out vested interests in this area which are actually undermining the delivery of a high-quality, needs-based, sector-blind funding model to every Australian student.


These changes get rid of the opaque and unfair system entrenched by the previous government. I note Dr Ken Boston, a panellist for the original Gonski review in 2011, has described what occurred under the previous, Labor government as a 'corruption of the Gonski report'. You would think the Labor Party would be getting on board the rectification of that corruption right here, right now, today. However, they continue to do what they always do and play cheap political games with the lives of Australian students, and it is simply not on. I commend every senator in this place who is seriously considering why this Commonwealth parliament should not treat every Australian student the same.


To illustrate the consequences of this regime, I turn to a small country primary school in Victoria, 40 kilometres north of my electorate office, with 41 students. It currently attracts Commonwealth funding of $26,731 per student per annum. A comparable school in New South Wales, with 42 enrolments, attracts $11,039 per student per year. That is a massive differential between small primary schools in country New South Wales and those in country Victoria that just should not be occurring but has been able to under the Labor Party's iteration of the Gonski deals. They have similar needs, yet there is a gulf in funding between them. That shows everything that is wrong with the act as it stands and why it needs amendment right now.


Another example is that 530 of the schools with the highest proportion of Indigenous students are in remote or very remote areas. These changes will ensure their particular needs are met. 


We need to have a more granular approach to students with a disability to ensure that a teacher in the classroom is able to assess a student's need and the amount of resources required to address that student's learning outcomes, because that is what we are talking about—learning outcomes, not just money from money's sake but how we are going to help those individual students reach their potential and learn to the best of their capacity. And that is by having a much more granular approach to how we deal with students with a disability loading, and that is something we are absolutely committed to.


I also want to go to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee inquiry on the bill. We received overwhelming evidence about the need to 'end the funding wars' when it came to education funding in this country, including from the Grattan Institute, who, typically, does not side with our side of politics, but wanted those issues put to bed. I think the most telling evidence was from ACSSO, which represents the parents of the over two-thirds of Australian students that attend state schools in this country. The ACSSO president, Mr Spratt, came to our hearings. Whilst it was great to hear from the smaller sectors and the different systems, it was great to hear from somebody that represented two-thirds of our nation's students' parents. As the chair said:


You have been very clear in your desire to end the funding wars—to get it sorted—


to support this bill. We have to take on board and ensure that the Commonwealth government treats every single Australian student fairly and justly.


Another issue that we are addressing is the need for states to maintain their contribution levels. Over recent years, while the Commonwealth government has been chipping in more money, we have seen states decreasing their rate of investment in their constitutional responsibility to educate the students within their state boundaries. That is simply not acceptable. If the Commonwealth government is going to invest record funding—I know others in this place have gone into the actual level of funding that will be distributed under these initiatives—then it is imperative that state governments stop playing politics with those students who are attending non-government schools within their boundaries and treat every student the same within their own boundaries. I hope this legislation will put their feet to the fire and help them get on board with focusing on how they can treat all students and maintain parental choice, which is a core fundamental aspect of our education system here in this country.


Again, I could go into the different deals and how they impact time and again on how different students are treated differently. One of the things that struck me about the Senate inquiry we conducted was that there were no questions from the Labor Party senators about public school funding. Every single question from the Labor Party senators was about how the private schools, the non-government sector, were going to fare under the changes being suggested. That beggars belief. I am a public school teacher and a lot of my kids went to public schools and the children of my constituents, en masse, attend state schools, so I want to see a very strong state school system—and this bill does what Labor's bill could never do. They are too busy playing footsies with premiers leading up to an election rather than considering outcomes for Australian students.


I want to put on the record some critiques that have been made in recent days on the guarantee, particularly for those private schools that operate as systems, that private schools will be getting an increased level of investment. We are the side of government that does support parental choice, but we also recognise that that should not come at a cost to investing in all students' education. I specifically go to the Catholic education sector. Between 2018 and 2021 the average annual per student funding to the Catholic sector will increase by 3.7 per cent and by a total of $2.8 billion between 2018 and 2027. That is a phenomenal amount of increased funding, and I am confident, as I travel around regional Victoria and I talk to Catholic principals, I talk to state school principals and I talk to independent school principals, that they are desperate for this money to enter their schools so they can provide the resources that their students need. It is absolute hypocrisy for people to stand up here today and talk about cuts in funding when, in a needs based system, if you have a need it will be funded. That is how it works. If you do not have a need, you are going to miss out. I have no objection whatsoever to ensuring that incredibly overfunded schools under the current system get a cutback. I would much rather see increased investment in rural and regional state schools across this country than see North Shore Sydney privates continue to get the level of funding that they are getting under the Labor Party's agreements right now. That is the level of unfairness that this bill seeks to undo, and I encourage all senators who care about equity and fairness to support it. 


People often mention the Finnish system—why aren't we more like Finland? Do you know what makes the Finnish system so great? It is not about the buckets of money; it is about a bipartisan approach to education over two decades rather than this argy-bargy 'he said, she said, we do it better, no you don't' argument. Our future is dependent on the educational outcomes of every Australian student right now. 



Senator Marshall interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  We know we are not achieving in international—




Senator Williams:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I am very interested in listening to Senator McKenzie's presentation. Senator Marshall, who is a very good Deputy President of this chamber—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Do you have a point of order?




Senator Williams:
  I don't know why they dumped him on that side—would keep order in this place, but he is being very disorderly, and I ask you to bring it to his attention or instigate standing order 203.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Marshall, on the point of order—and let's make it relevant, if possible.




Senator Marshall:
  Of course. Senator McKenzie is suggesting that there is hypocrisy and there are double standards.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not relevant to the point of order.




Senator Marshall:
  It goes exactly to the point. If Senator McKenzie is going to be so provocative, she expects—



Senator McKenzie interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Marshall, please resume your seat. Senator McKenzie, I do not need any assistance. You do not have the call yet. Senators are entitled to be heard in silence in this place, and it becomes particularly difficult when we have a small chamber with only a limited number of people. I would ask that that covenant be respected. Senator McKenzie, you have the call.




Senator McKENZIE:
  Thank you very much. No, you do not need any help from me in chairing or anything else.


It was the majority view of the committee examining all of the evidence before it to support this bill notwithstanding there were issues raised. I think the minister in his public commentary and other senators have dealt fairly and squarely with those concerns. It is our view that, if fully enacted as presented here today, this bill will create a system for public funding of schools that is fair and transparent. That has been one of the great critiques. The Commonwealth tips a lot of money—a record bucket of money—into certain systems, whether they be state systems, whether they be private school systems such as the Catholic education system, and has no real understanding or visual oversight of where that is going. To have a transparent system where parents and taxpayers can actually hold state governments and education systems more generally accountable for where they spend their money and who is getting that share of the funding is appropriate. It is absolutely the right policy position to take.


The bill will also ensure the highest levels of funding growth will occur where the need is greatest. Isn't that fantastic? Where you have some out-of-school needs which are actually going to impact how you engage with the education sector, the Commonwealth is prepared to back that and to ensure that the school has a level of funding to assist with overcoming those barriers. What I know about representing rural and regional Australians is the level of educational disadvantage is incredible. On any measure—NAPLAN results, PISA results, participation in higher education, you name it—rural and regionality is an issue with educational engagement. That must change. It is why our government has initiated an in independent review into rural and regional education and it is why one of the loadings is about the location and size of a school.


Similarly, so is SES. We know that the 10 electorates in this country with the lowest median income levels are in rural and regional Australia. This not only deals with inequity right now and over the coming 10 years but backs in the investment we need in my communities to ensure we have the skilled, engaged, educated young people and ongoing workforce that we need to fully participate in all the opportunities that the 21st century brings for us in agriculture and across the board.


It also puts an end to students with the same needs being treated differently depending on where they live. Anyone that is interested in fairness, do not listen to the opposition. If they are talking about fairness on one side and Gonski on the other, full stop turn it off. You are not hearing the truth. I sat and had a bit of a listen to the opening couple of lines of the shadow minister for education in her speech on this bill's second reading, and it was absolutely unbelievable. The level of falseness that she pursued through that speech was very concerning. The ABC Fact Check is not always great for my side of politics, but I tell you: they got it right on the Labor Party's claims about the Gonski funding—that the Labor Party was misleading not just the parliament but the entire nation around any talk of the $22 billion cuts—and yet we allow that conversation to go on. I see you nodding, Senator Marshall—




Senator Marshall:
  I'm laughing.




Senator McKENZIE:
  But we continue to let it go on. The AEU, which has spent $20 million on a Gonski campaign, when presented with a model that is going to end the inequity, cannot come to the party. During the Senate inquiry, when asked, 'Are you happy for students in WA state schools to continue to receive different levels of funding to students with the same need in my home state of Victoria?' the AEU refused to answer, but it made it very clear that it wanted to keep the entrenched disadvantage inherent in the 27 different deals as part of the policy of the Commonwealth government. It is absolutely an abomination. I commend this bill to the Senate. I thank the crossbenchers who are actually putting Australian students first in their consideration. (Time expired)

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-06-21,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (11:15):  It is with quite a deal of interest—interest and curiosity—that I am rising to speak to the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017 today, because I think we still do not yet quite know where this bill is going to land. It is of concern that the government has brought on this bill for debate today while negotiations are still ongoing, for this is a critical issue for the future of Australia and our education systems. Achieving equity, fairness and the best outcomes for kids at all schools across Australian is fundamentally critical to the future of our country. 


There is one thing that is clear in terms of the way that the Greens are approaching this: front and centre we are being completely guided by what is in the best interests of all school students at all schools across the country. We particularly have the interests of children who are going to public schools, and we want to make sure, in particular, that we achieve the best outcomes for the neediest public schools. We have a great opportunity to reform schools funding so that it is genuinely needs based and sector blind. That is not where our schools funding is at the moment. Schools funding currently is a complete dog's breakfast. Schools funding under the deal that is supposedly the result of the last reviews led by David Gonski is supposedly needs based and sector blind. It clearly is not. There are carve-outs all over the place. It is not fair. It is not equitable if you are a school student in the Northern Territory compared to a school student in the ACT, for example. So we have a really important opportunity now, and it is up to us to make the most of that opportunity.


There are some good things that the government has put on the table now, such as the changes to the architecture to make it more genuinely needs based and sector blind. But the Greens are not going to support the model that is on the table at the moment, if that is the one we end up voting on, because it is not a model that delivers what we need for our schools. Clearly there is not enough money on the table at the moment. The mechanisms are not there to make sure that the states are going to continue to pay their fair share. In our federation responsibility for education is shared between the Commonwealth and the states, and it is not going to be any use at all if the Commonwealth increases its funding but allows the states to squib their part of the deal—that we get extra money from the Commonwealth, but the states go, 'Oh, that's good. Right. Terrific. We'll go and pocket it and not spend it.' Clearly we have to maintain that nexus. We have to make sure that the increase in funding that is required comes from both the Commonwealth and the states.


The other critical factor that the Greens have been arguing for, which was part of the original Gonski review, is having an independent body to overview schools funding into the future so that it can be genuine and we can trust that we know that it is absolutely going to continue to be fair, equitable, needs based and sector blind. So that is what the Greens are continuing to fight for, and we will continue to fight for that and continue to put the needs of every school student in Australia at the forefront of our negotiations.


As I said, the critical issue is what is in the best interests for all kids in all schools, but particularly the kids of those families who frankly do not have the resources to be paying private school fees. They should not have to. Those children, as much as any other children in the country, deserve a gold-standard education. Our country needs them to receive that gold-standard education because it is in our national interest. If you look at how the Australian education system is currently performing on the world stage, our best schools are up there with the best schools in the world. The kids that are going to those best schools are achieving the outcomes that we can be really proud of. But, sadly, that does not extend through to all of our schools.


What we do not have is equity in education. That is what we need to achieve. The best performing school systems in the world, such as the Finnish system, are the ones that have that equity so that you know, no matter what the background of a child is—what their family background is, how much income their family has or whether they are Indigenous or not Indigenous—they are getting the resources that are required to enable them to achieve their full potential. That is what the Greens are fighting for—improving equity in our education. That means making sure that more resources are going to go to the most needy of public schools.


I have visited many schools across Victoria in my three years as a senator. The most recent one I visited, just a couple of weeks ago, was Tarneit Senior College. Tarneit Senior College is in one of Melbourne's growth areas—the outer western suburbs—and, despite being in a growth area and despite being a relatively new school that has only been built within the last decade, it is struggling. It has not had put into it the resources that are required. Usually, when you arrive at most schools you visit, they at least have the resources and feel that they have to be able to market themselves. There will be a grand entrance, even at a lot of our public schools. But, no, the entrance to Tarneit Senior College is off the car park. There is a little sign on the gate saying, 'All visitors, please report to the office.' You look and think, 'Where's the office?' There is no building that is obviously going to be one that has an office there. You follow the signs, and the office is in a portable building—and they expect it to be in a portable for many years to come. It has been in a portable for the whole life of the school.


I had a terrific meeting with the principal, who showed me around the school and showed me where they are still lacking in funding, where they need more funding to be able to provide the resources to make sure that all of their kids can achieve their potential and what they have been able to do with the extra money that has been put into their school over the last two years. In particular, I met their wellbeing team—their social workers and other staff working to ensure the welfare of all of their students. They told me some pretty amazing statistics. There are quite a lot of issues that Tarneit as a growth area is facing. It is actually an area that has a high turnover in population because of the unaffordability of housing right across our cities, even in growth areas. The people who move to Tarneit hoping to find affordable rent find, after a while, that they cannot afford to pay the rent there, and they move even further out and they move to regional Victoria.


So, there is lots of transience. There are low-socioeconomic families there, and huge multicultural diversity—lots of newly arrived families. There are major, major student needs. This is reflected in the fact that they now have a student wellbeing team of five staff, whereas two years ago they had only one. They have 420 students in years 10 to 12. Of those 420 students, 317 last year accessed the services of their student wellbeing team—three-quarters of the students. This is a school that is struggling, that needs more resources put into it. This is the type of school I have in my mind when we as Greens are negotiating to get the best outcomes for students and families.


The other issue which is, again, so critical—why we need to ensure that schools like Tarneit Secondary College get the level of funding they deserve—is that if they do not we know the pressure that puts on families, feeling that this school actually is not going to give their kids the best education. They have competition from local private schools. Then there are families that can afford to pay private school fees but may have to dig really deep and miss out on other things because they feel that in order to get the best education they have to send their children off to private schools. So then you get the segregation of the wealthier families who are sending their kids to private schools and those that have no option and so are sending their kids to the state high school. That is not in the interests of the wellbeing of our community. That is not going to be delivering the best educational outcomes.


We need to have the resources of all of the community feeding into and supporting our public education system. But in order to do that we have to make sure that schools like Tarneit Secondary College are funded appropriately. As a Victorian senator, that is what I am going to be fighting for: to make sure that those schools get the resources they need, that they are not going to be disadvantaged. Under any needs based, sector-blind model, with an adequate quantum of funding, they are the schools we are going to be fighting for. All children deserve the best education possible to set them up for a bright future. Their educational outcome should not depend on their family's wealth or income or on the state they live in. And parents should not have to shop around because they are worried that their local public school does not have the resources to educate their kids. Public education should be the gold standard, not a safety net.


I experienced this as well. My two kids both went to local high schools in the western suburbs. One went to Williamstown High School and one to Footscray Secondary College. They were great schools, but I was under a lot of pressure when we were choosing schools for my kids, who are reasonably bright kids: the number of my friends who said, 'Oh, you should be sending them off the private schools, because the local secondary schools aren't going to be able to deliver for them.' And we said: 'No, we're going to send them off the public schools. We are absolutely, philosophically committed to sending them off to public schools.' And they did brilliantly.


But many of their fellow students at Footscray and at Williamstown came from families from the outer western suburbs and were travelling long distances, where they could, to go to what their parents thought was a better public school. That is not a good outcome. We should be ensuring that the families living in St Albans, the families living in Werribee, the families living in Tarneit have a school they can be proud of. That is why we really need to have this genuine Gonski model of funding. It is absolutely critical for our students. We need that genuine, sector-blind, needs based model that is prioritising funding to look after the needy schools and kids. And we need to get that investment sooner.


One of the current concerns we have with the government's legislation is that although more funding would be flowing it is not going to be delivering outcomes to the most needy of schools until 10 years into the future. That is not good enough. It means that a kid who is in grade 3 today will not have the full funding going to their school until they are at the end of high school. We need to make sure that we get that greater investment sooner so that we can give every child the opportunity to reach their potential.


We have never had that genuine model. The current Gillard Gonski model is clearly not needs based. It is locked-in funding to the wealthy private schools at the expense of public schools. The current Turnbull Gonski 2.0 is not sector blind. It is offering certainty to private schools but it leaves the neediest public schools little chance to catch up after years of neglect. 




Senator Marshall:
  What's your position now? Are you voting for it?




Senator RICE:
  The Greens position is that we are continuing to negotiate. There are some advantages that the government's model is offering, improving the architecture—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Order! 



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Interjections while senators are speaking is disorderly and interjections while the chair is talking is even more disorderly. Senators are entitled to be heard in silence, and that is how we are going to proceed. Senator Rice, you have the call. 




Senator RICE:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Clearly, we have got a dog's breakfast at the moment. We are being failed by both parties, with both of the models that are on offer. A continuation of the old system is not good enough. The government's model that is currently on offer is also not good enough. The Greens will continue to negotiate to get the best outcome that we need, and that means having a genuine Gonski. It means putting kids before politics. It means making decisions on where we stand on the basis of what is the best policy outcome—not playing political games. 


What Labor are supporting at the moment is not the genuine Gonski. Labor walked away from the central premise that all schools should be funded on the basis of need. They promised that no school would lose a dollar, which sounds great, but it actually means that the wealthiest schools will continue to get more and more money, while those with scarce resources, the least well-off, will be deprived of funds. It means that we would have the continuation of the disparity, of the inequity, in our education system. The indexation that is on offer under Labor, which is locked into the legislation, means that poorer schools would take more than 100 years to catch up to those schools that are underfunded—let alone 10 years. It will be 100 years before they will be able to catch up to those that are underfunded. That inequality of opportunity is currently what is locked into law. Clearly, that is not a system that we would want to see continue. 


An analysis by the Grattan Institute says that Labor's education plan taken to the 2016 federal election would have added mega bucks but still not achieve consistent needs based funding for over 100 years. The Labor Party claim that the Turnbull government's cutting of $22 billion from schools over the decade is also a widely inaccurate claim. It is simply the difference between what Labor promised at the last election; it is not what is in law right now. Labor are currently not in government, so their promises sounds great but they actually mean nothing now. In order to have certainty over that, Labor should have locked in that funding before the 2013 election, but they chose not to do that. They chose not to lock in that amount, because they wanted to use our schools, our education, and the funding for schools in political game-playing in the election campaign. We could have had fairer funding locked in place if the Labor government in the lead-up to 2013 had chosen to do so, but they chose not to. On the other hand, the Turnbull government is claiming that there is a boost in funding of $16 billion over the decade, but this is based on the low level of funding that former Prime Minister Abbott stripped it back to. Neither of the parties are delivering fair, equitable and honest statements about our education system. The two parties are playing politics while our public schools are losing out. We need to be putting kids before politics. We need to be making sure that we have a system that is genuinely needs based and sector blind. 


We also have these claims that public schools are going to be receiving a cut under the government's Gonski 2.0 proposal, but, in fact, no public school system in Australia will receive a cut under the proposed funding model. The only notionally overfunded public schools in Australia are those in the Northern Territory, and they have been given additional funding under the government's proposed plan so their funding is not going to backwards. Government schools in every state will see their funding increase. Because they are all funded at different rates by the Commonwealth currently, the rate that they increase will be different. Historically underfunded states will increase at a faster rate than those that are closer to the target. 


Again, there are some good things that, as Greens, we want to be building upon. The best outcome is for us to negotiate an agreement that ends up with a genuine needs based, sector-blind funding system that will deliver the best outcomes, equitable and fair outcomes, that will give every kid the opportunity to achieve their potential. We are going to do that by changing the architecture so that it is genuinely needs based and sector blind, and by putting in the resources so that all schools will be up to the standard that is required to allow kids to fully achieve their potential.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-06-21,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (11:36):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak to the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017. This bill seeks to make a range of changes to the Gillard-era Australian Education Act 2013 to implement the government's so-called Gonski 2.0 education changes. These include a range of funding changes that seek both to increase education funding overall and to reapportion funding between and within the public and private school systems. 


Pauline Hanson's One Nation will be supporting the government's amended legislation; however, the key issues that need to be highlighted are accountability and choice. At Pauline Hanson's One Nation, we continue to listen widely. We appreciate very much the input from New South Wales Labor senator Deb O'Neill, whose passion and commitment to education is certain. We also appreciate the commitment and the passion with which Senator Chris Back, the Liberal senator from Western Australia, spoke to us this morning. Both are clearly knowledgeable and passionate about education; that came through with both of them. We listened to Senator David Leyonhjelm and Senator Cory Bernardi, and we will be considering their amendments for increasing the rigour and accountability of this bill as it is implemented. We listen, most importantly, to constituents, and we live ourselves in local communities with diverse state, Catholic and private schools. These vary from New South Wales with Senator Burston, to Queensland with Senator Hanson and me, to Western Australia with Senator Georgiou. 


In my early years as a child in India, I went to a school for expats run by Italian nuns using the acclaimed Montessori philosophy. I then went to state schools in New South Wales and then to a boarding school in Queensland. So I have sampled the private school sector and the independent school sector and I have also sampled state schools. My wife and I have two children who are now adults. Our kids went to a private primary school, based on the needs of the child, using the Montessori philosophy with parents paramount in the running of that school, albeit through an elected board appointing a principal. So there is yet another model. Then my children went to a state high school that had a history of respect for children. My understanding is that it was the only Queensland state high school with no uniform. What we want is for our kids to think for themselves and to discover as they wish. They have different interests, not just because one is a boy and one is a girl, but because they have different experiences and spirits when they came into this world, and different interests and passions.


Let me tell you a story. I want comment on the Greens. Before getting to that, I want to comment on one of their funders—the CFMEU. The CFMEU put a robocall around Queensland yesterday. They are saying that our party, Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, is calling for cuts to education spending. That is false. What would we expect from the CFMEU? It is a dishonest statement trying to hurt Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. The CFMEU is above all a political organisation. It is no longer a union that looks after its members. The union bosses are disconnected. It is these people from whom the Greens take their money. 


It is not true at all that Pauline Hanson's One Nation wants to cut education spending. We are actually in favour of strong education funding. No money has been taken out in this bill. The CFMEU's puppets, the Greens, say we need equity in education, as they often do. I am going to tell you a little story about two countries pretty soon. We do not want equity—sorry, equality—of opportunity; we want choice—equality of opportunity, because that gives choice. When choice is available it leads to accountability, and it leads to progress. That comes from accountability and choice—when humans are free to exercise our free will, our human spirit, in a way that enables us to take responsibility.


I would like to talk about the basics of education. That is a right of every child, with rigorous, effective education being the foundation for our nation's future economic prosperity and moral, spiritual and social health. There are three topics I would like to raise. First of all, state responsibility. Under our Constitution, the responsibility for education is with the states. That is where it should have been and should have stayed, and that is where it needs to be returned. We operate under competitive federalism—or rather, we used to. Centralisation has led to the politicisation of schools and has led to travesties such as the Safe Schools program, which is initiated federally and spread through some of the states, notably the Victorian Andrews government with its ridiculous Safe Schools policy. This is what centralisation gives us—United Nations driven ratbag propaganda such as Safe Schools, that are nothing more than brainwashing and propaganda exercises levied on the young and impressionable. Safe Schools are not about safe schools; Safe Schools are about violent schools—emotionally violent schools. Safe Schools are about intimidating young boys and girls from the age of four onwards—intimidating and confusing them.


The second thing I would like to talk about is individual choice—not state mandated social engineering, but choice, through vouchers. That leads to accountability.


The third thing I would like to talk about is effective education preparing boys and girls for the real world, so that boys and girls can pursue their dreams, their interests and their passions. We do not need boys especially sitting in school from the age of four or 5 to 18. That is not what many boys want to do. Boys in particular, but also girls, humans in general, learn by doing. Boys in particular learn by doing and by implementing what they learn. I have been to two universities and I am a graduate from two universities, one of them recognised as one of the finest in the world. I do not want every person to go to university—only those who want to go to university.


Let me tell you a story of two countries: East and West Germany. After the Second World War, West Germany was liberated from the American government by Ludwig Erhard, the Treasurer under the Chancellor at the time. East Germans and West Germans worked together in the Second World War and came up with a remarkable industrialisation and a remarkable inventiveness. The East Germans were restricted by socialism after the Second World War. The West Germans were liberated under Ludwig Erhard and free markets.


As a result of that simple difference, the East Germans over 50 years produced the Trabant car, a little papier-mache box with a smelly, dirty, polluting and noisy engine. People had to line up in East Germany to get that car because there were not enough of them available. The East Germans were a basket case. The West Germans, at the same time, produced Mercedes, Porsche, Volkswagen, Audi and Opel. The West Germans produced the world's most aspired-to cars.


Today we have a Trabant education system, and it is producing Trabants. The Greens love Trabants. They want Trabant energy, and we can see the cost of energy in this country. They want Trabant science, which is not science at all. They want a Trabant environment, which is hurting our environment. They want, you see, what the East Germans wanted, which was control, yet they cannot see the results of denying the human spirit.


What we want to see, though, is states delivering education and, within that education, states enabling individuals to have their choice of education. We accept a national minimum standard that makes it simple for standards to be accepted around the country, but we want to see the states implement their own curricula because only then will we see a development of curricula from one state to the next with superior curricula rising to the fore and other states copying those.


We need a certain level of qualification before people can be accepted into trades and universities. That is now dwindling. We need to restore that. We need teachers with authority, with responsibility, with a specialty where it suits them and with a real job, not childminding, as it has become in some parts of our country. We need an emphasis on maths, English, science and history, and we need a return to teaching about the Constitution. We must send education back to the states. That will end the waste and duplication, and it will liberate the human spirit to improve education.


Within the state system we need to recognise the complexity involved in delivering education across a diverse continent and across many diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. It is a fact, as Senator Back said to us this morning, that many of the towns in Northern Queensland, the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia do not have a state school. They have no state school at all and rely entirely on the Catholic system. That Catholic system has grown up over many years and become so adapted to suiting the needs of individual communities. It brings values, it brings basics in education and it brings education to the disadvantaged. That must be protected. We understand from Senator Back that the government will be putting a one-year moratorium and a delay on implementing some of the provisions in this legislation thanks to Senator Back and his advocacy. If Catholic schools were to be shut, there would be huge burdens on state systems around this country.


Then Senator Back went on to discuss the system weighted averaging used by Catholic schools in Western Australia, recognising the parents' ability to pay. He compared two schools in the same town, Cathedral Grammar and St Joseph's, with vastly differing fee levels. That is not possible under a government mandated bureaucracy. It is possible under the Catholic system, which shoulders an enormous burden in this country. He explained that system weighted averaging is far superior to the socioeconomic-standing system that the government proposes based on postcodes. He explained that Gonski and another key designer of education both say that the system weighted average is, in fact, far superior. We acknowledge many benefits to what the government is proposing. Thirty per cent of the kids in Catholic schools, according to Senator Back, are not Catholic. They are there by choice, with the exception of schools in northern Australia, where there is no alternative. We must recognise the Catholic system. There are regional and rural towns with no state school system that rely entirely on Catholic schools. Without Catholic schools there would be an enormous increased burden on state schools. Ninety-five per cent of state school capital costs were paid for by parents. That needs to be honoured. The Catholic school system, above all, provides parents with choice. 


Vouchers would also provide parents with choice—even wider choice. That would enable many more people to have input into education, into how the schools their kids are attending and being instructed at are run. Then we would have liberation from the Trabant of education. We would have not only diversity of education curricula but diversity of education delivery systems and diversity of educational administrative systems. And, as each one improved, they would be copied by surrounding schools, and we would have an ever-escalating improvement. We would start having the Porsches, the Mercedes, the BMWs of education. We would have a liberation of the human spirit. 


The final thing I want to discuss is the need to look at the merits of the German apprenticeship model, which gave us the apprenticeship system—the trade system. As I said, boys—and, indeed, girls—are not built to sit in school all day. Education needs to be for the real world to give people the opportunity to develop the ability to think for themselves. That is real education—not just to pick up the three Rs but the ability to pick up the responsibility for learning, the responsibility for discovery, the responsibility for self-awareness and consciousness, and the responsibility for life. Real education is also about them being able to focus on their interests, not what the state mandates and not what the UN mandates through our central government in this country. We need to stop setting boys up for failure. The German apprenticeship model has proven highly successful.


 In America, I was given instruction by a well-known educational expert, Michael Strong. He has had an outstanding career across the country from Alaska through to Hawaii through to the desert states of New Mexico. Michael Strong has developed schools with many different curricula under many different philosophies. He said that in America people talk about sending their kids to university. Only one-third get to university, which means that two-thirds are under the pressure of feeling like they have failed. A university education is not for everyone. We need a country that values education other than at universities. We need a country that sets up boys and girls for trades and careers outside universities. We need to be able to give people a foundation in entrepreneurial activities. That needs a free market. We need to unshackle this country from the clutches of central government—ever-growing central government. We need to stop setting up boys for failure. We need to release the school system for individual initiative. We need to give people choice in schools—not only whether or not they go to a school but what sort of school they go to. We need to really think ahead, but, for now, we are anticipating supporting the government's bill.

Senator XENOPHON

 (
South Australia
) (
11:54
):  It is impossible to overstate the importance of this bill because, whatever the outcome of our consideration, it will have a far-reaching effect on a generation of children and their educational outcomes. It is not hyperbole to say that the future prospects of a generation of children are in our hands. The importance of education cannot be overstated, because education is one of the strongest tools to tackle poverty, reduce welfare dependency and improve health outcomes. Education is about the future of our children and of our nation. My team and I have taken consideration of what is dubbed Gonski 2.0 very seriously. I commend the work that my colleague in the other place, the member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie MP, has done on this. She has done a tremendous amount of work. Her diligence and forensic approach to this are to be commended. She has spoken about the bill in the other place and gave the legislation our cautious support, pending satisfactory resolution of our reservations and the outcome of the Senate inquiry. The majority report of that inquiry predictably said it should be passed, but it did set out various concerns with the bill.


Before I discuss in detail how our reservations have been addressed, I want to congratulate the government for its determination to implement a purer form of the Gonski sector-blind needs based funding model. This took courage because, if you level the playing field, inevitably there will be some losers. But if it goes to the neediest schools, those that deserve it the most, then that is a good outcome. For confirmation that the government's model is closer to the original Gonski review's intent we need look no further than the enthusiastic support from members of the original Gonski review expert panel. Who could forget the image of David Gonski standing alongside the Prime Minister on 2 May and saying he supports this package? He was pleased that the government had adopted the recommendations of a needs based funding model. I look forward to the report of his review into how Commonwealth funding should be invested to improve school and student achievement, because outcomes are very important, but we also need to get the funding model right. Ken Boston, a fellow Gonski review expert panel member, went even further to say recently:


It will be a tragedy if the school funding bill is voted down in the Senate … Five years after the release and subsequent emasculation of the Gonski report, Australia has a rare second chance.


Kathryn Greiner, another member of the original Gonski review expert panel, said:


… it would be a disaster for Australian education if this doesn't pass. This is the first time a government in this country has drawn a line in the sand, removed the funding anomalies and got everybody on the same page.


The former Labor government, when trying to implement the Gonski model—this is not a criticism of them—were racked by needing a whole range of different funding deals to get the states on board. There were something like 27 different agreements. The requirement that no school should lose a dollar hobbled the implementation from the beginning and resulted in a distorted model. Instead of a level playing field, the starting point was each sector's then current funding level, which included historical funding anomalies and past deals. It was built on a flawed foundation of inequitable funding. The special deals done during the negotiation to cajole various states into signing up for Gonski sealed its fate as an inequitable model. It was not needs based and sector blind. Arguably it was not Gonski at all but a knock-off brand trying to look the same as the real thing.


I strongly support the intent of the legislation, but that does not mean there was no room for improvement. I mentioned earlier that we had some real reservations, and I want to cover how the negotiations we have had with the government address these. The first was the time frame. In our view a 10-year transition is too long, particularly for jurisdictions that have been underfunded for the past four years. The reduction of the transitional time frame from 10 years to six years is a big development. It goes much further towards bringing these funding anomalies to an end and putting schools on a more level playing field. If we all agree that reaching the SRS is the goal then getting there faster will benefit more children more quickly, particularly those who have already started secondary school.


Our second reservation was that the legislation as originally drafted only required states and territories to maintain their 2017 funding levels plus indexation. This lets states and territories off the hook too easily, so there must be measures—as I understand it, amendments will be tabled that will ensure real accountability on the part of states and territories to reach their share of the SRS by 2023. That will ensure accountability of the new funding model. That is fair, and if the states do not place a priority on appropriately funding their schools then they should be exposed.


The introduction of a national school resourcing body, something that the Australian Greens have long advocated, and I congratulate them for advocating, is also a very welcome addition. We need to have enhanced transparency and accountability, so I strongly support an independent body that can monitor all elements of the needs based funding model and suggest improvements. For example, I support that one of the first tasks is to examine the appropriateness of the current SES determination methodology. I know that the Catholic sector has been concerned about this, and I congratulate Senator Chris Back for his advocacy in this regard.


I have previously stated publicly that this might not be the full Gonski, but it is still the Gonski. At that time I was drawn into the focus on the quantum of funding, not the methodology. My position is now a bit more nuanced. Earlier, I alluded to the fact that Labor's Gonski was not really a Gonski at all, but rather a more expensive knock-off from a flawed methodology. I understand why there has been so much focus on the debate about the quantum of funding and not the methodology, but we can do both. If you scratch beneath the surface, the model that we saw before perpetuated historical funding inequities. The extra funding that Labor promised would have been allocated unfairly. 


Labor and the AEU have described this as a $22 billion cut. The $22 billion was Labor's funding promise, but they have not had to follow through on it. My colleague Rebekha Sharkie describes this as comparing apples with imaginary pears. Let us be clear: we are talking about $22 billion worth of imaginary pears. With the compression of the time frame to six years the difference has been reduced to $17 billion of imaginary funding. It is also important to note that the differences in the funding level between Labor's much-lauded years five and six of Gonski and the proposal is less than six per cent.


I am a pragmatist, as are my colleagues. We have a bill in front of us that will provide, in effect, $23 billion of extra funding to our schools over the next 10 years with the compression of getting up to the SRS standard within six years. I am not going to vote against a bill that provides extra funding and addresses the inequities of the failed Gonski implementation previously, given that David Gonski himself and his panel members believe it would be a grave mistake not to pass this bill. If the Labor Party is still committed to providing an extra $22 billion in funding, they can take that to the next election and it can be an election issue. 


I will talk about what this means for South Australia in due course in the committee stage. I believe that this is a very welcome bill in terms of the additional funding. I believe that if we knock this off, if we do not vote for this bill, it will lead to fundamental inequities and inequalities in the funding system being perpetuated. This is about getting the methodology right. The fact that David Gonski and the members of his panel are so enthusiastically fact in favour of this legislation is fundamental. 


I support this bill, as do my colleagues, with the improvements that we have been able to negotiate. I note that other crossbenchers have been working in good faith to improve this legislation. This bill will also lead to much more increased transparency, which is fundamental. That is something that I will speak about in the committee stages of this bill. In closing, I support the second reading stages of this bill. There are amendments that will even further improve it. This will be a good outcome for students around the country. I do not want to the perfect to be the enemy of the good, because this has very many good elements. It should be passed.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2017-06-21,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (12:03):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017, which provides for needs based school funding. This debate is not just about school funding, though. It is about our children. It is about equal opportunity and it is about our future. Today I speak on this bill to remind my colleagues to broaden their thinking beyond the here and now. In fact, I am asking my colleagues to think beyond the next 10 years. Constant squabbling amongst ourselves over issues as important as education funding, making changes to the education system every three or four years, only damages our children and, therefore, Australia's future. 


The Liberal government would have had an easier time negotiating with colleagues had the government included the opposition and the crossbench and the key stakeholders in the conversation a lot sooner. As I read through the submissions to the committee, the one thing most submissions had in common was a concern that there had been little to no consultation. I am thankful Minister Birmingham took time out of his busy schedule to fly to Tasmania to hear my concerns, but, if the schools and Minister Birmingham's colleagues in this place had been kept in the loop while this bill was put together, it would have received feedback sooner, allowing the minister to draft a solid bill.


This lack of consultation speaks to larger cultural issues within the Liberal government's ranks. The feedback I receive on a daily basis from key industry stakeholders on a variety of bills is that this government does not consult. This is a pattern of behaviour that has been allowed to develop, turning the Liberal government into its own worst enemy. Its consistent refusal to consult with key industry stakeholders and with its opposition and crossbench colleagues creates a mad rush to get the bill passed, as we have experienced this week. Instead of blaming our chaotic or feral Senate when bills do not pass, perhaps the Liberal government should sit down with its colleagues in the Senate to discuss our concerns well before bills are presented to the House. This prevents political games and mistakes being made. The point of a democracy is that all views are represented in parliament. As long as the Liberal government ignores those views, it will continue to have problems in the Senate. This culture of last-minute negotiations and decision-making is not conducive to considered and well-thought-out legislation and gives senators very little time to draft and present amendments to make for much better legislation and to give us a fair go.


Labor is not interested in this Gonski debate either. For me as an Independent, it is frustrating to see funds invested into a lengthy evidence based report and for the government of the day to bastardise the recommendations or cherry-pick recommendations to suit its political agenda. It is devastating to see governments play with the futures of our children, and therefore the future of our nation, for political gain. It is ironic that Labor proudly claims to roll out the full Gonski when it was the Labor government that compromised the true Gonski.


Do not get me wrong. I gave Labor the chance and the time to see Gonski through. A few years ago, I was approached by the Education Union when I expressed my disappointment in student outcomes, especially in Tasmania. They begged me to give it a couple more years. Well, I have done that. Oh, dear, I have done that! The NAPLAN results show there is no measurable improvement for Tasmania—absolutely none. It has not moved up a notch. In fact, there is negligible improvement across the nation. A media statement released by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority said:


… in recent years NAPLAN results have largely plateaued.


It asked the question, 'Is this good enough?' This is a good question. What are the major parties' ambitions for our children? Is the word 'okay' good enough, or should we have higher expectations for the young people who will eventually lead this nation? The education we give our children directly impacts nation-building and Australia's future. I would like to see our children reach their potential to be effective and ensure Australia continues to be the great country that it is. We now know that throwing enormous amounts of money at education is not the answer, but you do not throw out a broken model until you know the new one is better.


While I look forward to seeing a truly needs based, equal opportunity funding rollout, it still is not the answer to improving student outcomes. The answer lies in our teachers, who work hard and try their best but are not always provided with the support or resources to explore teaching students in a capacity that supports students' individual learning needs. As a start, the teaching degree must be treated with more respect. After all, teaching is circular in nature. If a teacher is taught well, that teacher is more likely to teach well. By providing a high-quality teaching degree, we encourage that sense of respect, and our teaching students will fulfil greater potential. By asking our students to complete postgraduate study, we create a greater knowledge base from which to teach our children.


While our teachers are studying at university, it should be a requirement that, on top of their practical work, they volunteer as a teacher aide every day, five days a week, from 10 to two. It is time for on-the-job training to begin again. We have lost this, and we are suffering because of this. Get them out of those universities in their second year, and get them on the job. During my time as a senator many schools have approached me about their need for more teacher aides and agonised over the lack of funding. Well, there is your answer: get them out of those universities and get them into schools. They will get on-the-job training and mentoring all in one. We are getting two for the price of one here. If university students were required to volunteer to be a teacher's aide they would not only receive real world experiences and develop mentor relationships with experienced teachers; they would also observe a variety of class behaviours and incidents. This would give them the tools and experience they need to deal with such behaviours as new teachers when they graduate. In addition, the schools and their students will receive the one-on-one support they need in the classroom without breaking the budget.


I emphasise that some things must be beyond politics. The Labor Party and the Liberal Party must stop playing games with issues that are vital to our country and our people. Education and health must be exempt from the political games that seem to be entrenched in this place. The good of the people and the future of Australia should be treated with greater consideration and sincerity.


I want to speak about children with disabilities. In the past—whether it be Veterans' Affairs or the NDIS—you have always underestimated the cost. I do not blame you for this; many of you have probably not experienced being sick and down and out, and what that costs. When you have not been on both sides of that game you underestimate terribly, and that is where you run into trouble. I want to make sure that our kids with disabilities are fully funded at all times. I do not want to see the divide in this country made any greater than it already is. That worries me terribly. If you cannot get this right in this model then I will be coming forward on the NDIS. I will be brutally honest with you: there are gaps in that, and I will push student funding for disabled students really hard and really fast. I want them well catered for and I want them to get the opportunity to be in normal classrooms if they are able to. It is not only great for them; it is also great for those students who do not have disabilities. They learn compassion. They learn how to deal with these matters. It gives them coping mechanisms for the rest of their lives. Everybody wins out with this. So I am really having a good look at this.


When it comes to the Catholic education system, I hope that they will continue on the same trajectory they are on right now until the review is over. I hope that what I have been told in that matter is the truth: for the next 12 to 18 months they will maintain everything they already have.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2017-06-21,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (12:13):  I rise to speak on the Australian Education Amendment Bill. Around this time last year, before the federal election, I travelled 11,250 kilometres around country Victoria and New South Wales, and not once was the word 'Gonski' mentioned in that time. Of course, in recent weeks here that is all we have heard and in the past few hours that is all we have heard. I do not intend to speak very long; I just want to say that I will be endorsing, supporting and voting for this bill. When I first heard of the Gonski amendments, I had some doubts—and I think they were legitimate ones—especially relating to Labor's scare campaign about $22 billion; they turned me off with that. In the election campaign, I was talking about justice issues. As a senator, I am now forced to vote on education and other issues which were not part of my party platform and not what people put me here for; they put me here to do such things as a passport ban for paedophiles. But I am in this position and I may be one of those who ends up swinging this vote one way or the other. Frankly, the $22 billion Labor scare campaign was a lie. I do not like either side when you lie to me. I watched those TV commercials and talked to various people on the opposition bench. It was like me coming in here today and making a promise that, in 2045, I will give $60 billion to gambling casinos—because I am in favour of gambling—and then a new government comes in and decides they will cut $50 billion of that $60 billion and will not give it. So I then run a TV campaign saying the government are bastards; they have cut $50 billion from James Packer's coffers—$50 billion that was not there in the first place.


Now, I have said I will support this. I have had meetings with many interested parties. I sat down with two very inspiring mothers from the Broken Bay diocese to listen to their concerns about the SES and the discrepancies in it, and I have had assurances that these things will be looked at. Those women came all the way here and paid their own hotel bills because they are concerned about their kids. I am pleased to announce that I am going to support the Gonski bill, with the changes that I and others from the crossbench have actively advocated. I am proud to see that the changes will come into effect more quickly for those schools that so desperately need extra support and need it now. I am proud that an additional $4 billion or so will be invested in the Gonski program.


I am also pleased that we will be holding the state and territory governments to account to make sure that they uphold their end of the bargain in the years going ahead. I am pleased that the 10-year plan will be pushed back to six or seven years—six years, I think. I am also very pleased to acknowledge the Greens' idea, which is to have an independent body to provide a very much needed layer of transparency. I know the Greens have had to fight amongst themselves, but for some of these changes they have advocated very strongly indeed. So, I will be supporting this bill. I think we will get some extra money for Victorian schools. The money will come faster than was planned, better than was planned. It is a needs based scheme. And before I sit down, to steal from Neil Armstrong's apocryphal story about what he really said when he walked on the moon: good luck, Mr Gonski!

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:46):  Today I want to raise a number of issues that are particularly important to my constituency, which is the state of Queensland. But I particularly want to refer to the north, where I am based. Unfortunately I am now the only senator in Queensland based in the north of the state. Some of my colleagues in the LNP are based in Central Queensland, on the Darling Downs and on the Sunshine Coast, but all the rest of the senators representing Queensland are based in Brisbane. I regret that the one other senator who for many, many years represented the north of the state, Senator Jan McLucas, is no longer with us. I did not always agree with Senator McLucas, but at least she was a passionate advocate for the north. Unfortunately in some dastardly deal within the Labor Party she lost her preselection spot to a union hack from Brisbane who now lives in Brisbane and pretends that he has an office on the Gold Coast.


As a proud North Queenslander and the only representative of North Queensland in the Senate, I want to talk about Adani. I want to talk about the wonderful Great Barrier Reef that all of us in Queensland but particularly in the north are so very proud of. I want to talk about jobs and small business in the north. In Townsville at the moment regrettably there is the largest unemployment figure in the country. Youth unemployment is at a catastrophic rate. It is essential that we do something to boost the economy of the North, particularly Townsville, not just for the jobs but also for small business, which is struggling in that area. That is why I want to talk about Adani.


But before I do that I want to congratulate Mr Tim Nicholls, the state leader of the Liberal National Party in the Queensland parliament and the alternative premier, who in the last few days has made some very significant announcements for the north in general and for Townsville in particular. I am delighted that Mr Nicholls has committed an incoming Liberal National Party government to within 100 days of taking office getting the approvals right for a coal-fired baseload power station somewhere in the north. That will of course utilise the cheapest form of power and the cheapest form of electricity that Australia possesses. If we have a new coal-fired power station in the north, it will mean Australians can relish that cheaper power that nowadays China, India and other places to which we export our black coal are experiencing. It will put Australia back in the game.


Just this morning Mr Nicholls announced a $225 million commitment to address the critical water situation in Townsville which has existed over a long period of time. The state parliament seems to be oblivious to the problems of water shortages in Townsville. Indeed, regrettably, now Townsville has three state Labor members and a Labor federal member. None of them seem to be interested in water. The state Labor Party in its budget promised in the never-never that they would make some money available. It is in their out years with no real commitment to anything, whereas Mr Nicholls today has committed that amount of money. Mr Nicholls has committed an incoming LNP government to funding within 100 days of being elected a definite project to fix Townsville's long-term water shortages.


I want to briefly talk about Adani and what a huge impact that will have on jobs and confidence in Queensland. It is so important that the Labor mayor of Townsville is one of its greatest supporters. The Queensland Premier says she is a supporter and has said some things that would demonstrate that. Unfortunately, her deputy and other members of the Labor Party, including the supposed Minister Assisting the Premier on North Queensland, Coralee O'Rourke, and the supposed federal member—I say supposed because there is still in my mind some doubt as to the validity of her election, but more on that some other time. But they say they are sort of for Adani because they know the huge support for Adani in Townsville but then have all these qualifications. 'But it's got to stack up commercially.' 'But it's got to stack up environmentally.' We know, of course, that the Adani project has more environmental conditions than any other development project any time in Australia's history, and Adani will do that.


But it will provide real jobs, and those real jobs have started already with the announcement of headquarters in Townsville where 500 people will be employed within the next period of time. Unfortunately, the Labor government, while having, it seems, two bob each way, really has internal dissent over this project. I notice that the state Labor government has granted a green activist group some $600,000 to support the Environmental Defenders' Office, which has sought a judicial review of the Abbot Point coal terminal expansion. The Labor Party cannot have it both ways. They either support it or they do not, and funding these radical outfits to try to hold up Adani makes one doubt Labor's commitment. But I am hopeful that, with a change of government in Queensland, Adani will go ahead.


I did want to mention more about that. There are supposedly some protests against Adani. I mentioned in this chamber previously that, when we went to the official opening of the headquarters in Townsville, there was a massive number of five protesters outside the door. As we left that an hour later, that had swelled to eight. There was a northern development conference in Cairns just yesterday where people were talking about, amongst other things, Adani and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, and again there was a huge protest at that particular conference. Five people turned up to protest the Adani proposal. I can understand that, because I know the people of North Queensland, who understand these issues, who need the jobs, who understand the barrier reef, have no interest in these radical movements to try to stop that project.


I hear, Madam Acting Deputy President Reynolds, that, in your state of Western Australia, GetUp! and the Greens are mounting this massive campaign against marginal Liberal seats—and on what cause? It is on Adani and the Barrier Reef. Why are they doing it in Western Australia? Of course, people in Western Australia are a long way from the Barrier Reef and they are a long way from Adani. They do not know, as we in Queensland know, that this mine is nowhere near the Barrier Reef. In fact, it is on the other side of the Great Dividing Range. How water can travel uphill is one of the 'fake news' stories that the Greens and GetUp! continue to propagate.


The amount of fake news that the Greens political party and GetUp! continue to propagate is just amazing. Somehow the opening of this mine is going to destroy the world's climate! Yet Dr Finkel himself, the Chief Scientist, has said that, even if you shut Australia down completely and cut our emissions by 1.3 per cent, it would have virtually no impact on the changing climate of the world. So the fake news continues to come out from the Greens political party and GetUp! All the time they do that, they are destroying the jobs and livelihoods of the hundreds of thousands of people in the north of the state who I represent and who I will continue to represent by trying to support, in every way I can, these job-creating projects, like Adani and like the water supply and coal-fired power station Mr Nicholls has announced, for the benefit of Queensland and the north in particular.

The PRESIDENT:  The minister has provided a response, in the form of a letter, which will be tabled this afternoon.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:06):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to schools funding.


This motion relates to a lack of information and the poor capacity available to senators to make very serious decisions about what education arrangements may indeed apply for the next six to 10 years. It simply is not good enough.


The minister was unable to provide answers to questions from Labor senators today. He gave the same stark response he has given time and time again—ballpark growth figures, he claims. I would highlight that he has not yet made the clarification that he needs to in relation to his comments in question time yesterday. In question time yesterday he claimed that Catholic Education would get a growth in their share. This is simply untrue. At the time Senator Brandis was not listening properly and thought the point was a different one. The issue is that the minister should have come back to this chamber to clarify that what he put in answer to Senator Farrell was simply false. There is no growth in share for Catholic Education. That is why we have seen those figures about the loss of funding that those schools face over 10 years.


What the minister did refer to today is what has been coined, and indeed what I highlighted, the 'fantasy figures' that were used in the school funding estimator. I think it is useful to take senators through exactly why The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and Fairfax Media reported those fantasy figures. What the minister did in that case, and what the department did—which is quite concerning, given that the department responded to requests to present information that way—was to re-base 2017 funding figures, on the basis of a formula that will never apply to 2017. They have re-based the figures for 2017 in order to promote and pretend that there would be an increase between 2017 and 2018. This is why the Senate agreed to the order for the production of documents. What I understand from the President now is that all we have is a letter—who knows what that letter says—yet we are now in the committee stage of consideration of the legislation.


All this minister has done is to engage in closed-door conversations with some senators, presenting information that is not publicly available and probably is not credible, because the minister's record is not credible. We have all heard the expression, 'Lies, damn lies and statistics.' Well, that is what has been going on here. I cannot imagine—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis on a point of order.




Senator Brandis:
  Senator Collins has accused Senator Birmingham of lying. She must withdraw.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I believe that Senator Collins was quoting.




Senator Brandis:
  She was not, actually. She just said, 'Lies, damn lies … that is what has been going on here,' in direct reference to Senator Birmingham.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I do not believe she has impugned the minister. Senator Collins.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I understand why Senator Brandis is sensitive here, so maybe I should reiterate my point about the fantasy figures that are in the school funding estimator. To try to convince parents in schools that there is an increase involved in this funding, the government has rebased the figures for 2017 on the basis of a formula that will never apply to 2017. They then used those silly figures to compare with 2018 and claim that it is an increase in funding. Well, it is not. The department could not defend it. The department had to fess up about what was really going on here. That is why the government's figures in this area have never been regarded as credible.


But what is worse is this minister's and this government's failure to provide the information that should be available for all of us to assess what is really going on here. The minister uses national growth figures, national sector figures and hides the impact of his one-size-fits-all policy behind them. And that impact is very alarming. It is very alarming for Victorian schools. It is very alarming for Catholic education. It is very, very alarming for public schools. But as I said earlier, the arrangements in place for schools delivered an 80 per cent increase for public schools out of the additional Commonwealth-state funding arrangements. Now we only have state funding arrangements, and guess who gets the 50 per cent increase? Public schools get only 50 per cent now, whereas under the former arrangements it was 80 per cent.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-06-21,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (15:11):  Let me open by saying that Labor's position on these matters and the contributions by the senators are based on lies—great lies. The facts as presented by them are completely inaccurate. But it had me cast my mind back to a pop group in the 1960s and 1970s called The Great Pretenders. What we have now with the Labor Party in this place, and particularly with this legislation, is 'The Great Resisters'. In fact, everything the government has endeavoured to do over the last couple of years and certainly in the term of this current government has been resisted by Labor. There are no arguments, of course, on the merit of their argument, and never have they produced any alternative ideas. Many of these recommendations are in parallel to or adequately supplement ideas the Labor Party has presented in the past. However, when it comes from the government side, from the government benches, they will just resist it. They will say and do anything to resist the passage of government adjustments, particularly in the space of education.


We saw in the earlier parliament an enormous amount of effort over a very long period of time come up with some structural reforms around higher education and education generally, reforms that were supported by the greater majority of the universities around the country, reforms that would bring more equalisation into the space, more fairness in relation to funding and the abilities of those educational facilities to operate. And what happened? The Labor Party resisted the reforms. In fact, their resistance put paid to them. This is another effort here. Every one of their quotes in relation to these matters, as I have heard over recent days and since this debate commenced, has been very selective. For every negative quote they have produced, my office and the offices of colleagues on the government side have received strong, resounding endorsements, often from people in authority in education who are superior to the individuals selectively quoted by the Labor Party.


This is an area that has been crying out for some serious reform for a long period of time. This is an area that has required some sort of stabilisation around fairness and equity with the distribution particularly from the Commonwealth in relation to funding in this space. As is the case with large transformative policies at their introduction, not everybody will be happy. It is impossible.


We go to an election and a large part of the Australian population wants to support one line of ideology and the other wants to support another, so it is going to be impossible of course to bring about reforms that please everybody in the community. These reforms have been endorsed by very substantive, important and influential figures in the education marketplace and by schools—right across the board, whether it is public schools or private schools or indeed the very important Catholic education system, it has been largely supported. They do not agree with the issues that have been raised by Labor. There is no body to their resistance. 


In fact it is, as we have seen, their practice over recent years to go from being the great pretenders to the great resistors. They pretend first; there are the crocodile tears about how we are somehow all going to be affected—partially sympathetic to reforms. This is how they go on, until of course we get to where the rubber meets the road. Then they slip out the side theatre and they change and come back as the great resistors, and their tune is completely different. 


I just urge the Labor Party, and I urge our colleagues in the Senate, to sit and think carefully about this. If this reform opportunity is lost at this time, then what is going to happen is we are going to have the status quo for a long, long period of time and the inequities that this legislation deals with will remain and the students and schools that they pretend to represent will continue to be affected.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (15:16):  It has been an interesting debate, in which a lot of claims have been made. There is the suggestion that if only we would 'stop playing politics' with this everything would be all right. But of course those who make that claim expect you to agree with them, and the only position they claim is valid is in fact their position. I think Senator Lambie made a good point earlier today, when she said that, if the government was serious about getting genuine reform through, it would actually consult with the opposition and it would genuinely consult with the crossbenchers. Instead, what we have seen is simply a decision of government to make savings. 


I also heard Senator Hinch earlier today suggest that there are no cuts being made, because the commitments that the Labor Party made were fictitious and were not actually there and, therefore, there could be no cuts. That does not then explain how the government's own documents talk about savings being made by these reforms. According to the government's own figures, these proposed changes represent a $22.3 billion cut to school funding, compared to the existing legislation and agreements put in place by the former Labor government in 2013. This difference is clearly detailed in the government's briefing document circulated to journalists on 2 May 2017. The document states that 'the legislation will see savings of $6.3 billion over four years'—that is the 2018-21—'and $22.3 billion over the 10-year period. That will be achieved by the government's plan.' So their own figures—Senator Hinch, and anyone else that is interested—demonstrate very clearly that these are savings and, therefore, they must be cuts. 


But these things just cannot be done in isolation. As if people think that the federal government is simply picking arbitrary figures out of the air and apply that to school funding. These school funding agreements are agreements made with the states. They rely on commitments of states to match certain funding levels to that of what the Commonwealth is matching. So states have budgeted for this money. They have agreements in writing with the Commonwealth about the funding share that should proceed. These are in place. They are there. What this government simply seeks to do is reduce their share of the funding and expect the states to live up to their commitments, which they want to do. The Victorian government, incidentally, was not invited to appear before the Senate inquiry into this, and none of the state governments were. You would think that the states, being the biggest providers of education in this country, would have been invited to give some evidence before the Senate committee. Nonetheless, they made a submission. 



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator MARSHALL:
  You would think you would hear from them, Senator Brandis. They are the major player in education in this country, and they do not even get an invitation to appear before the committee.




Senator Brandis:
  Did they ask them?




Senator MARSHALL:
  My understanding is that they did. This is what the Victorian government said in their submission:


… the Victorian Government became a signatory to the National Education Reform Agreement (NERA). The NERA was intended to deliver an additional $12.2 billion to Victorian schools between 2014 and 2019, with sixty per cent of this funding to be delivered in 2018 and 2019. The NERA was a landmark reform that enabled all schools across Victoria to access needs-based, equitable funding. It provided a solid foundation for both levels of government to work cooperatively to support growth and improvement across all school sectors over a six-year trajectory … Victoria has funded its full commitment of Gonski funding until the end of 2018. The Commonwealth Government’s new funding proposal leaves a massive shortfall for Victorian government schools of around $630 million in 2019 against the NERA, which will disproportionately impact on the most vulnerable schools and students. For some schools, this shortfall could equate to $1 million next year alone.


Again, the government, without any consultation with stakeholders, without any serious consultation, simply implements these cuts to education funding. This is not a government that is being honest with the Senate or the Australian people. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:22):  I too rise to take note of Minister Birmingham's answers at question time today. I think the appropriate place to start with any commentary on this is where it should be focused in this chamber at all times—on the best interests of all of Australian students. Sadly, listening to those opposite on this debate, clearly that is not where their best interests in the arguments lie. It is a tragedy for Australia and Australia's children that, instead of focusing on their best interests, they are focusing on their political needs. It comes down to this, quite clearly: you say you give a Gonski, but you cannot stand the fact that it is those on this side of the chamber who are actually delivering Gonski in full—fully funded, truly needs based, and without the 27 special deals that you concocted, which completely distorted the process.


That is not just my opinion. Let us have a look at what those who were on the original Gonski review and co-authored the report said. Last night, Kathryn Greiner, a Gonski review panel member, spoke on ABC. She was asked about her assessment of the political debate on Gonski 2.0. This is what the member of the Gonski review said:


I am very surprised about the Labor Party. They are behaving like naughty school children at the moment. They should be sat in the corner and given lines because they are behaving like children in that if they're not going to be the ones to implement the Gonski reforms when they had their opportunity—


They blew it—


then they seem to be spoiling it for anyone else to do that.


As I said, they cannot stand the fact that this side of the House is actually delivering the Gonski report and the intentions of the report. She also said:


… at the end of the day, my attitude and I think the attitude of any of us who were involved in the Gonski reforms, this is about the children.


Not those acting like children on the other side, but the actual children of Australia. Her advice to the Labor Party was:


Stop playing the political games and just get on with it.


She said, 'My gut feeling is that they want to spoil it, because they cannot be the ones to bring it to fruition.' I think Kathryn Greiner's comments are absolutely correct, and it has been absolutely evident in everything that we have heard from those opposite. I think it is a national disgrace that the interests of Australian children are being held hostage to the petty feelings of those on the other side—hurt feelings that they were not the ones to implement the report that they commissioned. 


Let's have a look at not just what we are saying but what other members of the Gonski review panel have said recently, in addition to Kathryn Greiner's comments. Ken Boston, a Gonski review member and also a leader in education policy, said this month that it is a 'new deal of historic national importance'. He went on to say: 


There are no grounds for opposition to the schools funding bill in principle …


And:


It will be a tragedy if the school funding bill is voted down in the Senate—


by those opposite. That is Ken Boston, the second member of the Gonski review. What did Bill Scales, an original Gonski review member, also say last month? He said: 


I think these concerns are not necessarily well-founded.


   …   …   …


If those systems are educating children of great need, then they have nothing to fear. 


He also said: 


This has to be de-politicised. This is not a political issue ... And we shouldn't make that a political issue.


They are three members of the Gonski review panel. Let's have a look to see what Mr David Gonski himself said recently about this bill and about these amendments. After everything that those opposite have said and are still saying here today, hysterically and very stridently, against this bill—they have signs in their windows saying, 'I give a Gonski'—let's hear what Mr Gonski himself says about this bill and these reforms:


I'm very pleased to hear that the Turnbull Government has accepted the fundamental recommendations of our 2011 report, and particularly regarding a needs-based situation.


…   …   …   


I'm very pleased that there is substantial additional money, even over indexation and in the foreseeable future.


If Gonski gives a Gonski then those opposite should stand up, be counted and deliver for the children of Australia. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:27):  I also rise to take note of Senator Birmingham's responses to questions from Labor senators today. First, I would like to absolutely support what Senator Marshall said in his contribution. We have people, and the minister in particular, talking about increases in funding when their own budget papers show us that it is a decrease in funding of over $22 billion. So I say to those senators who are signing up to pass this bill that they should look at their budget papers. They should look at what is in black and white. If you have over $22 billion in cuts, somebody loses out. We have already heard, through Senator Marshall, about the Victorian government's concern about $630 million, I think Senator Marshall said, in one year. In Tasmania, my home state, $60-odd million will be lost to the public education system in Tasmania. 


I particularly want to talk about the question that I asked Senator Birmingham, which was about the disability loadings in Tasmania. I did not get a response to that, regardless of how many times we asked that he directly respond to the question. What the Department of Education and Training, his own department, said in a question on notice that was released—



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  This is the minister's own department. This is what the department said: 'In 2018 the government sector, government schools, will lose $8 million, the Catholic sector will lose $2 million, and the independent sector will lose $2 million. That is a decrease of $12 million. The minister here would not even confirm his own department's advice—the response to a question on notice. That is how much the minister is evading answering any direct questions. This is very important. Back home in Tasmania, disability loading has been a matter of intense interest over the last few days. People in Tasmania know, parents know, the advocacy networks know that this government is cutting $12 million in 2018 alone from disability loading. If you want to sign up for that, well and good. But this is what is really happening, and you need to understand what is really happening.


Last night, on ABC TV news in Tasmania, Ms Kirsten Desmond, the spokesperson for the Tasmanian Disability Education Reform Lobby, said: 'There should not be one Tasmanian senator who votes for this in its current form, because what they are voting for this funding being stripped out of schools for students with a disability.' Ms Desmond, like so many others, is appalled that this government, this minister, is reducing funding to students in Tasmania with a disability by $12 million in 2018 alone—and this from a minister and a government  who pretend to support a needs based funding model. They are being very hypocritical in the position they have taken. Make no mistake, this is a massive cut for students in need in Tasmania.


The minister, in his answers to questions on notice, would not even confirm his own departments figures. I say to the crossbench and the Greens—I am not quite sure what they are doing—that they should have a look at the department's responses, have a look at the answers. They are different from what the minister is telling you. (Time expired)

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:37):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep sorrow at the death, on 18 June 2017, of Mary Shirley Walters, former senator for Tasmania, places on record its appreciation of her service to the Parliament and the nation and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.


Shirley Walters was born on 31 August 1925 in Sydney. She was the second of the three daughters of Eric and Mary Harrison. She was, in every sense, a daughter of the Liberal Party because she had a deeply political upbringing. Most of her childhood and early adult life took place in the shadow of her father's significant parliamentary career. 


Eric Harrison—or Sir Eric Harrison, as he became—was elected as the member for Wentworth in the other place in December 1931. He was later to become the deputy leader of the United Australia Party and he was the first ever deputy leader of the Liberal Party, serving from the formation of the party in 1945 until his retirement from parliament in 1956, making him, until Peter Costello overtook his record, the longest serving deputy leader of the Liberal Party. Sir Eric Harrison held a number of significant ministerial positions in five non-Labor ministries: The Lyons government, where he was Minister for the Interior; the Page government; the first Menzies government; the Fadden government; and the great postwar second Menzies government, where he held a number of defence related portfolios, among others. 


As a young girl, Shirley Walters experienced her first taste of politics by her father's side, campaigning from the back of a truck along the streets of his inner Sydney seat. As a young woman, she witnessed close hand her father's career as a senior cabinet minister. After completing her schooling, Shirley Walters found employment in the accounts department of the Rural Bank, but soon found that work unfulfilling, so she left the bank to begin nursing training at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, where she worked until her marriage to Dr David  Walters in 1949. Shortly after their marriage, the couple relocated to Hobart, where Dr Walters established an obstetrics practice. 


All her life, Shirley Walters was politically engaged and deeply committed to community service beyond politics. However, it was only in the 1970s she would become active as a professional politician. The 1970s was a decade of rapid and—in the eyes of many—radical social change, epitomised, perhaps, by the election of the Whitlam government, which left many conservative Australians concerned for the future of the nation and most Australians astonished at the folie de grandeur of Mr Whitlam. Reflecting in her valedictory speech on her inspiration for entering politics, Shirley Walters recalled quite clearly that she had had a driving force, and that driving force was Whitlam. We knew that something had to be done at that time, because great changes were occurring very quickly and very radically, and people were frightened. So, in 1975 Shirley Walters answered the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party's call for preselection nominations for the forthcoming Senate election. 


At the double dissolution election following the dismissal on 13 December that year, Tasmania returned five Liberal senators of the 10 Senate places then available. Shirley Walters was elected the fifth. This made her the first woman ever to represent Tasmania in the Senate. Such was her popularity within the Tasmanian Liberal party and the wider community, that, as Senator John Watson remarked on the occasion of her valedictory, it soon became apparent that the No. 1 position was for her. She would go on to lead the Tasmanian Liberal Senate ticket at the 1977 election as well as securing the safe second position on the Tasmanian Liberal Senate ticket for both the 1983 and 1987 elections. 


Throughout her nearly two decades long Senate career, Shirley Walters was a forceful and articulate advocate for her adopted state of Tasmania and also for issues of conscience and moral issues, which she held dear. She was proudly, unashamedly, a moral conservative. In her first speech to the chamber she remarked that, 'The people of Tasmania are now looking forward to the Liberal government for the equality that our Constitution affords us.' Although she remained a loyal stalwart of the party throughout and beyond her time in this place, she never shied away from what she believed to be her fundamental commitment to the people of Tasmania, crossing the floor on a total of 14 occasions throughout her career. The Fraser government in particular, was a government notable for a large ginger group of Liberal Senate backbenchers, of which Shirley Walters was one. Most notably, she voted against the Constitution alteration bills of 1977 and, in particular, the Constitution Alteration (Simultaneous Elections) Bill of 1977, which would have required that all elections for the Senate be held simultaneously with elections of the House of Representatives. She believed that that would have diminished the power and authority of the Senate as well as being inimical to the interests of a small state like Tasmania, the Senate being, in her firm opinion, as the founding fathers had ordained it to be, the states house. In the debate on the bill on 24 February of that year she declared herself to be 'totally opposed to this bill' and 'firmly committed to the independence of the Senate and the unhampered voice of the smaller States'. She observed:



The Senate is the most significant part of the federal structure. We remember from the great crisis of 1975 how the Senate demonstrated its power to reject a money bill. That power is fundamental and the way it is used depends upon the judgement of the Senate from time to time. These steps—


that is, the proposed constitutional amendment to require the simultaneous election of both houses—


represent the gradual undermining of the Senate preparatory to its abolition.


That was her warning. It is not to be forgotten that in those days the abolition of the Senate was the longstanding policy of the Australian Labor Party. The referendum was held on 21 May 1977, and although the yes vote was strong across the nation, with 62.2 per cent of ballots cast in favour of a yes vote, it was defeated by its failure to achieve the double majority required by section 128 of the Constitution. It was narrowly defeated in Queensland and Western Australia, but in Tasmania, where Shirley Walters led the campaign against the proposal, it was defeated by a whopping 158,818 votes to 82,785 votes—a margin of more than 30 per cent. So, we may say of Shirley Walters that one of her very important legacies was to be at the forefront of the salvation of the Senate, or at least the power of the Senate, from that obnoxious proposal of Mr Fraser's government.


In her maiden speech, Shirley Walters spoke of Tasmania's unparalleled natural beauty but equally of the acute economic challenges facing what she called the south island of Australia. Although many remember her for her staunch social conservatism and her defence of traditional family values, she could just as powerfully hold forth on an immense variety of diverse issues, from health policy to the complexities of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme and rising cost of living pressures. Indeed, such was her capacity to speak on a wide variety of topics that former senator Cheryl Kernot, teasingly no doubt, once referred to Senator Walters's unparalleled ability to speak on anything, for any length, at any time, the later the hour the better.


Senator Walters quickly established a reputation as a formidable and hardworking participant in the Senate committee system. She was chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare from November 1980 to February 1983, and thereafter served as a deputy chair of that committee until her retirement. During her tenure as chair and no doubt drawing upon her experience as a nurse she was instrumental in the production of landmark reports on youth homelessness, children in institutional care and drug abuse. She also served as chairman of the Library Bicentenary Publications Committee and as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes. 


From 1986 to 1988 Shirley Walters served as the appointee of the then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, to the board of the Bicentennial Authority, established to oversee community activities commemorating the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia. However, she was perhaps best known for her efforts to address community concerns about the depiction of violence and the degradation of women in modern media, including through her ultimately unsuccessful Regulation of Video Material Bill, which sought to prohibit the sale and hire of X-rated content in Australia. Notwithstanding her independent streak, in 1988 Shirley Walters was appointed to the then opposition front bench as shadow parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard. 


When Shirley Walters retired from the Senate in 1993, she did so as a trailblazer for Liberal women. She remained active in the Liberal Party in her home state for the rest of the life. She had served as a member of the Tasmanian Liberal Party state executive in 1981 and 1982. She continued her activism within the Liberal Party branches in Tasmania well into old age. In 2003 she was awarded life membership of the Tasmanian division, the Liberal Party's highest honour. She regularly attended branch meetings well into her 91st year and would often, I am told, telephone her branch president between meetings to provide her knowledgeable input on a broad spectrum of policy. 


I met Shirley Walters. I cannot claim to have known her well, but I can well understand why the word often associated with her was 'formidable'. She was a formidable advocate kept for conservative causes, but through her kindness and intelligence she won the respect of her peers from every section of this chamber. She entered politics, as I have said, in reaction to the Whitlam years and in defence of the great values: love of country, of family, of individual freedom, of respect for the constitution, of small government, the values which had inspired the Liberal Party over the generations. As her opposition to the 1977 simultaneous elections referendum showed, she had a very healthy respect for the powers and constitutional status of the Senate.


In her valedictory speech to this chamber, Shirley Walters said, 'I decided that I really loved my country and that I was going to do something about it.' So she did. She will be sadly missed by all who knew her, but most particularly, of course, by her four children, Rob, Pam, Susie and Jim, her 13 grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, to whom, on behalf of the government, I offer our sincerest condolences.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:52):  I rise on behalf of the opposition to acknowledge the passing of former senator Mary Shirley Walters, who passed away last week, and to convey, on behalf of the opposition, our condolences to her family and friends. Mrs Walters served in the Australian Senate from 1975 until 1993 and was, significantly, the first female senator to be elected from Tasmania. She was a woman of conservative values, and combined with the encouragement of business as central to employment growth she maintained a strong commitment to supporting families throughout her time in public life. Senator Brandis has outlined in much more detail what I was going to advert too, which it is that she was a woman of very strong Liberal pedigree. Her father, Sir Eric Harrison, was a minister in the Menzies government before resigning to become the Australian high commissioner in London.


Born in Sydney in 1925, Mrs Walters trained as a nurse before her marriage to David Walters. At that point she left the paid workforce to take on, proudly, the role of caregiver in the home. However, she entered politics, spurred on by her negative reaction to the policies of the Whitlam government. Elected in the double dissolution of 1975 that formally swept that government from power following the dismissal, she would go on to be elected again in 1977, 1983 and 1987.


Mrs Walters was well placed to become a consistent contributor on matters concerning health policy and family life during her time in the Senate. This is reflected in her committee service, including the Social Welfare and Community Affairs committees, of which she was a member for virtually the entire Senate career. She recognised the influence she could have on policy from this position. She was not afraid to maintain her strident political positions, even when they conflicted with party policy. She crossed the floor on 14 occasions throughout her career, which seems an extraordinary number in today's world. This inevitably had an impact on her career within the parliamentary party, although she did serve as Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition from 1987 to 1989. She was a loyal Tasmanian and, if you read her speech, she speaks at great length about her home state, saying that it was without doubt the most beautiful of all the states in the Australian Commonwealth and essentially daring anyone who disagreed to have an argument with her.

  I am surrounded by others who are cheering that. She was also an advocate, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate has said, for the Bass Strait freight equalisation scheme. Interestingly, if you do read her first speech, you can see her advocacy for that ab initio, as it were, from the beginning seeing it as critical to the Tasmanian economy. Unsurprisingly, she championed the rights of the smaller states and the place of the Senate in our constitutional framework as a defender of these rights.


If there were ever any doubt that Shirley Walters stood resolutely behind the values and position she campaigned on throughout her time in the Senate, I think that was put to rest by the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, when he spoke on her valedictory in 1993. He commenced with an honest but friendly appraisal, saying, 'A Liberal reformer she ain't' and describing her as 'a campaigner for every Tory value I deeply deplore'. What I would suggest is that that demonstrates that Mrs Walters was an extremely effective campaigner for conservative values during her time in the Senate. Senator Evans went on to reflect that, despite the terrible things they had said to each other over the years, there was never any malice. He said:


She has believed fiercely in a series of particular political objectives, she has been as tough as nails in this place in pursuing those objectives, but she has always been thoroughly charming and pleasant personally and impossible to hold a grudge against.


I think they are fine words from a political opponent.


In keeping with the assessment of her character by Senator Evans, then Senator Walters spent much of her own valedictory thanking the very many people who had provided assistance to her over her 18-year career. After she left the Senate, she remained active in the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party and was awarded, as Senator Brandis has outlined, life membership in 2003, of course a very great honour.


Regardless of whether or not she would have accepted the label, Shirley Walters was a trailblazer and she left her mark as a passionate advocate for her home state of Tasmania and for the conservative values that she considered core to the Liberal Party. We again extend our deepest sympathies to her family and friends following her passing.

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Minister for Indigenous Affairs and Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:57):  I rise on behalf of the Nationals in this place to offer condolences and to pay my respect to former senator Shirley Walters, who, sadly, passed away earlier this week. I would also like to associate the Nationals with all the remarks that have come before in the Senate debate.


Shirley Walters made a tremendous contribution to the nation as a nurse, a senator and a mother. She grew up with politics in her family and had remarked that she had campaigned for her father, Sir Eric Harrison, in Sydney when she was a teenager when he was the member for Wentworth. Her time in nursing did draw some interest in this place when she remarked that she had used heroin some years ago—although later did clarify that she was referring to her patients.


As others have remarked, Senator Walters was the first woman to be elected in the Senate from the state of Tasmania, and we pay respect to her for that remarkable achievement at that time in this place. Just like other women who led the way—Senator Tangney, the first ever woman elected to the Senate or, from my own home, my good friend Senator Trish Crossin—these women were role models for their families and communities and for this nation. Shirley Walters showed all Tasmanian women what was possible, and the Senate and the rest of Australia is better for her efforts.


Elected in 1975, she was at the forefront of promoting better outcomes for Australian women and remarked in 1976 that 'if women are disadvantaged then the whole of Australia should be concerned'. I think it is this sentiment that goes to the heart of our responsibilities as senators in this place. We are privileged to get the opportunity to serve the nation. Senator Walters, by all accounts took a very vigorous and honourable approach to her service to the nation. 


She was a very practical senator and took a very pragmatic approach to politics, focusing on economic issues for Tasmanians. She was always promoting marketing of Tasmanian made goods and ensuring that that was on people's minds when they made purchases. She was always talking about the vital tourist trade. As we already heard, she had a passion for the wonderful beauty of her country. She often spoke about it as a place to visit and a place to boost the Tasmanian economy. I acknowledge these are still issues that Tasmanian senators—like yourself, Mr President—are still advocating for today. 


I do not think you can ever question what she stood up for and what she believed in. Shirley Walters stood up to the senior ministers throughout her time here and was known as the most prolific interjector in this place, with a nickname of 'Foghorn Leghorn'. But I think that, above all else, she was committed to her family, and I would like to pass on the condolences and sympathies of the Nationals to her family. They should be proud of the contribution and life of former Senator Walters. Vale Shirley Walters.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:01):  In paying my respects to Shirley Walters and my condolences to her family, I want to mention some personal reflections I have of Shirley Walters. I arrived in this chamber as a very fresh, new, somewhat shy senator from way up there in the bush, and I can remember Shirley Walters. She sat, as I recall, in the back row in that second stanza of seats there. As Senator Scullion mentioned—whether she was referred to as 'Foghorn Leghorn' I could not say—she certainly had a voice that would fit that description. 


I have to say I was in awe of Shirley Walters, perhaps over-awed and, dare I say, even intimidated. If Shirley Walters said something to me or to the party in the party room, it would be done without question, because you did not argue with Shirley. Listening to Senator Wong's reflections about what Senator Evans, the then leader of the government, said, I can again see her. And she would say terrible things about him, which he took with good grace as he always did. She did not mean them but she was intimidatingly abrupt in the way she spoke. 


I was in the Senate for three years with her. The description I always remember about Shirley Walters is that she was ramrod straight. She was ramrod straight in her posture, notwithstanding the fact that, as Senator Brandis mentioned, she did have a car accident, which must have been an inconvenience for her or more. It must have been very difficult for her, but she would never let that be known or accept any sympathy. She often had a walking stick and at times a neck brace. So it was difficult for her to move around. Her mobility was sometimes restricted. It never stopped her crossing the floor, though, when she needed to do that. 


Shirley Walters, as has been mentioned, was yet another Liberal first. She was the first woman senator from the state of Tasmania. That was something she was proud of and something that we Liberals are proud of—we have a lot of firsts in those categories. I want to quote from some reflections by a well-known parliamentary observer and political historian, Don Morris. He has written some words about Shirley Walters. He reminded us that when Shirley was first elected to the Senate she said:


I think it would be wrong for candidates to be chosen just because they were women—or not women … … I am definitely not a women's libber.


Further, she said:


During my campaign I was frequently asked questions relating to women. I replied then, and I still maintain, that women's issues are Australia's issues and Australia's issues are women's issues and any problems must be dealt with by all Australians. We women are not an underprivileged minority group as the radical feminists would have us depicted. We women in Australia are equal with our menfolk, and only those who would wish to denigrate our sex would have us believe otherwise.


I think they are very telling words from someone who understood the importance of women in public life and led the way of women in this chamber and, indeed, the parliament.


Senator Walters was described, again sourcing Don Morris's work, as:


… a Menzian Liberal. She held a strong commitment to supporting the family unit and to supporting business as a source of jobs and carried these principles throughout her own parliamentary career. Always active in the Senate chamber—


And I can vouch for that personally. She was—


renowned for the frequency of her interjections, she was 'an indefatigable, noisy, wearying campaigner' to those who opposed her, but she was respected across the political divide for her 'dogged determination' …


That is another image I have of Shirley Walters—dogged determination in whatever she did.


She was never afraid of prosecuting an argument, however unfashionable, even within her own party. She has, Mr Deputy President, as you and Senator Bushby would know, received the highest accolade that the Liberal Party can bestow upon anyone by being awarded a life membership to the party. I note Senator Brandis's comment, I think it was, that she still would attend branch meetings and would generously ring the president beforehand to share views. I can just imagine that it would not have been so much sharing views as it would have been her saying, 'Mr Chairman, you must do this, that and the other.' I know I can say that with Shirley, and if she is looking down on me she will not be offended by my saying that she was a very, very forceful person. It was a real privilege for me to have three years serving with her and understanding a lot about different approaches to the Senate. She had commitment to the Senate, commitment to her own state of Tasmania and commitment to Australia. Shirley, may you rest in peace and, again, my condolences to your family.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (16:07):  I rise to also support the motion of condolence moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and to add a few words of tribute to the life and work of the late Shirley Walters, both on my own behalf and on behalf of my fellow Tasmanian Liberal senators, Senator Abetz, Senator Duniam and, of course, you, Mr President.


Shirley was, as has been mentioned, a trailblazer for women in politics in my state, although, as hinted at by Senator Wong, she scoffed at the very description. She was only the 12th woman to be elected to serve in this place and the first woman of any party to be elected as a senator for Tasmania. But in 1975, when she was preselected in a winnable position on the Liberal Party ticket and the Launceston newspaper The Examiner asked her about being a woman going into politics, she responded that she had stood because she felt that she had the skills that would be useful, not because of her gender.


As noted by Senator Brandis, Shirley came from a strong political background. Her father was a significant figure in Australian politics in the first part of the 20th century. After a significant business career, when he stood for preselection for the United Australia Party in 1931 for the seat of Wentworth, the local party could not decide between him and the sitting UAP member, so they endorsed them both. Each stood and won a major share of the vote, with Shirley's father, Eric Harrison, emerging victorious. As has been noted, he became a minister in the Lyons government and went on to become Deputy Leader of the UAP and then the first Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party under Robert Menzies.


She married Dr David Walters in 1949, and they moved to Hobart. They had four children—Rob, Pam, Susie and Jim—and Shirley spent their formative years supporting her husband and bringing up the family. However, she also found time for community activities and was heavily involved in supporting the National Trust.


Although she declared that she was never a women's libber, it is interesting that many of the views that prompted Shirley Walters to stand for the Senate have now become mainstream. For instance, she felt that sex education was important but that it should emphasise the obligations of men, as well as a practical approach to contraception.


For years Shirley campaigned against pornography and was criticised by some at the time for being a wowser, and yet her strong view was that much of it was exploitative of women. In this view, she was well ahead of her time.


She was a strong defender of her state and, as noted already, crossed the floor a number of times when she felt Fraser government measures would be detrimental to Tasmania. However, she never did this in an ambush. She always told the leader of the day and the party room what her intention was, and she did not grandstand on those issues.


In the chamber, Shirley Walters was a frequent interjector, as we have heard from a number of speakers today, and knew just how to get under the skin of her political opponents. But she kept any of that stridency strictly in the chamber, and was ever courteous and friendly outside the field of political combat.


Having been a nurse, she brought to the Senate a strong interest in health care and, in particular, aged care. She and former Labor senator Pat Giles were a formidable pair. In the years of the Fraser government, she chaired the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes, with Pat Giles as her deputy, and after the election of the Hawke government they swapped places. As a footnote, I note that this was the first committee of the Senate to initially comprise only women senators.


Unlike many, Shirley Walters remained active in the Liberal Party after she retired from the Senate. She was a regular attendee and speaker at branch meetings, as we have heard already, state council and Senate preselection—and I personally remember her asking me challenging questions at my own first preselection in 2007. The Tasmanian Division of the Liberal Party rarely confers the honour of life membership, but, as we have heard today, she received that honour in 2003.


She also supported her husband in his own role as a respected alderman of the Hobart City Council, and of course she enjoyed being a grandmother to 13 and a great-grandmother to three.


Some senators may also  know that Shirley's oldest child, Rob, has been a leading advocate for men's health in this country. He is very highly regarded and was the overseas medical officer to the Prime Minister during Julia Gillard's tenure in that office. 


I know that her family are feeling her loss keenly at this time, and I send my sincere sympathies to all of them. On a personal note, can I say to all her family how grateful I was for Shirley's wise advice and support, and can I also say how proud they can be of their mother's significant contribution not only to their state but to our nation.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.





Senator RHIANNON:
  I table an explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



I introduce the Greens' Live Animal Export (Slaughter) Prohibition Bill, which would end the horror and suffering that is the live export trade.


Thirty-two years ago a Senate inquiry found evidence of the cruelty of the trade was enough to close it down on animal welfare grounds alone. It recommended that the Government expand the chilled meat trade to eventually replace the live export trade. 


The Greens echo those calls. And for many years we have appealed to successive governments to end the trade and provide a just transition to the domestic chilled meat industry. That would be a win-win. Not only would the intense suffering of animals on those ships stop, but it would be a huge boost to Australian jobs and it would grow local supply chains in rural economies.


Yet despite the clear ethical, reputational and financial benefits of ending the live export trade, successive Labor and Coalition governments have continued to support this cruel and abhorrent trade in animal suffering.


Since 2000, 612 639 animals have been reported as dying on crowded live export ships. A vast number of those animals suffered slow deaths from starvation, unable to eat or digest the factory-produced pellets that are used by exporters to substitute a lifetime of grains or pastured food.


Over 25.2 million frightened animals have been crowded into the stinking holds of live export ships in the past seven years alone, blanketed in their own excrement for weeks which fouls any feed or water they might access. Their eyes, throats and lungs are burnt by dense toxic ammonic gases accumulating in those airless holds. 


Hundreds of thousands of sheep have died a cruel death from salmonellosis, pneumonia and enteritis with its fevered, cramping and bloodied diarrhoea; in excruciating pain from untreated injuries, infections and illness; or baked alive in searing temperatures. 


The profiteering from such abject and systemic cruelty continues, supported by both Labor and the Coalition.


In 2011 we saw clear evidence of animals being systematically tortured in Indonesia. The Federal Government responded with a temporary ban on the trade. But rather than transitioning towards domestic meat processing industry, they put a supply chain assurance scheme in place and lifted the ban. We now know that scheme, the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance scheme or ESCAS, has failed to do what it was supposed to do.


A history of breaches and complete lack of action shows that the Department of Agriculture is incapable of regulating the live export trade through ESCAS. ESCAS was intended to bring certainty to the Australian public, who are immensely concerned about animal welfare on live export ships. But the shocking acts of cruelty have continued unchecked.


In 2015-16 alone, over 17,000 animals died on that harrowing haul to overseas markets where their unspeakable suffering intensified. 


In overseas markets under the failed ESCAS regime, Australian animals cower and bellow under bludgeoning sledgehammers; have their throats sawn with blunt knives; tendons sliced, bodies and eyes stabbed; decapitated slowly; dragged and trussed into oven-baking car boots or on top of car roofs like terrified baggage to suffer abuse and horrific deaths.


Australian governments continue to excuse and facilitate extreme brutality by opening up this abhorrent trade to countries where animal abuse and cruelty thrives in government-sanctioned abattoirs.


Recently, the Greens have become concerned that the government is planning to expand the live export trade, at a time when they should be phasing it out. In Senate Estimates this February, the Department of Agriculture confirmed that it has considered ESCAS arrangements for horses, ponies and donkeys for the purposes of slaughter in the event that an application for live export is lodged. Animal welfare groups have seen an exposure draft order that would do such a thing.


I note that the Australian Livestock Exporters Council has stated that it and its members do not support the commencement of any trade in the live export of equines for slaughter. The government needs to definitively ban the export of equines for slaughter as well.


I also wish to note that the Victorian state director of the government's own Export Finance Credit Agency, EFIC, revealed that the agency did not fund the live export trade because it involved ""too much cruelty"". Those comments were quickly walked back by other EFIC members, but they were very revealing. And thanks to this individual we now know that there are individuals within some arms of government who are willing to give an honest assessment of the risks associated with this inhumane trade. Indeed, a Western Australian magistrate's court has found that a routine live export sheep voyage is unequivocally cruel. Australia's reputation isn't the only risk created by the barbaric live export trade. There is an unambiguous case that Australia can also profit financially from closure of live exports. The value of chilled meat exports is consistently worth seven to eight times more in trade income to Australia than live exports. 


Recently, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce announced his government is putting $8.3 million towards the livestock assurance scheme to improve 'efficiency and competitiveness' in the sector. While the local meat processing industry struggles, and jobs are dwindling, this government is busy funding and promoting this cruel trade. The live export trade remains in direct competition with the domestic meat processing industry which is of greater value to the Australian economy, as is the maintenance and creation of domestic employment along the domestic supply chain. Conversely the closure of domestic processors and the loss of local employment continue to be directly attributable to the growth of the live export trade that has shifted much of the profits and value-adding to overseas markets. 


In 2004, a WA Ministerial Taskforce directly blamed the growth in the live export trade as coming at the expense of the domestic meat processing industry with the two sectors competing for the limited supply of animals at the farm gate. This has a major impact on the supply of animals for processing, resulting in the consequent rationalisation of the meat processing sector.


The 2006 Hassall report into the live export industry forecast sheep-meat imports progressively displacing live sheep in Middle East markets, and demand for chilled meat growing. Trade figures show that for over 10 years chilled meat has been worth around 700 to 800 per cent times more in export dollars than the live export trade. 


In 2010 a report by SG Heilbron, The Future of the Queensland Beef Industry and the Impact of Live Cattle Exports, found that ""The rapid and unchecked growth of live cattle exports is inflicting significant damage on Queensland's beef processing industry"" and that ""live cattle exports are cannibalising Queensland's beef industry striking at the heart of its value chain"".


The 2012 ACIL Tasman economic analysis of the inputs and outputs of live cattle export farms in Australia's top end shows they are not financially sustainable over the long term regardless of the live export market and ""are problematic from a whole business perspective.""


A 2013 Sapere report looking at the economic impact of phasing out live sheep exports found that ""While there may be issues in relation to the availability of suitable labour, there exists sufficient spare physical processing capacity in Western Australia to absorb the entire Australian live sheep export trade as it currently stands.""


In December 2015, an industry conference was told the business case for exporting cattle to Indonesia had collapsed, with costs increasing by 4-5 times in the previous 8 years with it costing around 5 times more to produce a kilogram of beef in Indonesia through importing and feeding cattle than it did to import beef in a box.


Indeed a very small percentage of Australian livestock producers sell into the live export trade, which produces a small percentage of the income streams for the large majority of those producers.


The 2014 ABARES Live Export Trade Assessment Report reported that Australian livestock producers receive just 7% of their income from the sale of livestock to the live export industry, with 93% coming from the domestic processing sector. Only 12% of cattle producers in northern Australia rely on live exports as their primary source of income.


Additionally, international market factors beyond Australia's control will always present a constant threat to the sustainability of the live export industry.


There is only one answer. 


The Greens' plan to end the barbarism that is the Australian live export trade will benefit of the domestic meat processing industry and create more Australian jobs. It is time for a just transition to address animal cruelty and create economic benefits for rural Australia.


I commend this Bill to the Senate.

Senator GALLAGHER:
  This motion responds to concerns about international gambling sites collecting data from amateur sporting competitions on behalf of the offshore live betting sites. This motion would compel the production of a 2015 memorandum of understanding between the Australian Federal Police and Sportradar designed to reduce barriers to information-sharing on match fixing and related issues. Labor believes it is important to protect the integrity of Australian sport from organised crime. The AFP have said that the release of this MOU would have an adverse effect on investigation and intelligence operations, and for this reason Labor will not be supporting this motion. However, we are open to working with Senator Xenophon or the government on measures to ensure organised crime does not target Australian sport.

For that reason I thought it was important that this motion be passed so that we can actually see what the AFP has in terms of its agreement with Sportradar and whether the AFP is aware of Real Time Sportscast and its role in facilitating online gambling in other countries on our amateur sports.

The PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator GALLAGHER:
  This motion responds to concerns about international gambling sites collecting data from amateur sporting competitions on behalf of the offshore live betting sites. This motion would compel the production of a 2015 memorandum of understanding between the Australian Federal Police and Sportradar designed to reduce barriers to information-sharing on match fixing and related issues. Labor believes it is important to protect the integrity of Australian sport from organised crime. The AFP have said that the release of this MOU would have an adverse effect on investigation and intelligence operations, and for this reason Labor will not be supporting this motion. However, we are open to working with Senator Xenophon or the government on measures to ensure organised crime does not target Australian sport.

Senator XENOPHON:
  I am disappointed that the opposition does not see fit to support this motion. Sportradar is a multinational corporation that specialises in sports data collection and dissemination to deal with issues of match fixing. But it also has a subsidiary, Real Time Sportscast, which sends data scouts around the country to amateur sporting events, including the Tuggeranong women's basketball team, to facilitate betting on those games in other countries. For that reason I thought it was important that this motion be passed so that we can actually see what the AFP has in terms of its agreement with Sportradar and whether the AFP is aware of Real Time Sportscast and its role in facilitating online gambling in other countries on our amateur sports.

DSP claimants who indicate they have a disability related to substance abuse will now also be required to undergo treatment for their abuse before any associated functional impairments can be considered to be fully diagnosed, treated, stabilised and assessed under the remaining DSP impairment tables. Once table 6 is removed, permanent impairments caused by substance abuse can be assessed under the remaining tables. However, they would be functionally based rather than based on diagnosis alone. For example, a permanent brain injury acquired from long-term drug use can be assessed under table 7, brain function. Our changes ensure that people with drug abuse issues are directed to the help they need.

They simply want to punish those who are suffering from addiction rather than helping them.


These impairment tables were a result of a review conducted in 2011. The government is claiming that that report is the justification for this measure. However, the government is selectively reading that report and has failed to understand the reasons for including table 6, functioning related to alcohol, drug and substance use. The functional impacts of substance addictions are unique and cannot be appropriately recognised under the other impairment tables.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (19:20):  I am pleased that we have been able to commence with the minister with us now, so that I can get directly to some very important points. I do not have the precise time, but very, very recently the government tabled some amendments. My first question to the minister will be: is this it? Are these all the amendments that are due to appear, or is there a further sheet of amendments that is yet to arrive? The reason that I ask that question is that there has been so much speculation about what this debate may involve, and so little real information. There was even the question I asked earlier to the minister after question time about the order of production of documents. That was due, eventually, to be tabled, but that regular process was interrupted by the lengthy debate around the hours motion as we dealt with our concerns about the fact that we were being asked to establish hours to deal with this debate, without even an understanding of what the matter was before us. I have raised this same point with senators who have been involved in some discussions with the government . I will be very specific, because I know the minister needs us to be very specific on these issues. So far we have circulated for the government GX158, GX160 and GX167. 


Obviously, we have had very little time to analyse those, but, on a very cursory analysis, they certainly do not seem to be the full monty. There are many other issues, including faster transition arrangements for government schools to reach better funding levels—although still, quite probably, not anywhere near the student resource standard, because there is no capacity to commit states in this process—but the full monty I am referring to here is this supposed moratorium that has been canvassed. What is unclear is what that moratorium actually relates to. Figures were circulated in the press overnight, and this seems to be the government's preferred mode of operating: 'Let's leak stories into the press rather than provide the public or the parliament with adequate information to assess a matter.' Overnight we saw stories, and the first one suggested, if I recall correctly, a one-year accommodation that was worth $62 million. Then today there was another story circulating, talking about an accommodation that was worth $50 million. So the crux of the matter, minister, is: what is the real deal? I am hoping that, rather than at midnight tonight or midnight tomorrow night, we might actually get to a stage of understanding what is in this bill. 


So, what is the real deal and, of course, what is a special deal? That is a particular question that I would like the minister to answer, because, for even longer than the last seven weeks—if you go back to the lead-up of his campaign, going to his two case studies before the ministerial council—he has been telling us that he was going to have a consistent standard across Australia: his pure, one-size-fits-all model. That is what was going to be going forward, and then any other arrangements that might have been put in place under Gonski 1 involved special or, as I have quoted before—the former minister, Christopher Pyne—special dirty deals.


Well, now the government is back-pedalling, it seems. Maybe some of my colleagues on the other side, such as Senator Back, have been able to convince the government that they were never special deals. But special deals is what the minister has told us consistently. It is what he told us through estimates. It is what he has told us in answers to questions in this place time and time again. And it seems, according to the media that has been circulating—because that is all we really have to operate by—that what he previously couched as special deals are no longer special deals.


Now, I do not take credit myself. I know we have been pointing out to the government for some time now why certain matters were structured in certain ways, why there was a need for a review of the SES model and how indeed it was Mr Gonski's review that recommended that it should occur somewhat urgently. And time and time again the minister has argued otherwise. Indeed, we even had to have a correction from the department, because they tied themselves in knots trying to defend this minister on the fraudulent claims that were being made about the SES measure. So, the department tried to argue in the committee inquiry into this bill that indeed the SES measure had been adjusted and revised. That reflected earlier public comments that the minister had made in the media—or at least that he was reported as having made; maybe it was a spokesman. But at that point in time the government was arguing that it had been revised. And we know that was false. We know that the department needed to make a correction and that whilst they did not ultimately admit the consequence of that correction, the consequence was that the minister's claims were wrong; the SES measure had not been adjusted in the way that was claimed. It had never been taken down to the mesh blocks that had been suggested in the Gonski review, and that work still was urgently required.


Of course we have also heard the minister claiming that the Gonski review did not recommend that, until such time as that urgent review of the SES model occurred, systems should still be assessed as systems and a system weighted average calculation should continue to apply. No: instead, what this minister did in this bill was remove that arrangement, call it a special deal—even though it was an arrangement recommended very clearly in the Gonski review—and then, secondly, make further changes to the capacity to contribute arrangements for non-government primary schools. And remember, this is not a special deal for Catholics here; this was an arrangements for all school systems.


That is why in the committee inquiry—glossed over in the government's report—there were Lutherans, Anglicans and a range of other school systems saying that the impact of these changes was going to damage them as well. So while the minister is standing up there saying that there is growth for—as an example—independent schools, the 4.7 per cent over 10 years, what that glosses over is that there are school systems within even independent schools that were losing out over these changes. What is even worse is that this minister had in place a 10-year transition, he would have you believe. The capacity to contribute changes and the system weighted average changes were going to impact in full in 2018—in full, no transition, no accommodation. We have been told by the systems that have been asking this question—contrary to the non-answer that I got in the legislation inquiry—that systems have been told they would have no access to the adjustment funds. Perhaps that is the second question that the minister could clarify. Will systems have access to the transition adjustment funds, or is it designed specifically for another special group? But, of course, we do not have special groups, or so the minister would have us believe, now that he has done yet another backflip on how he is proceeding here. 


So the next question that I would have related to that one is: what will happen, if, indeed, we do eventually see amendments—or maybe they are in front of me and I have not been able to digest them properly yet—that do adjust the system weighted average arrangements and that do deal with the capacity to contribute measure? If we do revert back to the full existing model arrangements, as some media commentary has suggested—and maybe for the purposes of these discussions I will call that the 'full Monty moratorium'—if we do get a full Monty moratorium, what will happen to systems such as the Anglican system? I cannot recall which state, but there is one system that has been seeking the minister to acknowledge them as a system. I have been told they have been waiting for 12 months. So, Senator Back, here is an interesting example of a case at point. We have a system that had an application before the minister to be recognised as a system, like their brothers and sisters in other states, and the minister refused to act upon it. He can correct me if my information is not accurate, but where does that system sit now? Are they inside or outside? Is it the full Monty moratorium, or is it something less? If it is something less, then what is the impact of not fully preserving the arrangements that Gonski recommended should be put in place? That is one question. 


The next question is, as I have said: what about schools that are wanting to operate as systems? There are actually some educational benefits for encouraging and facilitating schools to operate as systems, not only issues like economy of scale but also issues like improving pedagogy and a range of other factors that we know work better. Indeed, that is why the Grattan Institute has been telling us for decades that there are very good things about how low-fee Catholic systemic schools operate. They produce very good outcomes, and that is why I am pleased that Senator Back has been fighting to preserve their capacity to continue to operate in that fashion. Why on earth, under a claim of 'We're going to improve Australian education for Australian school children', would we attack or compromise what we know works? 


I will be listening intently to the minister when he is able to answer: do we have the full Monty moratorium? Does it include both the system weighted average arrangements that currently exist? And does it remove from this bill the capacity to contribute changes that we know are going to be so damaging to parish Catholic primary schools, amongst others? There are Lutheran schools and Anglican schools. They have all told us the same thing. So when the minister has a chance to answer that and direct me to the precise provisions in the amendments that have only just been circulated, I will be very pleased to see those. 


Before I go into a range of other matters, I will return to how proposed changes might impact on government schools, because that is probably the most fundamental principle here—the funds that will not flow to Australian public schools and that will not ensure that Australian public schools get anywhere near the government's student resource standard.


The point that I have been making consistently over the last day or so is the point that the shadow minister has been making in the House as well. This is what is missed by most of the commentators that say, 'Oh, but there is more money here.' It is the proportion of that money that goes to public schools that is the issue here. That is the fundamental issue about why Gonski 2.0 is not a real Gonski. We have ended up with a situation under Gonski 2.0—it may be adjusted, and that is a further question for the minister—where only 50 per cent of the additional money goes to public schools, whereas under Gonski 1.0, 80 per cent of it did. Indeed, we have a settlement across all sectors about that. (Time expired)

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (19:38):  The minister sought leave to move a certain number of amendments together. No, Minister, I am not being deliberately obstinate at this point in time, but I have just, as an example, asked you a range of questions. You have not responded to any of those; you have just sought to dive into amendments that have only just been circulated. I have already made the point that they have not yet been able to be digested. I asked you in my questions if you could please take me to the amendments that deal with some particular issues as part of the opening stage of this committee stage and you have not done so. So why on earth, if you cannot even conduct a regular committee stage debate where we deal with general matters first, would I be standing here agreeing to particular clusters?


There are two things that need to be dealt with before the opposition will reach an understanding of what clusters we are prepared to proceed with. One of those is that we have had time to digest your amendments. The second one, of course, is that we have a coherent running sheet that reflects those amendments. Until such time as that is before us—it is not obstinacy, Minister. You might have had these amendments in front of you, potentially, for 12 months, if I consider the question I asked you about Anglican systems. You might have known what your agenda is for 12 months, but this parliament, this Senate, has only just been provided with these amendments. Indeed, I think Senator Hanson-Young was still looking for the amendments. So, no; we will not, at this point in time, be discussing the order in which we will proceed through amendments, not until we have had an opportunity to digest them and not until we have a coherent running sheet that reflects them. You do not even know what a running sheet is, do you?—by the look on your face.

Frankly, it is impossible, Minister, to digest anything while you are on your feet, making a contribution in the chamber. You might not understand that, but I think the public at large would have a pretty sensible idea that that is the case. So that is one point.


The second point is we have not long had your amendments, and I think everyone in this chamber, including Senator Back, is still trying to digest what is there. You have not answered my question yet about whether there are any more whether this is it.

But, again, given that all of us started the day and meetings at around eight o'clock this morning and we are now in here approaching eight o'clock at night, I am not surprised that I did not comprehend part of what you might have put.

The minister, at the start of this committee stage contribution, got up and gave a general presentation about his views of the world and how he regretted that he did not have the opportunity in the second reading debate to close the debate. Well, that was your own colleague who did that, Senator Birmingham, and there were indeed other senators who would have taken the opportunity to make a second reading contribution. And I think, by virtue of senator Cormann's conduct, you will find that those same senators have some issues that they want to address in this committee-stage consideration. So I would not anticipate that you will be getting to dealing with amendments in detail for a little while yet.


You were denied the opportunity to make a contribution, as were a number of other senators. You brought on this debate in a way that you had not given the Senate notice of. You commenced this bill as the first bill this morning rather than as it has had been advertised, as the second for the day. Other senators had commitments. Indeed, if I recall correctly, Senator McKenzie did not get here to speak at the allocated time on the running sheet. She did not get here, because she had another commitment. Well, indeed, several of my colleagues did as well.


So, you will need to understand that we will not be moving from the general discussion in the committee stage phase until we are ready. When we are ready—it is not obstinacy, but when we are ready—I will be able to give you an understanding of what clusters we are happy to proceed with, and we will move through this committee stage consideration in an orderly manner. But we are not going to be rushed. We are not going to be hoodwinked. We are not going to be presented with more fantasy figures that you cannot justify. We will hold this government to account, and we will challenge you when you are trying to pull the wool over any particular senator's eyes. We will ensure that your moratorium is exposed if it is not the full monty. We will ensure that the other arrangements of your agreements stand up to scrutiny. You can go behind closed doors. You can fail to provide the information that you should, consistently, time and time again. You can hoodwink the crossbench into agreeing to an inadequate legislation inquiry that is rushed when it does not need to be, that is pushed through this Senate in a fashion that should not occur. You can—sometimes—get away with those things. But at the end of the day you need to come into this chamber and face the opposition.


So no, we will not be rushed. Yes, we will look closely at these amendments that you have only just circulated. We will match them against the selective leaking of stories in the media that has occurred over the last couple of days. We will challenge those senators who believe they have a particular deal, that the deal actually does stand up to scrutiny. And I am sure the Greens will do the same. They know what this government has been offering in their discussions better than we do, and I am sure they will be taking some considerable time to ensure that what we are dealing with here are the facts. So no, Senator Birmingham. We will not be moving to a discussion about the detail of your first amendment until all of those other issues have been addressed and indeed until we have more adequate answers to the general questions that I have already asked and that I am sure many of my colleagues will want to ask, too.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (19:47):  I do not think I could articulate the arguments from our side any better than Senator Collins, but I do have some questions, because I have been inundated with calls and emails from concerned parents and teachers around Tasmania and around the country. And they are not just from Catholic schools, as was asserted earlier today when I was making a contribution, but also from the state school system and from the Anglican schools. People are very concerned, because so many mixed messages have been sent out by this government. But we do know—there is one thing that is very clear, as far as we know, standing here right now—that this government plans to take away $22 billion from Australian children.


But I do think it is important to actually try to gather some information, because during question time today the minister was saying things about those on this side who were asking questions—that it is why we need to put more emphasis on education, because we on this side cannot add up. Well, quite frankly, it is not us that are having the problem with the figures; it is this government and this minister. We have already established, through question time today, that Lauriston Girls' School in Melbourne, which has fees for its primary school of up to $27,000, is now set to get seven times the funding increase of other primary schools. One in particular that was mentioned today was Anula Primary School in Darwin. I ask the minister: how is that fair?


I also want to talk about some schools that I visited in Tasmania, and I will get to that in a moment. But first I want to ask you, Minister, because you were very diligent in avoiding answering the question when it was raised by Senator Brown, about the cut in funding for children with disabilities who get assistance through our Tasmanian education system: how can a cut not be a cut? Also, can you provide the figure for the funding they currently receive and the funding they will receive through this bill, if it gets passed. 


If it gets passed it will be because of the dirty deals you have done with those people on the crossbenches. You have done a deal with Senator Hanson, who made outrageous comments in relation to children with disabilities in our state primary and high schools throughout this country. Senator Hanson is the senator from Queensland who will never stand up for a school like the Holy Spirit Catholic School in Townsville, which does a fantastic job. Yet, you, as the education minister, are sidling up to Pauline Hanson and her party to get your dirty deal through at the cost of children with disabilities in this country, despite her outrageous comments. I find that grossly offensive. I think you will find, if you look in the media—if you go on any social media site—that your reputation has been greatly tarnished by that issue alone.


What is the impact on Tasmanian schools as a whole? How many children are going to be impacted by these savage cuts? Can you explain to the Senate what this government's modelling is based on, so that I can go back to my constituents and try to explain to them. How many classrooms are going to lose valuable resources? Can you tell me, if we break it down into Catholic schools in Tasmania, what the actual cut to the Catholic schools will be, because I want to know whether or not their figures match up with yours. 


We know that you have not even been able to provide accurate data to your own caucus, and that you are telling some members of your caucus one thing and something quite different to others. Who knows what you have been telling the crossbenchers in trying to get their support for your grubby deal! How do Tasmanian schools fair in comparison with the King's School in Sydney? The King's School is a private school, which from the figures we have seen is going to have their funding increased dramatically. I want you to be able to explain to me why Tasmanian children are going to have to pay the price so that you can look after your friends in the top end of town. 


I also want to look at some specific schools that I have visited. I know about the great work that they are doing at some of the most disadvantaged schools in our community. Can you please tell me what the impact on the Youngtown Primary School will be. That school does wonderful things. I am not sure if Senator Bushby, who is here, has even bothered to visit any schools in Launceston. I know he is supposedly moving his office to Launceston, but we have not heard him make any contribution at all in this debate. So I want you to explain to me, so that Senator Bushby can understand, what the impact is going to be on the Youngtown Primary School.


Mayfield Primary School has been recognised nationally over the years for the wonderful work that they have done in an area of great disadvantage. Their teachers have been acknowledged at a national level. They believe this change is going to have a huge impact on their ability to look after their community. Can you explain to me how much extra money they are going to get? Then there is Port Dalrymple School down in George Town. Can you explain to me if their funding is going to increase, and, if so, by how much, or why those children, who are from families who need all the support they can get to ensure their children have a good education, are going to be disadvantaged and their teachers lose money and resources?


The Friends' School in Hobart—that's right, it is one of your favourite ones; it is a private school—are going to significantly increase their money. Can you please explain to me and justify why The Friends' School will get more money? I do not have a problem with private schools at all; it should be about choice. Many families do make a choice to invest in their children's education. It is just very unfortunate that this government sees education as a cost rather than an investment. Minister, can you explain to the chamber why The Friends' School in Hobart, a well-funded private school that provides a good education, gets an increase when Norwood Primary School, Sacred Heart Primary School, West Launceston Primary School, Mayfield Primary School, Youngtown Primary School and East Launceston Primary School are going to lose out in this education bill?


I was wondering too if you can tell me what the impact will be on the Launceston Preparatory School, a small private school in Launceston that does an absolutely wonderful job for its students. Can you explain it to me and give us the figures? After all, Minister, you are the one who was saying that we in the opposition have not been able to add up. I think you said 'we should all go back to school' or something; I do not want to verbal you, but you made some trite comment. I would be most interested in the figures. I just do not get it. You have met with various sections within the education sector and they have asked you to go back to the drawing board and ensure that there is real fairness in this bill. We on this side have urged you to withdraw and redraft the bill so that it can get support. But you have failed to do that. You are hell-bent on moving forward—and who knows what dirty deals you have done. Perhaps you can now let us know.


I have not had the opportunity to see the amendments that are being proposed, but I am really interested. I know that my constituency of Tasmania wants to know—whether it is the public schools, the Anglican schools or the Catholic schools—what is fair in this bill that is going to ensure that Tasmanian schools are not going to be worse off. We know Tasmania has the second-lowest amount of funding in the country. At the same time, Senator Bushby, Senator Duniam and the President, Senator Parry, are not saying anything about the impact of this bill and the cuts to Tasmania. The only senator on the government side who has raised concerns is Senator Abetz. Unfortunately, for personal reasons, he cannot be here this week. But he has spoken up. Not one of the others has spoken up. Is this punishment for the Tasmanian community because they voted the incompetent Liberal House of Representatives members for Bass, Lyons and Braddon out of parliament? Is this another attempt by Mr Turnbull and this government to punish Tasmania? That is what it seems like to me. And it is not just me who thinks that way. The Tasmanian community are fed up with this government. Ever since 2 July, when they got rid of those three amigos out of Tasmania—mind you, they have all landed plum jobs provided by this government—they have known; and this piece of legislation is just another move by this government to show how arrogant you are, how out of touch you are and that you just do not understand the word 'fairness'.


Minister, I am looking forward to your explanation so that I can go to my community and try and explain to them the dirty deals you have done. Perhaps you could enlighten us—I think you have the obligation to do that in this place—of the deals you have done and put in place with people like the Pauline Hanson party. We would like to know what it is that you have promised them. Have you got something in writing for them? Is Senator Back going to ride off into retirement and be happy? Have you actually done a deal for the Catholic Education Commission in this country? We want to know, and we have a right to know. From what I have been hearing around this building over the last couple of days, there are all sorts of rumours going around. What have you done to make sure that people like Mr Abbott do not undermine the Prime Minister yet again in the media. If I were him, I would use this, because he knows, like I know, that the parents of Australian kids, whether those kids are in a state school, a private school or a Catholic school, are not going to forget the way they have been treated. You have taken them for granted.


What is it when the Catholic Education Commission meets with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education and Training? What a badge of honour that would be: to say that you are the worst minister for education in five decades and a Prime Minister who has failed to consult with his minister, the one charged with this responsibility. This is a huge investment from any government into education and the government has failed to consult and talk to those people who deliver more than just education in their communities. As I have said before in this place, Catholic parishes set up schools where they are needed to provide not only education but also support for the entire family. This government is so arrogant—and who knows what else is going on in the civil war in the dysfunctional government that this is. 


Minister, I will draw you back to the schools that I would like some answers about tonight—that is, the Tasmanian schools and the overall lack of funding that is in this bill for them. They are not going to be any better off. Some of that money will never reach the schools which you have alluded to over the course of this week. I would like you tell us what the impact is going to be on Tasmanian schools, broken down into public schools, Catholic, schools, Anglican schools and those private schools I have mentioned. I, along with many people who will be listening to this broadcast, will be very interested to see how you try and justify the sort of dirty deal that you have obviously done during the course of the last 48 hours.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (20:02):  I am happy to inform the senator that, in relation to the Tasmanian school systems, funding for the government system in Tasmania is estimated to be $183 million in 2017. That will steadily grow under the proposal put forward by the government each and every year to $261 million by 2027. That, of course, is funding that would be used to fund a number of the schools that you referenced in your remarks.


In relation to the Catholic education system in Tasmania, their forecast funding in 2017 is $149 million. That is estimated to grow to $226 million by 2027. In relation to independent schools or independent school systems within Tasmania, under the government's proposal they are forecast to receive $76 million in 2017 and that is forecast and estimated to steadily grow to $107 million by 2027. All of them by 2027, under the legislation for the bill before the parliament, would have their share of funding calculated according to the same consistent needs based formula as any other either government school system in the country or non-government school authority in the country. It will be applied in an entirely consistent manner. 


If we are not going to proceed in an orderly way, as is the normal custom of the committee, and instead we are going to be subjected to stalling tactics and filibustering speeches, then I shall—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  No, he's not going to answer your questions.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I did just answer the questions. I move:


That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:


(2) Schedule 1, item 16, page 7 (line 26), omit paragraph 35B(4)(c), substitute:


(c) for the purposes of the operation of paragraphs (a) and (b) in relation to 2017:


   (i) the Commonwealth share for each school were 100%; and


   (ii) the SRS funding amount for a primary student were $10,576; and


   (iii) the SRS funding amount for a secondary student were $13,290; and


   (iv) the SES score for each school were the score for the school for 2018; and


   (v) the maximum size loading for a primary school were $166,790; and


   (vi) the maximum size loading for a secondary school were $266,864; and


   (vii) the starting amount for a primary school were $11,119; and


   (viii) the starting amount for a secondary school were $22,239.




Statement of reasons: why certain amendments should be moved as requests



Section 53 of the Constitution is as follows:




Powers of the Houses in respect of legislation



53. Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law.


The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.


The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.


The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications.


Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.




GX160, amendment (8)



The effect of this amendment is to change the basis for calculating funding for certain schools under the Australian Education Act 2013. It is covered by section 53 because this will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 126 of the Act.




Consequential amendments



The following amendments on GX160 are consequential on the amendment mentioned above: (1) to (7), (9) to (15).




GX167, amendment (2)



The effect of this amendment is to change the basis for calculating funding for certain schools under the Australian Education Act 2013. It is covered by section 53 because this will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 126 of the Act.




Consequential amendments



There are no amendments on GX167 that are consequential on the amendment mentioned above.




Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017



SHEET GX167


Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000




Amendment (2)



This amendment will change the basis for calculating funding for certain schools under the Australian Education Act 2013, having the effect of increasing expenditure under the Act. This will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 126 of the Act.


The Senate has long followed the practice that an amendment which ""clearly, necessarily and directly"" increases expenditure under an appropriation is regarded as an increase in a charge or burden on the people within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution (Odgers' Australian Senate Practice, 14th edition, p. 412). On the basis that this amendment would result in increased expenditure under the standing appropriation in the Act, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that this amendment be moved as a request.


This is a technical request that ensures that there is no ambiguity in relation to the calculation of the starting Commonwealth share for schools and that the amounts of funding, both in base terms and in loading terms, accurately and clear reflect the notional application of the needs based funding model in 2018 and in 2017 dollar terms to provide for accurate funding.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (20:05):  I would draw the minister back to the question. If you are talking about a collective of the funding going to Tasmania, I clearly asked you to explain to the Senate, so I can explain to my constituents, why they are getting cuts. They are not getting the resources that they want, as opposed to somewhere like Kings College. Why is there more money going to the Friends' School in Hobart than what there is for the schools that are highly in need of these resources? In fact, they need additional money in places like Mayfield, Youngtown and Norwood Primary School. Why can't you provide those figures for us here tonight? If you are really serious about wanting to have support, you should be able to come in here and justify the allocation of funds that are being taken away from Tasmanian kids to give to the top end of town.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (20:06):  Chair, I just provided very clearly for the senator the growth rates in estimated funding for each of the different systems in Tasmania, demonstrating, that contrary to her claims, there are no cuts. There is in fact growth across each of those different parts of the school system in Tasmania. Of course, the senator knows full well that the history in relation to school funding in Australia is that public schools are largely funded by the state government, as is their constitutional responsibility and history; and that non-government schools have historically be largely funded by the Commonwealth government. 


A result of the proposals that the Turnbull government is putting in place is that public education, government schools in the state system, will receive a record level of support from the Commonwealth government. We will ensure that 20 per cent of the schooling costs across all of those different systems will be funded by the Commonwealth government. That is an increase from the current estimate of around 17 per cent. You do not have to go back too many years to get down to 13 per cent—in fact just around the time that this government was elected—and not too many years prior to that you will find that it was in single digit territory. So there will be record levels of support for government schools in Tasmania, as there will be record levels of support for government schools across every jurisdiction. It will be calculated according to the same consistent needs based formula across all of those different jurisdictions, ensuring that, regardless of state boundaries, we do not play favourites to one state over another and that we actually have an application of a fair, consistent funding model.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (20:08):  Minister, there are a number of questions that have already been raised by my colleagues on this side of the chamber with regard to the special deals that you said you were not going to make that you are going to make, and the deals that you said were not happening that are happening. We still do not have any clear answer from you in response to the first set of questions that were asked by Senator Collins. They went to the heart of matters of great concern in the community, which is to do with the system weighted average. Minister, I am sure that you have had significant lobbying from genuinely concerned parents across the country in every single sector. In fact, one thing I would count as an achievement is that you have managed to upset everybody in the government school system, everybody in the Catholic school system and a whole lot of people in the independent school system as well. One of the things that you have failed to answer is anything of detail that will give people any confidence at all that you might be telling them something approaching the truth.


The questions that Senator Collins asked earlier I will reiterate in perhaps a less eloquent way. I have to emphasise the importance of the need for you to answer these questions in this general debate before we can possibly move to a more detailed discussion of the very important papers that have landed here in the Senate this evening but have not landed until the twelfth hour, so much is your disdain for making yourself available for the proper scrutiny of this Senate. I think you are even more concerned about getting out of here with this bill under your belt, because you do not want the scrutiny of the community at all, particularly those who are educated.


Minister, I draw your attention to Senator Collin's questions for very clear explanations about the nature of the so-called moratorium that is some part of a stitched up deal that I do not think is anywhere in writing because nobody has been to be able provide it. There have been plenty of requests being sent around the country—all over the place: what is going on? What is the moratorium? What does it look like? People are asking these questions around the country this afternoon and tonight, and this is our chance to get a decent answer from you. Minister, if you have a bit of information on a bit of paper, that would be lovely. We are happy to receive pieces of paper at the last minute, clearly, or we would not be dealing with this process in this way. Just give us the bit of paper that explains your supposed deal that is the moratorium. What we want to know is, in this moratorium, what are you actually doing with the system weighted average that is going to impact on every single school in a system? What is the status of your response to the concerns about the capacity to contribute? When and in what way are you going to implement this moratorium around those two critical factors? Does the moratorium remove the capacity to contribute the dilemma that absolutely exists? It has been very well articulated by the Catholic system. 


We could have avoided getting to this place, if, before you had made your big announcement with the fanfare on that Monday, you had actually taken phone calls from peak representative groups that wanted to discuss these details with you. They approached in good faith. I do not know what would make them think that that was a reasonable thing to do, but they did approach you in good faith, seeking the opportunity to share their deep, rich and long understanding of their system, to share their deep commitment to the education of children in systems. They wanted to have you understand that, and they were ready to talk to you. But you completely ignored that, Minister. Now there is this hasty retreat of some sort that is as yet unknown to us and that is being attempted to be stitched up perhaps as we speak. 


I am going to give Senator Back some congratulations on his efforts to stand up for the Catholic system. Because I did not make a contribution during the valedictory speeches yesterday, I want to acknowledge now that the time I spent on the education committee in the last parliament with Senator Back was a time when I absolutely could understand his commitment to education. He was in defence mode for the Abbott government, which said that there should be absolutely no money going to schools. So he had a difficult job to do. But when we went to Western Australia and to Perth for a day of hearings, I could tell the integrity that he had in his dealings with people in that state. People who came to put their concerns about that version of the legislation said that Senator Back had served particularly Catholic education in Western Australia very, very well and that he had a deep and rich understanding of that sector. So my hopes and the hopes of 25 per cent of the children who attend schools around this country in the Catholic education system—25 per cent in the nation—all hang on whether or not Senator Back has in his departure from the Senate been able to save the country from the worst excesses of a deal that has been described as the worst in 50 years. 


So what has Senator Back actually got out of this greedy government—this government that acts with such disdain—for the expertise of education authorities around this country? What did he get out in terms of the funds and the impact on the SRS? What has actually been achieved with regard to that? 


I am delighted that I get to ask one particular question, and I genuinely hope for an answer. Instead of accepting Gonski's recommendations that the sectarian wars that have led to so much inequity across our schools should end, that both state and federal governments should in partnership take responsibility for the excellent education of all students in all systems, instead of looking towards that vision of a fair sharing of resources between state and federal governments to make sure all Australians get their opportunity to learn, this government has gone in a direction that takes us away from unity, it has gone in a direction that takes us away from shared responsibility and it has taken us away from a focus on ensuring equal opportunity for children who are born into different states and into families who are choosing different systems. So why, Minister, instead of accepting that shared responsibility, which was so much a part of the report delivered by David Gonski, have you moved to an arbitrary decision to give SRS support of 80 per cent to Catholic and independent schools and only 20 per cent to children in government schools? 


One thing that I absolutely know and I think is completely indisputable is that children do not choose their parents. They arrive, and they do not have any choice about where their parents are going to send them to school. I do not think it is unreasonable to believe that every child born in Australia today should be able in six years time to walk through the gate of any school in the country, whether it is Catholic, independent or government, or city regional, rural or remote—anywhere in the country. We have had the opportunity to deliver funding that would have allowed equitable experience of education, but instead, Minister, you have chosen this 80-20 model. 


Where is the research? Where is the background documentation that says that that is the way to go forward? It is certainly nowhere in the recommendations of the Gonski panel. We can call it Gonski 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 or 5.0, and with greater numeracy education I suppose we can go on to infinity; we can call it whatever number we like—but it is not truthful, it is not fair and it is not responsible for delivering equitable education access for every Australian. For people who are listening to this debate and going. 'Oh, my God, it is just so confusing', it is confusing, as Senator Collins says—it is very confusing. It is actually so confusing that I think Stephen Elder, from the Catholic Education Commission in Victoria, has had members of the coalition ring him up asking him to explain to them what is going on. 


This government have made an absolute mishmash of this. Gonski 2.0 is not what they are trying to make it out to be. It is a tool for delivering sector-entrenching discriminatory education experiences for Australian children. I am a senator for New South Wales and I am very concerned about my state—and I will have some questions about that—but Minister tell me I am wrong, prove to me I am wrong, when I say that students in the Northern Territory in government schools who are already behind are going to stay behind. They going to stay behind because you are not addressing the reality that that government school system needs an awful lot more than the 20 per cent of the SRS that you are going to offer to give those children a chance. Minister, explain to me and all the teachers of this country, explain to me and all the parents of children in this country, how it is fair to give the same proportion to states and overlook the fact that there are incredibly differentiating needs amongst those children in the states.


Australians who elected those opposite in 2013 were sold a message that there would be a funding match dollar for dollar. They were misled then. And the lie that was on those blue-and-white-striped posters that everybody saw as they walked in was so disingenuous that it did not even have a little asterisk at the bottom that said, 'But we won't be giving you years 5 and 6.' It did not even say that. So at this juncture, four years down the track, why should the Australian people trust you now, when you failed so badly then? Why should senators on this side, who absolutely believe in equitable access to funding for all children in all systems, believe that the legislation that you are pushing through this house with unseemly haste is actually going to address any of those inequities that were in fact the driver of the research that was undertaken by Mr David Gonski and his team? 


Prove it to me, Minister. Show me the figures. Help me understand. Answer the questions. Where did 80-20 come from? What is the deal that you have done—hopefully, well negotiated by Senator Back but still unseen by anybody in the sector that I have been in touch with? Show us the paper. Show us the money! Show the 25 per cent of Australian students in Catholic schools that they are not going to get done over in the next 12 months by this little deal that you have stitched up in the last day.


The reason we ended up with the report that we got from Mr Gonski, and the recommendation that he and his team put together—which was fair funding for every child in every single school, with additional loadings on top of that SRS evening out for disability, for indigeneity, for small and country schools, for low SES and non-English-speaking backgrounds—is that their experience of seeing Australian schools across this country was eye opening. I remember reading reports saying they could not believe that they had gone to schools where the resourcing was so totally inadequate that they were surprised that any learning at all could happen. 


At the heart of all of this, it is not a game of politics. It is about the capacity to create an environment in which the young people of our country, whom I consider to be our greatest asset, can learn—where teachers do not have to ask the P&F to fundraise to be able to buy $10,000 worth of school readers so that children in kindergarten and first class can have a book that is not dog-eared and falling apart, and actually learn to read. That is the kind of resourcing that I want for schools. I do not want primary school teachers to have to choose two, out of six kids who need Reading Recovery, because that is all they can afford, damning the other four to lost opportunities for learning. 


Explain to me, Minister, what you are doing and how it is going to work, because, frankly, I do not have any confidence in the numbers that you speak about, and neither the Catholic sector nor the government sector has any. Indeed, no-one who has interacted with you in this process actually believes you. Prove to it me, Minister. I would love to have some answers to my questions.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (20:23):  Senator O'Neill asked a few questions in relation to funding for the Northern Territory, which I did address during question time today. Very quickly, funding for the Northern Territory government school system is projected to grow from $191 million this year to $261 million by 2027. The senator asked a range of questions about the particularly high need in the Northern Territory, a fact which I acknowledged in question time today and a fact which is of course borne out by the fact that per-student funding in the Northern Territory is today the highest in the nation, at around $8,360, on average, per student. That will grow to around $11,870 per student by 2027. That is far and away the highest per-student funding in the country. In fact, it will be around 55 per cent more per student by 2027 than it will be in any other jurisdiction, reflective of their particular need.


The senator also asked about the original Gonski report and the views of the original Gonski panel on this legislation. I would draw the attention of the senator to the words of a number of individuals. Mr David Gonski said:


I'm very pleased to hear that the Turnbull government has accepted the fundamental recommendations of our 2011 report, and particularly regarding a needs based situation … I'm very pleased that there is substantial additional money, even over indexation and in the foreseeable future.


Fellow panel member Dr Ken Boston describes the legislation as 'a new deal of historic national importance' and says:


There are no grounds for opposition to the schools funding bill in principle … It will be a tragedy if the school funding bill is voted down in the Senate.


I would also highlight the comments of Ms Kathryn Greiner, another member of the Gonski panel, who says of the legislation and the policy:


I think they're on the moral ground. I think the decisions were right, I think the decisions are just.


She also says:


Gonski 2.0 delivers what the Gonski report wanted: an accountable, transparent, equitable, sector-blind funding formula.


Concerning responsibility for government school systems, I would highlight, Senator O'Neill, my response earlier to your colleague from Tasmania, where I identified that the Commonwealth share of funding to government school systems will indeed grow to a record level under these reforms, more than twice what it was not that many years ago.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (20:26):  I cannot let the minister's verballing continue in the way it has. I remind senators and others listening to this debate that the Gonski review panel involved two other members, and the minister has made no reference to their concerns with respect to this legislation. But the verballing of Mr David Gonski continues. Rather than stress the ways in which this minister has done that, I will segue into a press release from this evening, on which I will make another point in a moment. If we take it from the Nick Xenophon Team:


This is the REAL Gonski and we have three members of the original Gonski panel, including David Gonski himself, saying unambiguously it would be a disaster for Australian education if this package didn't pass.


David Gonski has never said that. David Gonski has said, with relief, that this government has accepted a principle of needs based funding, but Mr David Gonski has never endorsed the 80-20 approach or the Commonwealth-only approach to needs based funding, and to suggest otherwise is a blatant lie.


There are two other matters that I would like to deal with in this general discussion. The first of those, which I have raised I think now twice today, is the Senate's order for production of documents. The minister said to me after question time that he had submitted a letter in response to that order. Unfortunately, because the government has changed the arrangement for hours today, the tabling of that letter did not occur. Worse than that, the normal courtesy that would apply in a matter such as this—that the minister would furnish a copy of that material or correspondence to the senator who had originated that request—has not occurred. For this minister to come in here and claim that the opposition is being obstinate is just outrageous. He has not even followed basic courtesies of the Senate in relation to an order of the Senate for production of documents. This is not just the opposition; the whole Senate insisted that this minister provide that material by the end of yesterday, and he has not done so.


I can only second-guess at this stage what that letter might say. It might say, as some other colleagues have suggested to me, that there are no such documents. If that is the case, that raises very serious questions about the quality of the discussions that have occurred with the crossbenchers here. If the crossbenchers have not even seen modelling about moving forward from a ten-year transition and what that might really mean, that highlights what a farce has been occurring.


The other option, of course, is for the minister to argue that it is not in the public interest for that information to be made available. Maybe he has done that. We do not know that yet. We do not know what his answer to the Senate order has been, and, until such time as we do, it is not being obstinate to suggest that the minister should be answering reasonable questions and providing information to the Senate before we proceed into a detailed consideration of the amendments that we are indeed still digesting.


Beyond the order for production, though, I have to reflect again on this press release and its sheer audacity. It seems that by press release from the Nick Xenophon Team we can understand more about this package than the minister is telling us here and now. So let me inform the Senate what the Nick Xenophon Team tells us is 'the real Gonski win for Aussie schools'. Remember: they are anticipating a vote that has not even occurred yet. According to the Nick Xenophon Team, 'the real Gonski win for Aussie schools' is that the Nick Xenophon Team successfully advocated for:


Australian schools to receive $23.5 billion over the next 10 years ($4.9 billion above the Government's original plan)


So where is the modelling about what that will actually do? I hope the Nick Xenophon Team has actually seen it, because I would like to understand what that additional funding is going to do and what the impact of it will be. If the impact of it will be that schools like Kings get even more then we have got big problems. But let's wait and see. This debate might shed some further light on some of these issues.


The second dot point in this press release is:


Under-funded schools to reach funding targets in six years instead of 10.


Is that all of them? Is that some of them? What are the differences across states? Which ones? Hopefully, maybe, the Nick Xenophon Team can come in and tell us some of this, because the minister is not answering these questions.


The next dot point is:


National Schools Resourcing Board to be set up to review and improve the school funding methodology.


Hear, hear to that. I think that the Senate is united on that one, and the reason that the Senate is united on that one once we see the detail of what is being proposed here—hopefully, I can digest the detail in the government's amendments soon—is that we will know if it will save us from the school funding estimator debacle. We will not have a department politicised by you putting out material that is blatantly false. If we have an independent school resources board that can be responsible for the quality of the data that is circulated as it is on My School, for instance, and there is some independence in that process, given the way this minister has conducted himself, that will be a good thing. I have never seen as outrageous an exercise as the minister pretending to Australian parents that there will not be pressure on their school fees, because he has diddled his figures. He has diddled the figures for 2017. He has adjusted them to pretend that his new formula applies when it will never apply to 2017 to fool parents into believing that they get increases between 2017 and 2018 and to cover up the pressure for parents to pay school fees that he is introducing in this bill and as far as I can see still remain in this bill. Worse than that: he then went out and said Catholic education were basically rent-seekers, that they had a special case and they were only squawking because they were potentially going to lose their special deal. That is what this minister did, and he is still doing it if those capacity-to-contribute arrangements still exist in this bill.


But let's move on to the next point the Nick Xenophon Team tells us about:


There will be benchmarks for state and territory governments so that they pay their share of education funding.


Benchmarks for state government. Senator Back, in your valedictory speech you made a particular comment that I noted. I cannot remember the exact phrase but it was basically that a carrot is better than a stick. Gonski 1 involved a carrot for state governments. The carrot for state governments was that they would get an additional two Commonwealth dollars for each additional one state dollar to get all schools to a common Student Resource Standard. Now, this potential stick method will be debated for an awful long time in here because we are a long way from being satisfied that you have any reasonable capacity to deliver benchmarks for state and territory governments, so that they pay their share of education funding. You have already deferred these issues to COAG mid next year, so how you might have managed to hoodwink some relatively new members and senators into thinking you have got a better capacity will be very interesting to hear.


We already have the Nick Xenophon Team anticipating the vote and claiming they have a real Gonski win for Aussie schools. In reading this press release we can see that they are simply swallowing your verballing of a number of people in this debate. The verballing of David Gonski himself, I think, is the most outrageous. Now that that disease has spread from yourselves to the Nick Xenophon Team, it really does need to be called out.


I could go on through the two pages of this win that the Nick Xenophon Team is anticipating, but let me go to the more critical issue here, because there is one dot point they do not have, which is in an article written by Paul Osborne in The Australian this afternoon—I think it is online. It refers to a $50 million transition fund. Does that mean that we have four transition funds now. During the inquiry into the legislation we were told that there were three transition funds, but now, at least in the press but not in the Nick Xenophon Team win, we hear about this $50 million transition fund and it is described as being 'for Catholic and independent schools over 12 months'. So, is there a new $50 million transition fund? If so, where is it provided for? Is it in the amendments or is it provided for in some other way that we need to source? If there is such a fund, what are the terms of access to that fund? What is this $50 million meant to cover? Is it the 'partial-monty moratorium'; it is certainly not the 'full-monty moratorium'.


We have already read in the press today that Catholic Education, for instance, and probably the independent sector as well, have no confidence in this minister. So why would they have confidence about this $50 million transition fund, if it indeed exists? We should not really be having to ask these questions. The minister should have presented the full details of what is involved here. But if there is this fund, what are the terms for access to it?


I would like to use the opportunity of this committee-stage consideration to be very clear about this. We know from the legislation inquiry that there is already contention about independent schools and Catholic schools accessing the Students First Fund. We understand that, originally, the minister naively committed to independent schools that that would continue as it has been. Subsequently he told them, 'No, actually. We are going to go to a proportional break-up for access to that fund, because we are taking the system weighted average benefits away from systemic schools. So, no, you will not have the preferred arrangement that might previously have existed.' The independent sector, before the legislation inquiry, argued a very different story. They said that that fund was meant to help them deal with the fact that they do not have the benefits of operating as a system and that they should be able to preserve their existing arrangements for accessing it, which is roughly, I think, 60-40. Which is it, Minister?


This really is a moving feast. It is a dog's breakfast. We will wait to hear from you whether there is a $50 million transition fund. Is access to that fund going to be proportionate? Is it really only with respect to systems, is there some broader purpose for it or have you just rebadged the existing transition funds? What is the detail of what transition funds are going to be available? Surely you understand, coming in here today, Minister, that you need to add to what was covered in the legislation inquiry about the existing transition funds—the general one, the one for the ACT and the one for the Northern Territory—and tell us what this other transition fund for Catholic or independent schools might be and what it is meant to cover. I can see that the minister is not even listening to this very important question, which is very sad because it means that he thinks he has a done deal. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (20:41):  I am very, very keen to contribute to this debate. Can I start out by saying that my interest is in the education of children across the nation. In 2011 I instigated, with the authority of the Senate, a select committee inquiry into teaching and learning in Australia. On that committee, of course, was Senator Marshall, Senator Penny Wright and Senator McKenzie. This was at the time Gonski was being examined, and it was not an inquiry into the high-level Gonski macro. It was an inquiry into: why aren't teachers teaching and why aren't children learning?


We did a lot of good work on the selection of people going into teacher training; the quality of teacher training programs; the amount of practicum that they had in there; whether they were classed as ready, because we learnt that more than 50 per cent of new teachers were not ready; what the levels of mentoring were; what the involvement of parents was from the youngest age; professional development, of course; and teachers who were being asked to teach out of their level of expertise et cetera. Discipline was an incredibly important position.


At the same time, we visited China. We met with them in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu. Of course, I am familiar with the situation in Singapore and Finland. In each of those three jurisdictions student discipline in classrooms is not an issue, because the children are disciplined and the teachers teach. What was very interesting at that time was that, whilst money was important, we had doubled the expenditure of funds in our education system, yet our standards had gone down. I said to them in Shanghai, 'Maybe it's the nature of the international comparator that is being used.' They said, 'It was developed in Melbourne, so, if you're not happy with it, go back and have a look at it yourselves.'


I put on the record that I have a vital interest in the education of all children in this country. Also, I will just comment on the government-funding sector. I have no difficulty with the amendments as I have seen them in the legislation, because under the Constitution the teaching of children in government schools is a state responsibility. If, indeed, the minister is going to move to a commonality over time whereby the federal government contributes 20 per cent and the states contribute 80 per cent—and I can see that in the amendments there are provisions to make sure, whether it be government schools support or private schools support, that the state and territory governments continue to commit at least to that level—then I applaud that.


I now want to go to discussions relating to the Catholic education system, about which I have most experience. Also, in my time in this place, I have been particularly interested in the independent schools system and their contribution. I was on the Catholic Education Commission for nine years in the mid-eighties to the mid-nineties. I was on a country school board when this so-called concept of co-responsibility was first mooted. Of course, being from the bush, I immediately thought, 'This is a grab by the rich city schools against the country schools.' I then went to see the then head of Catholic Education, Dr Peter Tannock, whose name will come up again in a few minutes, and Mr Mike Beacham. I jumped up and down and carried on such treat that they said to me, 'The only way to shut you up and to have you understand that co-responsibility is about the wealthier schools supporting the poorer schools is to put you on the commission, and then you yourself can be the overall auditor.' So I became the parent member of the commission. I have even had somebody in email traffic to me in the last couple of days saying that I have a conflict of interest and I have been corrupt. How a parent member of the commission, who is there at a totally voluntary capacity, can be corrupt, I do not know. What I did come to learn, of course, was that the co-responsibility concept and the funding became critical.


I then moved to the board of Santa Maria College, where both my wife and daughter had been at school. I was about to call them 'old girls' but, as Senator Moore knows very well, you would never call them old girls—you would call them past students. Why I had to go onto the Santa Maria board, and not Linda, I will never know. Anyhow, there were only three schools that did not come aboard initially. One was Aquinas College, a Christian Brothers college, where I had been at school. The other one was Santa Maria, where I was on the board, and the third was John XXIII, which had been the Jesuits' St Louis and Loreto. I guess I had a bit of influence in those colleges coming on board.


What has been very interesting over time has been the absolute strength—I can speak with a lot of authority about Western Australia—I cannot speak much, although I have engaged in this process, as others know, in terms of the Senate inquiry, and I made it my business to spend a lot of time recently with the South Australians to understand it. There are a couple of points that I want people who might be listening to this conversation this evening to understand. I understand that my colleague Senator Hinch the other day said that I ought to get on my bike and leave because the only funding that ever should come from governments is to government schools. I want to comment on that.


The first point I want to make is—and maybe the independents are included in this—the cost of educating a child in a Catholic school in Australia is 90 per cent of that of educating a child in a government school. Remember that—90 per cent. The second point is that the Catholic system enjoys, as a benefit from the Commonwealth, which is vitally important, about the cost of the teachers' salaries. That is about the contribution that the Commonwealth pays to Catholic schools. But it is the parents, through fees and the co-responsibility system, that actually meet the balance of those costs. The day-to-day costs of running the school—the water, the electricity, the maintenance and all those other costs—are met by parents' fees. The next point I want to make is that where a child in a government school walks into a new school, that has been totally funded by the taxpayers of Australia, of whom many are the parents of Catholic children—remembering that 30 per cent of children in Catholic schools are not Catholic. That government school has been fully funded by government, whether it is state or federal. By contrast, 95 per cent of the capital cost of building Catholic schools in this country is paid by the parents. So Senator Hinch, if that is what you did say, be very pleased that Catholic parents and independent parents are paying up, because for everyone who is in a Catholic or independent school that capital cost of building the school, that extra 10 per cent of the cost of running the school and educating the child has been met by that Catholic or independent parent on top of paying their taxes.


When you think about the passion of it, think that in some of those schools, like St Benedict's in Applecross, where my children went to school, it is only last year that the last of the classrooms that were built by the parents in the 1950s under the direction of the builder Cyril Wildy were knocked down and replaced. So when I talk about a bit of passion, I remember bottle drives as a kid in Bunbury, I remember planting the lawn on the oval at the Marist Brothers in Bunbury on Saturdays and Sundays on our hands and knees. We were not praying and we were not getting any indulgences from upstairs, but I can tell you that if we wanted an oval we planted that oval. 


I want to make the point that that is how critically important all of this is. Co-responsibility supports poorer schools. You have heard these allegations that it is just a grab by the rich schools against the poor schools. In my state, under the current system weighted average every child in a Catholic school has a grading of 103, and more than 50 per cent of the funding supporting kids below the 103 comes from the kids above the 103.


Just a couple of small things. Rent in Karratha went to $2,400 a week. When it came to the state school, the state government just paid for the extra rent in rent support. When it comes to the Catholic school, how do you keep the teachers in the schools in Karratha? The co-responsibility fund pays for it. At Roxby, in South Australia, they had to provide a home for the principal. It cost them a million bucks. Could they go back to government and say, 'Look, it has cost us a million'? In South Australia, when electricity and water costs went up in recent times, the state schools were supported, but the Catholic education system pays for the middle. In the north of WA, in the Kimberley; in the Northern Territory, as Senator McCarthy would know; and in North Queensland there are many small communities where the only school is the Catholic school. If you close it, there is not a school. And who has the challenge then?


In Australia, choice has always been an element. One of the fears that I have—and it has been put to me—is that the very essence of the Catholic school system in this country has been the education of poor children. Mary MacKillop started in Penola. The Mercys came to Fremantle in January 1846, having come out of Tipperary in Ireland to the stinking January heat. Within 20 days, they were not only opening a school for girls but the first ever school for Aboriginal girls in Australia. That is the quality of the Catholic education system and that has to be preserved.


The last point I want to make before I go to specific questions is about transparency. We in this place, as lawmakers, need to know that every last dollar of taxpayers' money has been accounted for and has been spent on the purpose for which, quite rightly, the taxpayers of Australia have given it. I just want to make the point very strongly that that is an element that must continue.


I now want to come to the concept of the system weighted average. As you all know, I have jumped up and down publicly about it and said please continue it for at least one year. I will tell you why. I will quote a letter from Dr Peter Tannock. He was head of Catholic Education originally and then he became Vice-Chancellor at Notre Dame. He is a very active member of Gonski. In a letter just the other day he said: 'The government should ameliorate the concerns of Catholic systems and should reinstate the longstanding mechanism for Commonwealth funding of Catholic and other non-government systems—for example, Lutherans—and it should be based on the enrolment weighted average of all schools.' He refers to a recommendation at page 171 of the original Gonski report. He goes on to say: 'This funding mechanism was strongly and unanimously endorsed by Gonski'—and that should make it very acceptable. I understand that Professor Farish was asked to examine and create what was supposedly to be the new SES model—and even Farish has said it is not working. The Grattan Institute, as has been said earlier this evening, has also come out and said the same thing. That is the reason why I have pushed very hard for there to be a pause, for there to be a continuation of the system weighted average for a 12-month period, including an examination of the funding for students with disabilities—because that is a real area of concern right across the board, as the minister well knows. And, during that time, maybe it might be led by Professor Farish.


I can imagine a situation where that review is chaired by the person who was the original architect of the new SES model. It would have tax office people on board. It would have census and statistics people—a representation of the systems—so they can have a good long hard look based on capacity to pay. That might be through the tax file numbers of the parents in the schools. I am sure that, with modern technology, we can crossmatch those. The simple fact is that, if you do not earn $18,800 a year, you do not pay tax. So the possibility of examining it through tax returns might or might not work. We need something or other that can be examined. Minister, can you point to what you have in mind to allow the continuation of the system weighted average? What do you have in mind in terms of how that review will be undertaken? Can I have an undertaking from you that disability will be included in that particular process?


Naturally, at the conclusion of that review, since I will not be here, I want to be absolutely sure that my colleagues across the chamber will be able to know what it was that the review panel determined. If, indeed, it is one of your requirements that consensus be reached, well, send them all on a long drive to Darwin, because by the time they get there they will as sure as hell have consensus. I really do want to know what mechanism will be in place, whatever the determination the review panel make and whatever the recommendation they make to you as the minister, and how that will find its way into our processes. Of course, as has been quite rightly asked by Senator Collins: is there some indicative costing, additional costing, that you believe would be required to give effect to this so that there can be a level of satisfaction across systems, it is understood and we can go forward into 2018. 


We cannot leave it any longer, colleagues. There are those who say, 'Can we put this off until August or September?' However, those of us who have been on school boards know that by now you have normally done your budgets. You know what your enrolments are for next year. You know whether there are going to be more teachers or fewer teachers. You are trying to work out what the fee structures are going to be. June is late enough. For those of us who know the system, who know how school boards run, know that to delay the determination until August or September is far too late for 2018. Anybody associated with budgeting is screaming now. They are the questions I want answered. The minister knows that, if I can be satisfied, of course I can support it.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (20:56):  Senator Back, thank you for your contribution. I would just at the outset reflect on a couple of the broader comments that you made about the value of nongovernment education—the Catholic systemic schools, other school systems outside of the government systems, as well as standalone independent schools across Australia. I note particularly your comments that rightly acknowledge the hard work of parents and families who choose to invest in their child's education. You rightly acknowledge that such parents do make savings to other taxpayers in choosing to do so, particularly savings to states and territories in terms of costs that they would otherwise wear were those students to be in the equally high quality government school systems around the country. 


I also acknowledge that in those nongovernment schools, as in government schools, we see principals, teachers and the entire school community work hard in voluntary ways to raise additional funds to provide additional resources, as well as, of course, the resources that are provided in terms of the fees. I acknowledge the fact that many in the Catholic education system and in the other school systems work in ways to try to provide access to their schools for people who may not be able to pay all of the fees or indeed any of the fees in some instances and that they do so in a sense in a spirit of charity and access. In a handful of locations around the country, they do so where there may not even be a government school option readily available to those students. It is that choice and that right of people to choose an education, including a faith based education, for their children that is at the heart of Commonwealth funding of education historically. It is that choice that we seek to ensure continues into the future under the type of school funding models that are available. 


An important element of that over time has been especially the work undertaken in the Howard era, building on years of increased involvement of the Commonwealth government in school funding, particularly nongovernment school funding, to ensure that there was some methodology that allowed for governments of the day to provide greater support to nongovernment schools in communities of lower economic means or capabilities in their capacity to contribute to those school fees. This was essentially ensure there were some means that empowered school choice around Australia for those who may not be able to afford significant fees in their schools. I note that well before that there were many schools who, thanks to charitable contributions, church contributions, parish contributions and other ways, were already making such offerings available at little or no fee, regardless of government funding. But, as time has gone by, government funding has become more and more important, and it is important that the funding model we have does ensure that the greatest level of support goes to those school communities and to families in those school communities who are otherwise the least able to access that choice, relative to those who might be better off.


Senator Back, I want to thank you for that contribution and for your consistent advocacy in terms of school choice. Indeed, as this is your second-last sitting day—it would certainly be, technically, your second last sitting day, even if we are here beyond Thursday!—I acknowledge that that is not just a contribution you have made in the Senate but, as you rightly acknowledged, it is a contribution you have made in other ways through voluntary undertakings, like so many parents and community workers do as volunteers on school boards and on school authorities in roles that help to make schools work.


Senator Back, in this debate you have engaged with me and you have done so advocating for your constituents and others with whom you are engaged who have concerns about some elements of the funding model, and you have made quite reasonable requests in doing so. As you identified in your contribution then, funding for the system weighted average that applies currently and that is proposed to be removed under the legislation before the chamber should continue next year while the review of the SES methodology, the socioeconomic status methodology, is undertaken.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Where is the amendment for the review, Senator?




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  No, the amendment to remove the system weighted average.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  We will come to it, Senator Collins. So I am pleased to confirm, Senator Back, that the government have made a determination that, using section 69A of the Australian Education Act, we would provide for additional funding equivalent to the system weighted average determination for all relevant school systems across Australia. I emphasise 'relevant' because it is important to highlight that this is not just a matter relevant to Catholic education systems; it also applies to a number of other, generally smaller education systems around Australia.


The fiscal impact of that for the first calendar year is estimated to be $46.5 million, of which some $38.2 million would be estimated to be paid to each of the eight state and territory Catholic Education Commissions across Australia, and some $8.3 million would be paid to the different non-government education systems that are not in the Catholic system, over the next 12 months.


Senator Back, that funding is applying the same system averaging methodology—in terms of the averaging-out of scores—as is currently the case. They are of course estimates. Should there be more student enrolments or other variations in that sense, then they would be adjusted accordingly. 


In addition to that commitment to provide that funding certainty, we are committing to a review of the SES methodology and we are committing to establishing a permanent vehicle by which such enhancements and improvements to the school funding model could take place. I refer the Senate to proposed amendment (7) on sheet GX167, which deals with establishing a National School Resourcing Board.


I emphasise that that board will require representation and membership from the states and territories, from the representative body for Catholic systemic schools and from the representative body for independent schools, ensuring that all relevant parties will be at the table in terms of the board's operation and work. It will be tasked with conducting reviews periodically, and the government intends that the very first review that it be tasked with is a review in relation to the SES measure and the parental-capacity-to-contribute settings for non-government schools. This will allow for independent analysis of the suitability of the current arrangements and ensure that the concerns raised by non-government schools, including Catholic education system authorities, about the SES measure are fully and properly examined. Our intention is that this review will take place and be completed before the middle of next year. In doing so, that will of course then provide recommendations that the government's intention will be to act upon, noting, of course, any particular budgetary circumstances that need to be addressed in that regard.


I highlight to the Senate—and hopefully we would have moved this amendment by now—that there are particular measures in terms of the structure of this that will ensure that there must be consultation around the terms of reference for such a review with all of the relevant stakeholders in terms of ensuring that the findings of such a review will be made public; tabled in this place; provided to relevant stakeholders, including, of course, the different representative bodies in the states and territories; and, once having undertaken the SES and capacity-to-contribute review, we would anticipate and commit that the next body of work that this review would look at would be in relation to student-with-disability loadings to ensure the appropriate application of those loadings.


Senator Back, thank you again for your constructive engagement and advocacy in this regard. It helps to ensure that as we work through these processes we get even better outcomes. As I have highlighted time and time again in this place, the funding proposals that the government has put forward do ensure growth in funding in a range of different ways, and I note that your advocacy in this matter has not been about the quantum of funding so much as the co-responsibility arrangements that you highlight across systems and the way in which they work. I commend you for the way in which you put those arguments forward and worked with us in this way.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (21:07):  I have said to Senator Back that I will explain how the concern is not so much what Simon says but what Simon does not say. You might recall—I am not really being glib here—that it was the state ministers who came out of their last ministerial council saying it was 'all Simon says'. In other words, the outcome of any Commonwealth-state partnership in this area has deteriorated so badly that he would front one ministerial council with just two case studies. That is the only prior consideration or airing of this sole Commonwealth funding approach, and the only other area we have been directed to as informing this shift has been the cabinet consideration. He could not even draw the Grattan Institute into an informed discussion about why we should move to 80-20. There has been no informed discussion about moving to 80-20. As I said, that is the issue about public schools that I have been accused of not being concerned about, so let's leave that on the table.


Senator Back, on the issues that you are concerned about: it is what Simon does not say, which highlights—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senator, there has been quite a bit of latitude, but you will refer to the minister in the appropriate fashion.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Certainly I will. Thank you. It is what the minister does not say that is the issue here. Senator Back, I refer you to page 11 of the bill. Page 11 of the bill sets out the changes to the capacity-to-contribute arrangements under the SES. This is the area that the government amendments do not address. This is the area where the minister is deliberately refusing to pause, and the reason that the minister is deliberately refusing to pause—and we have heard different arguments about that, and I am sure we will get to the detail of those, because he convinced with very weak arguments all sorts of people that the justification for the existing capacity-to-contribute arrangement was tenuous. But it is connected to the SES arrangements and for him to suggest that he is pausing the arrangements under this model for systemic schools, and then not address these provisions in the bill, is simply disingenuous. Let me explain the reason, Senator Back: it is because the two factors work together.


I recall the decisions that were made under the Gillard government around how to follow the Gonski recommendations, and I want to take the Senate very carefully through that. I have done this a couple of times, but hopefully now that we are very focused on the issue I can do it again. I think you mentioned that Dr Tannock referred to page 177 of the Gonski review. I am now going to refer to a related part, which is on page 178. On that page the panel recommended that government should apply careful attention to the 'the shape of the anticipated private contribution' between two points in the model as to what level of contribution should be expected of parents. Under the Gillard government we did that. We modelled it. We looked at the sort of modelling that the minister is refusing to provide at the moment under our order for the production of documents. Under that modelling, at the time we were convinced—and we have had more recent data now from the ABS that highlights this point—that parents who have children at primary school level have a different capacity to contribute than, in general terms, parents who have children at secondary school level. The more recent ABS data reinforces that point. It is well-known that families with younger children are more likely to have one full-time income earner and then maybe only a part-time income earner, or not a second income earner, within their households. That is reflected in the ABS family income figures provided to me by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That is why we, under the Gillard government, framed the curve as it currently is in the act for primary school students.


We are also mindful of the fact that the highest proportion of students in non-government schools are in local parish Catholic primary schools. Unlike the independent sector, there is usually a smaller proportion of students at primary level and a much higher proportion of students at secondary level, and they can balance out that distribution more effectively. In Catholic schools they are commonly local parish Catholic primary schools—the ones you would be familiar with. Their argument was that not only does the SES model not measure very well the nature of our student population and their families but also their capacity to contribute is different when you have primary school aged students as opposed to secondary school aged students.


On that basis and on the basis of advice we received at the time, we structured the curve in a way that reflected that and took on board the Gonski review recommendation that we needed to do this in a fashion that would not compromise the delivery of the different types of non-government schools. One of those different types of non-government schools is the low-fee systemic Catholic primary school. I do not focus just on Catholics here, because that is why the Anglicans are in systems and the Lutherans are in systems. They run some very similar low-fee accessible schools. What the minister has yet to circulate—I would like to be wrong here but I have not yet been able to find this—is an amendment that withdraws the changes that I directed you to in the current bill, or at least provides a 12-month moratorium on those provisions. If they do not do that they are not providing the full-monty moratorium. Let me highlight why that is definitely the case, now that the minister has provided us with the anticipated figures. Because, Senator Back, the anticipated figures he has provided for this next financial year are nowhere near the anticipated figures we addressed in government. It is five-odd years since 2013, but my recollection is that the system weighted average factor at that point in time was worth roughly $60 million. So there is only one way the minister could be presenting the figure that he gave us today—the $46.5 million figure—and that is if he has done it on the basis of his changes to the parental capacity to contribute. That is the only way he could come up with that estimate. 


So there are two issues, Senator Back, that relate to assurances that you may have been given. The first of those is that it is not a full pause unless the government removes the changes to the capacity-to-contribute arrangements for non-government primary schools. If they do not remove the provisions that I have directed you to on page 11 of the bill—and we have amendments designed to do that—they are just simply not being genuine. It is a very difficult element to explain, but what people need to understand is the system weighted average factor works in partnership with the capacity-to-contribute measure. The two work together. So if the minister is only responding to one element of it, that is why you are getting figures that are well below the figures we addressed when we were in government. 


But what is more concerning is that the minister is being disingenuous in how he is addressing this. These are issues that have been taken to the minister time and time again, so for him to be here now deliberately skimming over that factor is disrespectful. It is disrespectful to you. I am more than happy for him to be disrespectful to me, and almost everybody in this debate has been. I have pretty thick skin; it does not bother me in the slightest. But, Senator Back, for you, for the minister to not cover that issue is disrespectful.


A genuine pause would involve at least a pause on the operation of the provisions on page 11 of the bill. Find me the amendment that the government is moving that does that—prove me wrong, please, but I cannot find it, and my advisers have not been able to find it in the limited time that we have had—or the minister can make an assurance that he will put it in. But if he does not then I suggest to you, Senator Back, and to other senators who are concerned about these issues, to support our amendment that does, because any suggestion that there is a moratorium on these issues, without dealing with the unilateral changes to capacity to contribute that this minister has put into this bill, is not adequate.


The complexity of all of this is what has allowed this minister to maintain the charade. Had this minister had his way we would have trotted in here this evening and we would have started systematically moving through his amendments, and he might have conned the Senate as a whole as well. But fortunately our parliamentary processes ensure—and you, Senator Back, know full well why—he cannot just do that. I think, Senator Back, the question you should be asking the minister is: what is he going to do about these capacity-to-contribute changes that he has unilaterally introduced into the bill?


As I have said to you, I have seen submissions from independent schools, and they were the only ones that you could glean any policy rationale from in relation to these changes. When we challenged people like Christians Schools to please tell us, 'Where has this come from? Why has the curve been adjusted this way? Do you really understand the impact?' the answers we got were quite alarming. Catholic Education has been accused of scaremongering. The truth is Catholic Education is really probably the only organisation that has the organisational capacity to use the funding estimator tool and understand fairly easily and fairly quickly what the implications are. When they spoke to the Lutherans, they put in a submission to the legislation committee inquiry, and said, 'No, we don't like this—don't do this to us.' Then we had the Anglicans, and it was much the same. Indeed, you will note that Senator Birmingham has not responded to my question about the Anglican system that sought to be recognised as a system almost 12 months ago, that he failed to act upon. Will they, at least, get some access to this partial Monty? Or will they get nothing? That is the problem here.


So it is going to be a long night, because the assurances that Senator Birmingham might be giving you now will be challenged to time and time again. But unless he stalls his capacity to contribute changes, there is no more moratorium. The figures are as represented, for instance, in my local parish school. I was a bit reluctant to talk about it until I received a letter from one of my fellow parishioners. It is probably about the first time as a senator that I have ever been able to respond almost immediately and say, 'Actually, there are a few other people you should be lobbying rather than me.' Consider the impact on that school, unless this capacity to contribute payment or, as described in the Gonski review report, the anticipated private contribution, because that is what this minister is unilaterally changing—the anticipated private contribution. 


He has said wonderful things about Catholic Education here tonight, but reflect on what he has said at other times. Catholic Education was supposedly scaremongering, yet his colleagues, like Senator Bridget McKenzie—if you look at her press release from 2013, she was way more out there in terms of suggesting that there would be fee rises within Catholic schools. No—Catholic Education has looked at these changes to the anticipated private contribution—page 11 in the bill—and they have been able to tell us quite clearly what will be anticipated from parents in Catholic schools from 2018, with no transition. There is no six or 10 years working these changes through the system—this cliff happens in 2018. Unless this is removed from the bill, there is no moratorium.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:22):  Just quickly, because Senator Collins has raised it a couple of times, I have managed to get some information in relation to what I think is the Anglican school system that she has queried about. My understanding is that on 8 February the system contacted the department seeking to have consideration of it for system weighted average application. They were advised two days later that the first step for that to apply was that there had to be a collection of the addresses of each child in the system. The 2017 collection was to take place over the period up to 31 May—there has been an extension provided in relation to provision of such addresses—but that once such addresses were collected in the system it would be possible to calculate a system weighted average. Whilst the department is not aware of that system having been in contact with the department again, if it is their wish with the updated data that they be treated in the same way as any of the others that have been included or naturally captured in the commitments I have given to Senator Back tonight, I would be happy for that to occur.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (21:23):  There is just one problem with that answer, which is that there are provisions in the bill that remove the minister's discretion to treat a system that way. So unless his amendments deal with removing that discretion, there can be no new systems. This is why I raised this case. It may have not have been 12 months—as I said, I am quite prepared to accept that people who convey this information to us might not have their information completely accurate. But thank you—we now know, even though I have asked this question before, and we have not received comprehensive answers to the questions that were asked in the legislation inquiry. But I now know that there is an Anglican system—as I said, I cannot recall which state it was, so we still do not know that. There are a number of Anglican systems in other states that already have that status. But there is one system sitting out there, outstanding. They commenced the process on 5 February. This bill removes the minister's capacity to treat them in such a fashion, unless we see another amendment. And so they cannot be treated in the same way, Minister, unless this suggested $50 million transition fund is some discretionary ministerial bucket. If so, you have yet to describe to us the circumstances and conditions under which people would have access to it.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:25):  If the system in question meets all of the other, usual preconditions for system status—as we would anticipate—and the address collection has occurred, then the same provisions for prescribed circumstances payments under section 69A of the act would allow us to be able to ensure that they were treated in the same equitable terms as any of those others that were identified in the response to Senator Back.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:26):  More than 40 per cent of students in Northern Territory schools are Indigenous. Most of them are more likely to attend government schools, and many of these students are high-needs students, often because of issues of disadvantage and poverty. Studies have found nearly 90 per cent of Indigenous students in Northern Territory schools suffer from hearing loss, which affects language development and impacts on learning. So imagine sitting at school as a student with hearing loss and English as your second language. Sadly, that is the case for almost half of our Indigenous students at any given time, yet we wonder why these children are not learning. As a government, you wonder why the gap is not closing, Minister, but how do you learn when you cannot hear the teacher?


Let me give you some more facts about the reality of Northern Territory schools and students. The Northern Territory has the largest proportion of children aged nought to eight years of any state or territory in Australia—14.1 per cent compared to 11.5 per cent nationally. The Territory also has the largest proportion of Indigenous children—42 per cent compared to 6 per cent nationally. Geographically, 48 per cent of all children aged nought to 12 in the Territory live in remote areas, compared to three per cent nationally, and over 37 per cent of NT government schools have a language background other than English. Very remote students live in relatively small, highly dispersed communities and homelands, where families choose to remain living close to country and culture. In these areas there is limited infrastructure, little or no economy and populations that do not use English as a first language.


Minister, I have a number of questions in relation to the Northern Territory that I would like to put to you. Just before I do, I also have a letter here that I wish to table. It is a letter from the education minister, Eva Lawler, who is urging the Senate to delay this bill to allow time to negotiate arrangements that are more favourable to Australia's most disadvantaged and vulnerable children. Essentially, the key message is that jurisdictions have different capacities to fund their schools, and, while it does not seem like much, it is important to the Northern Territory. So I seek leave to table this document.

 (Northern Territory) (21:29):  Minister, I have a number of questions that I would like to put to you in terms of the Northern Territory. Although the Commonwealth has announced additional funding from 2018 to 2021 to assist Northern Territory government schools' transition to the new school-funding arrangements, the Territory's educational landscape and complexities will continue beyond 2021, where additional funding will be needed to assist students with the highest needs. Minister, how will this bill allow for review and continuous improvement in the funding model to consider changes in evidence and context?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:30):  I do refer Senator McCarthy in particular to proposed amendment (7) on sheet GX167 as it does provide a very clear mechanism for states and territories as well as other sectors to be represented in a national school resourcing body, and it will have particular tasks in relation to continued improvement of the funding model.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:30):  Minister, under proposed section 22A of the bill it states that states and territories will be required to at least maintain their current level of per-student funding in accordance with the regulations detailing how funding must be maintained for both government and non-government schools. It is understood the proposed penalty for failure to meet maintenance-of-effort requirements will result in a further reduction of Commonwealth funding being applied to public schools. Is this the case?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:31):  There is no reduction to public schools, but under the government's proposals there is indeed a provision contained to ensure that, as the Commonwealth provides additional funding, the states and territories do not simply take out their funding, leaving no net improvement. That is intended as an accountability mechanism to ensure the states and territories do that, noting the reality that the Commonwealth does not directly fund government schools in the Northern Territory or anywhere else around the country. So this is a provision designed to ensure that we do not give with one hand and see any state or territory government take and pocket it with the other but that actually additional funding equates to real additionality in schools.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:31):  The intention is that the one lever we have over states and territories is the funding we provide to those states and territories. So if a state or territory is not going to provide a full pass-through of Commonwealth funding to increase contributions to their state and territory schools then the Commonwealth would have a power in the mechanism to be able to withhold some future level of funding from that state or territory in the hope that that would incentivise the state or territory to ensure that extra funding means extra funding rather than extra Commonwealth funding simply being a cost-shift from the state onto the Commonwealth.

 (Northern Territory) (21:32):  Minister, the Commonwealth will also transition a calculation of loadings for students with a disability to be based on the nationally consistent collection of data, the NCCD, on school students with disability. This data collection is in its infancy and inconsistencies between jurisdictions are a key concern. Does the bill allow for improvements to data accuracy prior to linking adjustment classifications to funding?

As I think I told the Senate yesterday, the ratings are essentially demand driven. So if the collection of data in the Northern Territory were to validly result in more students with disability being identified and/or students with disability being identified at higher levels of adjustment need that would result in additional funding flowing. So our determination is that there will be continued work done across the states and territories around data accuracy. That is why we have commissioned over a period of time an independent report into the collections that have been taking place over recent years. That is informing continuous enhancements in the moderation of data activity to give confidence around the NCCD.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:34):  Minister, you said today in question time that funding for the Northern Territory was about growth in the Northern Territory, and your figures were that it would be going up from $191 million to $261 million, equating to around $8,362 per student and $11,370 per student. The concern that the Northern Territory has is that the funding proposal will see federal funds cut to 20 per cent of the school resourcing standard, and currently Northern Territory government schools received 23 per cent of the school resourcing standard. How did you arrive at those figures?

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:36):  Minister, I am just trying to understand, though, what that means for remote schools—for example, Mutitjulu, Yuendemu, Maningrida, Yirrkala and Borroloola. Can you explain just what it will look like for those particular schools?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:36):  I will explain it in a couple of ways. One, as I highlighted before, is that what it looks like for those schools will be a matter for the Northern Territory minister, whose letter you tabled before, as she has full autonomy—or the Territory government have full autonomy in terms of how they distribute the funding across Territory schools. However, the quantum of funding that the Territory government receives is well and truly, as I highlighted in response to your earlier questions, the highest in the nation on a per-student basis, and that is because of the particular need there. 


Of course, a loadings model like this one, which provides additional loadings for Indigenous students, students of socio-educational disadvantage, for students from learning backgrounds other than English and for students with a disability, does provide, ultimately, the largest level of funding per student in the Northern Territory, rightly reflecting the very particular needs of the Territory. 


So, in terms of the remote schools that you identified, while I do not offhand know the circumstances of each of those schools, I imagine that, in terms of the funding that the Territory government receives, each of them would be attracting significant levels of Indigenous student loadings; significant levels of loadings in relation to socio-educational disadvantage; significant loadings, potentially, in relation to language backgrounds other than English; possibly, significant loadings in relation to student with disability; certainly, in terms of them being remote schools, the regional schools loading; and probably the small schools loadings as well.

 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:39):  Certainly, Senator. Just to highlight support for Indigenous students, I draw your attention to the fact sheets that the department has published in this regard. Loading support for Indigenous students is estimated to increase from around $962.6 million that was provided over the previous four years—2014 to 2017 inclusive—and increasing to some $1.4 billion in loading support over the period 2018 to 2021. That is an increase in support of around 46 per cent. A significant level of those loadings, certainly on a per population basis or ratio, is the highest level in the country and naturally goes to the Northern Territory.

 (Northern Territory) (21:40):  This is where it is just not adding up, Minister, because, on the one hand, you are giving extraordinary figures in terms of the investment, yet the outcome for students and the resourcing do not reflect that.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:40):  There are extraordinary sums of money involved in school education. We estimate that around 213,504 students in 2018 will identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander students and therefore will attract a loading, depending on the intensity of the Indigenous population in the schools that they attend. Because of the scale of the number of students and schools, they end up being very significant numbers. But, importantly, there is also clear growth and clear application of needs based principles. As identified before, I gave the figures in relation to the growth rates across Northern Territory government schools that are estimated to shift from $191 million in funding in 2017 up to $261 million by 2027, as well as highlighting in particular the additional funding and budget resourcing that the government is committed to, in essence, outside of the model to provide some $35.6 million in the Northern Territory. This specifically recognises the unique circumstances there, including the uniquely high starting share of the schooling resource standard.

Can you point me to where in your figures there is a focus on—I am not sure whether it is in the disability area—providing support so that there is a guarantee that there is support for students with those sorts of learning difficulties?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:43):  Senator, as I went through some of the areas of loadings that are applicable before, language backgrounds other than English are one area of those loadings, which, as I indicated, may be applicable in certain remote communities in the Northern Territory, in addition to all of the other loadings which we spoke about. I would also highlight in relation to the first question you asked in the string of questions about the Nationally Consistent Collection of Data on School Students with Disability that the intent behind that is to provide for appropriate levels of support that genuinely reflect the adjustment assistance that students need. Obviously, issues in relation to hearing that may have impaired a student's learning over a period of time are real challenges. In terms of identification of hearing loss and hearing difficulties, I am advised that the Department of Health funds and supports a number of programs in terms of hearing checks. They provide valuable assistance towards identifying students who may be able to have hearing problems rectified, as well as identifying students who may attract additional support under the students with disability funding.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:45):  I am not sure quite what Senator Pratt is referencing, but certainly the commitment the Turnbull government has given through the model that is before the parliament is indeed to provide additional support to all states and territories, but to ensure it is done consistently, ensuring that the state of Western Australia, where Senator Pratt hails from, does ultimately receive equal levels of federal support for its students based on their need, as does every other state or territory, unlike anything that would ever be achieved for the state of Western Australia were existing provisions left to continue.

The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Sterle
):  Minister? Senator Pratt.




Senator PRATT:
  In other words, no. Is the statement true that you have previously made that commitment but you have deviated from the commitment because you are not applying it until the outlying years? The 2016-17 federal budget papers certainly indicated that this commitment was to take place from 2018 onwards and provided no indication of deferment funding through a long-term transition period as is before us in this legislation, so, Minister, what funding was allocated to Western Australian state schools in the 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 years in the 2016-17 federal budget?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:47):  I can inform Senator Pratt that, whilst I do not have it in front of me, I am very much aware that the budget papers last year made it very clear that the proposed distribution of funding, that I am pretty sure no other Labor senator will come in here and suggest should have been adhered to, was indicative only and was to be the subject of the development of future funding models. I challenge Senator Pratt to find anywhere where I quoted those figures, or used those figures, or where the government promoted those figures anywhere, without the very strong caveats that were contained in those budget papers. But I do emphasise to Senator Pratt that Western Australian government schools do, under the proposal that the Turnbull government has brought forward, receive far and away the greatest growth for government schools anywhere in the country—some 7.3 per cent per student growth over the next four years under the government's proposal; growth that is well in excess of anywhere else and reflective of the fact that Western Australia got such a raw deal under the Gillard government proposals and that we are committed over the transition period proposed in our bill to catch Western Australia up to all other jurisdictions.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:50):  Far from a deficit for Western Australia, as I indicated before, the growth rates are in fact the strongest in the country. As I have done for a number of jurisdictions, I will highlight for Western Australia that in 2017 WA government schools will receive some $616 million of Commonwealth funding. That will increase to an estimated $677 million in 2018 and, as the model continues to the 2027 endpoint, some $1.489 billion being paid to the Western Australian government to support Western Australia government schools—a more than doubling of existing funding in relation to WA.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:50):  It is because of a couple of things. The baseline is, of course, what they actually receive in 2017, and it grows each and every year into the future. As I indicated in my first question, the footnotes were very clear in last year's budget papers that, as state allocations for some programs were yet to be determined, relevant payments are not included in state totals. Consequently, total payments may not equal the sum of state totals. They further went on that it includes financial assistance grants for local government in some instances and then noted that state allocations from the 2018 school year onwards are indicative only and final allocations are subject to formal negotiations with Commonwealth, the states and the non-government schools sector. Of course, in those final allocations for 2018 onwards we propose to remove all ambiguity or uncertainty and to actually ensure that they are locked into legislation  under a far fairer arrangement than the deal that absolutely dudded Western Australia that the Gillard government put on the table.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:52):  As I indicated before, the indicative figures in last year's budget were clearly specific as indicative only. Were, of course, I to accept the premise of your question, that would make a mockery of the claims each and every one of your colleagues seem to make. They do not want to use last year's budget as the basis upon which to acknowledge there is growth everywhere else across the country. Indeed, it seems as if you want to pick one set of figures completely different from the set of figures all of your other colleagues want to use. I highlight here that Western Australia is the biggest winner out of these reforms with the fastest rate of growth. Unlike anything that would ever have been achieved under the Gillard government deals, we are guaranteeing that Western Australia will receive a fair share of funding for its school students rather than being penalised for the fact that Western Australian governments have invested more in their schools than some in other states do.

Before I do that, Minister, we know that you have been in negotiations with some of the crossbenchers in here and, indeed, before that with the Australian Greens. I note that today Senator Hanson made comments about children with disability in a speech that she made during the education bill debate, stating that, if there are too many children with disability in a classroom, it affects the learning of children without disability—according to Senator Hanson—and that these children should go into a special classroom. Was that raised at any point by the Pauline Hanson's One Nation team as a negotiating point with government to get their support for the bill?

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (21:59):  I have one short question I hope the minister might be able to give me a decent answer to. One of the things that concerns the local community is how trustworthy the information is that the government has provided. As a former teacher, I have to say that people's interaction with the My School website has led to a degree of trust in the veracity of information they can access from a government about the facts relating to their school. So I think the government's decision on the back of that sense of trust that people have in the digital connection they have with governments about their school was actually an asset on which the government drew when they were trying to convince the Australian public that they were actually going to be doing something decent in terms of education.


But, in the context of all of that, there was the establishment of the school funding estimator. With discussion around the bill, and certainly at estimates, there were very many questions about the veracity of the detail embedded in that funding estimator. Parents right across the country and across New South Wales are communicating with me and they are very concerned about how much they can trust that. For some of them, their initial concern was simply because, like me, they really do not trust too much what this government says on education, particularly after they were told they were going to get dollar-for-dollar funding that would match Labor's commitment. They want to know how now they should interpret the school funding estimator given that the Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Education, Mark Scott, has said that the information on the federal government's school funding estimator is not to be relied upon. And that is a direction that has been given to New South Wales school principals with regard to school funding. So, Minister, with regard to what has now been declared by a state entity, the government sector in New South Wales, through Mr Mark Scott, what is your intention with regard to directions about removing incorrect factual data from the school funding estimator website?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:02):  The senator asked a couple of questions relating to the My School website and the school funding estimator. Of course, the My School website provides details of the Commonwealth funding that a state or territory system authority, Catholic school system authority or other school system says it provides to a particular school. It is not necessarily an accurate reflection on the My School website what the federal funding provided to that system authority for the school is; it is simply a reflection of what the system authority, out of their pooled grant of federal funding, provides to that school. I note that historical data on My School also includes other sources of federal funding outside of the direct recurrent school funding arrangements. In relation to the estimator, it has sought to provide the nominal allocation of funding that goes from the Commonwealth to a school or a school system. I note that, in relation to a school system such as the New South Wales government system, the school funding estimator does make clear that, if your school is part of a system—Commonwealth funding is paid to the system as a block—the system will determine the amount your school receives. That, of course, has been the case historically and it continues to be the case.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:03):  Just to be clear for people who thought they did not have to worry about the funding of their schools and education for their children, for people who have taken the government at its word and certainly accepted the fanfare on the day of the announcement—'the school funding estimator is going to tell you how great life is for your child'—the reality is that it is a nominal allocation. That means it is not an accurate number, it is nominal; it is something like it, but it is not the accurate number.


Minister, if your school is part of the Catholic school system, which is 25 per cent of the schools across the country—and all of the government schools as part of government systems—because parents of those school systems are looking up materials, there is not only a nominal allocation; the other variable is that the other numbers there do not actually reflect what is happening with the system through which the money is coming. Basically, they are very, very inaccurate numbers. Is that correct, Minister? They are not to be relied on?

I do note that all of these matters were covered fairly extensively at Senate estimates and, I suspect, in the Senate inquiry. I again refer the senator to my previous answer: if you accurately want to know how much federal government funding a school system provided to their individual schools, then ultimately you need to refer to the My School website when that data is finally reported.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (22:06):  I want to go to some further concerns of the Western Australian state government. I will quote from their submission to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. The Western Australian government noted that, through this legislation, the Commonwealth is 'seeking to strengthen the linkage between Commonwealth financial assistance and the implementation of evidence-based reforms to improve student outcomes'. As the Western Australian state government characterises it, the bill is seeking to stipulate conditions of financial assistance on the states and territories that is conditional on the implementation of national policy initiatives and that those jurisdictions maintain their 2017 levels of schools funding. Given that, why have you not provided the states the detail about how the funding will be tied to reforms, how maintenance of effort will be calculated and measured and how noncompliance will be managed?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:08):  The Turnbull government makes no apologies for wanting to ensure that record and growing levels of school funding are used in evidence-based ways to lift student outcomes and student performance. That is essential given the relative flatlining, and indeed decline, in some areas of performance across Australian schools over recent years. It is essential, particularly given that that has occurred in the context of increased funding growth, especially from Commonwealth governments into Australian school systems.


We want to make sure that, this time, in committing increased funding, that funding delivers results across Australian schools, which is why we are very pleased that David Gonski has agreed to do a further piece of work which will be undertaken over the duration of this year and which will receive evidence and opinions from educational experts around the country to identify how it is that our additional record growing levels of funding can most effectively be used to lift educational outcomes  and achieve educational excellence. We look forward to states and territories working with us through that review process, signing on to reform agreements and being held accountable for the implementation of those reforms so that we actually do achieve the lift in student outcomes that that investment is set and meant to achieve.

Senator BIRMINGHAM

Measure 175 says the minister must consult in relation to the making of regulations and have regard to the decisions of the ministerial council. Those relate to conditions of financial assistance matters as well as ongoing policy requirements and ongoing funding requirements. Indeed, the standard practice is that the minister of the day does write out to all of the jurisdictions to provide them with notice of and an opportunity to comment on or respond to proposed decisions or regulations that the minister is making.

This item will ensure that where proposed regulations will affect the ongoing policy or funding requirements of approved authorities for government schools, or conditions imposed under sections 22, 22A and 24 of the Act on states and territories for financial assistance received under the Act, the Minister must not only consult with the Ministerial Council, but must also have regard to decisions of the Council prior to the Governor-General making those regulations.

To facilitate the progress of dealing with amendments it would be useful if the minister, or with the assistance of the department, were able to address a couple of questions in relation to amendment (2), which the minister has moved. How do the amounts specified in GX1672, which detail different SRS funding amounts for 2017, impact upon different groups of schools? How does it increase expenditure?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:16):  The financial impact of these measures is already part of the budget estimations, as I understand it. For clarity: these measures give effect to some of the changes the government had already announced. As I think has been explored previously, there is a slight updating in relation to the base funding amount for primary school students and secondary school students, reflecting more current data about the level of expenditure of those schools captured in the modelling who meet the educational standards for the setting of the base funding. That is what these measures seek to give effect to, as I outlined in introducing this amendment, ensuring that the commencement funding calculations accurately reflect funding in the appropriate terms for the appropriate year, indexed off the base, from when they were calculated.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (22:18):  Minister, what we are seeking to understand at the moment is what has been circulated from the Parliamentary Counsel in relation to this amendment. It indicates that this amendment will 'change the basis for calculating funding for certain schools under the Australian Education Act 2013, having the effect of increasing expenditure under the act'. Do the comments you have just made in relation to those calculations deal with that issue?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:18):  Indeed, the bill presented by the government does involve increasing funding under the act. The way in which that funding is calculated is why these provisions are shaped in the form of a request. They are not an area of additional funding—and there are some of those in the form of further amendments that will be dealt with—but they do relate to the additional funding already provided for in the bill in that they impact the way it is all calculated. In terms of application to certain schools, obviously the primary school base amount relates to primary schools and the secondary school base amount relates to secondary schools—and I am sure you do not need me to go through the others in terms of size loadings and so on. Yes, the language is 'certain schools' but that is only because each of the factors relates to the schools to which it is relevant.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (22:19):  While we are on this issue of additional funding, and picking up on the minister's earlier comments in relation to the provisions in the act under 69A, which he would use to deal with any new systems that might get access to funding for the 12-month period in relation to applying a system-weighted average, he indicated earlier that his estimate for the cost of that is $46.5 million, $38.2 million of which is for Catholic schools with the remainder presumably for independent schools. Minister, what other arrangements have you reached with respect to independent schools? I mentioned earlier—and you have not responded to the comments I made in relation to Students First—that the independent school sector said quite clearly to the legislation inquiry that they were hopeful that you would reconsider the position that you gave at Senate estimates about how that would apply into the future. My question is: what other calls will there be for those seeking accommodations that you might utilise section 69A of the act for?

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:24):  I find it hard to understand how anybody at this point could trust your word. My understanding is very clear. You made a number of commitments, including to the director of schools for the Broken Bay diocese, that you would consider altering the school funding website to reflect the funding allocation by systems so as to more accurately reflect the funding realities. Have you changed your mind about that commitment that you made to the director of schools, or was it just something that you said to get out of a tricky situation and did not mean at the time?



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator O'NEILL:
  Senator Birmingham seems to think that that is a question that is not worthy of an answer, but I want to put on the record that I am a parishioner in the Diocese of Broken Bay and know many teachers in that sector. I know that three very powerful women have taken action in the last week to come down here to Canberra—to leave their small children behind—as advocates for that sector. They have been walking the halls of the parliament, making sure that those on the government benches understand the devastation of the proposed cuts to funding and the failure to deal with the system-weighted average and capacity-to-pay measures that have been the subject of some considerable questioning from our side—still without adequate answers from the other. Those parents from the Broken Bay diocese have been here very alarmed about the impact of government decision-making on their capacity to continue to send their children to the school of their choice.


Those women describe what I think is a very common phenomenon for many Australians around the country who are right now waking up to the disaster of what this funding model that you are proposing is. It has been around just long enough for them to notice the filthy smell of what it is that you are attempting to push through the parliament under the cover of darkness. People are just figuring out that something smells really bad about this. As described to me by these wonderful advocates for 25 per cent of the school population across the country—these three women came in and said, 'We thought at first maybe it was a slight overreaction.' They went to check the facts on the school funding estimator. They actually had faith in the government to put accurate data on the website in the government's name. What a terrible mistake they made. They went to the government website that was being constructed by your department on your watch, Minister. They went and they looked. They thought they could trust those figures, but bit by bit they found out how inaccurate they were, as the systems did and as the systems have gone to you and asked you, Minister, to correct the misinformation that is on those. You have just ignored that. You have made commitments you cannot even remember, it would seem, or are going to deny. Either way, the fact is that those calculators are still incorrect, and parents who are relying on information from you have suddenly started to figure out that they simply cannot trust any of the numbers that you are producing. It is like there is an asterisk and a few more little asterisks and a few more little asterisks. If you sit there and you read all the tiny asterisks—including the ones that you forgot to put in there—you might actually somewhere approximate something near the truth. But people cannot get a straight answer. They cannot get the truth from the school funding estimator and they are not getting the truth from this government in this place tonight.


Mothers who would perhaps normally be ready to put their feet up after a hard day of looking after their families, balancing their work-life and their commitment to their community have asked me to ask you these questions. 'Why does the senator want to pass a bill where it has been proven that the SES model is fundamentally flawed? Why doesn't he fix the modelling first and then present the bill?' What an insightful question from a mother who probably just a few weeks ago did not realise that she would have to sit down and spend hours and hours trawling through the misrepresentations that have been put out into the public place in the government's own school funding calculator? How many mothers of young children sit down and have to trawl their way through this data?


It is happening right across the country. That is the first question. Why do you want to pass this bill when your SES modelling is fundamentally flawed? Why didn't you sort out the modelling? Why didn't you get the modelling right? Why didn't you tell the truth before you brought the bill here?


The next question that these parents want answers to is: why does the minister want to rush this bill through the Senate without proper collaborative consultation with key stakeholders before the announcement was made? What a good question that is. I would love to hear the minister explain why he did not, as I indicated, collaboratively consult with key stakeholders before making the announcement of this bill, which is so terribly flawed and when it is becoming apparent right across the country that there are very big problems with what is being proposed here.


The third question that these parents are asking on behalf of their children and their access to education is: if the bill is so beneficial to systemic schools, why is the Parliamentary Budget Office reporting there will be a $3.1 billion reduction for Catholic schools over the next 10 years?


So there are three very important questions from three great Australian women who are civic advocates and have got themselves up to speed with the knowledge of very complex legislation and funding models because they do not want this government to get between their children and the future that they have a right to. They do not want to let this government get away with misrepresentation of what it is doing. All we hear from this government is, 'Funding is going up; funding is going up,' but parents are onto this government. They are alive to what is really going on here. Systems are onto this government and alive to what is really going on here. And the schoolchildren themselves, I am sure, are feeling the anxiety and the uncertainty that will be manifest in the schooling system that they are a part of. Can you answer those three important questions from those parents, Minister, and speak to what you are going to do about the gross misrepresentation that currently exists on the school funding estimator?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:32):  I will take the senator's three questions that I can manage to decipher from amongst all of her rhetorical flourish. In relation to SES modelling, I reject the categorisation of it as being fundamentally flawed. I do accept, and the government has accepted, there are people who have concerns about aspects of it, which is why, as I outlined in relation to questions from Senator Back earlier, the government has happily made a commitment to ensure that the SES methodology is reviewed. In relation to consultation issues that the senator asked about, I refer her to the Hansard of Senate estimates proceedings, in which I think we went through those matters fairly extensively.


In relation to funding for Catholic systemic schools, I refer the senator to answers that I have given in this chamber and many other places in recent days and prior to that that the evidence and data produced is very clear that, for Catholic systemic schools across Australia, funding goes up from $6.3 billion in 2017, growing to $9.7 billion by 2027, with $3.4 billion of growth across that period, as part of some $81 billion in funding provided to Catholic systemic authorities around the country.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,25,1
"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:33):  Minister, there is a particular way in which you answer the questions which is profoundly dismissive of the concerns of parents who are generally finding the passion and energy within themselves, in the context of their very busy lives, to actually engage in this political process, which they have never done before, and are sending questions through that they expect a serious answer to. Instead, you just brush them off in the elitist way that is one of the advancement strategies you must employ on that side, because it is pretty common across the frontbench. You just stand up there, dismiss their questions and send them off to a document where you have misrepresented the facts. Why don't you actually answer the questions honestly, with a little respect for the people who are asking them with genuine concern? The patter that we get from you, Minister, has worn out. You can tell the numbers as often as you like and in any way that you like, but people are seeing through it. It is a misrepresentation of what is going to happen and how it is going to impact on children's learning across the country.


The next question that arrived from this same group of wonderful women was: will the minister keep the capacity-to-contribute ratios as in the 2013 act, rather than use the figures in the amendment bill that is being discussed this evening? I think it is a pretty good question from a citizen who has not had too much to do with the parliament up until you threatened our children's funding.




Senator Birmingham:
  Can you just repeat the question?




Senator O'NEILL:
  I will repeat the question: will the minister keep the capacity-to-contribute ratios as they are in the 2013 act, rather than use the figures indicated in the current amendment bill up for discussion this evening?

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:36):  Can I go to some of the answers you gave to questions that were asked by Senator Back? You spoke about the determination, that using section 69(1) would lead to additional funding equivalent to the student weighted average for all relevant systems—I think I understood that. Minister, could you explain exactly where the number for the fiscal impact of $46.5 million comes from? And the $32 million amount that you indicated was also part of your answer?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:37):  The $46.5 million is the additional funding that will be provided as a result of providing funding equivalence for system authorities next year. That is calculated on the basis of the legislation passing. The same methodology is being applied in relation to the calculation of system weighted averaging as is currently the case.




Senator O'Neill:
  Minister, can you speak a little more slowly so that I can actually hear you?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I said that on the basis of the bill passing it is calculated using the same methodology as is currently the case in terms of system weighted averaging, as I have indicated already. That equates to $46.5 million of additional costs overall, as I indicated to Senator Back, $38.2 million of which would be for Catholic systemic authorities. Of that, a $8.3 million would be for systemic authorities representing other systems, such as the Lutheran system, the Adventist system, the Anglican system and the like.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:38):  I will ask one final question with regard to one of the schools on the Central Coast, where I live. I have lists of hundreds of schools here through the seat of Robertson, the seat of Hume and out into the Riverina, all of which indicate very significant cuts to funding that parents were expecting to receive if the Commonwealth had honoured its commitment to the NERA that was, fundamentally, the expression of the Gonski reviews. Avoca Beach primary school would have received $144,000. Under Mr Abbott it was pretty well zero but under Mr Turnbull the increase now is only $55,200, based on indicative figures. That cut of $89,000 is of concern to the local community. Are the P&C of Avoca Beach Public School wrong when they say that they are going to lose funding that will impact their capacity to deliver proper schooling? Are they wrong, Minister?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:39):  I would point parents to the growing funding that the New South Wales government school system will receive under the Turnbull government's reforms that are before the parliament, funding that will grow for New South Wales government schools from $2.186 billion in 2017 to $2.328 billion in 2018 added to $4.003 billion by 2027. Again, it is a strong growth, as I have highlighted for a number of jurisdictions tonight. The New South Wales government school system will be able to allocate this funding across its schools under our proposed reforms with the safeguards we are proposing to ensure that they are part of real additional funding into school systems and not used by any state as a cost-shifting mechanism. Of course it is growth above inflation, above wages growth that should ensure that the New South Wales government is able to support those schools to continue to do many good things they may have commenced doing to support their students in recent years and indeed, in many instances, to be able to do more in future years.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:40):  Minister, I have got a letter here on the letterhead of the Avoca Beach Primary School P&C association and I am sure it is indicative of letters that are going out right across this nation. Certainly I know there is a very active campaign in the whole diocese of Broken Bay and also throughout the schools up the North Shore and all the way right up to Swansea. The inconvenience and the alarm that your legislative program has caused has brought parents together for special meetings, which they do not do frequently, to actually discuss the impact of the decisions that are going to be made in this chamber in the next 24 hours it would seem. It called for a special meeting for all Avoca Beach Public School parents regarding Gonski funding. This is what it says:


Under the federal government's new Gonski funding model, our school will now not be receiving over $300,000 in funding initially promised to us over the next two years. We were promised $144,000 in 2018 but, under the school funding amendment bill, we will only receive $55,200. In 2019, we were promised $272,000 but will only receive $57,850. The bill has already passed through the lower House and now is a matter of debate in the Senate. We are calling a special meeting at 7:30 pm on Monday 26 June in the school library. We ask that you come along and learn how you can help overturn this bill. We have got a short window hence your attendance would be greatly appreciated.


I am pretty sure they are going to be devastated when Monday 26 June comes around if this piece of legislation gets forced through the parliament in the next 24 hours. Minister, does it concern you at all that letters that this have gone out to hundreds of thousands of families across this country because they no longer have any confidence in the Turnbull government to deliver fair funding for their government school or fair funding for their Catholic school or even fair funding for some of the independent schools, who are now very much questioning the capacity of this government to speak the truth with them?

They are essentially all technical amendments, and I will happily take questions on them rather than take up the Senate's time dealing with them.

(6) Schedule 1, item 103, page 27 (line 7), omit ""for a school"", substitute ""to an approved authority"".


Question agreed to.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I now move amendment (5) on sheet GX167:


(5) Schedule 1, item 89, page 25 (line 28) to page 26 (line 2), omit subsection 78(3), substitute:


(3) An ongoing funding requirement for an approved authority for more than one school is to distribute all financial assistance received in accordance with Division 2 of Part 3 in accordance with a needs‑based funding arrangement determined by the approved authority that complies with subsection (4) or (5).




Funding arrangement based on Division


2 of Part


3



(4) A needs‑based funding arrangement that complies with this subsection distributes to each school for which the authority is approved the amount of financial assistance worked out for the school under Division 2 of Part 3.




Funding arrangement based on other factors



(5) A needs-based funding arrangement that complies with this subsection:


(a) provides an amount per student that:


   (i) represents the recurrent resources required to support a student with minimal educational disadvantage to achieve expected educational outcomes; and


   (ii) takes account of efficiencies that can be realised while improving educational outcomes; and


(b) in addition to the amount per student mentioned in paragraph (a), provides loadings to students and schools with additional needs in order to support student achievement, including loadings for the following:


   (i) students with disability;


   (ii) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students;


   (iii) students with socio‑educational disadvantage;


   (iv) students who have low English proficiency;


   (v) schools based on location;


   (vi) schools based on size; and


(c) is publicly available and transparent.


(6) An approved authority that distributes financial assistance in accordance with subsection (5) is an approved system authority.


This is an amendment that relates to the requirements of approved authorities in relation to their compliance with the act in terms of the distribution of their funding. In particular, it seeks to effectively recognise the autonomy of those approved authorities to be able to distribute their funding. It does not negate, of course, their obligation to use all funding, clearly, for the benefit of their schools and students to ensure they meet all other compliance provisions. But it does ensure that they have autonomy in operating needs based systems with the pooled funding or grant funding they receive according to their principles of need, whilst still noting that the government would, of course, expect that that would reflect the particular disadvantage loadings that are identified.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (22:48):  Minister, can you advise on amendment (5): does this reduce the autonomy of systems to be able to distribute funding across their schools? What consultation has occurred in relation to this section in the bill? We are particularly interested to understand how these new requirements will relate to the description in the explanatory memorandum about how the act operates, allowing systems to distribute in relation to other factors. I think one of the best examples there is probably refugee children. Would these new requirements cut across the system's capacity to direct resourcing to address the needs of students that are not currently accommodated within the federal model?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:49):  Far from increasing regulation, this actually reduces it. Most of these provisions are contained in existing regulation but are being proposed in a slightly simplified way to be lifted into the act which will, for the first time, ensure that the right of an approved authority to distribute Commonwealth funding on the basis of zoned needs arrangements will be enshrined clearly in the act and not be subject to potential ministerial variation by regulation. 


These amendments do as they indicate. They will require approved authorities for more than one school to distribute funding in two essential ways: that they simply pass the funding along as they can pass it along as was calculated, or that they can contribute according their own needs based funding arrangement as long as it meets criteria that are relatively simple in terms of the different loading categories that is by no means binding them to exact application of funding specific to those loading categories nor does it restrict them from being able to indeed consider other certain loading factors such as refugee students, whom you indicated as an example before. I will leave it there while I see if I can find the reference in the EM.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (22:51):  Thank you. I asked the minister in my original question what consultation had occurred in relation to these provisions. The reason I asked that is—the first issue is: why are they now introducing these arrangements in the bill? Why wasn't it originally proposed in the bill, if it is as simple as the minister suggests? I know it is almost 11 o'clock at night after a long day, but we still have concerns that the relevant systems may not have been consulted in relation to these provisions, and there may be unintended consequences. It would also help, I think, if the minister could refer us to the regulation that is drawn upon here and being proposed to be brought into the act. 


Again, I use this opportunity to highlight the point, which is, when we are presented with government amendments so late in the piece in sittings as extraordinary as these, it is very difficult to give detailed consideration to matters. Certainly, when you have a day or so, you are able to go and check regulations and you are able to be assured that what the minister has said is simply drawing from regulation up into the act. I would certainly be a proponent of drawing into the act as much as one possibly could with our experience of the nearer now. It probably reflects even our experience with the National Schools Resourcing Body, which at the time we had concerns about establishing yet another school education related board or institution. But, with experience and in retrospect, looking at the way the government has dealt with modelling and data and information, as Senator O'Neill has highlighted—most recently in relation to the school funding estimator—very much so those arrangements, you would hope, were brought into legislation so that they could not be as easily dismantled as occurred with Gonski 1.0 and the arrangements and the reform agenda that was part of the National Education Reform Agreement. 


So, if it is as simple as the minister suggests, which is drawing up well-understood regulations that school systems have worked with and are familiar with, then, on the face of it, we could potentially accept that. But, Minister, you have not yet assured me that adequate consultation has occurred in respect of this, so I remain to be satisfied on that point.

Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  These amendments provide for the establishment of a national school resourcing body. The amendments themselves are relatively self-explanatory for any senator, so I will not take long in going through them. I do acknowledge that a number of non-government parties have advocated for and argued for such a body to be established. Indeed, elements of this body reflect one of the original recommendations of the Gonski review. Importantly, as I have already alluded to in relation to addressing some of the issues with Senator Back earlier in the debate, this is the body that would be tasked with continual review and enhancement of the school funding formula.


The establishment of this board will ensure a number of things. It will provide a mechanism by which we can ensure, in a way that engages all of the relevant stakeholders, the funding model can continually be enhanced and appropriate reviews of it can be undertaken, as well as ensuring that we have a standing body that, on a regular basis, can ensure compliance of states and territories and approved authorities with their obligations under the funding arrangements and the act.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-06-21,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (23:03):  The creation of the independent resources body or some type of watchdog on the way funding is distributed is absolutely essential. The Greens have been advocating for this for quite some time. We know, of course, that it was a recommendation by David Gonski in the original Gonski review. However, the Greens have circulated amendments to these amendments from the government, because we believe what is currently in the amendments circulated by the government is a pale imitation of what needs to be implemented. We need an independent body that actually has the teeth to inquire, to oversee and to ensure that it can report back to this parliament and publicly.


Of course, we know that across different school systems and across different states and territories people have not always abided by the rules or, indeed, the spirit of the arrangements and agreements as to how public money should be spent in schools and through systems. We know that there have been allegations around the way some in the Catholic system have been spending money put aside by the taxpayer for Catholic schools. We know that in the states and territories money that was put up and meant to go improving education in their schools has not been spent on education and, indeed, has gone to other areas. We know that in some systems, in some states and in some territories there are schools that are chronically underfunded. They need money which should have been allocated money and instead money has been flowing to schools that are more popular and more affluent.


If we are serious about implementing a new funding model—a needs based model—then we need to make sure we have somebody watching what is going on. In order to do that, to make a watchdog that has teeth, we have to amend the government's proposal tonight. It is essential that we do this because otherwise what we will end up having is simply a panel of people appointed by the minister to report to the minister when the minister wants, as opposed to a body that has true independence, is able to inquire into the issues that they see need exposing and answer the questions that they see are problematic and to run reviews where needs be.


I think there is also an expectation by the taxpayer and the broader public that if a body like this is going to act as a watchdog it must be able to report back to the parliament in a regular and meaningful way. The amendments that the Greens have circulated tonight would strengthen this body and make sure it is in the true spirit of what those of us who have been advocating for it for quite some time intend, both in this place and also outside—that we will actually see those concerns realised through this amendment.


I know that there are members of the crossbench who I have spoken to at length about the need to create an independent resources body. I would urge them that this is an opportunity to make sure we actually get it right. The things that we have put into this amendment simply give it proper teeth. They ensure that it is a body that will have integrity and do its job to ensure that we do shine a light on what is going on, so that the taxpayer, parents, students and teachers can have full confidence and know where the money is being spent and that it is actually being spent in the true spirit of needs based funding.


Of course, the other thing that this body should be able to do is to conduct a review of the SES model. We know that has been a concern amongst many. It has been raised several times tonight and it has been raised a lot over the last couple of weeks with the debate into this legislation. It is about having this body in place that would be able to run these types of reviews with true independence, away from us as politicians and away from the toxic politics that have consumed this school funding debate. Instead, it should be able to do it with a clear head and clarity, and then report back to the parliament to give us a true indication of what should be done going forward.


Along with the SES model review I would hope that a body like this would be able to do things such as review the way disability loadings have been characterised. This would ensure that the auditing and collection of data around students with disability is being done in the most accurate way. Is there indeed a better way of ensuring that we are able to identify the needs of students with varying elements of disability?


There are a number of fundamental things that this body could do and good work a body like this could undertake if, indeed, we got it right. So I urge the crossbench—the Nick Xenophon party and others—to consider putting some of these things in place tonight so that we can ensure that the resources body, the watchdog of this government schools funding, actually has the teeth to do its job going forward. I am happy to continue talking about this as we go tonight if anybody has any concerns.


By leave, I move Greens amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 8177, which are amendments to government amendments (1) and (7) on sheet GX167, together:


(1) Item 106, omit subsections 128(1) and (2), substitute:



(1) Independent reviews of the operation of this Act, and in particular of arrangements and requirements relating to funding for schools, are to be conducted by a review board (the National School Resourcing Board):


(a) on request by the Minister; or


(b) on its own initiative.




Review boards



(2) A review board must consist of at least 6, but no more than 9, members who:


(a) are appointed by the Minister; and


(b) in the opinion of the Minister, have suitable experience and expertise in the matters to be addressed by the review.


(2) Item 106, after subsection 128(6), insert:


(6A) An independent review of the matter mentioned in paragraph (7)(a) must be conducted at least annually.


(3) Item 106, at the end of section 128, add: 




Review board may pu
blish information and statement



(13) A review board may, at any time, publish information obtained or developed by it in conducting a review to bring to the public's attention an instance of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or an approved authority:


(a) not distributing funding on a needs basis; or


(b) funding a school below its share for a year; or


(c) funding a school above its share for a year.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (23:11):  I want to ask Senator Hanson-Young, in relation to these amendments, what she sees would be the effect of these amendments in the sense of whether the review would bind the minister. Regarding the mechanics of it, what effect would it have? The requirement to publish information statements is welcome, but how would Senator Hanson-Young see this working in the context of arrangements? Does she anticipate that the recommendations of the National School Resourcing Board would be binding on the minister? What effect would she see it having on the minister?

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-06-21,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (23:12):  The effect of this is simply that the recommendations would be made public and given to the parliament, and, indeed, the minister would have to respond. Obviously, this body cannot direct the minister. It would be up to the parliament and those of us responsible for ensuring that the minister does their job to follow through on those recommendations.


The main issue here, of course, is that the naming and shaming of systems or states or territories who are not doing the right thing ensures that, hopefully, everybody will agree that, if we are putting aside a lot of money from the Australian taxpayer to provide to various school systems, it is being spent in the most appropriate way and in line with the needs based model. We have spent quite a bit of time already tonight; we have spent a number of years as parliamentarians and as a parliament debating the need for needs based funding. When must now make sure that there is somebody, an independent body, to keep a watchful eye that that is actually happening.


It is useless, in my opinion, to put in place a body that is not required to report back to the parliament but is simply an advisory body to the minister. If we are serious about putting in place a watchdog, the watchdog must have the teeth to do its job properly. We should ensure that a review body can at any time publish information obtained or developed by it in conducting a review or can bring to the public's attention an instance where the Commonwealth, a state or territory or an approved authority—a type of school funding system—has not distributed funding on a needs basis. This parliament and the public should have the right to know about that. If a system, a state or a territory is funding a school below its fair share, this parliament and the public—Australian parents—should have the right to know about that. If a system, a state or a territory is funding a school above what it is fairly entitled to, this parliament, the taxpayer. parents across this country, teachers and principals deserve to know. If we are serious about needs based funding, we have to be serious about making sure it is going to happen.

Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (23:17):  Senator Hanson-Young has raised some very important points. We do need a review board to ensure that they are accountable to the public with regard to this. I would like clarification from the minister with regard to this. Proposed section 128(10) in the amendment states, with reference to the reports of reviews:


(10) The Minister must:


…   …   …


(b) cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the report is given to the Ministerial Council.


Does that answer Senator Hanson-Young's comments that it should be reported to the parliament for accountability?

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (23:18):  I may need some advice from the clerks here as well, given that the opposition has amendments that were on revised sheet 2. Let me deal with it there for the moment. Opposition amendments (9) and (12) on sheet 8155 similarly deal with this issue, but we do not seem to have brought those matters together on the running sheet. I might commence at this stage with some general remarks in relation to a national schooling resource body, which will save me needing to deal with them subsequently if and when we get to Labor's amendments, and then I will deal with some further issues related to the government's proposals at this stage.


I have already mentioned that, when Labor established the review of school funding and passed the Australian Education Act 2013, we wanted to take the politics out of school funding and to end decades of sector being against sector in school funding wars. I acknowledge Senator Hanson-Young's comments, again, very much on that point. The opposition has revised thinking on that matter, given that clearly those wars have been reignited by the process that has occurred in more recent times.


Had the original Gonski six-year plan come through to fruition we would obviously be in a different place to what we are today. Instead, today we only have four years of what was a six-year transition to a shared student resource standard and, indeed, a situation where most schools would have reached their target in relation to that student resource standard. Now we have proposals that are still very unclear about how many schools will get anywhere near the student resource standard that was proposed under the Gonski review. Perhaps at this stage it might be worthwhile me asking the minister if he could, please, as a courtesy, provide me with his correspondence that has not yet been able to be tabled in response to the Senate's order for production of documents. It would be useful for us to understand what, if any, information has been provided to crossbench senators on that point.


But back on the point of the national schooling resource body: of course, we would hope that information would reside there independently, and that information would be publicly available and independently available. It would prevent the cherry picking of data that has occurred through this minister and the department to justify his case. It would avoid the politicisation of a Commonwealth department in the way that we have seen—a department that has produced things such as the schools funding estimator, which, seriously, is an embarrassment and a joke to any public officer.


If we can bring the independents into this issue we will be in a different place again, hopefully, to what was envisaged when the Gonski review first occurred. I suppose that, in part, that brings me to my first point in relation to the government schools resourcing proposal, which is simply for a board, not a standalone independent body. That is the concern which I will leave senators with to consider at the moment.


Back in 2013 we thought we had a bipartisan plan. As has been mentioned several times, the Liberals went to the 2013 federal election stating that they were on a unity ticket with Labor in regard to school funding and that the Liberals would match Labor dollar for dollar on school funding. Well, obviously, we are now in a very different place.


In part, I do understand when commentators say that the National Education Reform Agreement is dead. But I still grieve that loss. I grieve the loss of the consensus that had been achieved when Australian public policy shifted so significantly to where we are today. At that point in time we finally thought that we had bipartisan support to end the school funding wars and to ensure that each and every child, no matter at what school or which state they lived in, would receive their fair funding level.


Remember, at that point that was a combined funding arrangement, as was recommended in the Gonski review. In discussions today I have been saddened to hear some of the crossbenchers adopt this new rhetoric about 27 agreements. We all know that there were 27 agreements; it is how education in Australia had been delivered for decades. Each state and territory had a Catholic education system; a network of independent schools, including, often, some of the elite Catholic schools; and a government system. Each state had those arrangements. 


In fact, while Senator Hanson is here, I should make another point, because I think Senator Hanson needs to understand that the path that they have taken here is not quite what she understood arrangements to be. She made a contribution earlier today where she said that states do not fund non-government schools. Well, that it not true. States do fund non-government schools, and an element of the history here was that both the New South Wales and the Queensland governments some years ago started withdrawing their funding from non-government schools. That and the fact that states were also cost shifting and removing some of their funding for public schools was part of the political history that informed the overall Gonski review. The settlement that was sought and reached was that we would bring all parties together, as recommended by the Gonski review, into an agreed funding arrangement moving towards a common combined student resource standard. 


It was going to vary from state to state, because the states were starting at different points. Victoria, for instance: the reason it had a longer transition path was that it was starting from a lower base. Now, Senators, we are a federation and to suggest otherwise is a joke. You tell me any other area of Commonwealth funding policy that pretends things are consistent from one state to the other. You know it is not true, and how this minister has been able to befuddle the whole debate is a joke. You all know from your own states how policy and implementation differ from state to state. 


Take the GST as the classic example. So how this minister has managed to befuddle senators into thinking that one size fits all is beyond me. But let's go back to the issues around the national schooling resource body. I am sorry, Senator, you have accused me in the past of only focusing on Catholic schools; I am quite happy to address these other issues and, if your comprehension improves a bit in this area, I will be even happier. 


Back to the issues around the national schooling resource body—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I wonder sometimes exactly what I have done to upset Senator Whish-Wilson, but, given that senators have listened with courtesy to other senators in this place—and I do not think anyone could characterise the length of my contributions as the opposition representative as being particularly extensive—Senator Whish-Wilson might want to digress to whatever else he was doing this evening. 


Back to the issue of the national schooling resource body: back in the 2014 budget, the government of course reneged on their plan. They cut $30 billion of school funding as was clearly detailed in the budget papers. Now they are saying they should be congratulated for putting only part of that funding back to schools. I am sorry: I do not congratulate them for that. The position that they took back in 2014 was an outrageous statement in terms of how they went to the previous federal election, and they should be called out on that each and every occasion that is possible. 


The record demonstrates that we cannot trust the government in general terms on school funding, so I was quite surprised at the last division to see the minister fail to answer questions about what consultation has occurred here. You tell us that you are lifting regulations up into the act, but you have not explored the potential consequences of that. You have not consulted adequately. The minister just sat there, refusing to provide any information on that point, and the crossbench all just trotted in here and voted with the government. That was astounding. If that is the way public policy is going to continue in this place, God help our parliament. It reinforces that if we are going to need independent bodies outside of the parliament to do the heavy grunt work, then maybe we do need to establish them. If we cannot rely on the parliament to comprehend the detail of these matters—and we certainly cannot rely upon this government and, unfortunately, even this department to provide honest data—then yes: perhaps we do need an independent body.


Remember that the government is moving from a sector-blind model by enshrining sector-specific targets of 80 per cent for non-government schools and only 20 per cent for government schools. I hope that an independent body will be able to show us the honest impact of that. For New South Wales, for instance, currently at 22 per cent—I cannot remember the precise figure—of the student resource standard, what will that mean? We have already had the Grattan Institute suggesting in their submission to the Senate legislation inquiry that states might want to retreat from their funding of non-government schools. Rather than encouraging increased funding, the bizarre effect of these arrangements embedded in this bill will be the suggestion that state governments retreat from their funding of non-government schools. I would like an independent resourcing body to be able to demonstrate how, or the extent to which, that might be happening.


We had the discussion earlier that one of the issues and problems in dealing with states and territories is that they do not all necessarily budget across forward estimates. I understand there may have been some changes in that area, particularly in Victoria; but if an independent resourcing body can watch and monitor state contributions to resourcing, that would be a good thing and that would be an improvement. That is because we still very serious doubts about how effective this government's proposal to introduce a stick is going to be. We will get to that debate later in the discussions on this. The provisions that the government is proposing to hold states to funding arrangements are not going to deliver that outcome.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,25,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-06-21,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (23:32):  I have a question for Senator Hanson-Young. In my earlier contribution to the second reading debate, I expressed the concern that there was really no educational accountability or outcomes attached to this legislation. Effectively, the government was writing what is now, instead of an $18.9 billion cheque, something in the region of $24 billion cheque—by tomorrow's newspaper reports—of funding for schools, with no responsibility or accountability to those schools for producing measurable educational outcomes to improve the literacy and numeracy of students.


This is a great concern, because it would be very easy for a school to seek to gather in additional students for the funding—because funding is based on numbers of students—but not actually get the educational outcomes that are necessary. For those who say that money is the answer to everything, you can look at the history of increased educational funding over the last 10 years or so and you can look at our status on an international ranking in maths, science, literacy, numeracy, common sense and civics. In fact, however you want to measure it up, on the traditional scale the education system is not working to the advantage of our children.


The outcomes are then somewhat deficient in later in life. Every child is now accepted into university, virtually. Whether they get the grades or not, whether they can read or not and whether they can write or not, they get a degree. Whether they actually do any study or not they incur a HELP debt or a HECS debt—whatever you want to call it and then they cannot get a job. In the end, the government is on the hook for the HECS debt and the HELP debt—which I might telegraph is scheduled to reach, I think, something like $85 billion within the next 10 years. By the government's own estimates, about 20 per cent of that will not be paid back. That is in the region of $17 billion--$17 billion not paid back as the result of a poor educational system that does not have measurable outcomes.


The result of this failure is not to say, 'Let's actually make sure we can climb the ranks,' and it is not to say, 'Let's make sure our kids can read and write and do basic arithmetic to a sufficient standard.' It is, 'Let's throw money at it and let the schools continue to do what they are doing,' which is not working particularly well.


When we are talking about having a review body, and I must say that this amendment was news to me, there is a part of me that welcomes it. I do believe that it is important to continue to review legislation. I have my own amendment coming up a bit later. I trust that those who support a review will support it, and I hope that the opposition will consider it. It is: let us not bind future governments. For those of you who have aspirations to be in government at some point in the future—and I am looking at you, Senator O'Neill—is it really fair that you are bound by the poor decisions of the previous government?


I did not think it was right when the Labor Party were in government and trying to pretend that they had funded a $40 billion education package, which they had not done. But this government is doing exactly the same thing, although 'slightly less worse' is how they would describe it. In fact, that was the selling point to me! 'We are slightly less worse than what otherwise might come down the track.' I would say there is a better way.


But nonetheless, what we should be doing is not only considering reviewing legislation, reviewing the outcomes and measuring those sorts of things but we should be forcing governments of all persuasions, when they are promising unfunded and unaccountable ongoing funding, to come back to the parliament after the forward estimates period. That is why my amendment, which we will be dealing with later—and I will talk extensively about that—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I can't wait for that one!




Senator BERNARDI:
  I know you cannot, Senator Whish-Wilson! You will have to wait till tomorrow, unfortunately!




Senator Dastyari:
  Shame!




Senator BERNARDI:
  Excuse me, Chair, I heard interjection. I thought it was Senator Dastyari moving for an extension of time and hours for tonight. Was I right or not? I am happy to get that on the record and keep going for as long as anyone likes!


The point is this: if you are really serious about reviewing stuff it means that you also have to review the funding attached to it. So we might as well draw a line in the sand at some point and say that in four years' time we will have a revisit of the funding model, to see whether it is actually working.


Nothing I have seen in the government's position has committed it to actually delivering better results for students. Yes, they will deliver more money for some schools and they will deliver less money for some schools. It seems that this is a bit of a political fix and a political stitch up. They seem to have convinced some of the crossbenchers that this is a really good thing to do. But there is no responsibility attached to it. I think it is incumbent on all of us here at this late hour to consider just our obligation to our children, to students, to the budget bottom line and to the outcomes that we all desire for the benefit of our country. We do need people who are better educated. We do need better outcomes. We cannot afford to be below Kazakhstan in the science ratings, as I think we are. We cannot afford to be slipping down the rankings in every conceivable measure. Earlier today, Senator Gichuhi in her first speech—or her 'maiden speech' as us traditionalists like to refer to it—said that it was important that education comes through not only in a direct academic stance but that we also have to make sure that our children are informed about things like managing money, personal responsibility and things of that nature. In any measurable statistic, whether it be academia or just general life skills, I think our educational system is not doing a good service to our children.


This is the great concern. The government has not answered any of those sorts of things. I recognise that Senator Hanson-Young in moving this amendment is trying to redress in some way, shape or form that lack of accountability and lack of review. So my question is to Senator Hanson-Young. Does your amendment on sheet 8177 actually deal in any way, shape or form with measuring the educational outcomes rather than just the allocation of money? That is one of the gravest deficiencies of this bill. It appears to me that there are too many people in this place that really do not care about what happens to our children and whether they can read or write. They are just happy to throw money at them. But, as a parent, I can tell you throwing money at kids does not make them better kids; it makes them worse. It takes time and investment, teaching them things like how to learn and giving them experiences. Money is not the answer despite what the minister might be suggesting. Senator Hanson-Young—through you, Temporary Chair—that is my question. Are there measurable statistics attached to your amendment? I would really like to consider it if there were.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (23:42):  What I have tried to do with this amendment is empower the body to establish reviews where it sees fit. Of course we know the government is going to be asking David Gonski, for example, to conduct a review into various different elements of a number of the things that you are concerned about. If indeed this review body wanted to say after that process, 'Is there a reason why this particular school or this system that has been allocated this money is not getting these outcomes?' under these amendments the body would be able to empower itself to look into that and to report back. Why I am concerned with the way this body has been created to date and why I have moved the amendments is because it can only do reports based on the direction of the minister. I just do not think that is very independent. If indeed we are serious about having a body that can oversee what is going on, wants to pinpoint a problem, wants to investigate it and wants to make sure taxpayers are getting value for money then the last person who should be able to tell them what to do would be the minister responsible. It does not seem very independent to me.


I put to you, Senator Bernardi, that, in giving this body the power to initiate their own investigations and their own reviews with the power to report publicly and speak freely about their results without being shuffled through the minister's office, you might be pleasantly surprised that there is more than what is currently there.

 (South Australia) (23:44):  I appreciate the response, Senator Hanson-Young. I am always open to being pleasantly surprised, but you referred to Mr Gonski's review of the outcomes, which is part of the bill, and that in some ways does concern me, because why would you implement a funding package and then ask someone to decide in a year's time or thereabouts what desired benefits that package is meant to deliver? It just seems you are putting the cart before the horse, and I think that is a question for the minister: what specifically is Mr Gonski supposed to be doing whilst your funding package comes into being or is being implemented? What are the measurable outcomes specifically attached to this education funding package? If you know what they are now, why is Mr Gonski going to spend 12 months or so trying to develop them for you?

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (23:46):  Thank you, Minister. Senator Bernardi makes some very good points which relate to the proposal we have in the subsequent amendments in relation to the independent body that we are proposing should be instituted, but what is relevant here in part, Senator Bernardi, is that some of the very issues that you are referring to were in the National Education Reform Agreement. Unfortunately, those provisions were not brought into the act, and the current government did not follow through on what had been resolved. Had they done so, some of what has occupied all of our time in recent weeks would have been settled long ago. For example, the government pretend to be committed now to a schooling resource standard, yet they have not conducted any of the original reviews that were agreed with the states and territories. The overall model and the loadings have not been reviewed.


You might recall that, in some of the earlier media commentary, we had suggestions that the disadvantage loading should be structured differently. That might have been an early consideration of the government. We do not know, because we have not seen any of this work. It may be that, if we had an independent student resourcing body that could look at the outcomes that the existing structure of the model was producing, we could have an informed debate about how well those loadings are operating.


As we have already mentioned, the indexation had not been reviewed. Now we have the government saying that, if the act continues as it currently is, there are all sorts of consequences. Part of the problem there was that the indexation review that should have occurred and been concluded by 2016 was not done, so the act continued in a way that had not been envisaged back in 2013.


I know you are not so interested in the issues around the outcome of indexation rates, but if we move to the next level, which is the SES calculation that determines how much base funding non-government schools get, it had not been reviewed. If that element had been drawn up into the act and guaranteed to have occurred, much of the debate that has occurred here and has created significant problems for a number of senators would have been settled well before now. If we are going to set up a body to be an independent student resourcing body, I think we should learn those lessons from the past and make sure it does all of the things that should be dealt with.


Senator Bernardi, I think your point about outcomes is very important. To the extent they may not currently be accommodated in the amendment that we have proposed subsequently, that is something that we can probably address overnight. But I agree with you: we need to have a student resourcing body that might be looking at PISA and TIMSS results and the like but also comparing them to the relevant issues that affect Australia rather than necessarily making some of the sometimes less relevant comparisons with other areas in the world, in sometimes not the most informed way. We could rely on an independent agency to do that in a way which depoliticises much of that debate.


Looking at our proposal and what we think a schooling resource body should be tasked with, the first is maintaining and reviewing the base SRS and the loadings for disadvantage, as I mentioned. We need to ensure that the underlying funding model matches the evidence about what schools need to deliver high-quality education. That, in part, fits with the ongoing work that David Gonski has been tasked to do, and that is where there might be some sense in looking at how we combine those two processes. It should be tasked with reviewing the SES calculation for the non-government school sector to ensure it accurately reflects the capacity of parents to contribute to their children's education. This is included in the Labor amendment that we will come to later; as far as we have been able to determine, this is not in this proposal as it currently stands.


The next issue that it should be dealing with is monitoring what states are contributing towards schools, which I mentioned earlier, to ensure that states increase funding over time so all schools reach their student resource standard within a reasonable time frame. Such a body might even recommend more appropriate ways of ensuring that that occurs. I have mentioned in the past that Labor's approach was the carrot; this approach appears to be the stick. If we were in an alternate universe where the carrot approach had been picked up by the government and agreements had been finalised with the states that had not yet signed on, and they too had been offered the $2 Commonwealth to $1 state arrangement, we would be far, far closer to having a combined student resourcing standard for all Australian schools. But this is not the approach that this government is taking and, if at the end of the day the crossbench and the government have the numbers for this new 80-20 Commonwealth-only share approach, we will need a body to hold to account how effective that approach is at ensuring that states make the contributions that they need to make to assist us to reach a student resourcing standard. As I said, states have very different accounting standards for how they manage these things, and we are going to need experts that have a good understanding of how those issues work to hold states to account. So we hope that that would be part of a role for a schools resourcing body.


Finally, the body would provide greater transparency about recommended funding for schools—transparency in a way which does deliver accuracy about the information that is being provided around what is happening with schools and, indeed, within systems. The Labor government got down that path some way with the My School initiative. Some senators, such as Senator Xenophon, who is in the chamber now, will recall some of the controversy about what went into My School and what did not go into My School and how accurate or well informed some of that data might be. The particular area I dealt with in detail was in relation to students with disability. Later in the debate, we will get to some of the concerns about whether the nationally consistent dataset is in the position we need it to be in to do the job we need it to do. Other senators have suggested that this area is an area where the student resourcing body could perhaps do some very constructive work. It could understand the concerns about how well moderated the current figures are. It could help explain the data—because the department has not yet been able to explain to me some quite alarming spikes in that data. If we roll out the data as is currently proposed and those spikes are not understood and managed, then we will end up with some very perverse circumstances where some sectors in states will have cuts in the amount of funding available for students with disability that are completely buried within these aggregate figures that the minister often talks about. And, if at the end of the day, the Senate chooses to go down that path, we will need an independent resourcing body to help us understand the outcomes of that approach so that, if we do need to revisit them, if we do need to redress them, we have accurate, reliable information. 


This is a very important discussion, and I am quite pleased to see the number of senators who have remained to listen and consider this factor. I suspect—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  We are not listening!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Well, we know you're not! I suspect that this issue will end up being considered in a bit more detail tomorrow now, given that it is almost midnight. I think Senator Xenophon might want to make a contribution at this point, so I will leave the remaining time for him.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (23:56):  I was listening to Senator Collins' contribution and I am grateful for it. I just wanted to speak to the actual amendment and I think I might ask some questions of the minister in relation to the amendment, notwithstanding that it is Senator Hanson-Young's amendment. I just want to ask the minister about matters relating to it within the context of the amendments and in the context of this bill.


I will set them out in this way: in respect of subclause (1), is it the case that the national schools resourcing board can conduct a review on its own initiative—and does it have those inherent powers, or is it something that must be approved by the minister? The second question is: in terms of the review board publishing information and statements in subclause (3) of the amendment, are there any inherent powers now for the review board to publish information without having a specific authority as envisaged by this amendment? 


These are genuine questions about how it would work from the minister's perspective—and of course these are matters that I can also put to Senator Hanson-Young. I just want to understand what the government's position is about those two issues and, in the remaining two minutes and three seconds, I would be grateful if I could get an answer or it might be something the minister may want to take on notice until tomorrow.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (23:58):  I will do my best. So, Senator Xenophon, in relation to your question specific to the amendments from Senator Hanson-Young and the Australian Greens, the government is predisposed to supporting amendments (1) and (2) but not amendment (3). We acknowledge that there may be some benefit in having clarity for such a board to be able to initiate reviews of its own initiative and so would not oppose that. 


We do believe that already the provisions, as Senator Hanson-Young acknowledged, of paragraph (10) part 10 of our substantive amendment in relation to the national school resourcing board do already provide for publication of that via distribution to Education Council, the ministerial council, the non-government representative bodies and of course, ultimately, tabling within the parliament. 




Senator Xenophon:
  Was that the FOI?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Documents of the board would be documents that could be FOIed, Senator Xenophon, and indeed, as I think we have had some discussions elsewhere, they could also be asked to appear at Senate estimates.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (19:20):  I am pleased that we have been able to commence with the minister with us now, so that I can get directly to some very important points. I do not have the precise time, but very, very recently the government tabled some amendments. My first question to the minister will be: is this it? Are these all the amendments that are due to appear, or is there a further sheet of amendments that is yet to arrive? The reason that I ask that question is that there has been so much speculation about what this debate may involve, and so little real information. There was even the question I asked earlier to the minister after question time about the order of production of documents. That was due, eventually, to be tabled, but that regular process was interrupted by the lengthy debate around the hours motion as we dealt with our concerns about the fact that we were being asked to establish hours to deal with this debate, without even an understanding of what the matter was before us. I have raised this same point with senators who have been involved in some discussions with the government . I will be very specific, because I know the minister needs us to be very specific on these issues. So far we have circulated for the government GX158, GX160 and GX167. 


Obviously, we have had very little time to analyse those, but, on a very cursory analysis, they certainly do not seem to be the full monty. There are many other issues, including faster transition arrangements for government schools to reach better funding levels—although still, quite probably, not anywhere near the student resource standard, because there is no capacity to commit states in this process—but the full monty I am referring to here is this supposed moratorium that has been canvassed. What is unclear is what that moratorium actually relates to. Figures were circulated in the press overnight, and this seems to be the government's preferred mode of operating: 'Let's leak stories into the press rather than provide the public or the parliament with adequate information to assess a matter.' Overnight we saw stories, and the first one suggested, if I recall correctly, a one-year accommodation that was worth $62 million. Then today there was another story circulating, talking about an accommodation that was worth $50 million. So the crux of the matter, minister, is: what is the real deal? I am hoping that, rather than at midnight tonight or midnight tomorrow night, we might actually get to a stage of understanding what is in this bill. 


So, what is the real deal and, of course, what is a special deal? That is a particular question that I would like the minister to answer, because, for even longer than the last seven weeks—if you go back to the lead-up of his campaign, going to his two case studies before the ministerial council—he has been telling us that he was going to have a consistent standard across Australia: his pure, one-size-fits-all model. That is what was going to be going forward, and then any other arrangements that might have been put in place under Gonski 1 involved special or, as I have quoted before—the former minister, Christopher Pyne—special dirty deals.


Well, now the government is back-pedalling, it seems. Maybe some of my colleagues on the other side, such as Senator Back, have been able to convince the government that they were never special deals. But special deals is what the minister has told us consistently. It is what he told us through estimates. It is what he has told us in answers to questions in this place time and time again. And it seems, according to the media that has been circulating—because that is all we really have to operate by—that what he previously couched as special deals are no longer special deals.


Now, I do not take credit myself. I know we have been pointing out to the government for some time now why certain matters were structured in certain ways, why there was a need for a review of the SES model and how indeed it was Mr Gonski's review that recommended that it should occur somewhat urgently. And time and time again the minister has argued otherwise. Indeed, we even had to have a correction from the department, because they tied themselves in knots trying to defend this minister on the fraudulent claims that were being made about the SES measure. So, the department tried to argue in the committee inquiry into this bill that indeed the SES measure had been adjusted and revised. That reflected earlier public comments that the minister had made in the media—or at least that he was reported as having made; maybe it was a spokesman. But at that point in time the government was arguing that it had been revised. And we know that was false. We know that the department needed to make a correction and that whilst they did not ultimately admit the consequence of that correction, the consequence was that the minister's claims were wrong; the SES measure had not been adjusted in the way that was claimed. It had never been taken down to the mesh blocks that had been suggested in the Gonski review, and that work still was urgently required.


Of course we have also heard the minister claiming that the Gonski review did not recommend that, until such time as that urgent review of the SES model occurred, systems should still be assessed as systems and a system weighted average calculation should continue to apply. No: instead, what this minister did in this bill was remove that arrangement, call it a special deal—even though it was an arrangement recommended very clearly in the Gonski review—and then, secondly, make further changes to the capacity to contribute arrangements for non-government primary schools. And remember, this is not a special deal for Catholics here; this was an arrangements for all school systems.


That is why in the committee inquiry—glossed over in the government's report—there were Lutherans, Anglicans and a range of other school systems saying that the impact of these changes was going to damage them as well. So while the minister is standing up there saying that there is growth for—as an example—independent schools, the 4.7 per cent over 10 years, what that glosses over is that there are school systems within even independent schools that were losing out over these changes. What is even worse is that this minister had in place a 10-year transition, he would have you believe. The capacity to contribute changes and the system weighted average changes were going to impact in full in 2018—in full, no transition, no accommodation. We have been told by the systems that have been asking this question—contrary to the non-answer that I got in the legislation inquiry—that systems have been told they would have no access to the adjustment funds. Perhaps that is the second question that the minister could clarify. Will systems have access to the transition adjustment funds, or is it designed specifically for another special group? But, of course, we do not have special groups, or so the minister would have us believe, now that he has done yet another backflip on how he is proceeding here. 


So the next question that I would have related to that one is: what will happen, if, indeed, we do eventually see amendments—or maybe they are in front of me and I have not been able to digest them properly yet—that do adjust the system weighted average arrangements and that do deal with the capacity to contribute measure? If we do revert back to the full existing model arrangements, as some media commentary has suggested—and maybe for the purposes of these discussions I will call that the 'full Monty moratorium'—if we do get a full Monty moratorium, what will happen to systems such as the Anglican system? I cannot recall which state, but there is one system that has been seeking the minister to acknowledge them as a system. I have been told they have been waiting for 12 months. So, Senator Back, here is an interesting example of a case at point. We have a system that had an application before the minister to be recognised as a system, like their brothers and sisters in other states, and the minister refused to act upon it. He can correct me if my information is not accurate, but where does that system sit now? Are they inside or outside? Is it the full Monty moratorium, or is it something less? If it is something less, then what is the impact of not fully preserving the arrangements that Gonski recommended should be put in place? That is one question. 


The next question is, as I have said: what about schools that are wanting to operate as systems? There are actually some educational benefits for encouraging and facilitating schools to operate as systems, not only issues like economy of scale but also issues like improving pedagogy and a range of other factors that we know work better. Indeed, that is why the Grattan Institute has been telling us for decades that there are very good things about how low-fee Catholic systemic schools operate. They produce very good outcomes, and that is why I am pleased that Senator Back has been fighting to preserve their capacity to continue to operate in that fashion. Why on earth, under a claim of 'We're going to improve Australian education for Australian school children', would we attack or compromise what we know works? 


I will be listening intently to the minister when he is able to answer: do we have the full Monty moratorium? Does it include both the system weighted average arrangements that currently exist? And does it remove from this bill the capacity to contribute changes that we know are going to be so damaging to parish Catholic primary schools, amongst others? There are Lutheran schools and Anglican schools. They have all told us the same thing. So when the minister has a chance to answer that and direct me to the precise provisions in the amendments that have only just been circulated, I will be very pleased to see those. 


Before I go into a range of other matters, I will return to how proposed changes might impact on government schools, because that is probably the most fundamental principle here—the funds that will not flow to Australian public schools and that will not ensure that Australian public schools get anywhere near the government's student resource standard.


The point that I have been making consistently over the last day or so is the point that the shadow minister has been making in the House as well. This is what is missed by most of the commentators that say, 'Oh, but there is more money here.' It is the proportion of that money that goes to public schools that is the issue here. That is the fundamental issue about why Gonski 2.0 is not a real Gonski. We have ended up with a situation under Gonski 2.0—it may be adjusted, and that is a further question for the minister—where only 50 per cent of the additional money goes to public schools, whereas under Gonski 1.0, 80 per cent of it did. Indeed, we have a settlement across all sectors about that. (Time expired)

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (19:38):  The minister sought leave to move a certain number of amendments together. No, Minister, I am not being deliberately obstinate at this point in time, but I have just, as an example, asked you a range of questions. You have not responded to any of those; you have just sought to dive into amendments that have only just been circulated. I have already made the point that they have not yet been able to be digested. I asked you in my questions if you could please take me to the amendments that deal with some particular issues as part of the opening stage of this committee stage and you have not done so. So why on earth, if you cannot even conduct a regular committee stage debate where we deal with general matters first, would I be standing here agreeing to particular clusters?


There are two things that need to be dealt with before the opposition will reach an understanding of what clusters we are prepared to proceed with. One of those is that we have had time to digest your amendments. The second one, of course, is that we have a coherent running sheet that reflects those amendments. Until such time as that is before us—it is not obstinacy, Minister. You might have had these amendments in front of you, potentially, for 12 months, if I consider the question I asked you about Anglican systems. You might have known what your agenda is for 12 months, but this parliament, this Senate, has only just been provided with these amendments. Indeed, I think Senator Hanson-Young was still looking for the amendments. So, no; we will not, at this point in time, be discussing the order in which we will proceed through amendments, not until we have had an opportunity to digest them and not until we have a coherent running sheet that reflects them. You do not even know what a running sheet is, do you?—by the look on your face.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (19:42):  I will explain again for the minister. He circulated a running sheet whilst I was on my feet. Frankly, it is impossible, Minister, to digest anything while you are on your feet, making a contribution in the chamber. You might not understand that, but I think the public at large would have a pretty sensible idea that that is the case. So that is one point.


The second point is we have not long had your amendments, and I think everyone in this chamber, including Senator Back, is still trying to digest what is there. You have not answered my question yet about whether there are any more whether this is it.



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  This is it, is it? Okay.



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  No, I did not hear you say that, Minister. But, again, given that all of us started the day and meetings at around eight o'clock this morning and we are now in here approaching eight o'clock at night, I am not surprised that I did not comprehend part of what you might have put. That does not override the critical issue here, which is that we will have a general discussion about this bill and about the amendments that will hopefully allow us some time to digest what has very, very recently been circulated.


The minister, at the start of this committee stage contribution, got up and gave a general presentation about his views of the world and how he regretted that he did not have the opportunity in the second reading debate to close the debate. Well, that was your own colleague who did that, Senator Birmingham, and there were indeed other senators who would have taken the opportunity to make a second reading contribution. And I think, by virtue of senator Cormann's conduct, you will find that those same senators have some issues that they want to address in this committee-stage consideration. So I would not anticipate that you will be getting to dealing with amendments in detail for a little while yet.


You were denied the opportunity to make a contribution, as were a number of other senators. You brought on this debate in a way that you had not given the Senate notice of. You commenced this bill as the first bill this morning rather than as it has had been advertised, as the second for the day. Other senators had commitments. Indeed, if I recall correctly, Senator McKenzie did not get here to speak at the allocated time on the running sheet. She did not get here, because she had another commitment. Well, indeed, several of my colleagues did as well.


So, you will need to understand that we will not be moving from the general discussion in the committee stage phase until we are ready. When we are ready—it is not obstinacy, but when we are ready—I will be able to give you an understanding of what clusters we are happy to proceed with, and we will move through this committee stage consideration in an orderly manner. But we are not going to be rushed. We are not going to be hoodwinked. We are not going to be presented with more fantasy figures that you cannot justify. We will hold this government to account, and we will challenge you when you are trying to pull the wool over any particular senator's eyes. We will ensure that your moratorium is exposed if it is not the full monty. We will ensure that the other arrangements of your agreements stand up to scrutiny. You can go behind closed doors. You can fail to provide the information that you should, consistently, time and time again. You can hoodwink the crossbench into agreeing to an inadequate legislation inquiry that is rushed when it does not need to be, that is pushed through this Senate in a fashion that should not occur. You can—sometimes—get away with those things. But at the end of the day you need to come into this chamber and face the opposition.


So no, we will not be rushed. Yes, we will look closely at these amendments that you have only just circulated. We will match them against the selective leaking of stories in the media that has occurred over the last couple of days. We will challenge those senators who believe they have a particular deal, that the deal actually does stand up to scrutiny. And I am sure the Greens will do the same. They know what this government has been offering in their discussions better than we do, and I am sure they will be taking some considerable time to ensure that what we are dealing with here are the facts. So no, Senator Birmingham. We will not be moving to a discussion about the detail of your first amendment until all of those other issues have been addressed and indeed until we have more adequate answers to the general questions that I have already asked and that I am sure many of my colleagues will want to ask, too.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (19:47):  I do not think I could articulate the arguments from our side any better than Senator Collins, but I do have some questions, because I have been inundated with calls and emails from concerned parents and teachers around Tasmania and around the country. And they are not just from Catholic schools, as was asserted earlier today when I was making a contribution, but also from the state school system and from the Anglican schools. People are very concerned, because so many mixed messages have been sent out by this government. But we do know—there is one thing that is very clear, as far as we know, standing here right now—that this government plans to take away $22 billion from Australian children.


But I do think it is important to actually try to gather some information, because during question time today the minister was saying things about those on this side who were asking questions—that it is why we need to put more emphasis on education, because we on this side cannot add up. Well, quite frankly, it is not us that are having the problem with the figures; it is this government and this minister. We have already established, through question time today, that Lauriston Girls' School in Melbourne, which has fees for its primary school of up to $27,000, is now set to get seven times the funding increase of other primary schools. One in particular that was mentioned today was Anula Primary School in Darwin. I ask the minister: how is that fair?


I also want to talk about some schools that I visited in Tasmania, and I will get to that in a moment. But first I want to ask you, Minister, because you were very diligent in avoiding answering the question when it was raised by Senator Brown, about the cut in funding for children with disabilities who get assistance through our Tasmanian education system: how can a cut not be a cut? Also, can you provide the figure for the funding they currently receive and the funding they will receive through this bill, if it gets passed. 


If it gets passed it will be because of the dirty deals you have done with those people on the crossbenches. You have done a deal with Senator Hanson, who made outrageous comments in relation to children with disabilities in our state primary and high schools throughout this country. Senator Hanson is the senator from Queensland who will never stand up for a school like the Holy Spirit Catholic School in Townsville, which does a fantastic job. Yet, you, as the education minister, are sidling up to Pauline Hanson and her party to get your dirty deal through at the cost of children with disabilities in this country, despite her outrageous comments. I find that grossly offensive. I think you will find, if you look in the media—if you go on any social media site—that your reputation has been greatly tarnished by that issue alone.


What is the impact on Tasmanian schools as a whole? How many children are going to be impacted by these savage cuts? Can you explain to the Senate what this government's modelling is based on, so that I can go back to my constituents and try to explain to them. How many classrooms are going to lose valuable resources? Can you tell me, if we break it down into Catholic schools in Tasmania, what the actual cut to the Catholic schools will be, because I want to know whether or not their figures match up with yours. 


We know that you have not even been able to provide accurate data to your own caucus, and that you are telling some members of your caucus one thing and something quite different to others. Who knows what you have been telling the crossbenchers in trying to get their support for your grubby deal! How do Tasmanian schools fair in comparison with the King's School in Sydney? The King's School is a private school, which from the figures we have seen is going to have their funding increased dramatically. I want you to be able to explain to me why Tasmanian children are going to have to pay the price so that you can look after your friends in the top end of town. 


I also want to look at some specific schools that I have visited. I know about the great work that they are doing at some of the most disadvantaged schools in our community. Can you please tell me what the impact on the Youngtown Primary School will be. That school does wonderful things. I am not sure if Senator Bushby, who is here, has even bothered to visit any schools in Launceston. I know he is supposedly moving his office to Launceston, but we have not heard him make any contribution at all in this debate. So I want you to explain to me, so that Senator Bushby can understand, what the impact is going to be on the Youngtown Primary School.


Mayfield Primary School has been recognised nationally over the years for the wonderful work that they have done in an area of great disadvantage. Their teachers have been acknowledged at a national level. They believe this change is going to have a huge impact on their ability to look after their community. Can you explain to me how much extra money they are going to get? Then there is Port Dalrymple School down in George Town. Can you explain to me if their funding is going to increase, and, if so, by how much, or why those children, who are from families who need all the support they can get to ensure their children have a good education, are going to be disadvantaged and their teachers lose money and resources?


The Friends' School in Hobart—that's right, it is one of your favourite ones; it is a private school—are going to significantly increase their money. Can you please explain to me and justify why The Friends' School will get more money? I do not have a problem with private schools at all; it should be about choice. Many families do make a choice to invest in their children's education. It is just very unfortunate that this government sees education as a cost rather than an investment. Minister, can you explain to the chamber why The Friends' School in Hobart, a well-funded private school that provides a good education, gets an increase when Norwood Primary School, Sacred Heart Primary School, West Launceston Primary School, Mayfield Primary School, Youngtown Primary School and East Launceston Primary School are going to lose out in this education bill?


I was wondering too if you can tell me what the impact will be on the Launceston Preparatory School, a small private school in Launceston that does an absolutely wonderful job for its students. Can you explain it to me and give us the figures? After all, Minister, you are the one who was saying that we in the opposition have not been able to add up. I think you said 'we should all go back to school' or something; I do not want to verbal you, but you made some trite comment. I would be most interested in the figures. I just do not get it. You have met with various sections within the education sector and they have asked you to go back to the drawing board and ensure that there is real fairness in this bill. We on this side have urged you to withdraw and redraft the bill so that it can get support. But you have failed to do that. You are hell-bent on moving forward—and who knows what dirty deals you have done. Perhaps you can now let us know.


I have not had the opportunity to see the amendments that are being proposed, but I am really interested. I know that my constituency of Tasmania wants to know—whether it is the public schools, the Anglican schools or the Catholic schools—what is fair in this bill that is going to ensure that Tasmanian schools are not going to be worse off. We know Tasmania has the second-lowest amount of funding in the country. At the same time, Senator Bushby, Senator Duniam and the President, Senator Parry, are not saying anything about the impact of this bill and the cuts to Tasmania. The only senator on the government side who has raised concerns is Senator Abetz. Unfortunately, for personal reasons, he cannot be here this week. But he has spoken up. Not one of the others has spoken up. Is this punishment for the Tasmanian community because they voted the incompetent Liberal House of Representatives members for Bass, Lyons and Braddon out of parliament? Is this another attempt by Mr Turnbull and this government to punish Tasmania? That is what it seems like to me. And it is not just me who thinks that way. The Tasmanian community are fed up with this government. Ever since 2 July, when they got rid of those three amigos out of Tasmania—mind you, they have all landed plum jobs provided by this government—they have known; and this piece of legislation is just another move by this government to show how arrogant you are, how out of touch you are and that you just do not understand the word 'fairness'.


Minister, I am looking forward to your explanation so that I can go to my community and try and explain to them the dirty deals you have done. Perhaps you could enlighten us—I think you have the obligation to do that in this place—of the deals you have done and put in place with people like the Pauline Hanson party. We would like to know what it is that you have promised them. Have you got something in writing for them? Is Senator Back going to ride off into retirement and be happy? Have you actually done a deal for the Catholic Education Commission in this country? We want to know, and we have a right to know. From what I have been hearing around this building over the last couple of days, there are all sorts of rumours going around. What have you done to make sure that people like Mr Abbott do not undermine the Prime Minister yet again in the media. If I were him, I would use this, because he knows, like I know, that the parents of Australian kids, whether those kids are in a state school, a private school or a Catholic school, are not going to forget the way they have been treated. You have taken them for granted.


What is it when the Catholic Education Commission meets with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education and Training? What a badge of honour that would be: to say that you are the worst minister for education in five decades and a Prime Minister who has failed to consult with his minister, the one charged with this responsibility. This is a huge investment from any government into education and the government has failed to consult and talk to those people who deliver more than just education in their communities. As I have said before in this place, Catholic parishes set up schools where they are needed to provide not only education but also support for the entire family. This government is so arrogant—and who knows what else is going on in the civil war in the dysfunctional government that this is. 


Minister, I will draw you back to the schools that I would like some answers about tonight—that is, the Tasmanian schools and the overall lack of funding that is in this bill for them. They are not going to be any better off. Some of that money will never reach the schools which you have alluded to over the course of this week. I would like you tell us what the impact is going to be on Tasmanian schools, broken down into public schools, Catholic, schools, Anglican schools and those private schools I have mentioned. I, along with many people who will be listening to this broadcast, will be very interested to see how you try and justify the sort of dirty deal that you have obviously done during the course of the last 48 hours.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (20:02):  I am happy to inform the senator that, in relation to the Tasmanian school systems, funding for the government system in Tasmania is estimated to be $183 million in 2017. That will steadily grow under the proposal put forward by the government each and every year to $261 million by 2027. That, of course, is funding that would be used to fund a number of the schools that you referenced in your remarks.


In relation to the Catholic education system in Tasmania, their forecast funding in 2017 is $149 million. That is estimated to grow to $226 million by 2027. In relation to independent schools or independent school systems within Tasmania, under the government's proposal they are forecast to receive $76 million in 2017 and that is forecast and estimated to steadily grow to $107 million by 2027. All of them by 2027, under the legislation for the bill before the parliament, would have their share of funding calculated according to the same consistent needs based formula as any other either government school system in the country or non-government school authority in the country. It will be applied in an entirely consistent manner. 


If we are not going to proceed in an orderly way, as is the normal custom of the committee, and instead we are going to be subjected to stalling tactics and filibustering speeches, then I shall—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  No, he's not going to answer your questions.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I did just answer the questions. I move:


That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:


(2) Schedule 1, item 16, page 7 (line 26), omit paragraph 35B(4)(c), substitute:


(c) for the purposes of the operation of paragraphs (a) and (b) in relation to 2017:


   (i) the Commonwealth share for each school were 100%; and


   (ii) the SRS funding amount for a primary student were $10,576; and


   (iii) the SRS funding amount for a secondary student were $13,290; and


   (iv) the SES score for each school were the score for the school for 2018; and


   (v) the maximum size loading for a primary school were $166,790; and


   (vi) the maximum size loading for a secondary school were $266,864; and


   (vii) the starting amount for a primary school were $11,119; and


   (viii) the starting amount for a secondary school were $22,239.




Statement of reasons: why certain amendments should be moved as requests



Section 53 of the Constitution is as follows:




Powers of the Houses in respect of legislation



53. Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law.


The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.


The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.


The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications.


Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.




GX160, amendment (8)



The effect of this amendment is to change the basis for calculating funding for certain schools under the Australian Education Act 2013. It is covered by section 53 because this will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 126 of the Act.




Consequential amendments



The following amendments on GX160 are consequential on the amendment mentioned above: (1) to (7), (9) to (15).




GX167, amendment (2)



The effect of this amendment is to change the basis for calculating funding for certain schools under the Australian Education Act 2013. It is covered by section 53 because this will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 126 of the Act.




Consequential amendments



There are no amendments on GX167 that are consequential on the amendment mentioned above.




Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017



SHEET GX167


Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000




Amendment (2)



This amendment will change the basis for calculating funding for certain schools under the Australian Education Act 2013, having the effect of increasing expenditure under the Act. This will increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under the standing appropriation in section 126 of the Act.


The Senate has long followed the practice that an amendment which ""clearly, necessarily and directly"" increases expenditure under an appropriation is regarded as an increase in a charge or burden on the people within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution (Odgers' Australian Senate Practice, 14th edition, p. 412). On the basis that this amendment would result in increased expenditure under the standing appropriation in the Act, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that this amendment be moved as a request.


This is a technical request that ensures that there is no ambiguity in relation to the calculation of the starting Commonwealth share for schools and that the amounts of funding, both in base terms and in loading terms, accurately and clear reflect the notional application of the needs based funding model in 2018 and in 2017 dollar terms to provide for accurate funding.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (20:05):  I would draw the minister back to the question. If you are talking about a collective of the funding going to Tasmania, I clearly asked you to explain to the Senate, so I can explain to my constituents, why they are getting cuts. They are not getting the resources that they want, as opposed to somewhere like Kings College. Why is there more money going to the Friends' School in Hobart than what there is for the schools that are highly in need of these resources? In fact, they need additional money in places like Mayfield, Youngtown and Norwood Primary School. Why can't you provide those figures for us here tonight? If you are really serious about wanting to have support, you should be able to come in here and justify the allocation of funds that are being taken away from Tasmanian kids to give to the top end of town.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (20:06):  Chair, I just provided very clearly for the senator the growth rates in estimated funding for each of the different systems in Tasmania, demonstrating, that contrary to her claims, there are no cuts. There is in fact growth across each of those different parts of the school system in Tasmania. Of course, the senator knows full well that the history in relation to school funding in Australia is that public schools are largely funded by the state government, as is their constitutional responsibility and history; and that non-government schools have historically be largely funded by the Commonwealth government. 


A result of the proposals that the Turnbull government is putting in place is that public education, government schools in the state system, will receive a record level of support from the Commonwealth government. We will ensure that 20 per cent of the schooling costs across all of those different systems will be funded by the Commonwealth government. That is an increase from the current estimate of around 17 per cent. You do not have to go back too many years to get down to 13 per cent—in fact just around the time that this government was elected—and not too many years prior to that you will find that it was in single digit territory. So there will be record levels of support for government schools in Tasmania, as there will be record levels of support for government schools across every jurisdiction. It will be calculated according to the same consistent needs based formula across all of those different jurisdictions, ensuring that, regardless of state boundaries, we do not play favourites to one state over another and that we actually have an application of a fair, consistent funding model.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (20:08):  Minister, there are a number of questions that have already been raised by my colleagues on this side of the chamber with regard to the special deals that you said you were not going to make that you are going to make, and the deals that you said were not happening that are happening. We still do not have any clear answer from you in response to the first set of questions that were asked by Senator Collins. They went to the heart of matters of great concern in the community, which is to do with the system weighted average. Minister, I am sure that you have had significant lobbying from genuinely concerned parents across the country in every single sector. In fact, one thing I would count as an achievement is that you have managed to upset everybody in the government school system, everybody in the Catholic school system and a whole lot of people in the independent school system as well. One of the things that you have failed to answer is anything of detail that will give people any confidence at all that you might be telling them something approaching the truth.


The questions that Senator Collins asked earlier I will reiterate in perhaps a less eloquent way. I have to emphasise the importance of the need for you to answer these questions in this general debate before we can possibly move to a more detailed discussion of the very important papers that have landed here in the Senate this evening but have not landed until the twelfth hour, so much is your disdain for making yourself available for the proper scrutiny of this Senate. I think you are even more concerned about getting out of here with this bill under your belt, because you do not want the scrutiny of the community at all, particularly those who are educated.


Minister, I draw your attention to Senator Collin's questions for very clear explanations about the nature of the so-called moratorium that is some part of a stitched up deal that I do not think is anywhere in writing because nobody has been to be able provide it. There have been plenty of requests being sent around the country—all over the place: what is going on? What is the moratorium? What does it look like? People are asking these questions around the country this afternoon and tonight, and this is our chance to get a decent answer from you. Minister, if you have a bit of information on a bit of paper, that would be lovely. We are happy to receive pieces of paper at the last minute, clearly, or we would not be dealing with this process in this way. Just give us the bit of paper that explains your supposed deal that is the moratorium. What we want to know is, in this moratorium, what are you actually doing with the system weighted average that is going to impact on every single school in a system? What is the status of your response to the concerns about the capacity to contribute? When and in what way are you going to implement this moratorium around those two critical factors? Does the moratorium remove the capacity to contribute the dilemma that absolutely exists? It has been very well articulated by the Catholic system. 


We could have avoided getting to this place, if, before you had made your big announcement with the fanfare on that Monday, you had actually taken phone calls from peak representative groups that wanted to discuss these details with you. They approached in good faith. I do not know what would make them think that that was a reasonable thing to do, but they did approach you in good faith, seeking the opportunity to share their deep, rich and long understanding of their system, to share their deep commitment to the education of children in systems. They wanted to have you understand that, and they were ready to talk to you. But you completely ignored that, Minister. Now there is this hasty retreat of some sort that is as yet unknown to us and that is being attempted to be stitched up perhaps as we speak. 


I am going to give Senator Back some congratulations on his efforts to stand up for the Catholic system. Because I did not make a contribution during the valedictory speeches yesterday, I want to acknowledge now that the time I spent on the education committee in the last parliament with Senator Back was a time when I absolutely could understand his commitment to education. He was in defence mode for the Abbott government, which said that there should be absolutely no money going to schools. So he had a difficult job to do. But when we went to Western Australia and to Perth for a day of hearings, I could tell the integrity that he had in his dealings with people in that state. People who came to put their concerns about that version of the legislation said that Senator Back had served particularly Catholic education in Western Australia very, very well and that he had a deep and rich understanding of that sector. So my hopes and the hopes of 25 per cent of the children who attend schools around this country in the Catholic education system—25 per cent in the nation—all hang on whether or not Senator Back has in his departure from the Senate been able to save the country from the worst excesses of a deal that has been described as the worst in 50 years. 


So what has Senator Back actually got out of this greedy government—this government that acts with such disdain—for the expertise of education authorities around this country? What did he get out in terms of the funds and the impact on the SRS? What has actually been achieved with regard to that? 


I am delighted that I get to ask one particular question, and I genuinely hope for an answer. Instead of accepting Gonski's recommendations that the sectarian wars that have led to so much inequity across our schools should end, that both state and federal governments should in partnership take responsibility for the excellent education of all students in all systems, instead of looking towards that vision of a fair sharing of resources between state and federal governments to make sure all Australians get their opportunity to learn, this government has gone in a direction that takes us away from unity, it has gone in a direction that takes us away from shared responsibility and it has taken us away from a focus on ensuring equal opportunity for children who are born into different states and into families who are choosing different systems. So why, Minister, instead of accepting that shared responsibility, which was so much a part of the report delivered by David Gonski, have you moved to an arbitrary decision to give SRS support of 80 per cent to Catholic and independent schools and only 20 per cent to children in government schools? 


One thing that I absolutely know and I think is completely indisputable is that children do not choose their parents. They arrive, and they do not have any choice about where their parents are going to send them to school. I do not think it is unreasonable to believe that every child born in Australia today should be able in six years time to walk through the gate of any school in the country, whether it is Catholic, independent or government, or city regional, rural or remote—anywhere in the country. We have had the opportunity to deliver funding that would have allowed equitable experience of education, but instead, Minister, you have chosen this 80-20 model. 


Where is the research? Where is the background documentation that says that that is the way to go forward? It is certainly nowhere in the recommendations of the Gonski panel. We can call it Gonski 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 or 5.0, and with greater numeracy education I suppose we can go on to infinity; we can call it whatever number we like—but it is not truthful, it is not fair and it is not responsible for delivering equitable education access for every Australian. For people who are listening to this debate and going. 'Oh, my God, it is just so confusing', it is confusing, as Senator Collins says—it is very confusing. It is actually so confusing that I think Stephen Elder, from the Catholic Education Commission in Victoria, has had members of the coalition ring him up asking him to explain to them what is going on. 


This government have made an absolute mishmash of this. Gonski 2.0 is not what they are trying to make it out to be. It is a tool for delivering sector-entrenching discriminatory education experiences for Australian children. I am a senator for New South Wales and I am very concerned about my state—and I will have some questions about that—but Minister tell me I am wrong, prove to me I am wrong, when I say that students in the Northern Territory in government schools who are already behind are going to stay behind. They going to stay behind because you are not addressing the reality that that government school system needs an awful lot more than the 20 per cent of the SRS that you are going to offer to give those children a chance. Minister, explain to me and all the teachers of this country, explain to me and all the parents of children in this country, how it is fair to give the same proportion to states and overlook the fact that there are incredibly differentiating needs amongst those children in the states.


Australians who elected those opposite in 2013 were sold a message that there would be a funding match dollar for dollar. They were misled then. And the lie that was on those blue-and-white-striped posters that everybody saw as they walked in was so disingenuous that it did not even have a little asterisk at the bottom that said, 'But we won't be giving you years 5 and 6.' It did not even say that. So at this juncture, four years down the track, why should the Australian people trust you now, when you failed so badly then? Why should senators on this side, who absolutely believe in equitable access to funding for all children in all systems, believe that the legislation that you are pushing through this house with unseemly haste is actually going to address any of those inequities that were in fact the driver of the research that was undertaken by Mr David Gonski and his team? 


Prove it to me, Minister. Show me the figures. Help me understand. Answer the questions. Where did 80-20 come from? What is the deal that you have done—hopefully, well negotiated by Senator Back but still unseen by anybody in the sector that I have been in touch with? Show us the paper. Show us the money! Show the 25 per cent of Australian students in Catholic schools that they are not going to get done over in the next 12 months by this little deal that you have stitched up in the last day.


The reason we ended up with the report that we got from Mr Gonski, and the recommendation that he and his team put together—which was fair funding for every child in every single school, with additional loadings on top of that SRS evening out for disability, for indigeneity, for small and country schools, for low SES and non-English-speaking backgrounds—is that their experience of seeing Australian schools across this country was eye opening. I remember reading reports saying they could not believe that they had gone to schools where the resourcing was so totally inadequate that they were surprised that any learning at all could happen. 


At the heart of all of this, it is not a game of politics. It is about the capacity to create an environment in which the young people of our country, whom I consider to be our greatest asset, can learn—where teachers do not have to ask the P&F to fundraise to be able to buy $10,000 worth of school readers so that children in kindergarten and first class can have a book that is not dog-eared and falling apart, and actually learn to read. That is the kind of resourcing that I want for schools. I do not want primary school teachers to have to choose two, out of six kids who need Reading Recovery, because that is all they can afford, damning the other four to lost opportunities for learning. 


Explain to me, Minister, what you are doing and how it is going to work, because, frankly, I do not have any confidence in the numbers that you speak about, and neither the Catholic sector nor the government sector has any. Indeed, no-one who has interacted with you in this process actually believes you. Prove to it me, Minister. I would love to have some answers to my questions.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (20:23):  Senator O'Neill asked a few questions in relation to funding for the Northern Territory, which I did address during question time today. Very quickly, funding for the Northern Territory government school system is projected to grow from $191 million this year to $261 million by 2027. The senator asked a range of questions about the particularly high need in the Northern Territory, a fact which I acknowledged in question time today and a fact which is of course borne out by the fact that per-student funding in the Northern Territory is today the highest in the nation, at around $8,360, on average, per student. That will grow to around $11,870 per student by 2027. That is far and away the highest per-student funding in the country. In fact, it will be around 55 per cent more per student by 2027 than it will be in any other jurisdiction, reflective of their particular need.


The senator also asked about the original Gonski report and the views of the original Gonski panel on this legislation. I would draw the attention of the senator to the words of a number of individuals. Mr David Gonski said:


I'm very pleased to hear that the Turnbull government has accepted the fundamental recommendations of our 2011 report, and particularly regarding a needs based situation … I'm very pleased that there is substantial additional money, even over indexation and in the foreseeable future.


Fellow panel member Dr Ken Boston describes the legislation as 'a new deal of historic national importance' and says:


There are no grounds for opposition to the schools funding bill in principle … It will be a tragedy if the school funding bill is voted down in the Senate.


I would also highlight the comments of Ms Kathryn Greiner, another member of the Gonski panel, who says of the legislation and the policy:


I think they're on the moral ground. I think the decisions were right, I think the decisions are just.


She also says:


Gonski 2.0 delivers what the Gonski report wanted: an accountable, transparent, equitable, sector-blind funding formula.


Concerning responsibility for government school systems, I would highlight, Senator O'Neill, my response earlier to your colleague from Tasmania, where I identified that the Commonwealth share of funding to government school systems will indeed grow to a record level under these reforms, more than twice what it was not that many years ago.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (20:26):  I cannot let the minister's verballing continue in the way it has. I remind senators and others listening to this debate that the Gonski review panel involved two other members, and the minister has made no reference to their concerns with respect to this legislation. But the verballing of Mr David Gonski continues. Rather than stress the ways in which this minister has done that, I will segue into a press release from this evening, on which I will make another point in a moment. If we take it from the Nick Xenophon Team:


This is the REAL Gonski and we have three members of the original Gonski panel, including David Gonski himself, saying unambiguously it would be a disaster for Australian education if this package didn't pass.


David Gonski has never said that. David Gonski has said, with relief, that this government has accepted a principle of needs based funding, but Mr David Gonski has never endorsed the 80-20 approach or the Commonwealth-only approach to needs based funding, and to suggest otherwise is a blatant lie.


There are two other matters that I would like to deal with in this general discussion. The first of those, which I have raised I think now twice today, is the Senate's order for production of documents. The minister said to me after question time that he had submitted a letter in response to that order. Unfortunately, because the government has changed the arrangement for hours today, the tabling of that letter did not occur. Worse than that, the normal courtesy that would apply in a matter such as this—that the minister would furnish a copy of that material or correspondence to the senator who had originated that request—has not occurred. For this minister to come in here and claim that the opposition is being obstinate is just outrageous. He has not even followed basic courtesies of the Senate in relation to an order of the Senate for production of documents. This is not just the opposition; the whole Senate insisted that this minister provide that material by the end of yesterday, and he has not done so.


I can only second-guess at this stage what that letter might say. It might say, as some other colleagues have suggested to me, that there are no such documents. If that is the case, that raises very serious questions about the quality of the discussions that have occurred with the crossbenchers here. If the crossbenchers have not even seen modelling about moving forward from a ten-year transition and what that might really mean, that highlights what a farce has been occurring.


The other option, of course, is for the minister to argue that it is not in the public interest for that information to be made available. Maybe he has done that. We do not know that yet. We do not know what his answer to the Senate order has been, and, until such time as we do, it is not being obstinate to suggest that the minister should be answering reasonable questions and providing information to the Senate before we proceed into a detailed consideration of the amendments that we are indeed still digesting.


Beyond the order for production, though, I have to reflect again on this press release and its sheer audacity. It seems that by press release from the Nick Xenophon Team we can understand more about this package than the minister is telling us here and now. So let me inform the Senate what the Nick Xenophon Team tells us is 'the real Gonski win for Aussie schools'. Remember: they are anticipating a vote that has not even occurred yet. According to the Nick Xenophon Team, 'the real Gonski win for Aussie schools' is that the Nick Xenophon Team successfully advocated for:


Australian schools to receive $23.5 billion over the next 10 years ($4.9 billion above the Government's original plan)


So where is the modelling about what that will actually do? I hope the Nick Xenophon Team has actually seen it, because I would like to understand what that additional funding is going to do and what the impact of it will be. If the impact of it will be that schools like Kings get even more then we have got big problems. But let's wait and see. This debate might shed some further light on some of these issues.


The second dot point in this press release is:


Under-funded schools to reach funding targets in six years instead of 10.


Is that all of them? Is that some of them? What are the differences across states? Which ones? Hopefully, maybe, the Nick Xenophon Team can come in and tell us some of this, because the minister is not answering these questions.


The next dot point is:


National Schools Resourcing Board to be set up to review and improve the school funding methodology.


Hear, hear to that. I think that the Senate is united on that one, and the reason that the Senate is united on that one once we see the detail of what is being proposed here—hopefully, I can digest the detail in the government's amendments soon—is that we will know if it will save us from the school funding estimator debacle. We will not have a department politicised by you putting out material that is blatantly false. If we have an independent school resources board that can be responsible for the quality of the data that is circulated as it is on My School, for instance, and there is some independence in that process, given the way this minister has conducted himself, that will be a good thing. I have never seen as outrageous an exercise as the minister pretending to Australian parents that there will not be pressure on their school fees, because he has diddled his figures. He has diddled the figures for 2017. He has adjusted them to pretend that his new formula applies when it will never apply to 2017 to fool parents into believing that they get increases between 2017 and 2018 and to cover up the pressure for parents to pay school fees that he is introducing in this bill and as far as I can see still remain in this bill. Worse than that: he then went out and said Catholic education were basically rent-seekers, that they had a special case and they were only squawking because they were potentially going to lose their special deal. That is what this minister did, and he is still doing it if those capacity-to-contribute arrangements still exist in this bill.


But let's move on to the next point the Nick Xenophon Team tells us about:


There will be benchmarks for state and territory governments so that they pay their share of education funding.


Benchmarks for state government. Senator Back, in your valedictory speech you made a particular comment that I noted. I cannot remember the exact phrase but it was basically that a carrot is better than a stick. Gonski 1 involved a carrot for state governments. The carrot for state governments was that they would get an additional two Commonwealth dollars for each additional one state dollar to get all schools to a common Student Resource Standard. Now, this potential stick method will be debated for an awful long time in here because we are a long way from being satisfied that you have any reasonable capacity to deliver benchmarks for state and territory governments, so that they pay their share of education funding. You have already deferred these issues to COAG mid next year, so how you might have managed to hoodwink some relatively new members and senators into thinking you have got a better capacity will be very interesting to hear.


We already have the Nick Xenophon Team anticipating the vote and claiming they have a real Gonski win for Aussie schools. In reading this press release we can see that they are simply swallowing your verballing of a number of people in this debate. The verballing of David Gonski himself, I think, is the most outrageous. Now that that disease has spread from yourselves to the Nick Xenophon Team, it really does need to be called out.


I could go on through the two pages of this win that the Nick Xenophon Team is anticipating, but let me go to the more critical issue here, because there is one dot point they do not have, which is in an article written by Paul Osborne in The Australian this afternoon—I think it is online. It refers to a $50 million transition fund. Does that mean that we have four transition funds now. During the inquiry into the legislation we were told that there were three transition funds, but now, at least in the press but not in the Nick Xenophon Team win, we hear about this $50 million transition fund and it is described as being 'for Catholic and independent schools over 12 months'. So, is there a new $50 million transition fund? If so, where is it provided for? Is it in the amendments or is it provided for in some other way that we need to source? If there is such a fund, what are the terms of access to that fund? What is this $50 million meant to cover? Is it the 'partial-monty moratorium'; it is certainly not the 'full-monty moratorium'.


We have already read in the press today that Catholic Education, for instance, and probably the independent sector as well, have no confidence in this minister. So why would they have confidence about this $50 million transition fund, if it indeed exists? We should not really be having to ask these questions. The minister should have presented the full details of what is involved here. But if there is this fund, what are the terms for access to it?


I would like to use the opportunity of this committee-stage consideration to be very clear about this. We know from the legislation inquiry that there is already contention about independent schools and Catholic schools accessing the Students First Fund. We understand that, originally, the minister naively committed to independent schools that that would continue as it has been. Subsequently he told them, 'No, actually. We are going to go to a proportional break-up for access to that fund, because we are taking the system weighted average benefits away from systemic schools. So, no, you will not have the preferred arrangement that might previously have existed.' The independent sector, before the legislation inquiry, argued a very different story. They said that that fund was meant to help them deal with the fact that they do not have the benefits of operating as a system and that they should be able to preserve their existing arrangements for accessing it, which is roughly, I think, 60-40. Which is it, Minister?


This really is a moving feast. It is a dog's breakfast. We will wait to hear from you whether there is a $50 million transition fund. Is access to that fund going to be proportionate? Is it really only with respect to systems, is there some broader purpose for it or have you just rebadged the existing transition funds? What is the detail of what transition funds are going to be available? Surely you understand, coming in here today, Minister, that you need to add to what was covered in the legislation inquiry about the existing transition funds—the general one, the one for the ACT and the one for the Northern Territory—and tell us what this other transition fund for Catholic or independent schools might be and what it is meant to cover. I can see that the minister is not even listening to this very important question, which is very sad because it means that he thinks he has a done deal. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (20:41):  I am very, very keen to contribute to this debate. Can I start out by saying that my interest is in the education of children across the nation. In 2011 I instigated, with the authority of the Senate, a select committee inquiry into teaching and learning in Australia. On that committee, of course, was Senator Marshall, Senator Penny Wright and Senator McKenzie. This was at the time Gonski was being examined, and it was not an inquiry into the high-level Gonski macro. It was an inquiry into: why aren't teachers teaching and why aren't children learning?


We did a lot of good work on the selection of people going into teacher training; the quality of teacher training programs; the amount of practicum that they had in there; whether they were classed as ready, because we learnt that more than 50 per cent of new teachers were not ready; what the levels of mentoring were; what the involvement of parents was from the youngest age; professional development, of course; and teachers who were being asked to teach out of their level of expertise et cetera. Discipline was an incredibly important position.


At the same time, we visited China. We met with them in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu. Of course, I am familiar with the situation in Singapore and Finland. In each of those three jurisdictions student discipline in classrooms is not an issue, because the children are disciplined and the teachers teach. What was very interesting at that time was that, whilst money was important, we had doubled the expenditure of funds in our education system, yet our standards had gone down. I said to them in Shanghai, 'Maybe it's the nature of the international comparator that is being used.' They said, 'It was developed in Melbourne, so, if you're not happy with it, go back and have a look at it yourselves.'


I put on the record that I have a vital interest in the education of all children in this country. Also, I will just comment on the government-funding sector. I have no difficulty with the amendments as I have seen them in the legislation, because under the Constitution the teaching of children in government schools is a state responsibility. If, indeed, the minister is going to move to a commonality over time whereby the federal government contributes 20 per cent and the states contribute 80 per cent—and I can see that in the amendments there are provisions to make sure, whether it be government schools support or private schools support, that the state and territory governments continue to commit at least to that level—then I applaud that.


I now want to go to discussions relating to the Catholic education system, about which I have most experience. Also, in my time in this place, I have been particularly interested in the independent schools system and their contribution. I was on the Catholic Education Commission for nine years in the mid-eighties to the mid-nineties. I was on a country school board when this so-called concept of co-responsibility was first mooted. Of course, being from the bush, I immediately thought, 'This is a grab by the rich city schools against the country schools.' I then went to see the then head of Catholic Education, Dr Peter Tannock, whose name will come up again in a few minutes, and Mr Mike Beacham. I jumped up and down and carried on such treat that they said to me, 'The only way to shut you up and to have you understand that co-responsibility is about the wealthier schools supporting the poorer schools is to put you on the commission, and then you yourself can be the overall auditor.' So I became the parent member of the commission. I have even had somebody in email traffic to me in the last couple of days saying that I have a conflict of interest and I have been corrupt. How a parent member of the commission, who is there at a totally voluntary capacity, can be corrupt, I do not know. What I did come to learn, of course, was that the co-responsibility concept and the funding became critical.


I then moved to the board of Santa Maria College, where both my wife and daughter had been at school. I was about to call them 'old girls' but, as Senator Moore knows very well, you would never call them old girls—you would call them past students. Why I had to go onto the Santa Maria board, and not Linda, I will never know. Anyhow, there were only three schools that did not come aboard initially. One was Aquinas College, a Christian Brothers college, where I had been at school. The other one was Santa Maria, where I was on the board, and the third was John XXIII, which had been the Jesuits' St Louis and Loreto. I guess I had a bit of influence in those colleges coming on board.


What has been very interesting over time has been the absolute strength—I can speak with a lot of authority about Western Australia—I cannot speak much, although I have engaged in this process, as others know, in terms of the Senate inquiry, and I made it my business to spend a lot of time recently with the South Australians to understand it. There are a couple of points that I want people who might be listening to this conversation this evening to understand. I understand that my colleague Senator Hinch the other day said that I ought to get on my bike and leave because the only funding that ever should come from governments is to government schools. I want to comment on that.


The first point I want to make is—and maybe the independents are included in this—the cost of educating a child in a Catholic school in Australia is 90 per cent of that of educating a child in a government school. Remember that—90 per cent. The second point is that the Catholic system enjoys, as a benefit from the Commonwealth, which is vitally important, about the cost of the teachers' salaries. That is about the contribution that the Commonwealth pays to Catholic schools. But it is the parents, through fees and the co-responsibility system, that actually meet the balance of those costs. The day-to-day costs of running the school—the water, the electricity, the maintenance and all those other costs—are met by parents' fees. The next point I want to make is that where a child in a government school walks into a new school, that has been totally funded by the taxpayers of Australia, of whom many are the parents of Catholic children—remembering that 30 per cent of children in Catholic schools are not Catholic. That government school has been fully funded by government, whether it is state or federal. By contrast, 95 per cent of the capital cost of building Catholic schools in this country is paid by the parents. So Senator Hinch, if that is what you did say, be very pleased that Catholic parents and independent parents are paying up, because for everyone who is in a Catholic or independent school that capital cost of building the school, that extra 10 per cent of the cost of running the school and educating the child has been met by that Catholic or independent parent on top of paying their taxes.


When you think about the passion of it, think that in some of those schools, like St Benedict's in Applecross, where my children went to school, it is only last year that the last of the classrooms that were built by the parents in the 1950s under the direction of the builder Cyril Wildy were knocked down and replaced. So when I talk about a bit of passion, I remember bottle drives as a kid in Bunbury, I remember planting the lawn on the oval at the Marist Brothers in Bunbury on Saturdays and Sundays on our hands and knees. We were not praying and we were not getting any indulgences from upstairs, but I can tell you that if we wanted an oval we planted that oval. 


I want to make the point that that is how critically important all of this is. Co-responsibility supports poorer schools. You have heard these allegations that it is just a grab by the rich schools against the poor schools. In my state, under the current system weighted average every child in a Catholic school has a grading of 103, and more than 50 per cent of the funding supporting kids below the 103 comes from the kids above the 103.


Just a couple of small things. Rent in Karratha went to $2,400 a week. When it came to the state school, the state government just paid for the extra rent in rent support. When it comes to the Catholic school, how do you keep the teachers in the schools in Karratha? The co-responsibility fund pays for it. At Roxby, in South Australia, they had to provide a home for the principal. It cost them a million bucks. Could they go back to government and say, 'Look, it has cost us a million'? In South Australia, when electricity and water costs went up in recent times, the state schools were supported, but the Catholic education system pays for the middle. In the north of WA, in the Kimberley; in the Northern Territory, as Senator McCarthy would know; and in North Queensland there are many small communities where the only school is the Catholic school. If you close it, there is not a school. And who has the challenge then?


In Australia, choice has always been an element. One of the fears that I have—and it has been put to me—is that the very essence of the Catholic school system in this country has been the education of poor children. Mary MacKillop started in Penola. The Mercys came to Fremantle in January 1846, having come out of Tipperary in Ireland to the stinking January heat. Within 20 days, they were not only opening a school for girls but the first ever school for Aboriginal girls in Australia. That is the quality of the Catholic education system and that has to be preserved.


The last point I want to make before I go to specific questions is about transparency. We in this place, as lawmakers, need to know that every last dollar of taxpayers' money has been accounted for and has been spent on the purpose for which, quite rightly, the taxpayers of Australia have given it. I just want to make the point very strongly that that is an element that must continue.


I now want to come to the concept of the system weighted average. As you all know, I have jumped up and down publicly about it and said please continue it for at least one year. I will tell you why. I will quote a letter from Dr Peter Tannock. He was head of Catholic Education originally and then he became Vice-Chancellor at Notre Dame. He is a very active member of Gonski. In a letter just the other day he said: 'The government should ameliorate the concerns of Catholic systems and should reinstate the longstanding mechanism for Commonwealth funding of Catholic and other non-government systems—for example, Lutherans—and it should be based on the enrolment weighted average of all schools.' He refers to a recommendation at page 171 of the original Gonski report. He goes on to say: 'This funding mechanism was strongly and unanimously endorsed by Gonski'—and that should make it very acceptable. I understand that Professor Farish was asked to examine and create what was supposedly to be the new SES model—and even Farish has said it is not working. The Grattan Institute, as has been said earlier this evening, has also come out and said the same thing. That is the reason why I have pushed very hard for there to be a pause, for there to be a continuation of the system weighted average for a 12-month period, including an examination of the funding for students with disabilities—because that is a real area of concern right across the board, as the minister well knows. And, during that time, maybe it might be led by Professor Farish.


I can imagine a situation where that review is chaired by the person who was the original architect of the new SES model. It would have tax office people on board. It would have census and statistics people—a representation of the systems—so they can have a good long hard look based on capacity to pay. That might be through the tax file numbers of the parents in the schools. I am sure that, with modern technology, we can crossmatch those. The simple fact is that, if you do not earn $18,800 a year, you do not pay tax. So the possibility of examining it through tax returns might or might not work. We need something or other that can be examined. Minister, can you point to what you have in mind to allow the continuation of the system weighted average? What do you have in mind in terms of how that review will be undertaken? Can I have an undertaking from you that disability will be included in that particular process?


Naturally, at the conclusion of that review, since I will not be here, I want to be absolutely sure that my colleagues across the chamber will be able to know what it was that the review panel determined. If, indeed, it is one of your requirements that consensus be reached, well, send them all on a long drive to Darwin, because by the time they get there they will as sure as hell have consensus. I really do want to know what mechanism will be in place, whatever the determination the review panel make and whatever the recommendation they make to you as the minister, and how that will find its way into our processes. Of course, as has been quite rightly asked by Senator Collins: is there some indicative costing, additional costing, that you believe would be required to give effect to this so that there can be a level of satisfaction across systems, it is understood and we can go forward into 2018. 


We cannot leave it any longer, colleagues. There are those who say, 'Can we put this off until August or September?' However, those of us who have been on school boards know that by now you have normally done your budgets. You know what your enrolments are for next year. You know whether there are going to be more teachers or fewer teachers. You are trying to work out what the fee structures are going to be. June is late enough. For those of us who know the system, who know how school boards run, know that to delay the determination until August or September is far too late for 2018. Anybody associated with budgeting is screaming now. They are the questions I want answered. The minister knows that, if I can be satisfied, of course I can support it.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (20:56):  Senator Back, thank you for your contribution. I would just at the outset reflect on a couple of the broader comments that you made about the value of nongovernment education—the Catholic systemic schools, other school systems outside of the government systems, as well as standalone independent schools across Australia. I note particularly your comments that rightly acknowledge the hard work of parents and families who choose to invest in their child's education. You rightly acknowledge that such parents do make savings to other taxpayers in choosing to do so, particularly savings to states and territories in terms of costs that they would otherwise wear were those students to be in the equally high quality government school systems around the country. 


I also acknowledge that in those nongovernment schools, as in government schools, we see principals, teachers and the entire school community work hard in voluntary ways to raise additional funds to provide additional resources, as well as, of course, the resources that are provided in terms of the fees. I acknowledge the fact that many in the Catholic education system and in the other school systems work in ways to try to provide access to their schools for people who may not be able to pay all of the fees or indeed any of the fees in some instances and that they do so in a sense in a spirit of charity and access. In a handful of locations around the country, they do so where there may not even be a government school option readily available to those students. It is that choice and that right of people to choose an education, including a faith based education, for their children that is at the heart of Commonwealth funding of education historically. It is that choice that we seek to ensure continues into the future under the type of school funding models that are available. 


An important element of that over time has been especially the work undertaken in the Howard era, building on years of increased involvement of the Commonwealth government in school funding, particularly nongovernment school funding, to ensure that there was some methodology that allowed for governments of the day to provide greater support to nongovernment schools in communities of lower economic means or capabilities in their capacity to contribute to those school fees. This was essentially ensure there were some means that empowered school choice around Australia for those who may not be able to afford significant fees in their schools. I note that well before that there were many schools who, thanks to charitable contributions, church contributions, parish contributions and other ways, were already making such offerings available at little or no fee, regardless of government funding. But, as time has gone by, government funding has become more and more important, and it is important that the funding model we have does ensure that the greatest level of support goes to those school communities and to families in those school communities who are otherwise the least able to access that choice, relative to those who might be better off.


Senator Back, I want to thank you for that contribution and for your consistent advocacy in terms of school choice. Indeed, as this is your second-last sitting day—it would certainly be, technically, your second last sitting day, even if we are here beyond Thursday!—I acknowledge that that is not just a contribution you have made in the Senate but, as you rightly acknowledged, it is a contribution you have made in other ways through voluntary undertakings, like so many parents and community workers do as volunteers on school boards and on school authorities in roles that help to make schools work.


Senator Back, in this debate you have engaged with me and you have done so advocating for your constituents and others with whom you are engaged who have concerns about some elements of the funding model, and you have made quite reasonable requests in doing so. As you identified in your contribution then, funding for the system weighted average that applies currently and that is proposed to be removed under the legislation before the chamber should continue next year while the review of the SES methodology, the socioeconomic status methodology, is undertaken.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Where is the amendment for the review, Senator?




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  No, the amendment to remove the system weighted average.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  We will come to it, Senator Collins. So I am pleased to confirm, Senator Back, that the government have made a determination that, using section 69A of the Australian Education Act, we would provide for additional funding equivalent to the system weighted average determination for all relevant school systems across Australia. I emphasise 'relevant' because it is important to highlight that this is not just a matter relevant to Catholic education systems; it also applies to a number of other, generally smaller education systems around Australia.


The fiscal impact of that for the first calendar year is estimated to be $46.5 million, of which some $38.2 million would be estimated to be paid to each of the eight state and territory Catholic Education Commissions across Australia, and some $8.3 million would be paid to the different non-government education systems that are not in the Catholic system, over the next 12 months.


Senator Back, that funding is applying the same system averaging methodology—in terms of the averaging-out of scores—as is currently the case. They are of course estimates. Should there be more student enrolments or other variations in that sense, then they would be adjusted accordingly. 


In addition to that commitment to provide that funding certainty, we are committing to a review of the SES methodology and we are committing to establishing a permanent vehicle by which such enhancements and improvements to the school funding model could take place. I refer the Senate to proposed amendment (7) on sheet GX167, which deals with establishing a National School Resourcing Board.


I emphasise that that board will require representation and membership from the states and territories, from the representative body for Catholic systemic schools and from the representative body for independent schools, ensuring that all relevant parties will be at the table in terms of the board's operation and work. It will be tasked with conducting reviews periodically, and the government intends that the very first review that it be tasked with is a review in relation to the SES measure and the parental-capacity-to-contribute settings for non-government schools. This will allow for independent analysis of the suitability of the current arrangements and ensure that the concerns raised by non-government schools, including Catholic education system authorities, about the SES measure are fully and properly examined. Our intention is that this review will take place and be completed before the middle of next year. In doing so, that will of course then provide recommendations that the government's intention will be to act upon, noting, of course, any particular budgetary circumstances that need to be addressed in that regard.


I highlight to the Senate—and hopefully we would have moved this amendment by now—that there are particular measures in terms of the structure of this that will ensure that there must be consultation around the terms of reference for such a review with all of the relevant stakeholders in terms of ensuring that the findings of such a review will be made public; tabled in this place; provided to relevant stakeholders, including, of course, the different representative bodies in the states and territories; and, once having undertaken the SES and capacity-to-contribute review, we would anticipate and commit that the next body of work that this review would look at would be in relation to student-with-disability loadings to ensure the appropriate application of those loadings.


Senator Back, thank you again for your constructive engagement and advocacy in this regard. It helps to ensure that as we work through these processes we get even better outcomes. As I have highlighted time and time again in this place, the funding proposals that the government has put forward do ensure growth in funding in a range of different ways, and I note that your advocacy in this matter has not been about the quantum of funding so much as the co-responsibility arrangements that you highlight across systems and the way in which they work. I commend you for the way in which you put those arguments forward and worked with us in this way.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (21:07):  I have said to Senator Back that I will explain how the concern is not so much what Simon says but what Simon does not say. You might recall—I am not really being glib here—that it was the state ministers who came out of their last ministerial council saying it was 'all Simon says'. In other words, the outcome of any Commonwealth-state partnership in this area has deteriorated so badly that he would front one ministerial council with just two case studies. That is the only prior consideration or airing of this sole Commonwealth funding approach, and the only other area we have been directed to as informing this shift has been the cabinet consideration. He could not even draw the Grattan Institute into an informed discussion about why we should move to 80-20. There has been no informed discussion about moving to 80-20. As I said, that is the issue about public schools that I have been accused of not being concerned about, so let's leave that on the table.


Senator Back, on the issues that you are concerned about: it is what Simon does not say, which highlights—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator O'Sullivan
):  Senator, there has been quite a bit of latitude, but you will refer to the minister in the appropriate fashion.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Certainly I will. Thank you. It is what the minister does not say that is the issue here. Senator Back, I refer you to page 11 of the bill. Page 11 of the bill sets out the changes to the capacity-to-contribute arrangements under the SES. This is the area that the government amendments do not address. This is the area where the minister is deliberately refusing to pause, and the reason that the minister is deliberately refusing to pause—and we have heard different arguments about that, and I am sure we will get to the detail of those, because he convinced with very weak arguments all sorts of people that the justification for the existing capacity-to-contribute arrangement was tenuous. But it is connected to the SES arrangements and for him to suggest that he is pausing the arrangements under this model for systemic schools, and then not address these provisions in the bill, is simply disingenuous. Let me explain the reason, Senator Back: it is because the two factors work together.


I recall the decisions that were made under the Gillard government around how to follow the Gonski recommendations, and I want to take the Senate very carefully through that. I have done this a couple of times, but hopefully now that we are very focused on the issue I can do it again. I think you mentioned that Dr Tannock referred to page 177 of the Gonski review. I am now going to refer to a related part, which is on page 178. On that page the panel recommended that government should apply careful attention to the 'the shape of the anticipated private contribution' between two points in the model as to what level of contribution should be expected of parents. Under the Gillard government we did that. We modelled it. We looked at the sort of modelling that the minister is refusing to provide at the moment under our order for the production of documents. Under that modelling, at the time we were convinced—and we have had more recent data now from the ABS that highlights this point—that parents who have children at primary school level have a different capacity to contribute than, in general terms, parents who have children at secondary school level. The more recent ABS data reinforces that point. It is well-known that families with younger children are more likely to have one full-time income earner and then maybe only a part-time income earner, or not a second income earner, within their households. That is reflected in the ABS family income figures provided to me by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That is why we, under the Gillard government, framed the curve as it currently is in the act for primary school students.


We are also mindful of the fact that the highest proportion of students in non-government schools are in local parish Catholic primary schools. Unlike the independent sector, there is usually a smaller proportion of students at primary level and a much higher proportion of students at secondary level, and they can balance out that distribution more effectively. In Catholic schools they are commonly local parish Catholic primary schools—the ones you would be familiar with. Their argument was that not only does the SES model not measure very well the nature of our student population and their families but also their capacity to contribute is different when you have primary school aged students as opposed to secondary school aged students.


On that basis and on the basis of advice we received at the time, we structured the curve in a way that reflected that and took on board the Gonski review recommendation that we needed to do this in a fashion that would not compromise the delivery of the different types of non-government schools. One of those different types of non-government schools is the low-fee systemic Catholic primary school. I do not focus just on Catholics here, because that is why the Anglicans are in systems and the Lutherans are in systems. They run some very similar low-fee accessible schools. What the minister has yet to circulate—I would like to be wrong here but I have not yet been able to find this—is an amendment that withdraws the changes that I directed you to in the current bill, or at least provides a 12-month moratorium on those provisions. If they do not do that they are not providing the full-monty moratorium. Let me highlight why that is definitely the case, now that the minister has provided us with the anticipated figures. Because, Senator Back, the anticipated figures he has provided for this next financial year are nowhere near the anticipated figures we addressed in government. It is five-odd years since 2013, but my recollection is that the system weighted average factor at that point in time was worth roughly $60 million. So there is only one way the minister could be presenting the figure that he gave us today—the $46.5 million figure—and that is if he has done it on the basis of his changes to the parental capacity to contribute. That is the only way he could come up with that estimate. 


So there are two issues, Senator Back, that relate to assurances that you may have been given. The first of those is that it is not a full pause unless the government removes the changes to the capacity-to-contribute arrangements for non-government primary schools. If they do not remove the provisions that I have directed you to on page 11 of the bill—and we have amendments designed to do that—they are just simply not being genuine. It is a very difficult element to explain, but what people need to understand is the system weighted average factor works in partnership with the capacity-to-contribute measure. The two work together. So if the minister is only responding to one element of it, that is why you are getting figures that are well below the figures we addressed when we were in government. 


But what is more concerning is that the minister is being disingenuous in how he is addressing this. These are issues that have been taken to the minister time and time again, so for him to be here now deliberately skimming over that factor is disrespectful. It is disrespectful to you. I am more than happy for him to be disrespectful to me, and almost everybody in this debate has been. I have pretty thick skin; it does not bother me in the slightest. But, Senator Back, for you, for the minister to not cover that issue is disrespectful.


A genuine pause would involve at least a pause on the operation of the provisions on page 11 of the bill. Find me the amendment that the government is moving that does that—prove me wrong, please, but I cannot find it, and my advisers have not been able to find it in the limited time that we have had—or the minister can make an assurance that he will put it in. But if he does not then I suggest to you, Senator Back, and to other senators who are concerned about these issues, to support our amendment that does, because any suggestion that there is a moratorium on these issues, without dealing with the unilateral changes to capacity to contribute that this minister has put into this bill, is not adequate.


The complexity of all of this is what has allowed this minister to maintain the charade. Had this minister had his way we would have trotted in here this evening and we would have started systematically moving through his amendments, and he might have conned the Senate as a whole as well. But fortunately our parliamentary processes ensure—and you, Senator Back, know full well why—he cannot just do that. I think, Senator Back, the question you should be asking the minister is: what is he going to do about these capacity-to-contribute changes that he has unilaterally introduced into the bill?


As I have said to you, I have seen submissions from independent schools, and they were the only ones that you could glean any policy rationale from in relation to these changes. When we challenged people like Christians Schools to please tell us, 'Where has this come from? Why has the curve been adjusted this way? Do you really understand the impact?' the answers we got were quite alarming. Catholic Education has been accused of scaremongering. The truth is Catholic Education is really probably the only organisation that has the organisational capacity to use the funding estimator tool and understand fairly easily and fairly quickly what the implications are. When they spoke to the Lutherans, they put in a submission to the legislation committee inquiry, and said, 'No, we don't like this—don't do this to us.' Then we had the Anglicans, and it was much the same. Indeed, you will note that Senator Birmingham has not responded to my question about the Anglican system that sought to be recognised as a system almost 12 months ago, that he failed to act upon. Will they, at least, get some access to this partial Monty? Or will they get nothing? That is the problem here.


So it is going to be a long night, because the assurances that Senator Birmingham might be giving you now will be challenged to time and time again. But unless he stalls his capacity to contribute changes, there is no more moratorium. The figures are as represented, for instance, in my local parish school. I was a bit reluctant to talk about it until I received a letter from one of my fellow parishioners. It is probably about the first time as a senator that I have ever been able to respond almost immediately and say, 'Actually, there are a few other people you should be lobbying rather than me.' Consider the impact on that school, unless this capacity to contribute payment or, as described in the Gonski review report, the anticipated private contribution, because that is what this minister is unilaterally changing—the anticipated private contribution. 


He has said wonderful things about Catholic Education here tonight, but reflect on what he has said at other times. Catholic Education was supposedly scaremongering, yet his colleagues, like Senator Bridget McKenzie—if you look at her press release from 2013, she was way more out there in terms of suggesting that there would be fee rises within Catholic schools. No—Catholic Education has looked at these changes to the anticipated private contribution—page 11 in the bill—and they have been able to tell us quite clearly what will be anticipated from parents in Catholic schools from 2018, with no transition. There is no six or 10 years working these changes through the system—this cliff happens in 2018. Unless this is removed from the bill, there is no moratorium.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:22):  Just quickly, because Senator Collins has raised it a couple of times, I have managed to get some information in relation to what I think is the Anglican school system that she has queried about. My understanding is that on 8 February the system contacted the department seeking to have consideration of it for system weighted average application. They were advised two days later that the first step for that to apply was that there had to be a collection of the addresses of each child in the system. The 2017 collection was to take place over the period up to 31 May—there has been an extension provided in relation to provision of such addresses—but that once such addresses were collected in the system it would be possible to calculate a system weighted average. Whilst the department is not aware of that system having been in contact with the department again, if it is their wish with the updated data that they be treated in the same way as any of the others that have been included or naturally captured in the commitments I have given to Senator Back tonight, I would be happy for that to occur.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (21:23):  There is just one problem with that answer, which is that there are provisions in the bill that remove the minister's discretion to treat a system that way. So unless his amendments deal with removing that discretion, there can be no new systems. This is why I raised this case. It may have not have been 12 months—as I said, I am quite prepared to accept that people who convey this information to us might not have their information completely accurate. But thank you—we now know, even though I have asked this question before, and we have not received comprehensive answers to the questions that were asked in the legislation inquiry. But I now know that there is an Anglican system—as I said, I cannot recall which state it was, so we still do not know that. There are a number of Anglican systems in other states that already have that status. But there is one system sitting out there, outstanding. They commenced the process on 5 February. This bill removes the minister's capacity to treat them in such a fashion, unless we see another amendment. And so they cannot be treated in the same way, Minister, unless this suggested $50 million transition fund is some discretionary ministerial bucket. If so, you have yet to describe to us the circumstances and conditions under which people would have access to it.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:25):  If the system in question meets all of the other, usual preconditions for system status—as we would anticipate—and the address collection has occurred, then the same provisions for prescribed circumstances payments under section 69A of the act would allow us to be able to ensure that they were treated in the same equitable terms as any of those others that were identified in the response to Senator Back.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:26):  More than 40 per cent of students in Northern Territory schools are Indigenous. Most of them are more likely to attend government schools, and many of these students are high-needs students, often because of issues of disadvantage and poverty. Studies have found nearly 90 per cent of Indigenous students in Northern Territory schools suffer from hearing loss, which affects language development and impacts on learning. So imagine sitting at school as a student with hearing loss and English as your second language. Sadly, that is the case for almost half of our Indigenous students at any given time, yet we wonder why these children are not learning. As a government, you wonder why the gap is not closing, Minister, but how do you learn when you cannot hear the teacher?


Let me give you some more facts about the reality of Northern Territory schools and students. The Northern Territory has the largest proportion of children aged nought to eight years of any state or territory in Australia—14.1 per cent compared to 11.5 per cent nationally. The Territory also has the largest proportion of Indigenous children—42 per cent compared to 6 per cent nationally. Geographically, 48 per cent of all children aged nought to 12 in the Territory live in remote areas, compared to three per cent nationally, and over 37 per cent of NT government schools have a language background other than English. Very remote students live in relatively small, highly dispersed communities and homelands, where families choose to remain living close to country and culture. In these areas there is limited infrastructure, little or no economy and populations that do not use English as a first language.


Minister, I have a number of questions in relation to the Northern Territory that I would like to put to you. Just before I do, I also have a letter here that I wish to table. It is a letter from the education minister, Eva Lawler, who is urging the Senate to delay this bill to allow time to negotiate arrangements that are more favourable to Australia's most disadvantaged and vulnerable children. Essentially, the key message is that jurisdictions have different capacities to fund their schools, and, while it does not seem like much, it is important to the Northern Territory. So I seek leave to table this document.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:29):  Minister, I have a number of questions that I would like to put to you in terms of the Northern Territory. Although the Commonwealth has announced additional funding from 2018 to 2021 to assist Northern Territory government schools' transition to the new school-funding arrangements, the Territory's educational landscape and complexities will continue beyond 2021, where additional funding will be needed to assist students with the highest needs. Minister, how will this bill allow for review and continuous improvement in the funding model to consider changes in evidence and context?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:30):  I do refer Senator McCarthy in particular to proposed amendment (7) on sheet GX167 as it does provide a very clear mechanism for states and territories as well as other sectors to be represented in a national school resourcing body, and it will have particular tasks in relation to continued improvement of the funding model.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:30):  Minister, under proposed section 22A of the bill it states that states and territories will be required to at least maintain their current level of per-student funding in accordance with the regulations detailing how funding must be maintained for both government and non-government schools. It is understood the proposed penalty for failure to meet maintenance-of-effort requirements will result in a further reduction of Commonwealth funding being applied to public schools. Is this the case?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:31):  There is no reduction to public schools, but under the government's proposals there is indeed a provision contained to ensure that, as the Commonwealth provides additional funding, the states and territories do not simply take out their funding, leaving no net improvement. That is intended as an accountability mechanism to ensure the states and territories do that, noting the reality that the Commonwealth does not directly fund government schools in the Northern Territory or anywhere else around the country. So this is a provision designed to ensure that we do not give with one hand and see any state or territory government take and pocket it with the other but that actually additional funding equates to real additionality in schools.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:31):  The intention is that the one lever we have over states and territories is the funding we provide to those states and territories. So if a state or territory is not going to provide a full pass-through of Commonwealth funding to increase contributions to their state and territory schools then the Commonwealth would have a power in the mechanism to be able to withhold some future level of funding from that state or territory in the hope that that would incentivise the state or territory to ensure that extra funding means extra funding rather than extra Commonwealth funding simply being a cost-shift from the state onto the Commonwealth.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:32):  Minister, the Commonwealth will also transition a calculation of loadings for students with a disability to be based on the nationally consistent collection of data, the NCCD, on school students with disability. This data collection is in its infancy and inconsistencies between jurisdictions are a key concern. Does the bill allow for improvements to data accuracy prior to linking adjustment classifications to funding?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:33):  There is a joint working group that brings together the states and territories, the non-government schooling sector and the Commonwealth for continued enhancement of data accuracy and to work with all of those in collection authorities to ensure improvements in that data accuracy.


As I think I told the Senate yesterday, the ratings are essentially demand driven. So if the collection of data in the Northern Territory were to validly result in more students with disability being identified and/or students with disability being identified at higher levels of adjustment need that would result in additional funding flowing. So our determination is that there will be continued work done across the states and territories around data accuracy. That is why we have commissioned over a period of time an independent report into the collections that have been taking place over recent years. That is informing continuous enhancements in the moderation of data activity to give confidence around the NCCD.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:34):  Minister, you said today in question time that funding for the Northern Territory was about growth in the Northern Territory, and your figures were that it would be going up from $191 million to $261 million, equating to around $8,362 per student and $11,370 per student. The concern that the Northern Territory has is that the funding proposal will see federal funds cut to 20 per cent of the school resourcing standard, and currently Northern Territory government schools received 23 per cent of the school resourcing standard. How did you arrive at those figures?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:35):  The government have been fairly clear that, whilst the 20 per cent figure will be applied to all of the other states and territories, we note the unique circumstances of the Northern Territory and therefore have provided for some additional funding in the Territory to ensure that there is a continued level of growth in funding and support for Northern Territory schools, which is included in the figures that I quoted in question time today.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2017-06-21,"




Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:36):  Minister, I am just trying to understand, though, what that means for remote schools—for example, Mutitjulu, Yuendemu, Maningrida, Yirrkala and Borroloola. Can you explain just what it will look like for those particular schools?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:36):  I will explain it in a couple of ways. One, as I highlighted before, is that what it looks like for those schools will be a matter for the Northern Territory minister, whose letter you tabled before, as she has full autonomy—or the Territory government have full autonomy in terms of how they distribute the funding across Territory schools. However, the quantum of funding that the Territory government receives is well and truly, as I highlighted in response to your earlier questions, the highest in the nation on a per-student basis, and that is because of the particular need there. 


Of course, a loadings model like this one, which provides additional loadings for Indigenous students, students of socio-educational disadvantage, for students from learning backgrounds other than English and for students with a disability, does provide, ultimately, the largest level of funding per student in the Northern Territory, rightly reflecting the very particular needs of the Territory. 


So, in terms of the remote schools that you identified, while I do not offhand know the circumstances of each of those schools, I imagine that, in terms of the funding that the Territory government receives, each of them would be attracting significant levels of Indigenous student loadings; significant levels of loadings in relation to socio-educational disadvantage; significant loadings, potentially, in relation to language backgrounds other than English; possibly, significant loadings in relation to student with disability; certainly, in terms of them being remote schools, the regional schools loading; and probably the small schools loadings as well.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (21:38):  The Turnbull government puts significant resources into the Remote School Attendance Strategy. On the one hand, there have been significant funds going into that—you are putting resources into trying to get kids to schools in remote communities—but, on the other hand, there is an understanding about cuts to schools, like local teachers, Indigenous education workers and investment in resources. There is a major imbalance here. Can you respond to that?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:39):  Certainly, Senator. Just to highlight support for Indigenous students, I draw your attention to the fact sheets that the department has published in this regard. Loading support for Indigenous students is estimated to increase from around $962.6 million that was provided over the previous four years—2014 to 2017 inclusive—and increasing to some $1.4 billion in loading support over the period 2018 to 2021. That is an increase in support of around 46 per cent. A significant level of those loadings, certainly on a per population basis or ratio, is the highest level in the country and naturally goes to the Northern Territory.

Senator McCARTHY

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:40):  There are extraordinary sums of money involved in school education. We estimate that around 213,504 students in 2018 will identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander students and therefore will attract a loading, depending on the intensity of the Indigenous population in the schools that they attend. Because of the scale of the number of students and schools, they end up being very significant numbers. But, importantly, there is also clear growth and clear application of needs based principles. As identified before, I gave the figures in relation to the growth rates across Northern Territory government schools that are estimated to shift from $191 million in funding in 2017 up to $261 million by 2027, as well as highlighting in particular the additional funding and budget resourcing that the government is committed to, in essence, outside of the model to provide some $35.6 million in the Northern Territory. This specifically recognises the unique circumstances there, including the uniquely high starting share of the schooling resource standard.

 (Northern Territory) (21:42):  Minister, you refer to the 'unique circumstances', and I did mention earlier issues like hearing problems, which contribute quite significantly to some of the learning difficulties in terms of not only health but also language. Many different languages are spoken across the Northern Territory. Can you point me to where in your figures there is a focus on—I am not sure whether it is in the disability area—providing support so that there is a guarantee that there is support for students with those sorts of learning difficulties?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:43):  Senator, as I went through some of the areas of loadings that are applicable before, language backgrounds other than English are one area of those loadings, which, as I indicated, may be applicable in certain remote communities in the Northern Territory, in addition to all of the other loadings which we spoke about. I would also highlight in relation to the first question you asked in the string of questions about the Nationally Consistent Collection of Data on School Students with Disability that the intent behind that is to provide for appropriate levels of support that genuinely reflect the adjustment assistance that students need. Obviously, issues in relation to hearing that may have impaired a student's learning over a period of time are real challenges. In terms of identification of hearing loss and hearing difficulties, I am advised that the Department of Health funds and supports a number of programs in terms of hearing checks. They provide valuable assistance towards identifying students who may be able to have hearing problems rectified, as well as identifying students who may attract additional support under the students with disability funding.

 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:47):  I can inform Senator Pratt that, whilst I do not have it in front of me, I am very much aware that the budget papers last year made it very clear that the proposed distribution of funding, that I am pretty sure no other Labor senator will come in here and suggest should have been adhered to, was indicative only and was to be the subject of the development of future funding models. I challenge Senator Pratt to find anywhere where I quoted those figures, or used those figures, or where the government promoted those figures anywhere, without the very strong caveats that were contained in those budget papers. But I do emphasise to Senator Pratt that Western Australian government schools do, under the proposal that the Turnbull government has brought forward, receive far and away the greatest growth for government schools anywhere in the country—some 7.3 per cent per student growth over the next four years under the government's proposal; growth that is well in excess of anywhere else and reflective of the fact that Western Australia got such a raw deal under the Gillard government proposals and that we are committed over the transition period proposed in our bill to catch Western Australia up to all other jurisdictions.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (21:48):  How are state governments supposed to manage their budgets if you make up figures in your budget papers that are blatantly untrue for 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20, the three following years? How are they supposed to function in any meaningful way whatsoever if you cannot or refuse to give them reliable figures on which to manage their education budgets?

 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:49):  Senator Pratt has an outstanding opportunity tonight to fix the concerns she just expressed by locking into legislation the funding formulas for state and territory governments into the future in a far more certain way than the different deals done by the Gillard government did.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:50):  Far from a deficit for Western Australia, as I indicated before, the growth rates are in fact the strongest in the country. As I have done for a number of jurisdictions, I will highlight for Western Australia that in 2017 WA government schools will receive some $616 million of Commonwealth funding. That will increase to an estimated $677 million in 2018 and, as the model continues to the 2027 endpoint, some $1.489 billion being paid to the Western Australian government to support Western Australia government schools—a more than doubling of existing funding in relation to WA.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:50):  It is because of a couple of things. The baseline is, of course, what they actually receive in 2017, and it grows each and every year into the future. As I indicated in my first question, the footnotes were very clear in last year's budget papers that, as state allocations for some programs were yet to be determined, relevant payments are not included in state totals. Consequently, total payments may not equal the sum of state totals. They further went on that it includes financial assistance grants for local government in some instances and then noted that state allocations from the 2018 school year onwards are indicative only and final allocations are subject to formal negotiations with Commonwealth, the states and the non-government schools sector. Of course, in those final allocations for 2018 onwards we propose to remove all ambiguity or uncertainty and to actually ensure that they are locked into legislation  under a far fairer arrangement than the deal that absolutely dudded Western Australia that the Gillard government put on the table.

 (Western Australia) (21:52):  Is it not true that, as previously indicated in the budget papers, there was $744 million for Western Australian schools in 2017-18, $884 million in 2018-19 and $928 million in 2019-20, which represents some $400 million more than what you are proposing in the legislation before us?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (21:52):  As I indicated before, the indicative figures in last year's budget were clearly specific as indicative only. Were, of course, I to accept the premise of your question, that would make a mockery of the claims each and every one of your colleagues seem to make. They do not want to use last year's budget as the basis upon which to acknowledge there is growth everywhere else across the country. Indeed, it seems as if you want to pick one set of figures completely different from the set of figures all of your other colleagues want to use. I highlight here that Western Australia is the biggest winner out of these reforms with the fastest rate of growth. Unlike anything that would ever have been achieved under the Gillard government deals, we are guaranteeing that Western Australia will receive a fair share of funding for its school students rather than being penalised for the fact that Western Australian governments have invested more in their schools than some in other states do.

Before I do that, Minister, we know that you have been in negotiations with some of the crossbenchers in here and, indeed, before that with the Australian Greens. I note that today Senator Hanson made comments about children with disability in a speech that she made during the education bill debate, stating that, if there are too many children with disability in a classroom, it affects the learning of children without disability—according to Senator Hanson—and that these children should go into a special classroom. Was that raised at any point by the Pauline Hanson's One Nation team as a negotiating point with government to get their support for the bill?

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (21:59):  I have one short question I hope the minister might be able to give me a decent answer to. One of the things that concerns the local community is how trustworthy the information is that the government has provided. As a former teacher, I have to say that people's interaction with the My School website has led to a degree of trust in the veracity of information they can access from a government about the facts relating to their school. So I think the government's decision on the back of that sense of trust that people have in the digital connection they have with governments about their school was actually an asset on which the government drew when they were trying to convince the Australian public that they were actually going to be doing something decent in terms of education.


But, in the context of all of that, there was the establishment of the school funding estimator. With discussion around the bill, and certainly at estimates, there were very many questions about the veracity of the detail embedded in that funding estimator. Parents right across the country and across New South Wales are communicating with me and they are very concerned about how much they can trust that. For some of them, their initial concern was simply because, like me, they really do not trust too much what this government says on education, particularly after they were told they were going to get dollar-for-dollar funding that would match Labor's commitment. They want to know how now they should interpret the school funding estimator given that the Secretary of the New South Wales Department of Education, Mark Scott, has said that the information on the federal government's school funding estimator is not to be relied upon. And that is a direction that has been given to New South Wales school principals with regard to school funding. So, Minister, with regard to what has now been declared by a state entity, the government sector in New South Wales, through Mr Mark Scott, what is your intention with regard to directions about removing incorrect factual data from the school funding estimator website?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:02):  The senator asked a couple of questions relating to the My School website and the school funding estimator. Of course, the My School website provides details of the Commonwealth funding that a state or territory system authority, Catholic school system authority or other school system says it provides to a particular school. It is not necessarily an accurate reflection on the My School website what the federal funding provided to that system authority for the school is; it is simply a reflection of what the system authority, out of their pooled grant of federal funding, provides to that school. I note that historical data on My School also includes other sources of federal funding outside of the direct recurrent school funding arrangements. In relation to the estimator, it has sought to provide the nominal allocation of funding that goes from the Commonwealth to a school or a school system. I note that, in relation to a school system such as the New South Wales government system, the school funding estimator does make clear that, if your school is part of a system—Commonwealth funding is paid to the system as a block—the system will determine the amount your school receives. That, of course, has been the case historically and it continues to be the case.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:03):  Just to be clear for people who thought they did not have to worry about the funding of their schools and education for their children, for people who have taken the government at its word and certainly accepted the fanfare on the day of the announcement—'the school funding estimator is going to tell you how great life is for your child'—the reality is that it is a nominal allocation. That means it is not an accurate number, it is nominal; it is something like it, but it is not the accurate number.


Minister, if your school is part of the Catholic school system, which is 25 per cent of the schools across the country—and all of the government schools as part of government systems—because parents of those school systems are looking up materials, there is not only a nominal allocation; the other variable is that the other numbers there do not actually reflect what is happening with the system through which the money is coming. Basically, they are very, very inaccurate numbers. Is that correct, Minister? They are not to be relied on?

I do note that all of these matters were covered fairly extensively at Senate estimates and, I suspect, in the Senate inquiry. I again refer the senator to my previous answer: if you accurately want to know how much federal government funding a school system provided to their individual schools, then ultimately you need to refer to the My School website when that data is finally reported.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (22:06):  I want to go to some further concerns of the Western Australian state government. I will quote from their submission to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. The Western Australian government noted that, through this legislation, the Commonwealth is 'seeking to strengthen the linkage between Commonwealth financial assistance and the implementation of evidence-based reforms to improve student outcomes'. As the Western Australian state government characterises it, the bill is seeking to stipulate conditions of financial assistance on the states and territories that is conditional on the implementation of national policy initiatives and that those jurisdictions maintain their 2017 levels of schools funding. Given that, why have you not provided the states the detail about how the funding will be tied to reforms, how maintenance of effort will be calculated and measured and how noncompliance will be managed?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:08):  The Turnbull government makes no apologies for wanting to ensure that record and growing levels of school funding are used in evidence-based ways to lift student outcomes and student performance. That is essential given the relative flatlining, and indeed decline, in some areas of performance across Australian schools over recent years. It is essential, particularly given that that has occurred in the context of increased funding growth, especially from Commonwealth governments into Australian school systems.


We want to make sure that, this time, in committing increased funding, that funding delivers results across Australian schools, which is why we are very pleased that David Gonski has agreed to do a further piece of work which will be undertaken over the duration of this year and which will receive evidence and opinions from educational experts around the country to identify how it is that our additional record growing levels of funding can most effectively be used to lift educational outcomes  and achieve educational excellence. We look forward to states and territories working with us through that review process, signing on to reform agreements and being held accountable for the implementation of those reforms so that we actually do achieve the lift in student outcomes that that investment is set and meant to achieve.

Senator PRATT

Although the bill states that the amendment will now say 'consult and have regard to any relevant decisions of the ministerial council', will you give state governments an assurance that the regulations on how this will be undertaken will be explicit?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:12):  Senator Pratt, for your reference, you are referring to and asking questions about page 37 of the bill. Measure 175 says the minister must consult in relation to the making of regulations and have regard to the decisions of the ministerial council. Those relate to conditions of financial assistance matters as well as ongoing policy requirements and ongoing funding requirements. Indeed, the standard practice is that the minister of the day does write out to all of the jurisdictions to provide them with notice of and an opportunity to comment on or respond to proposed decisions or regulations that the minister is making.

Senator PRATT

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:14):  The purpose of this clause is not to set regulations about how consultation occurs but to ensure that, where regulations are being set, there is a requirement that consultation occurs. I refer the senator to page 34 of the EM, which makes clear:


This item will ensure that where proposed regulations will affect the ongoing policy or funding requirements of approved authorities for government schools, or conditions imposed under sections 22, 22A and 24 of the Act on states and territories for financial assistance received under the Act, the Minister must not only consult with the Ministerial Council, but must also have regard to decisions of the Council prior to the Governor-General making those regulations.

To facilitate the progress of dealing with amendments it would be useful if the minister, or with the assistance of the department, were able to address a couple of questions in relation to amendment (2), which the minister has moved. How do the amounts specified in GX1672, which detail different SRS funding amounts for 2017, impact upon different groups of schools? How does it increase expenditure?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:16):  The financial impact of these measures is already part of the budget estimations, as I understand it. For clarity: these measures give effect to some of the changes the government had already announced. As I think has been explored previously, there is a slight updating in relation to the base funding amount for primary school students and secondary school students, reflecting more current data about the level of expenditure of those schools captured in the modelling who meet the educational standards for the setting of the base funding. That is what these measures seek to give effect to, as I outlined in introducing this amendment, ensuring that the commencement funding calculations accurately reflect funding in the appropriate terms for the appropriate year, indexed off the base, from when they were calculated.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (22:18):  Minister, what we are seeking to understand at the moment is what has been circulated from the Parliamentary Counsel in relation to this amendment. It indicates that this amendment will 'change the basis for calculating funding for certain schools under the Australian Education Act 2013, having the effect of increasing expenditure under the act'. Do the comments you have just made in relation to those calculations deal with that issue?

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:18):  Indeed, the bill presented by the government does involve increasing funding under the act. The way in which that funding is calculated is why these provisions are shaped in the form of a request. They are not an area of additional funding—and there are some of those in the form of further amendments that will be dealt with—but they do relate to the additional funding already provided for in the bill in that they impact the way it is all calculated. In terms of application to certain schools, obviously the primary school base amount relates to primary schools and the secondary school base amount relates to secondary schools—and I am sure you do not need me to go through the others in terms of size loadings and so on. Yes, the language is 'certain schools' but that is only because each of the factors relates to the schools to which it is relevant.

Minister, what other arrangements have you reached with respect to independent schools? I mentioned earlier—and you have not responded to the comments I made in relation to Students First—that the independent school sector said quite clearly to the legislation inquiry that they were hopeful that you would reconsider the position that you gave at Senate estimates about how that would apply into the future.

 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:24):  Not that I recall, or at least not in any detail. But I am aware of some of the concerns, and they are concerns that I would be very mindful of if we were making any changes to the estimator. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:24):  I find it hard to understand how anybody at this point could trust your word. My understanding is very clear. You made a number of commitments, including to the director of schools for the Broken Bay diocese, that you would consider altering the school funding website to reflect the funding allocation by systems so as to more accurately reflect the funding realities. Have you changed your mind about that commitment that you made to the director of schools, or was it just something that you said to get out of a tricky situation and did not mean at the time?



Senator Birmingham interjecting—




Senator O'NEILL:
  Senator Birmingham seems to think that that is a question that is not worthy of an answer, but I want to put on the record that I am a parishioner in the Diocese of Broken Bay and know many teachers in that sector. I know that three very powerful women have taken action in the last week to come down here to Canberra—to leave their small children behind—as advocates for that sector. They have been walking the halls of the parliament, making sure that those on the government benches understand the devastation of the proposed cuts to funding and the failure to deal with the system-weighted average and capacity-to-pay measures that have been the subject of some considerable questioning from our side—still without adequate answers from the other. Those parents from the Broken Bay diocese have been here very alarmed about the impact of government decision-making on their capacity to continue to send their children to the school of their choice.


Those women describe what I think is a very common phenomenon for many Australians around the country who are right now waking up to the disaster of what this funding model that you are proposing is. It has been around just long enough for them to notice the filthy smell of what it is that you are attempting to push through the parliament under the cover of darkness. People are just figuring out that something smells really bad about this. As described to me by these wonderful advocates for 25 per cent of the school population across the country—these three women came in and said, 'We thought at first maybe it was a slight overreaction.' They went to check the facts on the school funding estimator. They actually had faith in the government to put accurate data on the website in the government's name. What a terrible mistake they made. They went to the government website that was being constructed by your department on your watch, Minister. They went and they looked. They thought they could trust those figures, but bit by bit they found out how inaccurate they were, as the systems did and as the systems have gone to you and asked you, Minister, to correct the misinformation that is on those. You have just ignored that. You have made commitments you cannot even remember, it would seem, or are going to deny. Either way, the fact is that those calculators are still incorrect, and parents who are relying on information from you have suddenly started to figure out that they simply cannot trust any of the numbers that you are producing. It is like there is an asterisk and a few more little asterisks and a few more little asterisks. If you sit there and you read all the tiny asterisks—including the ones that you forgot to put in there—you might actually somewhere approximate something near the truth. But people cannot get a straight answer. They cannot get the truth from the school funding estimator and they are not getting the truth from this government in this place tonight.


Mothers who would perhaps normally be ready to put their feet up after a hard day of looking after their families, balancing their work-life and their commitment to their community have asked me to ask you these questions. 'Why does the senator want to pass a bill where it has been proven that the SES model is fundamentally flawed? Why doesn't he fix the modelling first and then present the bill?' What an insightful question from a mother who probably just a few weeks ago did not realise that she would have to sit down and spend hours and hours trawling through the misrepresentations that have been put out into the public place in the government's own school funding calculator? How many mothers of young children sit down and have to trawl their way through this data?


It is happening right across the country. That is the first question. Why do you want to pass this bill when your SES modelling is fundamentally flawed? Why didn't you sort out the modelling? Why didn't you get the modelling right? Why didn't you tell the truth before you brought the bill here?


The next question that these parents want answers to is: why does the minister want to rush this bill through the Senate without proper collaborative consultation with key stakeholders before the announcement was made? What a good question that is. I would love to hear the minister explain why he did not, as I indicated, collaboratively consult with key stakeholders before making the announcement of this bill, which is so terribly flawed and when it is becoming apparent right across the country that there are very big problems with what is being proposed here.


The third question that these parents are asking on behalf of their children and their access to education is: if the bill is so beneficial to systemic schools, why is the Parliamentary Budget Office reporting there will be a $3.1 billion reduction for Catholic schools over the next 10 years?


So there are three very important questions from three great Australian women who are civic advocates and have got themselves up to speed with the knowledge of very complex legislation and funding models because they do not want this government to get between their children and the future that they have a right to. They do not want to let this government get away with misrepresentation of what it is doing. All we hear from this government is, 'Funding is going up; funding is going up,' but parents are onto this government. They are alive to what is really going on here. Systems are onto this government and alive to what is really going on here. And the schoolchildren themselves, I am sure, are feeling the anxiety and the uncertainty that will be manifest in the schooling system that they are a part of. Can you answer those three important questions from those parents, Minister, and speak to what you are going to do about the gross misrepresentation that currently exists on the school funding estimator?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:32):  I will take the senator's three questions that I can manage to decipher from amongst all of her rhetorical flourish. In relation to SES modelling, I reject the categorisation of it as being fundamentally flawed. I do accept, and the government has accepted, there are people who have concerns about aspects of it, which is why, as I outlined in relation to questions from Senator Back earlier, the government has happily made a commitment to ensure that the SES methodology is reviewed. In relation to consultation issues that the senator asked about, I refer her to the Hansard of Senate estimates proceedings, in which I think we went through those matters fairly extensively.


In relation to funding for Catholic systemic schools, I refer the senator to answers that I have given in this chamber and many other places in recent days and prior to that that the evidence and data produced is very clear that, for Catholic systemic schools across Australia, funding goes up from $6.3 billion in 2017, growing to $9.7 billion by 2027, with $3.4 billion of growth across that period, as part of some $81 billion in funding provided to Catholic systemic authorities around the country.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:33):  Minister, there is a particular way in which you answer the questions which is profoundly dismissive of the concerns of parents who are generally finding the passion and energy within themselves, in the context of their very busy lives, to actually engage in this political process, which they have never done before, and are sending questions through that they expect a serious answer to. Instead, you just brush them off in the elitist way that is one of the advancement strategies you must employ on that side, because it is pretty common across the frontbench. You just stand up there, dismiss their questions and send them off to a document where you have misrepresented the facts. Why don't you actually answer the questions honestly, with a little respect for the people who are asking them with genuine concern? The patter that we get from you, Minister, has worn out. You can tell the numbers as often as you like and in any way that you like, but people are seeing through it. It is a misrepresentation of what is going to happen and how it is going to impact on children's learning across the country.


The next question that arrived from this same group of wonderful women was: will the minister keep the capacity-to-contribute ratios as in the 2013 act, rather than use the figures in the amendment bill that is being discussed this evening? I think it is a pretty good question from a citizen who has not had too much to do with the parliament up until you threatened our children's funding.




Senator Birmingham:
  Can you just repeat the question?




Senator O'NEILL:
  I will repeat the question: will the minister keep the capacity-to-contribute ratios as they are in the 2013 act, rather than use the figures indicated in the current amendment bill up for discussion this evening?

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:36):  Can I go to some of the answers you gave to questions that were asked by Senator Back? You spoke about the determination, that using section 69(1) would lead to additional funding equivalent to the student weighted average for all relevant systems—I think I understood that. Minister, could you explain exactly where the number for the fiscal impact of $46.5 million comes from? And the $32 million amount that you indicated was also part of your answer?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:37):  The $46.5 million is the additional funding that will be provided as a result of providing funding equivalence for system authorities next year. That is calculated on the basis of the legislation passing. The same methodology is being applied in relation to the calculation of system weighted averaging as is currently the case.




Senator O'Neill:
  Minister, can you speak a little more slowly so that I can actually hear you?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I said that on the basis of the bill passing it is calculated using the same methodology as is currently the case in terms of system weighted averaging, as I have indicated already. That equates to $46.5 million of additional costs overall, as I indicated to Senator Back, $38.2 million of which would be for Catholic systemic authorities. Of that, a $8.3 million would be for systemic authorities representing other systems, such as the Lutheran system, the Adventist system, the Anglican system and the like.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:38):  I will ask one final question with regard to one of the schools on the Central Coast, where I live. I have lists of hundreds of schools here through the seat of Robertson, the seat of Hume and out into the Riverina, all of which indicate very significant cuts to funding that parents were expecting to receive if the Commonwealth had honoured its commitment to the NERA that was, fundamentally, the expression of the Gonski reviews. Avoca Beach primary school would have received $144,000. Under Mr Abbott it was pretty well zero but under Mr Turnbull the increase now is only $55,200, based on indicative figures. That cut of $89,000 is of concern to the local community. Are the P&C of Avoca Beach Public School wrong when they say that they are going to lose funding that will impact their capacity to deliver proper schooling? Are they wrong, Minister?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:39):  I would point parents to the growing funding that the New South Wales government school system will receive under the Turnbull government's reforms that are before the parliament, funding that will grow for New South Wales government schools from $2.186 billion in 2017 to $2.328 billion in 2018 added to $4.003 billion by 2027. Again, it is a strong growth, as I have highlighted for a number of jurisdictions tonight. The New South Wales government school system will be able to allocate this funding across its schools under our proposed reforms with the safeguards we are proposing to ensure that they are part of real additional funding into school systems and not used by any state as a cost-shifting mechanism. Of course it is growth above inflation, above wages growth that should ensure that the New South Wales government is able to support those schools to continue to do many good things they may have commenced doing to support their students in recent years and indeed, in many instances, to be able to do more in future years.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (22:40):  Minister, I have got a letter here on the letterhead of the Avoca Beach Primary School P&C association and I am sure it is indicative of letters that are going out right across this nation. Certainly I know there is a very active campaign in the whole diocese of Broken Bay and also throughout the schools up the North Shore and all the way right up to Swansea. The inconvenience and the alarm that your legislative program has caused has brought parents together for special meetings, which they do not do frequently, to actually discuss the impact of the decisions that are going to be made in this chamber in the next 24 hours it would seem. It called for a special meeting for all Avoca Beach Public School parents regarding Gonski funding. This is what it says:


Under the federal government's new Gonski funding model, our school will now not be receiving over $300,000 in funding initially promised to us over the next two years. We were promised $144,000 in 2018 but, under the school funding amendment bill, we will only receive $55,200. In 2019, we were promised $272,000 but will only receive $57,850. The bill has already passed through the lower House and now is a matter of debate in the Senate. We are calling a special meeting at 7:30 pm on Monday 26 June in the school library. We ask that you come along and learn how you can help overturn this bill. We have got a short window hence your attendance would be greatly appreciated.


I am pretty sure they are going to be devastated when Monday 26 June comes around if this piece of legislation gets forced through the parliament in the next 24 hours. Minister, does it concern you at all that letters that this have gone out to hundreds of thousands of families across this country because they no longer have any confidence in the Turnbull government to deliver fair funding for their government school or fair funding for their Catholic school or even fair funding for some of the independent schools, who are now very much questioning the capacity of this government to speak the truth with them?

But, otherwise in concurrence with your suggestion, I seek leave to move amendments (3), (4) and (6) on sheet GX167 together. They are essentially all technical amendments, and I will happily take questions on them rather than take up the Senate's time dealing with them.


Leave granted.

(6) Schedule 1, item 103, page 27 (line 7), omit ""for a school"", substitute ""to an approved authority"".


Question agreed to.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I now move amendment (5) on sheet GX167:


(5) Schedule 1, item 89, page 25 (line 28) to page 26 (line 2), omit subsection 78(3), substitute:


(3) An ongoing funding requirement for an approved authority for more than one school is to distribute all financial assistance received in accordance with Division 2 of Part 3 in accordance with a needs‑based funding arrangement determined by the approved authority that complies with subsection (4) or (5).




Funding arrangement based on Division


2 of Part


3



(4) A needs‑based funding arrangement that complies with this subsection distributes to each school for which the authority is approved the amount of financial assistance worked out for the school under Division 2 of Part 3.




Funding arrangement based on other factors



(5) A needs-based funding arrangement that complies with this subsection:


(a) provides an amount per student that:


   (i) represents the recurrent resources required to support a student with minimal educational disadvantage to achieve expected educational outcomes; and


   (ii) takes account of efficiencies that can be realised while improving educational outcomes; and


(b) in addition to the amount per student mentioned in paragraph (a), provides loadings to students and schools with additional needs in order to support student achievement, including loadings for the following:


   (i) students with disability;


   (ii) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students;


   (iii) students with socio‑educational disadvantage;


   (iv) students who have low English proficiency;


   (v) schools based on location;


   (vi) schools based on size; and


(c) is publicly available and transparent.


(6) An approved authority that distributes financial assistance in accordance with subsection (5) is an approved system authority.


This is an amendment that relates to the requirements of approved authorities in relation to their compliance with the act in terms of the distribution of their funding. In particular, it seeks to effectively recognise the autonomy of those approved authorities to be able to distribute their funding. It does not negate, of course, their obligation to use all funding, clearly, for the benefit of their schools and students to ensure they meet all other compliance provisions. But it does ensure that they have autonomy in operating needs based systems with the pooled funding or grant funding they receive according to their principles of need, whilst still noting that the government would, of course, expect that that would reflect the particular disadvantage loadings that are identified.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (22:48):  Minister, can you advise on amendment (5): does this reduce the autonomy of systems to be able to distribute funding across their schools? What consultation has occurred in relation to this section in the bill? We are particularly interested to understand how these new requirements will relate to the description in the explanatory memorandum about how the act operates, allowing systems to distribute in relation to other factors. I think one of the best examples there is probably refugee children. Would these new requirements cut across the system's capacity to direct resourcing to address the needs of students that are not currently accommodated within the federal model?

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2017-06-21,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (22:49):  Far from increasing regulation, this actually reduces it. Most of these provisions are contained in existing regulation but are being proposed in a slightly simplified way to be lifted into the act which will, for the first time, ensure that the right of an approved authority to distribute Commonwealth funding on the basis of zoned needs arrangements will be enshrined clearly in the act and not be subject to potential ministerial variation by regulation. 


These amendments do as they indicate. They will require approved authorities for more than one school to distribute funding in two essential ways: that they simply pass the funding along as they can pass it along as was calculated, or that they can contribute according their own needs based funding arrangement as long as it meets criteria that are relatively simple in terms of the different loading categories that is by no means binding them to exact application of funding specific to those loading categories nor does it restrict them from being able to indeed consider other certain loading factors such as refugee students, whom you indicated as an example before. I will leave it there while I see if I can find the reference in the EM. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (22:51):  Thank you. I asked the minister in my original question what consultation had occurred in relation to these provisions. The reason I asked that is—the first issue is: why are they now introducing these arrangements in the bill? Why wasn't it originally proposed in the bill, if it is as simple as the minister suggests? I know it is almost 11 o'clock at night after a long day, but we still have concerns that the relevant systems may not have been consulted in relation to these provisions, and there may be unintended consequences. It would also help, I think, if the minister could refer us to the regulation that is drawn upon here and being proposed to be brought into the act. 


Again, I use this opportunity to highlight the point, which is, when we are presented with government amendments so late in the piece in sittings as extraordinary as these, it is very difficult to give detailed consideration to matters. Certainly, when you have a day or so, you are able to go and check regulations and you are able to be assured that what the minister has said is simply drawing from regulation up into the act. I would certainly be a proponent of drawing into the act as much as one possibly could with our experience of the nearer now. It probably reflects even our experience with the National Schools Resourcing Body, which at the time we had concerns about establishing yet another school education related board or institution. But, with experience and in retrospect, looking at the way the government has dealt with modelling and data and information, as Senator O'Neill has highlighted—most recently in relation to the school funding estimator—very much so those arrangements, you would hope, were brought into legislation so that they could not be as easily dismantled as occurred with Gonski 1.0 and the arrangements and the reform agenda that was part of the National Education Reform Agreement. 


So, if it is as simple as the minister suggests, which is drawing up well-understood regulations that school systems have worked with and are familiar with, then, on the face of it, we could potentially accept that. But, Minister, you have not yet assured me that adequate consultation has occurred in respect of this, so I remain to be satisfied on that point.

Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  These amendments provide for the establishment of a national school resourcing body. The amendments themselves are relatively self-explanatory for any senator, so I will not take long in going through them. I do acknowledge that a number of non-government parties have advocated for and argued for such a body to be established. Indeed, elements of this body reflect one of the original recommendations of the Gonski review. Importantly, as I have already alluded to in relation to addressing some of the issues with Senator Back earlier in the debate, this is the body that would be tasked with continual review and enhancement of the school funding formula.


The establishment of this board will ensure a number of things. It will provide a mechanism by which we can ensure, in a way that engages all of the relevant stakeholders, the funding model can continually be enhanced and appropriate reviews of it can be undertaken, as well as ensuring that we have a standing body that, on a regular basis, can ensure compliance of states and territories and approved authorities with their obligations under the funding arrangements and the act.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (23:03):  The creation of the independent resources body or some type of watchdog on the way funding is distributed is absolutely essential. The Greens have been advocating for this for quite some time. We know, of course, that it was a recommendation by David Gonski in the original Gonski review. However, the Greens have circulated amendments to these amendments from the government, because we believe what is currently in the amendments circulated by the government is a pale imitation of what needs to be implemented. We need an independent body that actually has the teeth to inquire, to oversee and to ensure that it can report back to this parliament and publicly.


Of course, we know that across different school systems and across different states and territories people have not always abided by the rules or, indeed, the spirit of the arrangements and agreements as to how public money should be spent in schools and through systems. We know that there have been allegations around the way some in the Catholic system have been spending money put aside by the taxpayer for Catholic schools. We know that in the states and territories money that was put up and meant to go improving education in their schools has not been spent on education and, indeed, has gone to other areas. We know that in some systems, in some states and in some territories there are schools that are chronically underfunded. They need money which should have been allocated money and instead money has been flowing to schools that are more popular and more affluent.


If we are serious about implementing a new funding model—a needs based model—then we need to make sure we have somebody watching what is going on. In order to do that, to make a watchdog that has teeth, we have to amend the government's proposal tonight. It is essential that we do this because otherwise what we will end up having is simply a panel of people appointed by the minister to report to the minister when the minister wants, as opposed to a body that has true independence, is able to inquire into the issues that they see need exposing and answer the questions that they see are problematic and to run reviews where needs be.


I think there is also an expectation by the taxpayer and the broader public that if a body like this is going to act as a watchdog it must be able to report back to the parliament in a regular and meaningful way. The amendments that the Greens have circulated tonight would strengthen this body and make sure it is in the true spirit of what those of us who have been advocating for it for quite some time intend, both in this place and also outside—that we will actually see those concerns realised through this amendment.


I know that there are members of the crossbench who I have spoken to at length about the need to create an independent resources body. I would urge them that this is an opportunity to make sure we actually get it right. The things that we have put into this amendment simply give it proper teeth. They ensure that it is a body that will have integrity and do its job to ensure that we do shine a light on what is going on, so that the taxpayer, parents, students and teachers can have full confidence and know where the money is being spent and that it is actually being spent in the true spirit of needs based funding.


Of course, the other thing that this body should be able to do is to conduct a review of the SES model. We know that has been a concern amongst many. It has been raised several times tonight and it has been raised a lot over the last couple of weeks with the debate into this legislation. It is about having this body in place that would be able to run these types of reviews with true independence, away from us as politicians and away from the toxic politics that have consumed this school funding debate. Instead, it should be able to do it with a clear head and clarity, and then report back to the parliament to give us a true indication of what should be done going forward.


Along with the SES model review I would hope that a body like this would be able to do things such as review the way disability loadings have been characterised. This would ensure that the auditing and collection of data around students with disability is being done in the most accurate way. Is there indeed a better way of ensuring that we are able to identify the needs of students with varying elements of disability?


There are a number of fundamental things that this body could do and good work a body like this could undertake if, indeed, we got it right. So I urge the crossbench—the Nick Xenophon party and others—to consider putting some of these things in place tonight so that we can ensure that the resources body, the watchdog of this government schools funding, actually has the teeth to do its job going forward. I am happy to continue talking about this as we go tonight if anybody has any concerns.


By leave, I move Greens amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 8177, which are amendments to government amendments (1) and (7) on sheet GX167, together:


(1) Item 106, omit subsections 128(1) and (2), substitute:



(1) Independent reviews of the operation of this Act, and in particular of arrangements and requirements relating to funding for schools, are to be conducted by a review board (the National School Resourcing Board):


(a) on request by the Minister; or


(b) on its own initiative.




Review boards



(2) A review board must consist of at least 6, but no more than 9, members who:


(a) are appointed by the Minister; and


(b) in the opinion of the Minister, have suitable experience and expertise in the matters to be addressed by the review.


(2) Item 106, after subsection 128(6), insert:


(6A) An independent review of the matter mentioned in paragraph (7)(a) must be conducted at least annually.


(3) Item 106, at the end of section 128, add: 




Review board may pu
blish information and statement



(13) A review board may, at any time, publish information obtained or developed by it in conducting a review to bring to the public's attention an instance of the Commonwealth, a State, a Territory or an approved authority:


(a) not distributing funding on a needs basis; or


(b) funding a school below its share for a year; or


(c) funding a school above its share for a year.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (23:11):  I want to ask Senator Hanson-Young, in relation to these amendments, what she sees would be the effect of these amendments in the sense of whether the review would bind the minister. Regarding the mechanics of it, what effect would it have? The requirement to publish information statements is welcome, but how would Senator Hanson-Young see this working in the context of arrangements? Does she anticipate that the recommendations of the National School Resourcing Board would be binding on the minister? What effect would she see it having on the minister?

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,25,2
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-06-21,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (23:12):  The effect of this is simply that the recommendations would be made public and given to the parliament, and, indeed, the minister would have to respond. Obviously, this body cannot direct the minister. It would be up to the parliament and those of us responsible for ensuring that the minister does their job to follow through on those recommendations.


The main issue here, of course, is that the naming and shaming of systems or states or territories who are not doing the right thing ensures that, hopefully, everybody will agree that, if we are putting aside a lot of money from the Australian taxpayer to provide to various school systems, it is being spent in the most appropriate way and in line with the needs based model. We have spent quite a bit of time already tonight; we have spent a number of years as parliamentarians and as a parliament debating the need for needs based funding. When must now make sure that there is somebody, an independent body, to keep a watchful eye that that is actually happening.


It is useless, in my opinion, to put in place a body that is not required to report back to the parliament but is simply an advisory body to the minister. If we are serious about putting in place a watchdog, the watchdog must have the teeth to do its job properly. We should ensure that a review body can at any time publish information obtained or developed by it in conducting a review or can bring to the public's attention an instance where the Commonwealth, a state or territory or an approved authority—a type of school funding system—has not distributed funding on a needs basis. This parliament and the public should have the right to know about that. If a system, a state or a territory is funding a school below its fair share, this parliament and the public—Australian parents—should have the right to know about that. If a system, a state or a territory is funding a school above what it is fairly entitled to, this parliament, the taxpayer. parents across this country, teachers and principals deserve to know. If we are serious about needs based funding, we have to be serious about making sure it is going to happen.

 (Queensland) (23:17):  Senator Hanson-Young has raised some very important points. We do need a review board to ensure that they are accountable to the public with regard to this. I would like clarification from the minister with regard to this. Proposed section 128(10) in the amendment states, with reference to the reports of reviews:


(10) The Minister must:


…   …   …


(b) cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the report is given to the Ministerial Council.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2017-06-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (23:18):  I may need some advice from the clerks here as well, given that the opposition has amendments that were on revised sheet 2. Let me deal with it there for the moment. Opposition amendments (9) and (12) on sheet 8155 similarly deal with this issue, but we do not seem to have brought those matters together on the running sheet. I might commence at this stage with some general remarks in relation to a national schooling resource body, which will save me needing to deal with them subsequently if and when we get to Labor's amendments, and then I will deal with some further issues related to the government's proposals at this stage.


I have already mentioned that, when Labor established the review of school funding and passed the Australian Education Act 2013, we wanted to take the politics out of school funding and to end decades of sector being against sector in school funding wars. I acknowledge Senator Hanson-Young's comments, again, very much on that point. The opposition has revised thinking on that matter, given that clearly those wars have been reignited by the process that has occurred in more recent times.


Had the original Gonski six-year plan come through to fruition we would obviously be in a different place to what we are today. Instead, today we only have four years of what was a six-year transition to a shared student resource standard and, indeed, a situation where most schools would have reached their target in relation to that student resource standard. Now we have proposals that are still very unclear about how many schools will get anywhere near the student resource standard that was proposed under the Gonski review. Perhaps at this stage it might be worthwhile me asking the minister if he could, please, as a courtesy, provide me with his correspondence that has not yet been able to be tabled in response to the Senate's order for production of documents. It would be useful for us to understand what, if any, information has been provided to crossbench senators on that point.


But back on the point of the national schooling resource body: of course, we would hope that information would reside there independently, and that information would be publicly available and independently available. It would prevent the cherry picking of data that has occurred through this minister and the department to justify his case. It would avoid the politicisation of a Commonwealth department in the way that we have seen—a department that has produced things such as the schools funding estimator, which, seriously, is an embarrassment and a joke to any public officer.


If we can bring the independents into this issue we will be in a different place again, hopefully, to what was envisaged when the Gonski review first occurred. I suppose that, in part, that brings me to my first point in relation to the government schools resourcing proposal, which is simply for a board, not a standalone independent body. That is the concern which I will leave senators with to consider at the moment.


Back in 2013 we thought we had a bipartisan plan. As has been mentioned several times, the Liberals went to the 2013 federal election stating that they were on a unity ticket with Labor in regard to school funding and that the Liberals would match Labor dollar for dollar on school funding. Well, obviously, we are now in a very different place.


In part, I do understand when commentators say that the National Education Reform Agreement is dead. But I still grieve that loss. I grieve the loss of the consensus that had been achieved when Australian public policy shifted so significantly to where we are today. At that point in time we finally thought that we had bipartisan support to end the school funding wars and to ensure that each and every child, no matter at what school or which state they lived in, would receive their fair funding level.


Remember, at that point that was a combined funding arrangement, as was recommended in the Gonski review. In discussions today I have been saddened to hear some of the crossbenchers adopt this new rhetoric about 27 agreements. We all know that there were 27 agreements; it is how education in Australia had been delivered for decades. Each state and territory had a Catholic education system; a network of independent schools, including, often, some of the elite Catholic schools; and a government system. Each state had those arrangements. 


In fact, while Senator Hanson is here, I should make another point, because I think Senator Hanson needs to understand that the path that they have taken here is not quite what she understood arrangements to be. She made a contribution earlier today where she said that states do not fund non-government schools. Well, that it not true. States do fund non-government schools, and an element of the history here was that both the New South Wales and the Queensland governments some years ago started withdrawing their funding from non-government schools. That and the fact that states were also cost shifting and removing some of their funding for public schools was part of the political history that informed the overall Gonski review. The settlement that was sought and reached was that we would bring all parties together, as recommended by the Gonski review, into an agreed funding arrangement moving towards a common combined student resource standard. 


It was going to vary from state to state, because the states were starting at different points. Victoria, for instance: the reason it had a longer transition path was that it was starting from a lower base. Now, Senators, we are a federation and to suggest otherwise is a joke. You tell me any other area of Commonwealth funding policy that pretends things are consistent from one state to the other. You know it is not true, and how this minister has been able to befuddle the whole debate is a joke. You all know from your own states how policy and implementation differ from state to state. 


Take the GST as the classic example. So how this minister has managed to befuddle senators into thinking that one size fits all is beyond me. But let's go back to the issues around the national schooling resource body. I am sorry, Senator, you have accused me in the past of only focusing on Catholic schools; I am quite happy to address these other issues and, if your comprehension improves a bit in this area, I will be even happier. 


Back to the issues around the national schooling resource body—



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I wonder sometimes exactly what I have done to upset Senator Whish-Wilson, but, given that senators have listened with courtesy to other senators in this place—and I do not think anyone could characterise the length of my contributions as the opposition representative as being particularly extensive—Senator Whish-Wilson might want to digress to whatever else he was doing this evening. 


Back to the issue of the national schooling resource body: back in the 2014 budget, the government of course reneged on their plan. They cut $30 billion of school funding as was clearly detailed in the budget papers. Now they are saying they should be congratulated for putting only part of that funding back to schools. I am sorry: I do not congratulate them for that. The position that they took back in 2014 was an outrageous statement in terms of how they went to the previous federal election, and they should be called out on that each and every occasion that is possible. 


The record demonstrates that we cannot trust the government in general terms on school funding, so I was quite surprised at the last division to see the minister fail to answer questions about what consultation has occurred here. You tell us that you are lifting regulations up into the act, but you have not explored the potential consequences of that. You have not consulted adequately. The minister just sat there, refusing to provide any information on that point, and the crossbench all just trotted in here and voted with the government. That was astounding. If that is the way public policy is going to continue in this place, God help our parliament. It reinforces that if we are going to need independent bodies outside of the parliament to do the heavy grunt work, then maybe we do need to establish them. If we cannot rely on the parliament to comprehend the detail of these matters—and we certainly cannot rely upon this government and, unfortunately, even this department to provide honest data—then yes: perhaps we do need an independent body.


Remember that the government is moving from a sector-blind model by enshrining sector-specific targets of 80 per cent for non-government schools and only 20 per cent for government schools. I hope that an independent body will be able to show us the honest impact of that. For New South Wales, for instance, currently at 22 per cent—I cannot remember the precise figure—of the student resource standard, what will that mean? We have already had the Grattan Institute suggesting in their submission to the Senate legislation inquiry that states might want to retreat from their funding of non-government schools. Rather than encouraging increased funding, the bizarre effect of these arrangements embedded in this bill will be the suggestion that state governments retreat from their funding of non-government schools. I would like an independent resourcing body to be able to demonstrate how, or the extent to which, that might be happening.


We had the discussion earlier that one of the issues and problems in dealing with states and territories is that they do not all necessarily budget across forward estimates. I understand there may have been some changes in that area, particularly in Victoria; but if an independent resourcing body can watch and monitor state contributions to resourcing, that would be a good thing and that would be an improvement. That is because we still very serious doubts about how effective this government's proposal to introduce a stick is going to be. We will get to that debate later in the discussions on this. The provisions that the government is proposing to hold states to funding arrangements are not going to deliver that outcome.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",AC,2017-06-21,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (23:32):  I have a question for Senator Hanson-Young. In my earlier contribution to the second reading debate, I expressed the concern that there was really no educational accountability or outcomes attached to this legislation. Effectively, the government was writing what is now, instead of an $18.9 billion cheque, something in the region of $24 billion cheque—by tomorrow's newspaper reports—of funding for schools, with no responsibility or accountability to those schools for producing measurable educational outcomes to improve the literacy and numeracy of students.


This is a great concern, because it would be very easy for a school to seek to gather in additional students for the funding—because funding is based on numbers of students—but not actually get the educational outcomes that are necessary. For those who say that money is the answer to everything, you can look at the history of increased educational funding over the last 10 years or so and you can look at our status on an international ranking in maths, science, literacy, numeracy, common sense and civics. In fact, however you want to measure it up, on the traditional scale the education system is not working to the advantage of our children.


The outcomes are then somewhat deficient in later in life. Every child is now accepted into university, virtually. Whether they get the grades or not, whether they can read or not and whether they can write or not, they get a degree. Whether they actually do any study or not they incur a HELP debt or a HECS debt—whatever you want to call it and then they cannot get a job. In the end, the government is on the hook for the HECS debt and the HELP debt—which I might telegraph is scheduled to reach, I think, something like $85 billion within the next 10 years. By the government's own estimates, about 20 per cent of that will not be paid back. That is in the region of $17 billion--$17 billion not paid back as the result of a poor educational system that does not have measurable outcomes.


The result of this failure is not to say, 'Let's actually make sure we can climb the ranks,' and it is not to say, 'Let's make sure our kids can read and write and do basic arithmetic to a sufficient standard.' It is, 'Let's throw money at it and let the schools continue to do what they are doing,' which is not working particularly well.


When we are talking about having a review body, and I must say that this amendment was news to me, there is a part of me that welcomes it. I do believe that it is important to continue to review legislation. I have my own amendment coming up a bit later. I trust that those who support a review will support it, and I hope that the opposition will consider it. It is: let us not bind future governments. For those of you who have aspirations to be in government at some point in the future—and I am looking at you, Senator O'Neill—is it really fair that you are bound by the poor decisions of the previous government?


I did not think it was right when the Labor Party were in government and trying to pretend that they had funded a $40 billion education package, which they had not done. But this government is doing exactly the same thing, although 'slightly less worse' is how they would describe it. In fact, that was the selling point to me! 'We are slightly less worse than what otherwise might come down the track.' I would say there is a better way.


But nonetheless, what we should be doing is not only considering reviewing legislation, reviewing the outcomes and measuring those sorts of things but we should be forcing governments of all persuasions, when they are promising unfunded and unaccountable ongoing funding, to come back to the parliament after the forward estimates period. That is why my amendment, which we will be dealing with later—and I will talk extensively about that—




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I can't wait for that one!




Senator BERNARDI:
  I know you cannot, Senator Whish-Wilson! You will have to wait till tomorrow, unfortunately!




Senator Dastyari:
  Shame!




Senator BERNARDI:
  Excuse me, Chair, I heard interjection. I thought it was Senator Dastyari moving for an extension of time and hours for tonight. Was I right or not? I am happy to get that on the record and keep going for as long as anyone likes!


The point is this: if you are really serious about reviewing stuff it means that you also have to review the funding attached to it. So we might as well draw a line in the sand at some point and say that in four years' time we will have a revisit of the funding model, to see whether it is actually working.


Nothing I have seen in the government's position has committed it to actually delivering better results for students. Yes, they will deliver more money for some schools and they will deliver less money for some schools. It seems that this is a bit of a political fix and a political stitch up. They seem to have convinced some of the crossbenchers that this is a really good thing to do. But there is no responsibility attached to it. I think it is incumbent on all of us here at this late hour to consider just our obligation to our children, to students, to the budget bottom line and to the outcomes that we all desire for the benefit of our country. We do need people who are better educated. We do need better outcomes. We cannot afford to be below Kazakhstan in the science ratings, as I think we are. We cannot afford to be slipping down the rankings in every conceivable measure. Earlier today, Senator Gichuhi in her first speech—or her 'maiden speech' as us traditionalists like to refer to it—said that it was important that education comes through not only in a direct academic stance but that we also have to make sure that our children are informed about things like managing money, personal responsibility and things of that nature. In any measurable statistic, whether it be academia or just general life skills, I think our educational system is not doing a good service to our children.


This is the great concern. The government has not answered any of those sorts of things. I recognise that Senator Hanson-Young in moving this amendment is trying to redress in some way, shape or form that lack of accountability and lack of review. So my question is to Senator Hanson-Young. Does your amendment on sheet 8177 actually deal in any way, shape or form with measuring the educational outcomes rather than just the allocation of money? That is one of the gravest deficiencies of this bill. It appears to me that there are too many people in this place that really do not care about what happens to our children and whether they can read or write. They are just happy to throw money at them. But, as a parent, I can tell you throwing money at kids does not make them better kids; it makes them worse. It takes time and investment, teaching them things like how to learn and giving them experiences. Money is not the answer despite what the minister might be suggesting. Senator Hanson-Young—through you, Temporary Chair—that is my question. Are there measurable statistics attached to your amendment? I would really like to consider it if there were.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (23:42):  What I have tried to do with this amendment is empower the body to establish reviews where it sees fit. Of course we know the government is going to be asking David Gonski, for example, to conduct a review into various different elements of a number of the things that you are concerned about. If indeed this review body wanted to say after that process, 'Is there a reason why this particular school or this system that has been allocated this money is not getting these outcomes?' under these amendments the body would be able to empower itself to look into that and to report back. Why I am concerned with the way this body has been created to date and why I have moved the amendments is because it can only do reports based on the direction of the minister. I just do not think that is very independent. If indeed we are serious about having a body that can oversee what is going on, wants to pinpoint a problem, wants to investigate it and wants to make sure taxpayers are getting value for money then the last person who should be able to tell them what to do would be the minister responsible. It does not seem very independent to me.


I put to you, Senator Bernardi, that, in giving this body the power to initiate their own investigations and their own reviews with the power to report publicly and speak freely about their results without being shuffled through the minister's office, you might be pleasantly surprised that there is more than what is currently there.

It just seems you are putting the cart before the horse, and I think that is a question for the minister: what specifically is Mr Gonski supposed to be doing whilst your funding package comes into being or is being implemented? What are the measurable outcomes specifically attached to this education funding package? If you know what they are now, why is Mr Gonski going to spend 12 months or so trying to develop them for you?

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (23:46):  Thank you, Minister. Senator Bernardi makes some very good points which relate to the proposal we have in the subsequent amendments in relation to the independent body that we are proposing should be instituted, but what is relevant here in part, Senator Bernardi, is that some of the very issues that you are referring to were in the National Education Reform Agreement. Unfortunately, those provisions were not brought into the act, and the current government did not follow through on what had been resolved. Had they done so, some of what has occupied all of our time in recent weeks would have been settled long ago. For example, the government pretend to be committed now to a schooling resource standard, yet they have not conducted any of the original reviews that were agreed with the states and territories. The overall model and the loadings have not been reviewed.


You might recall that, in some of the earlier media commentary, we had suggestions that the disadvantage loading should be structured differently. That might have been an early consideration of the government. We do not know, because we have not seen any of this work. It may be that, if we had an independent student resourcing body that could look at the outcomes that the existing structure of the model was producing, we could have an informed debate about how well those loadings are operating.


As we have already mentioned, the indexation had not been reviewed. Now we have the government saying that, if the act continues as it currently is, there are all sorts of consequences. Part of the problem there was that the indexation review that should have occurred and been concluded by 2016 was not done, so the act continued in a way that had not been envisaged back in 2013.


I know you are not so interested in the issues around the outcome of indexation rates, but if we move to the next level, which is the SES calculation that determines how much base funding non-government schools get, it had not been reviewed. If that element had been drawn up into the act and guaranteed to have occurred, much of the debate that has occurred here and has created significant problems for a number of senators would have been settled well before now. If we are going to set up a body to be an independent student resourcing body, I think we should learn those lessons from the past and make sure it does all of the things that should be dealt with.


Senator Bernardi, I think your point about outcomes is very important. To the extent they may not currently be accommodated in the amendment that we have proposed subsequently, that is something that we can probably address overnight. But I agree with you: we need to have a student resourcing body that might be looking at PISA and TIMSS results and the like but also comparing them to the relevant issues that affect Australia rather than necessarily making some of the sometimes less relevant comparisons with other areas in the world, in sometimes not the most informed way. We could rely on an independent agency to do that in a way which depoliticises much of that debate.


Looking at our proposal and what we think a schooling resource body should be tasked with, the first is maintaining and reviewing the base SRS and the loadings for disadvantage, as I mentioned. We need to ensure that the underlying funding model matches the evidence about what schools need to deliver high-quality education. That, in part, fits with the ongoing work that David Gonski has been tasked to do, and that is where there might be some sense in looking at how we combine those two processes. It should be tasked with reviewing the SES calculation for the non-government school sector to ensure it accurately reflects the capacity of parents to contribute to their children's education. This is included in the Labor amendment that we will come to later; as far as we have been able to determine, this is not in this proposal as it currently stands.


The next issue that it should be dealing with is monitoring what states are contributing towards schools, which I mentioned earlier, to ensure that states increase funding over time so all schools reach their student resource standard within a reasonable time frame. Such a body might even recommend more appropriate ways of ensuring that that occurs. I have mentioned in the past that Labor's approach was the carrot; this approach appears to be the stick. If we were in an alternate universe where the carrot approach had been picked up by the government and agreements had been finalised with the states that had not yet signed on, and they too had been offered the $2 Commonwealth to $1 state arrangement, we would be far, far closer to having a combined student resourcing standard for all Australian schools. But this is not the approach that this government is taking and, if at the end of the day the crossbench and the government have the numbers for this new 80-20 Commonwealth-only share approach, we will need a body to hold to account how effective that approach is at ensuring that states make the contributions that they need to make to assist us to reach a student resourcing standard. As I said, states have very different accounting standards for how they manage these things, and we are going to need experts that have a good understanding of how those issues work to hold states to account. So we hope that that would be part of a role for a schools resourcing body.


Finally, the body would provide greater transparency about recommended funding for schools—transparency in a way which does deliver accuracy about the information that is being provided around what is happening with schools and, indeed, within systems. The Labor government got down that path some way with the My School initiative. Some senators, such as Senator Xenophon, who is in the chamber now, will recall some of the controversy about what went into My School and what did not go into My School and how accurate or well informed some of that data might be. The particular area I dealt with in detail was in relation to students with disability. Later in the debate, we will get to some of the concerns about whether the nationally consistent dataset is in the position we need it to be in to do the job we need it to do. Other senators have suggested that this area is an area where the student resourcing body could perhaps do some very constructive work. It could understand the concerns about how well moderated the current figures are. It could help explain the data—because the department has not yet been able to explain to me some quite alarming spikes in that data. If we roll out the data as is currently proposed and those spikes are not understood and managed, then we will end up with some very perverse circumstances where some sectors in states will have cuts in the amount of funding available for students with disability that are completely buried within these aggregate figures that the minister often talks about. And, if at the end of the day, the Senate chooses to go down that path, we will need an independent resourcing body to help us understand the outcomes of that approach so that, if we do need to revisit them, if we do need to redress them, we have accurate, reliable information. 


This is a very important discussion, and I am quite pleased to see the number of senators who have remained to listen and consider this factor. I suspect—




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  We are not listening!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Well, we know you're not! I suspect that this issue will end up being considered in a bit more detail tomorrow now, given that it is almost midnight. I think Senator Xenophon might want to make a contribution at this point, so I will leave the remaining time for him.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (23:56):  I was listening to Senator Collins' contribution and I am grateful for it. I just wanted to speak to the actual amendment and I think I might ask some questions of the minister in relation to the amendment, notwithstanding that it is Senator Hanson-Young's amendment. I just want to ask the minister about matters relating to it within the context of the amendments and in the context of this bill.


I will set them out in this way: in respect of subclause (1), is it the case that the national schools resourcing board can conduct a review on its own initiative—and does it have those inherent powers, or is it something that must be approved by the minister? The second question is: in terms of the review board publishing information and statements in subclause (3) of the amendment, are there any inherent powers now for the review board to publish information without having a specific authority as envisaged by this amendment? 


These are genuine questions about how it would work from the minister's perspective—and of course these are matters that I can also put to Senator Hanson-Young. I just want to understand what the government's position is about those two issues and, in the remaining two minutes and three seconds, I would be grateful if I could get an answer or it might be something the minister may want to take on notice until tomorrow.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (23:58):  I will do my best. So, Senator Xenophon, in relation to your question specific to the amendments from Senator Hanson-Young and the Australian Greens, the government is predisposed to supporting amendments (1) and (2) but not amendment (3). We acknowledge that there may be some benefit in having clarity for such a board to be able to initiate reviews of its own initiative and so would not oppose that. 


We do believe that already the provisions, as Senator Hanson-Young acknowledged, of paragraph (10) part 10 of our substantive amendment in relation to the national school resourcing board do already provide for publication of that via distribution to Education Council, the ministerial council, the non-government representative bodies and of course, ultimately, tabling within the parliament. 




Senator Xenophon:
  Was that the FOI?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Documents of the board would be documents that could be FOIed, Senator Xenophon, and indeed, as I think we have had some discussions elsewhere, they could also be asked to appear at Senate estimates.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (23:59):  Can I just thank the minister for his answer. It might be between now and when we debate this again—when we go into committee again—that I have some discussion for Senator Hanson-Young and the minister. I am pleased to see that the government is disposed to supporting subparagraphs (1) and (2). If the government is saying that clause 3 is redundant, that might be something to consider further as well. But I think, between now and tomorrow afternoon, we will have a chance to discuss this further.


Progress reported.
