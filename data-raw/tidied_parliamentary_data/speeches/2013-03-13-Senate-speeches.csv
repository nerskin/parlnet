Senator McEWEN
 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (09:41):  I would like to make a short contribution to this debate on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012, which is before us today. The federal government is very proud of its record of assistance to the rural and regional sector of Australia. I am pleased to have with me here today in the chamber the minister responsible, Senator Joe Ludwig, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This bill makes some amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. As a South Australian, anything to do with wine has much importance to me and my home state. I would like to take the opportunity a bit later in the debate to make a further contribution, but I notice that Senator Colbeck has arrived in the chamber. I will be pleased to hear from him.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (09:42):  In rising to make my contribution on behalf of the coalition to the debate on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012, which covers a number of different areas of the agriculture portfolio, I note that the coalition will be supporting the legislation. But there are a number of comments around the legislation and agriculture generally that I would like to make as part of my contribution.


This proposed legislation effectively makes some minor changes to a range of portfolio areas. As the government whip just noted, it makes some amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. It makes some modifications to the Fisheries Management Act 1994 to explain requirements for directions to close a fishery, particularly a specific part of a fishery, and also to correct some grammatical errors and delete some redundant text. The opposition supports those amendments.


It also makes some changes to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to allow the departmental secretary to consider requests made by levy payers for remission of penalties. It also makes some further technical amendments to the Fisheries Management Act, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act, the Export Control Act 1982 and the Quarantine Act. But none of the amendments make any substantial changes in substance to the law.


So, in that context, the coalition is quite happy to lend its support to the legislation, but I think it is pertinent at this stage to look at the way that the government has actually managed the agricultural portfolio. There is a long history of legitimate concern from the primary industry sector about the way that the government has managed this portfolio, and I suppose prime amongst those concerns would be the carbon tax. We are seeing right now the very negative impacts of additional cost imposed by this government on the rural sector, the farming sector and the fisheries sector right around the country. For example, in dairy, I acknowledge that there are global issues in respect of the market price and that the dollar is high, and that is having the impact, but that is being exacerbated by the additional costs imposed by this government through the carbon tax. The government has been trying to convince farmers that they are not subject to the carbon tax, but you tell that to a dairy farmer who has a quarterly power bill of $40,000 that is going to receive, and has received, a 10 per cent increase due to the carbon tax, or you tell that to the same dairy farmer, whose processor is also subject to significant extra costs. If their milk, for example, is going into milk powder, 30 per cent of the cost of producing that product is energy. The global market is not going to carry the cost; it is being sent back to the industry. We know that that is the case, because a number of organisations, including the government's own ABARES, have done some work to indicate that those costs will be pushed back to the agricultural sector. The government really has not understood that. Its line is, 'Well, agriculture's not subject to the carbon tax,' but agriculture is subject to the impacts. That needs to be remembered and understood.


Of course, if you live in Tasmania, the cost of shipping is impacted by the carbon tax. The minister came to Tasmania and was asked on Tasmanian radio about the costs of freight and the impact of the carbon tax on the costs of freight. The minister ridiculed the person who was asking the question on the radio, saying, 'You don't know what you're talking about, because freight is not subject to the carbon tax.' The minister did not even understand the impact of his own tax. I am not talking about the minister for agriculture; I am talking about Minister Albanese, the transport minister, who does not understand the impacts of the carbon tax on his own portfolio, much less the impacts that flow back to the rest of industry.


So it is important for the community to understand that this government continues to make decisions that are not in the interests of agriculture. We talk about being the food bowl for Asia and about sending our produce all across the globe, particularly into South-East Asia. Yet for seven years—two under the coalition, admittedly, but also the last five years—what has happened to the progress of the China free trade agreement? New Zealand commenced at the same time as we did and finalised theirs in three years. As of the beginning of this year, we are at a 15 per cent disadvantage for our fisheries sector into the Chinese market because this government has not progressed a free trade agreement. There is a free trade agreement with South Korea sitting there waiting to be signed. At the NFF blueprint launch a few weeks ago, the head of the NFF was asked, 'If there is one thing that the government could do for you, what would that be?' The very quick response was, 'Sign the South Korea FTA tomorrow.' Where is it? What is going on with that? How are we supposed to be providing agricultural produce from this country into those markets—markets that are growing and are demanding our product—if we are at such a significant price disadvantage compared to a country like New Zealand, which already has significant cost advantages over us for a number of other reasons, currency being one of them, but also labour cost?


We are seeing our food processing and our food manufacturing businesses go offshore because the government is not dealing with these particular issues. What it is doing is imposing additional costs. And so for an exporter to get licensed and to have export access, what has this government done? It has removed a 40 per cent rebate that assisted with markets, market development and access into those markets; it has made it more expensive to export. That is the legacy of this government; that is what it has done. It is forcing businesses to make the decision on whether they might stay registered as an exporter or not. That is what is starting to occur.


In the fishing sector, we have seen an increase in fees for access to some of the fisheries from $7,000 to $14,000 per unit for access to the fishery. And after huge swathe of industry players said, 'We can't afford that, we'll bail out; we'll surrender our licences', what happened next? The government changes the cost structure completely and makes it more affordable for these businesses to get in, but these businesses, having conceded their licenses, have no entitlement to get them back. The complete inconsistency in the decision-making of this government really does not stand up. The lack of consultation, the lack of consideration of the impacts of its decisions have been a real drag on the agricultural sector at a time when the global market and the dollar, because of the resource sector boom, have had a negative impact. And what has this government done? It has added additional costs over and above those broader economic conditions.


We have coming to us the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation that adds millions more to the cost of doing business for agriculture. How many more things can this government layer on top of all of the other impacts that it has had over the past four or five years? We have had a circumstance with access to markets where it just becomes slightly difficult to actually get into the markets. Lobsters into China has been a significant issue. I have to concede that the government, through the trade minister, has put into place a program to start dealing with lobsters and the supply chain project there, but that sat there for a couple of years while the industry suffered significant disadvantage. Bearing in mind that the New Zealand industry has a free trade agreement which gives it a 15 per cent advantage over the Australian fisheries sector, when you are talking about a commodity that is valued at between $65 and $95 a kilogram, then a 15 per cent disadvantage into that premium market is a significant one. That is having a major negative effect on our rock lobster sector, which is a major business for Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. We need to continue to work on the supply chain project, but where is the free trade agreement that is going to assist those industries getting into the country?


The relationship that we have with Indonesia has been so badly damaged by the decision to ban the live cattle export trade without notice. They heard about this on the radio after being told via our foreign minister the day before: 'Everything's okay. We'll continue to work with you. We'll sort something out here.' Then the next day a decision was made and the Indonesians found out about it on the radio. It is an absolute disgrace that we put countries and our trading partners through these things. How long is it going to take to repair the damage that has been done by that decision? Indonesia now says: 'Australia is a risk to our protein supply. We need to mitigate that risk.' And so from the situation where we were sending over more than 600,000 tonnes of product to them, we are now down to around 200,000 tonnes a year—and we will potentially receive further cuts. The relationship with China also needs to be managed. China is a huge opportunity for agriculture in Australia. In fact, it is one of the few really growing markets. If you go back to 2005-06, we were sending something in the order of $630 million worth of food to China. If you go forward to 2011-12, that is $2.1 billion. The growth in food sales from Australia to China was over threefold in that period of time. We hear complaints about the food imports from China which have grown by about $300 million in that same time frame, with imports less than doubling from China. How we manage our relationship with the Chinese has to be done in a way that continues to provide for that opportunity. 


I think that some of the scaremongering that goes on in this country around the relationship with China quite frankly needs to be reconsidered very carefully because, at the same time as there has been that threefold growth in our market to China, countries like the UK and the US, for example, have actually halved the amount of food produce that they are taking from Australia. So who should we be working with and who should we be maintaining a positive relationship with? Should we be going to China and in their language telling them how to run their own country? Is that the sort of thing that we ought to be doing?


Look at the circumstances that occurred around the management of the incursion of Asian bees where the critical scientist was not invited to the critical meeting to make decisions around whether or not to declare them endemic and if we cannot actually deal with them. Why didn't he get invited? Because we lost his email address. This is the most eminent scientist on bees in the country. He did not get invited to the key meeting to make a decision as to whether or not we think we can combat or eradicate the Asian bee incursion in and around Cairns. There are just completely absurd decisions. Something like 65 per cent of our agriculture relies on wild bees for its pollination. An incursion of Asian bees with varroa mite could wipe out our native bee population in two or three years. What is the potential impact on agriculture from that? Australia is the last continent on the planet that does not have varroa mite. We need to ensure that our borders are secure in respect of that and yet here we are at the critical point in time not inviting the guy who has the most knowledge about the issue to the meeting. It is just absolutely absurd.


In respect of something that is pretty close to my heart, the way that the government has dealt with the forestry industry in Tasmania is nothing short of a disgrace. The deal that they have on the table right now is being debated in the Tasmanian upper house. It basically spells the end of the native forestry industry in Tasmania by 2030. That is the effect of the deal. It is simple to work out. All you need to do is to look at the wood supply projections. The wood supply projections say that if you lock up half a million hectares that the government is proposing to lock up and harvest 137,000 cubic metres of category 1 sawlogs from now on, the industry will be gone by 2030. There will be between 25,000 and 40,000 cubic metres of category 1 sawlogs left by 2030. Industry will look at that and the decline will start straight away. Who is going to invest in an industry where the resource has a 17-year life? Who will make that decision? Yet that is what this government is doing to my home state of Tasmania. While the industry might continue to 2030, the death of the industry has already been determined if the Tasmanian upper house passes this sham legislation that is in front of it right now.


The government claims that a deal was negotiated between the environmental movement and the industry, and that is correct; it was. But the industry was negotiating for itself, not for the rest of Tasmania. And this piece of legislation deals with more than just the forest industry; it deals with the mining sector, the tourism sector and the agriculture sector. The absurdity is that this government is looking to move the forest industry out of the forest and into a plantation industry, which puts it onto our farmland. The proposal says that 20 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural land is to go under plantations—130,000 hectares. How is Tasmania supposed to be the food bowl of Australia—which is what is being claimed by some people in Tasmania—if we are going to put 20 per cent of our agricultural land into plantation? Why are we spending $400 million in Tasmania on irrigation development to irrigate trees? The complete lack of logic from this government—albeit Greens driven, because of their partnership with the Greens in this place and in Tasmania—is absolutely absurd. But here they are, proposing to take out one of the pillars of the Tasmanian economy. What was a $1.4 billion industry is now down to about $700 million but by 2030 will be zero. The native forest industry will be dead, because there is no viability in an industry where the supply volumes are between 25,000 and 40,000 cubic metres. It just does not exist.


That is what this government is doing to the forest sector, but it also applies to agriculture. And when you look at what they have done to the fishing industry through their management of significant fisheries issues over the last 12 months, taking political decisions rather than science based decisions, you get the picture. So, in respect of the marine planning process, they are doing deals with people in this place—a little piece here for a vote over there—and taking the side of the environmental groups over industry. If people in agriculture do not think they are next, they are kidding themselves, because once the environmental groups are finished with the forestry sector, the mining sector and the fishing sector they will come after them on the land. You only have to look at what they are doing in New Zealand.


This government's record in respect of the agricultural, fisheries and forestry sector is completely and utterly dismal—remember, they did not even have a policy at the last election. Having said that, the coalition will be supporting this piece of legislation.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2013-03-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:02):  I rise to speak in support of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. This bill makes some useful technical changes to a range of acts under the agriculture, fisheries and forestry portfolio, including the changes to wine labelling, which will implement changes that the industry has been calling for. As you know, the Greens are very committed to truth in labelling, whether it can be seen in wine standards or in the accurate labelling of ingredients such as genetically modified organisms and palm oil. I suspect that the next biggest issue relating to accuracy and truth in labelling to confront the agriculture industry will in fact be genetically modified crops. Recently we have begun to receive reports that Monsanto's genetically modified corn has begun to fail in the USA. There is growing consensus that GMOs are not the silver bullet that it was originally thought they would be and that in the meantime our farmers are beginning to command premium prices for non-GMO crops.


GMOs are and will continue to be a big issue for our farmers. At the very minimum, we need the robust engagement with industry and the willingness to listen to alternative voices from industry that are raising concerns about the impact of GMOs and the effect on their ability to command premium prices and to protect themselves from contamination. We believe it is essential that we introduce legislative protections for these farmers and for consumers the way we are introducing these protections for wine producers in Australia. Consumers have a right to know what they are consuming. Farmers also have the right to be able to label their products as GMO-free. You will recall that the Greens' and Senator Xenophon's private senators' bill on palm oil labelling successfully passed the Senate chamber last year only to become entangled in the House of Representatives in free trade issues and lobbying from the Malaysian government. So I have concerns that, despite the promising signs we see before us with this bill, there is no appetite to take on the other big issues that need to be taken on in labelling. My colleagues and I remain committed to truth in labelling. We welcome the work that has gone into resolving this issue and hope that the momentum will continue with other labelling issues, such as support for the country of origin labelling bill of my colleague and Leader of the Greens, Christine Milne, which is currently in the inquiry stage.


This bill also takes steps to correct a drafting error that was introduced two years ago when this government sought to introduce the legislative powers that would give substantive decision-making powers over the fisheries management at AFMA to fisheries users under a scheme of fisheries co-management. I want to take this time to reflect on the current state of fisheries management in Australia and the challenges that co-management faces. We need to look at what is good co-management. AFMA reports that a primary benefit of legislative powers to enable co-management comes from more cost-effectively administrating the fisheries. Admirable though it is to desire to ensure that there is efficiency in our public administration, we do not believe that efficiency alone is sufficient grounds for shifting responsibility in administration away from government. It is critical that the benefits we do achieve from co-management are not in fact short-term budgetary cycle gains at the expense of our ocean but actually lead to better management of our oceans.


As the Centre for Policy Development reported last year, our oceans are worth billions of dollars annually in tourism, recreation, carbon capture as well as commercial fisheries. Just yesterday in this place we had the release of Marine Nation 2025, which again clearly articulated the value of our oceans and particularly highlighted the potential value of what they call blue carbon. It is also important to note here the impact of climate change we are going to be seeing on our oceans. In fact, we have just seen that off the coast in my home state of Western Australia where we have had a marine heat wave, which has, as the name implies, increased the temperature of the water and has already resulted in impacts on commercial fisheries in terms of abalone deaths, impacts on the rock lobster industry and impacts on recreational fishers who for the first time are catching subtropical fish off the coast of Perth. While that may seem a bonus in the short term for those fishers, it has very serious ecological consequences. They also think that might be one of the reasons for sharks being closer to shore. That issue has had very substantial media coverage. It also has very important implications for fisheries management.


What did the minister for fisheries in Western Australia, Mr Moore, say? 'Hopefully, it is an aberration.' Well, it is not going to be an aberration. He was minister for fisheries at that time. Hoping it is just an aberration is not good enough. We actually need firm policy changes in order to look at how we manage our fisheries in a changing climate. The initial research on that incident has indicated that we need to be investing a lot more in research to look at what impacts this is going to have on our marine environment and then we need to be researching what adaptive management changes we need to be making. Above all else, leadership and community engagement are essential for these co-management changes. We need to confront a worrying trend where strong leadership and consultation are abandoned in favour of pitting the interests of industry against the other stakeholders, be they recreational users or environmentalists. How many times in this place have I listened to a beat-up, particularly from the other side of the chamber and the coalition, about the damage that changes to ensure sustainable, well-managed fisheries will have on that particular fishery, sometimes in the short term, and not taking the long-term consequences of business as usual into consideration? This does not constitute leadership, nor does it facilitate the kinds of meaningful engagement that fishers and fisheries managers need to have in order to pursue and ensure better management. It does not engender a good environment for co-management.


In 2006 the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation formed a working group to report on co-management in Australian fisheries. The working group report reflected the increasing recognition among fishers and fisheries managers alike of the need for a cultural change away from an untrusting, often conflicted 'them versus us' approach to one of partnership based on joint responsibility for decision-making and implementation in fisheries management. That is what they were saying needs to be done. The report talks about the transitional nature of the development from a centralised model to a delegated model. It is a staged process of development and not something that can be implemented immediately. It involves building relationships and trust so that a stage is reached where negotiated outcomes have been decided and functions and powers may be delegated to relevant stakeholders who then take on the responsibility of seeing that these functions are implemented within the terms of the formal agreement. The report describes a natural progression from a centralised model to a consultative model, which matures into a collaborative model and then, finally, results in a delegated model, where the people using the fishery are the ones operating the fishery and making the rules for it. I do believe this is a desirable outcome, particularly in having the users take a much more active role and greater responsibility for ensuring that their behaviours adapt to changing circumstances in that fishery. Business as usual should not be the opening assumption, particularly in these days of changing climate and overfishing in fisheries around the world.


However, before this greater control can happen, there needs to be cultural change, not just so that fishers see themselves as the managers of a fishery but also so that fisheries managers, whether they are fishers, policy makers, bureaucrats—and I mean that in a nice, loving way—scientists or whoever is involved, see the bigger picture. There needs to be a bioregional approach. Fisheries management has to stop being about individual targeted species, bycatch issues and how many tonnes you can take out before you start to undermine the capacity to restock—it has to start being about how actions within a fishery change that ecosystem and how that fishery is adjusting to ecosystem changes that are beyond our control such as, as I said, climate change and a warming ocean. Bioregional planning is not a new concept for this place, although by the reaction of some people in this place you would think it is. Both this government and the previous Liberal government—yes, under John Howard—have been working away for well over a decade and a half to comprehensively survey our marine environment and set up a world-class network of marine reserves based on the concept of bioregional planning. As you are aware, the process of bioregional planning is almost at the stage of being implemented around the country. Although the government did not go as far as some of us would have liked in terms of the areas that are protected by marine reserves, I am pleased to see that we now have a nearly national network of marine reserves that will help protect our marine life into the future. Marine reserves are the basis of good fisheries management—the basis of an ecosystemic approach.


But bioregional planning is not just about marine parks. It is an important tool for ensuring that we are making the best decisions for our ecosystem, based on more than just the value of fish stocks that are targeted in particular fisheries. We believe it is essential for good fisheries management. The bioregional approach to fisheries management has been painted as antithetical to the interests and goals of fishers. But an interest in fisheries management that is focused on ensuring a flourishing stock for future exploitation is a completely different mindset to that of a marine scientist, who can take a broader view about the intrinsic value of our marine system and see it not simply as a resource to be exploited but as an important piece of a bigger system that sustains a complex web of marine life. That is where we need to be changing our mindsets in order to be able to progressively go through the process of establishing co-management.


The 2010 amendment that introduced co-management powers also brought in changes to enable AFMA to rationalise the number of management advisory committees from 12 to six. This was promised to provide a more cost-effective and efficient consultative structure that would deliver better decisions and simpler administration and to enable the implementation of a dual advisory model. This will separate the provision of advice to AFMA: MACs will provide advice to AFMA on community interest issues, and advice on fishing operations will be provided by peak industry bodies.


The success of co-management should not be judged on the dollars that it saves our government and the extent to which it can pass on administrative overheads to the fisheries users, because this can encourage an increasing spiral of cost-cutting, rationalisation and emphasis on the margins, rather than inspiring collective effort, good long-term decision making and harmonisation between different models. The efforts to make a living today and to act as good stewards to the fishery, to maintain the health of the fishery and to see the fishery within the broader prospects of the bioregion, which is already under threat from multiple directions, need to be at the forefront of people's thinking.


I expect that finally giving the proper effect to this 2010 amendment, correcting the drafting error at a time when the bioregional planning process is moving from the research stage to the implementation stage, will mean that co-management is a very effective tool for shifting thinking about our fisheries away from just stocks and towards a more ecosystem based management plan. That is why we support co-management, but we believe that it needs to be done within the framework of understanding that there needs to be an ecosystem based approach.


The bill also repeals the States Grants (War Service Land Settlement Land) Act 1952. The War Service Land Settlement Scheme commenced in 1945 to assist returned soldiers into farming after World War II. Many areas in Western Australia, particularly on the south coast, were released under that scheme. Unfortunately, some of those areas of land should not have been released, despite the fact that the community was keen to help the returned soldiers. The truth is some marginal country was released and we are now paying for the consequences of that in excessive land degradation, loss of native species and loss of biodiversity. That is why we need to keep investing in natural resource management programs such as Caring for our Country and, in the past, the national Landcare program. I had the good fortune quite a significant time ago to work on the south coast in agriculture and on Landcare and salinity management, so I know firsthand the impact that clearing of some of the native vegetation had on that fragile land. We need to remember that decisions taken with a lack of information can have long-term consequences. I am extremely concerned that we are making decisions now that will have long-term consequences—or, should I say, not making decisions now that will have long-term consequences. On the front page of the West Australian last Thursday there was a story about farmers in my home state of Western Australia who are struggling with drought. The south-west of Western Australia is being hit the hardest by climate change. We have had dramatic drops in rainfall and high temperatures. We have had season after season when farmers are in drought or in rainfall deficiency. We are now faced with many farmers potentially having to walk off their land in the next season or considering not being able to put a crop in because they cannot get the finance. This is partly a consequence of the fact that we do not have adequate systems for agriculture in a changing climate because we have not invested in the research needed to enable our agriculture industry to adapt to a changing climate.


Ross Kingston, an economist who was working for the Department of Agriculture and Food in Western Australia, pointed out a number of years ago that our farmers in Western Australia are some of the most adaptive in the world. They have adapted to a changing climate, but they reached a point a number of years ago where they were unable to continue to adapt without a significant investment in research. That research is coming far too late, if at all. The Western Australian government invested only half of the money that they had allocated in their budget for research and climate change issues.


It is essential that we develop an agriculture system that can better adapt to the changing climate. I am deeply concerned about the future of agriculture, and Senator Colbeck was addressing the issue of the future of agriculture. Well, the future of agriculture is at risk through climate change in Western Australia—dire risk—because we have failed to take the necessary steps to invest in research and to understand what impact climate change will have on our agriculture. Various governments in Western Australia and in Australia buried their heads in the sand about the impact that climate change would have on agriculture. I do not want to see farmers walk off the land as a result of drought in Western Australia caused by climate change and our failure to adapt. We need to be taking action now before it is too late.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2013-03-13,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (10:22):  I rise today to speak on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. The coalition welcomes this bill as it attempts to simplify and remove some of the red tape associated with a number of agriculture related acts. It gives me great pleasure to join with Senator Colbeck in his comments and with Senator Siewert in her comments. I applaud the fact that the Greens recognise that we must remove costs, and I applaud the Greens' acknowledgement that farmers are struggling in Western Australia and in my home state of South Australia through what have been the vagaries of agriculture since we settled this land in 1788.


I think it is also an opportune time to talk about the fact that soil in this country has probably about 50 per cent less carbon stored in it than it did when we settled this country. That is an issue that we should be looking to address with our research and development, and trying to provide farmers in this country with tools of a scientific basis with which to improve their carbon. As we all know the Direct Action Plan of the coalition would seek to restore carbon levels in this country back to the levels of the time when we came here and to make it more productive.


This Labor government has certainly not been a friend of agriculture in this country so far. Those opposite may talk about Australia as being the food bowl of Asia but they certainly are not doing much to make it happen. Part of the problem is the actual representation on the other side of the chamber. Working for a city based trade union or spending time as a Labor staffer before getting the nod for a position on a Labor Senate ticket does not give a person much exposure to rural industries. Doing the numbers to eliminate factional rivals is a long way removed from meticulous circumstances with fishing, farming and fibre family businesses.


We on this side, however, have a strong rural and regional representation. Senator Colbeck himself comes from regional Tasmania, I from the Clare Valley in South Australia, Senator McKenzie from Bendigo in Victoria, Senator Williams from the bush in New South Wales, Senator Heffernan from Junee in New South Wales and my South Australian colleague Senator Anne Ruston from the Riverland in South Australia. All my colleagues, in some way or another, have a firsthand knowledge and understanding of agricultural issues and are able to successfully handle and negotiate those industry concerns.


This is clearly demonstrated by Labor's breakdown in Australia's free trade agreement talks with Korea. Senator Colbeck spoke so eloquently about the ramifications of having a trade barrier of 15 per cent on everything that is going into South Korea. How can agricultural industries grow and compete internationally when Labor's decision to ban live cattle exports and its about-face on the Abel Tasman fishing vessel are causing the international community to distrust the Australian government and remove opportunities for strengthening relationships and negotiation processes? With Australia's $1 billion-a-year beef export market to Korea, the coalition recognises the importance of signing an all-inclusive free trade agreement. The longer Australia delays finalising a free trade agreement deal with South Korea, the harder it gets for our beef exporters to stop the US trade push, which is outmanoeuvring this Gillard government.


Never mind the mess that Labor has made in Tasmania and the timber industry, also labelled a disgrace by Senator Colbeck earlier today, or the complete shambles in which its state counterparts in my home state of South Australia have mismanaged the forestry industry. The ongoing impact of the Forestry South Australia sale has led to job losses and small businesses downsizing or, worse, closing down. At all levels, Labor just cannot manage our productive industries in this country. It does not understand business. It is a 'tax and spend', not a 'support and grow', government.


Despite Labor's incompetence in agricultural industries, agriculture still contributes more than $5 billion annually in production to the South Australian economy, and more than double this in value-adding to Australia's small and medium-sized enterprises. On 13,475 farms, 31,400 people are employed in agricultural production jobs, with 146,000 in the food sector alone. Agriculture is very important to my home state of South Australia and it is one of our major export industries, so we need to make sure we have the right policy settings to allow it to continue to prosper.


This bill is a step, albeit small, in the right direction. It amends eight portfolio acts, including wine legislation amendments. There are a large number of small to large wine businesses in the regions, employing a large number of people, from grape growing through to tourism. The industry provides much-needed economic activity—specifically in my hometown federal electorate of Wakefield, where unemployment is approximately 9.4 per cent, nearly twice the national average. Outrageously, unemployment is up 50 per cent in the last 12 months across the entire northern suburbs of Adelaide.


This bill will make two amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. The first of these amendments relates to the Label Integrity Program, which seeks to ensure the accuracy of label claims on vintage, variety and geographical indication of wine manufactured in Australia. These changes will reduce the record-keeping requirements of people who supply or receive wine goods that are packaged for sale to a consumer. These are positive changes which will be welcomed by retailers, wholesalers and wine industry representative bodies.


The second amendment alters the definition of 'vintage'. It is up to a producer to choose whether they include the vintage on the wine label. However, if they do, they must follow the rules relating to vintage labelling. Currently a vintage year on a label is considered to be the period 1 July to 30 June the following year, and it appears on the label as the second of the two calendar years.


The majority of harvest occurs from late summer and finishing before 30 June; however, sometimes winemakers leave their grapes on the vines for a longer period in order to cultivate different flavours and create a higher sugar content—you might know that, Senator Williams, as botrytis. To allow for more accurate labelling of these late harvest wines, this amendment will change the definition of vintage year to be the period of 1 September to 31 August. 


Moves to simplify wine labelling are welcomed; however, there are moves to further complicate wine labelling and force winemakers to mandate unproven labelling requirements. For example, the Blewett review contained a series of recommendations that would significantly impact the wine sector. These included pregnancy warnings; mandating energy content; warnings as a part of broader health campaigns; minimum font size; contrast levels and boldness for warning messages and allergens et cetera; and clear 'Made in Australia' terminology and existing label compliance.


These and other spurious claims made by extremists made under the guise of health claims will only add regulation and bureaucratic red tape. How soon before the health zealots, emboldened by their success over the tobacco industry, start demanding similar so-called health warnings on the labels of wine containers? Make no mistake: well-meaning but poorly guided health groups will be pushing to get their way with their messages on labels. Backed by sympathetic academics wheeled out to speak for narrow-interest pressure groups, they will want wine and any other forms of alcohol to get the same treatment as cigarettes in terms of nonpromotion in an oversimplification of the debate which, if the wine industry does not respond to these insidious representations, it may face a campaign of misinformation and dumbing down of the facts.


Going back to the bill, it also contains some useful amendments to fisheries and levies legislation and some technical amendments. This bill will also repeal the now redundant States Grants (War Service and Land Settlement) Act 1952. Just as a point of interest, some 755,000 acres of land were acquired under the scheme in South Australia.


While this Bill may reduce some much needed red tape, there is so much more that this government could and should be doing in the agriculture portfolio. Of particular concern is educating our future work force—where are our trained and skilled agriculturalists going to come from? Only 800 agronomists are being trained in Australia each year when the demand is for around 5,000. What support is being given to agricultural industries to promote the increase of resources and opportunity for future sustainable practices?


There is an apparent disconnect between the need for more secondary school students to undertake science based courses, particularly those that have relevance to primary production and the information being provided to them when they are choosing courses for not only their late secondary years but also tertiary.


I have concerns that many school career advisers either do not mention courses with an agricultural component as a potential career or are consciously discouraging students from studying them. We need to increase the proportion but we need to be strategic about how we resource that increase to ensure that there are no gaps. Rural industries have concerns about their potential workforce in the future. Filling the increasing void between the number of jobs and the dwindling number of trained candidates is a worrying trend.


This issue needs to be viewed in light of Labor's crackdown on the 457 visa scheme and the concern amongst business leaders as to the damage this does to confidence, investment and ultimately economic growth, job creation and incomes. Increasingly, businesses are looking to bring in workers from overseas to fill the vacancies and, while I have no problem with bringing in skilled and unskilled labour, it is an issue when you have areas like Wakefield with 9.4 per cent unemployment and 42 per cent youth unemployment in its northern suburbs.


Thousands of people are in a position and want the opportunity to be working but they just do not have the right skills. Of equal concern, education and the support of careers in the agriculture sector are not given enough attention when developing industry growth mechanisms. It is important that a balance be struck in building agricultural industries in Australia. A holistic approach must be taken when considering developing local education, training initiatives and foreign labour opportunities.


Furthermore, of paramount importance with this approach, it is crucial that we continue to promote agriculture in this country. Agriculture is one of our great strengths. It is one of our areas of true competitive advantage. Our farmers successfully compete against other countries without the same kinds of subsidies or government assistance. This is why we must continue to reduce the red and green tape for our farmers, something which this bill thankfully does.


But it does not go far enough and that is why the coalition is committed to taking over $1 billion of red bureaucratic tape out of our economy, helping our producers and businesses to be more productive and internationally competitive. That is why the coalition in our plan of real solutions for all Australians has agriculture as one of core pillars in our plan for the economy. We will build on our comparative strength in food production and better manage our precious water resources to help our agriculture sector truly become the food bowl of Asia with food security in a world demanding more of our food resources. We will support our fishing industry and review the declaration of the marine protected areas. Unlike Labor, we will establish genuine consultation with the fishing industry on research and strengthen the connection between science and sound fishing policy. Most importantly, the coalition will provide policy stability and certainty to our agricultural and production exports, particularly live exports, unlike Labor, who so flippantly shut down the trade overnight that day in June 2011. 


Labor continued to add insult to injury when Mr Kelvin Thomson, Labor member for Wills, was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary for Trade. Mr Thomson told the ABC's PM program on 18 September 2012: 'We would be much better off if we transitioned out of live animal export altogether and moved towards domestic processing.' This is not the kind of talk live cattle producers want to hear from their Parliamentary Secretary for Trade. It doesn't provide the kind of certainty producers need and the coalition will provide. It does not provide the certainty that the bankers of cattle producers across northern Australia want to hear. It does not provide the security that the Indonesian government, looking to feed hundreds of millions of people, would like to hear. 


Agriculture and farming communities deserve to be given a fair go and the coalition is committed to deliver opportunity so that industries can grow and successfully compete on equal playing fields both domestically and internationally. I will support the passage of this bill but lay at the feet of the Labor Party that it could have been more extensive reform. But it seems they are still burdened with the yoke of the Greens and their socialistic ways.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-03-13,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:39):  This bill, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment bill (No.1) 2012, makes a number of changes to the acts that relate to agriculture, fisheries and forestry legislation, including the Wine Australia Corporation Act on which we have heard from Senator Edwards some very detailed deliberation; and the Fisheries Management Act, with a direction to close a fishery under statutory fishing concessions. I should note that Australia is overwhelmingly now an importer of fish. I think about 72 per cent of our fish is now imported, which is a disgrace. It is absurd that we have countries outside our zone collecting vastly more fish than we do. Basically we are creating a mechanism to feed Taiwanese and Papua New Guineans and whoever else wishes to turn up with their fishing vessels. We should have a greater capacity to manage our own fishery and to provide for the Australian people more of their own fish. We have heard even lately the huge concerns out there about the use of excessive antibiotics in farmed fish, especially coming out of Vietnam. This causes real health concerns in Australia. The Australian people should be aware that if you want to create a mechanism for the consumption of a superbug you are going about it the right way if you are consuming fish that come from an area where there has been an excessive use of antibiotics, so that you basically create an environment where the only form of bacteria that will survive will be the one that is resistant to antibiotics and you have served it up with peas and carrots at your dinner table. I do not think that is a very clever way to do business. What I would be doing is consuming fish caught from the wild in Australia which has all the natural forms of challenge and response affecting its life as opposed to what you are getting when you are buying a product that is imported. It might look like the domestic product but I can assure you it is totally and utterly different. So we have a role in the future to start informing the Australian people about the fact that we have a better product, that there is the capacity for a better utilisation of our fishery resource and to make sure we using more of that to feed the Australian people with a product they wish to purchase.


The legislation also deals with the Fisheries Administration Act and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act, which is basically going to enable the secretary to remit all or part of a penalty imposed for the late payment of the levy or charge. It also deals with the Farm Household Support Act to remove specific references to departments and secretaries. The coalition supports these changes because they streamline administration and reduce costs for the industry in some instances. But it is unfortunate that this bill is not reflective of the government's broader approach to our primary industries. Australia's agricultural exports still account for more than 20 per cent of our exports. 


We have to realise that we should never get confused between the GDP argument and where the money in reality actually turns up. In the chamber here at the moment there are seven senators, eight with you in the chair, Mr Acting Deputy President. If we have a case where someone brings in $10 and spins it around to every senator in this chamber, they say, 'Whoopee, the GDP of this chamber is now $80.' That sounds great. They will say, 'That is $80 and around 88 per cent of it came from all those people inside the chamber, who are the service sector. Therefore the service sector is incredibly important.' But the reality is that if the gentleman in the chair had not put his $10 forward first then no-one in the chamber would have any money, because it is that money that has been spun around. So the actual delivery of money into the economy, the actual delivery of funds in a primary source, is vitally important for the economic sustenance of this nation, and 20 per cent of that comes from the agricultural sector. Then you have mining, obviously Australia's biggest export. It is for our own survival as a nation that we must be cognisant of where primary industry is going and we must make sure it is sustained. I know the farming sector has always been the harbinger of people who have generally got a gripe. I grew up in that sector and I am still part of that sector. But now there really is a problem. We are losing farmers. They are going out the back door. I went to Western Australia and spoke to farmers there. I went there as a politician and I came away feeling like a psychologist. It is quite disturbing how much under the pump they are. In the wheat industry they have been frosted and they are dealing with the corruption of global world prices by reason of a manipulated global currency. In Western Australia they had the live sheep trade, but of course those in the radical environmental movement want to shut down the live sheep trade. We are just making people destitute. We are making them poor. We are destroying their quality of life—and, in so doing, we are doing it to ourselves.


There are 134,000 farm businesses in Australia and there are 307,000 people employed in Australian agriculture. That is vastly more than is employed in the mining industry—vastly more. People are always thinking that the farm sector does not pull its weight, but from 1974-75 to 2003-04 it grew just shy of three per cent per annum. It was consistently outperforming other sectors. So, when you are looking for productivity increases, the farming sector—when it has the right government policy surrounding it—will actually deliver it. When I started in the cotton industry, we used to budget on 2.7 bales to the acre. There are 2.471 acres to the hectare, but we were still working on acres. So it was about 2.7 bales to the acre, and with that it was thought that you were doing the job well. Now it is four bales to the acre. Imagine if we could do that in other sectors of our economy. The economy would boom. We have been doing that in agriculture.


I remember when there was a discussion about GPS. They were going to GPS for the delivery of the chemical requirements of the land, because we needed to save money. If you look at the scope and structure and carcass size in the abattoirs, you see that it has gone up immensely. The marbling content has gone up immensely. The quality of the product has gone up immensely. There have been real productivity increases, but we cannot be constricted by certain regulations which are more emotive than realistic. The inclusion of buffel grass into the pasture in red soils has given us an incredible increase in the capacity for the delivery of protein per acre off country which otherwise is not able to deliver an outcome. There have been watering issues. In my own family hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent on piping and boring groundwater to save that resource. That is why we get so hot under the collar when we hear about coal seam gas and other people utilising the resource without the same sanctity with which we hold that water resource. These are the things that agriculture has been delivering.


This has been one of our strengths for so long but we are now losing farming families. There are 100,000 fewer farming families now then there were 30 years ago. Even the size of our agricultural area is reducing. In 1980 we had about 496 million hectares of farming land. In 2010 there was just shy of 400 million hectares. We have lost about 100 million hectares of farming country. If we look anecdotally at one of the industries that was at one stage the key of the providence of this nation we see that in 1980 we had 136 million sheep and in 2010 we had 68 million sheep—and it is going down even more.


This is a sign that our policy structure is not correct. There is an epiphany we have got to have as we go stammering and tripping along to an election, who knows when. If we want to have a real debate—something that the Australian people will be engaged with—another area that we should be looking at is farm policy. We need to look at how we make sure that we keep these people on the land, how we make sure that we give a fair return to people on the land and how we make sure that we are part of a process that actually deals with issues. Anybody can have empathy. Empathy is easy. Just stick on a pair of elastic-sided boots, put on an akubra and talk out the side of your mouth and you have got empathy all worked out. But that just does not cut it.


What people are looking for now is policy that is going to address the needs and requirements of the industry to bring a future back into agriculture. The only way that you will get a future in agriculture is if you are determined to bring about a fairer outcome at the farm gate. There are a range of things that have been working against us at the farm gate. First and foremost we have the dollar. We have the United States which is in a period of quantitative easing; we have the Chinese who have basically manipulated their currency and tied it to the Americans who are printing their own dollars; we have the Europeans who are in a period of quantitative easing and subsidies; and we have England quantitatively easing. 


We have to starting asking the question: are we going to be pure in debt? Are we going to be the people who never broke a rule but we all went broke? The return at the farm gate is getting smashed by the global corruption in the currency market. What is the government's policy for this? How are they going to deal with this? Coming up with a constructive outcome in that area would be vastly beneficial. You can do that in a Giorgio Armani suit with Jimmy Choo shoes on, and that is going to be a vastly better outcome than wearing an akubra hat and elastic-sided books and not having anything really to say.


There is also the exploitation of the farmer by an overcentralised retail market. In the past it was like: 'Oh, we can't talk about that.' Well, we have got to talk about that. It is just unnatural. We are the only place in the world that has the form of centralisation that we have got—except North Korea. It has probably got more centralisation than us. But, apart from that, we are it. There is nothing wrong with a company being powerful—good luck to Coles, good luck to Woolworths; well done—but there is a problem if they use that market power for the exploitation of the farmer. We have a Competition and Consumer Act that talks about the competitive stresses between two competitors in a market, but it does not properly address the exploitation between the supplier and the retailer. It does not properly deal with that relationship. We should have a policy discussion—the coalition has a root-and-branch review, but that is a policy discussion that the government should also be engaged in. How do we go about bringing a fairer term back to people?


The obvious example out there is $1-per-litre milk. You cannot produce milk for a $1 a litre—not on the farm. By the time the processer has had a chop at it and the retailer has had a chop at it, it is corrupting the marketplace. The retailers say, 'We're not affecting the farm price,' and they are right, because they buy it off the processer. The processor says, 'We can't do anything about it because we're supplying the retailer.' And the farmer just suffers. We have to go into the space and say that we want Coles and Woolworths to survive, prosper and thrive, but we cannot do it at the cost of exploitation of people on the land. We cannot have people turning up with the unilateral variation of contracts. If we did it to a wage and salary earner there would be an outcry. Imagine turning up to a wage and salary earner and saying: 'You know how I was paying you $800 a week last week? This week I've decided I am going to pay you only $300 a week, and I know you have nowhere to go.' If we did that to individuals people would be disgusted, but that is happening to farmers and we are all sitting back and saying: 'Oh, that's shocking, but we can't say anything about it. We can't interfere in the market.'


When there is exploitation it means that the market principles are not at work. The situation is devoid of the market principles, and when it is devoid of market principles then you have a role for bringing about fairness. If there were ease of entry, ease of exit, transparency in negotiations, multiplicity of players—with those sorts of terms you could say, 'I'll walk,' but farmers cannot do that, especially in the horticultural sector. Tomatoes, peas, carrots, onions—those farmers get held over a barrel. They are terrified to talk about it because they know that if they talk about it and the major retailer finds out about it then they will get cut out and go broke. We found out that the average price a dairy farmer is working for is $7 an hour. Who in this building would work for $7 an hour? Who in Australia these days would work for $7 an hour? If you want to look after working families then where is the policy that deals with that?


We need new infrastructure and we need to open up new areas of irrigation. We need to have a future. There is a great capacity, especially in the north of this nation and with the utilisation of genetic modification in some areas, for the advancement of agriculture in these areas. You cannot say: 'I'm a friend to the farmer but I don't want any new farming areas. I'm a friend to the farmer but I don't believe in the live cattle trade. I'm a friend to the farmer but I want to make life even tougher for the people of south-west Western Australia who are dealing with the live sheep trade. I'm a friend to the farmer, but I believe it is morally justifiable that some Australians today, in the year of our Lord 2013, are getting paid $7 an hour.' That is not being a friend to anybody. If we are going to be fair dinkum about this we have to have an holistic view and say, 'Right, we're going to walk into this space and before this election we will make sure we are not talking about who said what to whom, and having some peripheral personality discussion in the election, but that we will be having a discussion about concrete policy issues that involves the Australian people and that brings us to a conclusion that is a betterment to the agricultural sector, because the Australian people need the agricultural sector.' We really do need it.


We have to look at the ethos of it. In my own small way I am trying to be part of the dams task force to build dams and create another mechanism of investment in agriculture, and I think that is positive. We have to touch base with the marketing department in trade. We are having real problems. It is no good going over to Beijing, Taipei, Tokyo or Seoul and coming back with photos full of happy, smiling people drinking cups of tea, but with no contract. You have to come home with something hard, something that shows you have opened up the market, something that shows a new form of advantage. We cannot develop new agricultural areas if we cannot move the product. We have to be able to follow that through, and that is something that needs a succinct group of people who work as closely with the Prime Minister as possible, who have the capacity and the runs on the board to deliver trade outcomes. We have to get them to work.


Minister Craig Emerson is supposed to be the trade minister, but what has he ever brought back? What has he ever delivered as a trade outcome? What is a deal that he has structured for us? If he were good at his job then farmers would be doing it better, but they are not—he has failed. Whenever I think of Dr Craig Emerson I have a picture of a man doing a dance in our courtyard. I cannot get it out of my head. I cannot see how he could be the trade minister. Now we have Minister Kelvin Thomson assisting him. The last thing I remember about Minister Kelvin Thomson is that he wanted to shut down the live cattle trade. In fact, he was playing his banjo at the Midwinter Ball and shutting down the live cattle trade. This is not much use to us. This is not much of a help. To give him his due, in the past Minister Simon Crean was not a bad agricultural minister, but we do not have him now. And Minister Burke has enough problems of his own at the moment.


We have to engage in this discussion about how a farm sector that is truly under the pump can be picked up and moved forward. All Australian people look to the farm sector as representative of how competent we are. They empathise with people on the land because they know they do it tough—and they do. They recognise that every farmer is also an agronomist, a veterinarian and a diesel fitter, and they do it for nothing. People recognise that they have done what the nation has asked of them: they went out west and scratched a living out of the dirt to provide a providence for this nation. We owe it to that farm sector to go back to that space right now and start coming up with a farm policy to bring forward at the election so that we can deliver a better horizon for them right now.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-03-13,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:59):  I also rise to speak on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I would like to congratulate the government and the department on a bill that aspires to do such fantastic things, some of these things we really support not only throughout the agriculture, fisheries and forestry legislation but right throughout the government's work. It reduces red tape, creates clearer Commonwealth laws and improves the effectiveness and efficiency of regulation. I would encourage the government, having taken this very small step, to take some giant strides using this same underpinning principle right across its portfolios. It shows that the department has been listening to industry with the future in mind. The coalition obviously will be supporting measures by the government to reduce regulation and make things simpler for those who live outside capital cities and work in agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries.


The bill before us will make minor amendments to eight portfolio acts to improve the operation of the existing legislation and make some technical amendments. As I have mentioned, the bill will reduce red tape. This is fantastic considering that the current regulatory ratio for this government is 200 to one: 200 new regulations in, one out—quite a poor performance. So we are absolutely going to be supporting some streamlining efforts here today. It is going to reduce complexity and unnecessary regulation, and I welcome that. I particularly mention a group within the agricultural sector: the chemical suppliers. Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 is another bill we have been debating lately. The inquiry that we have been having in the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport committeehas shown that the government's changes under that particular group of new regulations is going to be quite significant to industry. 


The regulatory impact statement of that legislation called for 'better regulation of agriculture and veterinary chemicals'—better for whom? The Deloitte Access Economics report showed there had been increasing costs of $8 million per year to product registrations. How does that actually help farmers compete globally and become the food bowl for Asia? There is no clear cost-benefit analysis done, but then again this government has form. Maybe it almost has an aversion to cost benefit analysis. When we think of the NBN, if only it had done one it might tell a different story today. Chemical registration has increased by nearly a third, increasing not just the cost but also the time. This is the time that it takes people working in the sector to do the audit. As it is reviewed every five years, they are going to have to redo this.


One of the acts that will be amended is the wine legislation amendments. Schedules 1 and 2 of the bill make two amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. The first amendment relates to the label integrity program. We know how important having integrity and truth in labelling laws is, particularly to the agricultural sector. Research shows that Australians want to buy Australian products. They need to know that it is an Australian product. There needs to be no deception about what proportion or percentage of the product before them on their supermarket shelves is home-grown, homemade and owned by Australians. We need to be supporting labelling laws that give truth in labelling.


It is useful to know that these changes to the wine legislation amendments are supported and agreed to by the retailer, wholesaler and wine industry representative bodies. As Senator Joyce mentioned, it would be great to get all of those players around the supply chain on the same page when it comes to dealing with issues, particularly around supermarkets. There are significant issues in our community right throughout the supply chain in how suppliers and processors are dealt with all in the name of chasing a cheap product for the end consumer. I am sure that, if consumers were made aware of what was occurring further back in the supply chain, they would be more than happy to adjust their spending habits.


The second area that is going to be amended under this bill is the fisheries legislation amendment. Schedule 3 of the bill before us will amend theFisheries Management Act 1991to explain requirements for directions to close a fishery or a particular part of a fishery to fishing. The government has form in that area too. Whilst tightening regulation and reducing red and green tape is commendable in this bill, there are issues around fisheries legislation with this government that need putting on the record. We have argued this time and time again in this place over recent times.


We have the best managed fisheries in the world. We use science to manage those fisheries. It has been quite interesting how this government has chosen to be a subscriber of scientific method and scientific outcomes when it suits them. The Abel Tasman decision was a triumph of politics over science and one that increased our sovereign risk as a nation. If you go out into the community and talk to our fishers right around the country about this government's track record in supporting them, you will find a very different story.


The third area that will be addressed in the bill before us is the levies legislation amendment. Schedule 5 of the bill will amend the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to allow the departmental secretary to consider all requests made by levy payers for the remission of penalties. It actually is providing recourse for those who are paying levies and for the variety of levies as we have moved to a user pays system across various aspects of our agriculture, forestry and fishery industries. At the moment, the provision applies only if the levy is over $5,000. This change will actually allow anyone who is paying a levy to make a request to the departmental secretary for the remission of that penalty. That is a good decision, because whilst $5,000 might not seem a lot of money to some people, for small businesses that are working within these industries and paying these levies that amount can be quite significant in terms of their operating costs. 


Schedule 6 of the bill makes technical amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, the Export Control Act 1982 and the Quarantine Act 1908. We support this bill and we welcome the changes the government has made, but when we talk about research into agriculture, yes, we can fiddle around and make technical amendments, as we are doing in this bill, but this government has not supported agricultural research. We have seen cuts to CSIRO funding and cuts to agricultural R&D over time and all the time. If we are going to develop and drive further innovation in our already highly efficient and effective agricultural sector then R&D funding is essential. Senator Edwards, in his contribution, made reference to the lack of undergraduate students in our agricultural education degrees, and that is a huge concern for those of us who have a passion for agriculture and sustainability of our local communities in regional Australia. We need to get more young people interested in and studying agriculture. If they are not going through at the undergrad level, we are not producing any great researchers at the postgrad level. I notice Senator Siewert nodding, as a proud holder of an agricultural science degree. We need to be producing a high proportion of undergrad ag scientists so that we can have the skills and expertise that are specific to our nation, to our farming methods and to our land and that will allow the research and development required to drive innovation for our agricultural industries. This government has poor form in that area—a lot of talk but no action.


The bill also contains amendments to modernise the language in two acts. Talking about modernising language reminds me of something I have been thinking about which does have a regional perspective. In looking at legislation around education—which I have been doing this week—I note that the government wants all schools to teach one of four Asian languages to all students in our nation. It can be Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese or Indonesian. My issue is that we are not graduating enough teachers from university who are specialised in these languages as it is now—let alone enough to be putting them right across the country. I am thinking of places like Wycheproof and Echuca, and right throughout regional areas. If we cannot fill our LOTE requirement in our capital cities, I am really struggling to understand how we are going to do it out in the regions.


The bill will also be amending the Export Control Act. That brings me to another Labor failure in the agriculture portfolio, and that would be the live cattle exports. I am sure that others have made worthy mention of this government's poor track record in dealing with that issue, such as the damaged relationships with our Indonesian neighbours and the crisis that is occurring on farm, even today, as farmers deal with the fallout of decisions made for political reasons, as a reaction to public pressure rather than in a leadership-focused manner. 


The Quarantine Act 1908 will also be amended by the bill. When I think about the Quarantine Act and agriculture, I think about the New Zealand apples issue from last year. In my own home state the Goulburn Valley produces 80 per cent of the national pear crop and a significant amount of our national apple crop, and the biosecurity issues around the importation of New Zealand apples had a severe impact on that community in terms of confidence and in terms of what this government understands about how they live, how they work and what they require in terms of leadership from a government out there in the regions. This was all going on at the same time that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan consultations were happening right across that area of northern Victoria, and it led to huge uncertainty and a huge lack of confidence. If this government were serious about supporting agriculture, fisheries and forestry, it could do more around quarantine and biosecurity. It could do more to support our potato growers and our ginger growers. We have so many inquiries into biosecurity issues within the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee at the moment, it seems that this whole area needs to be looked at and the government needs to get serious about supporting our industries and protecting them—and I am not afraid to say 'protecting our local industries from international threats.' When I go back to Shepparton I think of the closed shops right around that area as a result of a combination of this government's response to environmental watering and their relationship with the Greens. 


Schedules 7 and 8 make some other amendments. Schedule 7 will amend the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to remove specific references to departments and secretaries in the act so that when changes are made to the administrative arrangements orders the act will not require amendment. With respect to the Farm Household Support Act, I am still waiting to hear from the minister on an act of grace payment around farm exit grants. So, when we are talking about supporting farm households, they are doing it tough. As Senator Joyce outlined, they are not just dealing with a decrease in income; the increase in input costs for farms is ridiculous. 


I was out at Tongala with the dairy farmers with Senator Joyce a few weeks ago, hearing their direct tales. This carbon tax was not actually going to affect agriculture, but the impact on our dairy farmers has been significant. There are people who cannot pump water because of the carbon tax. There are people who have to pay exorbitant electricity costs to keep their milk fresh and safe for human consumption, costs that have just risen exponentially under the carbon tax.


It was not just increased electricity costs and input costs; they were talking about increased labour costs and increased costs of fertiliser—right across the board, their inputs are increasing. You just cannot keep doing this. You cannot keep absorbing. Across the way says: 'It's only a one per cent increase. It's only a 0.5 per cent increase'. But, when your margin is less than four per cent, that very quickly adds up to an unsustainable business, and that is what we are dealing with. It is as a result of an increasing number of green and environmentalist agendas right throughout this government. 


The coalition is interested in reducing not only red tape to our small businesses but also green tape. It is very disappointing that the federal government has walked away from negotiations with the states to streamline the assessment and approval processes under the EPBC Act. There was a commitment that all levels of government would work together to ensure that our environment is protected and our businesses can still make a dollar. It is not rocket science; we have just got to make it simpler, without sacrificing the environment. It is possible if we work together and worry less about the fallout in Brunswick and more about the actual outcomes. 


I am reminded of the Prime Minister's visit to Western Sydney last week. I mirror the concerns of the National Party leader, Warren Truss, when he very sensibly asked the Prime Minister to spend a week in regional Australia, living and working with us, seeing firsthand the frustrations that we experience. No, we are not congested with traffic, but we have a lot of other challenges—don't we, Senator Ruston, out there—challenges that the Prime Minister would do well to actually see and feel firsthand—not just fly in for the photo op, for the flood or the fire, but to actually come and see how we live and work, and understand us. And then maybe this great bit of legislation before us, making minor amendments to a variety of bills around the agriculture, forestry and fisheries portfolio, would become a cause for the Prime Minister; maybe she could encourage the minister to seek other ways, more significant ways, to assist agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries. She is welcome down my way, if she wants to come down to Victoria. But I am sure there are multiple communities right throughout Australia that would love to host the Prime Minister for a week. 


At the end of the day, regional Australia does produce the wealth. The agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries contribute 20 per cent, as Senator Joyce said, to our economic future. They are innovative; they are world's best practice. The way we are able to manage our environment and our agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries together and ensure best outcomes for both is world leading and we need to be celebrating that and supporting that. This government has—in the examples I have outlined for you—a poor track record over its time. 


Despite the government, the department is very capable of taking action in this area. I would really like to commend them and encourage them to go further. It also shows this government is capable of reducing regulation, despite the modesty of the ones before us. I support this bill and commend it to the Senate.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (11:19):  A number of the things raised by Senator McKenzie are fantastic examples of where the agricultural sector in this country is overburdened by the weight of compliance regulation and red tape.


I stand to speak on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. This bill seeks to make a range of amendments on a range of different bills. I would like to briefly comment on the wine legislation amendments, but I would like to reserve the majority of my comments today for the States Grants (War Service Land Settlement) Act 1952, which is to be repealed as part of this bill. 


I was involved in the development of the wine integrity program that the wine industry developed a number of years ago. It is a very good example of a labelling program. However, nobody in this place should be fooled that that was the most extraordinarily difficult program to put together. The Winemakers' Federation, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and their state affiliate associations went through an inordinate amount of trouble trying to get some sort of consensus position about just developing that one homogenous product, the labelling program. So I think we would be well advised to take on some of the examples and the experiences of the development of that program when we have a look at some of the wider labelling programs that we are looking at. 


Certainly, labelling has been the perennial issue, particularly with regard to identification of Australian product and Australian produce and the differentiation between our clean home-grown product in Australia and imported products. The debate is obviously further confused when we get out into the wider marketplace: 'product of Australia', 'made in Australia', 'packaged in Australia'; and the issues of seasonality, consistency of supply and ingredients that are not available in Australia. I would suggest that we would do well to have a look at the experience of the wine industry's Label Integrity Program in the process of trying to develop a labelling program for the benefit of Australian producers. And, in remembering this, we certainly need to have a look at the Greens bill that has been put before this place. We will see that it is fraught with a lot of danger if we try to go forward and make a one-size-fits-all labelling program, notwithstanding the fact that there is an urgent need for such a program.


It is actually with a level of sadness that I am here today to witness, I assume, with the passage of this bill, the repealing of the State Grants (War Service Land Settlement) Act 1952. The region that I was born in, that I was brought up in and that I now, again, live in was built as a soldier settlement. Post the First World War a number of soldier settlers came and lived in towns such as Cobdogla, Waikerie, Berri, Cadell, Chaffey and the town in which I live, Renmark. Some horrendous mistakes were made by these soldier settlers because they certainly did not have the kind of information about irrigation technologies and the things that we now so take for granted. They had no idea how to get access to market, to move their products to where they were to be purchased. Obviously, the tyranny of distance, following the First World War, was quite significant in comparison to our ability to quickly move product and produce as we do today. And bear in mind that a lot of this product was perishable, so it was not a case of putting it on a truck or a dray being pulled by a horse and letting it wander off to Adelaide in due course, because the product just would not get there. So there were many mistakes in the first soldier settlement in the region in which I live.


But, following the Second World War, we had another influx of soldier settlement properties, particularly in the town of Loxton, which was developed post Second World War and which is probably the major town we are referring to today with the repealing of this act. A number of other areas in South Australia were also developed as soldier settlements following the Second World War—places such as Parndana on Kangaroo Island and Padthaway in the south-east of our state. These were thriving regional communities. They had extraordinarily strong cultures. They were built on a sense of 'can do' in the face of extraordinary adversity. They had wonderful organisations of people who got together—the foundation of organisations such as the CWA, Civil Defence and RSL, which were all hugely active participants in the community. They built these communities into very strong, self-sufficient communities. They had no reliance on the outside world for what they did.


As a child I can remember that, if there were a bushfire in the surrounding area, my father and everybody else's father would all jump in somebody's ute. There would be 10 guys with shovels in the back of the ute. They would go off and they would dig firebreaks. Nobody put up their hand and said: 'Where's the government funding? Where's the front-end loader or the grader that is going to turn up, that somebody else will provide?' They just went out there and did it themselves. This pioneering spirit that was developed in these communities following the soldier settlements, I think, is intrinsic in the culture that still largely exists in these communities.


Another great thing that was born of the soldier settlements was the cooperatives. The growers, by necessity, got together and formed cooperatives so that they could actually market and sell their products. Of course, in those days it was difficult to sell individually from the farm gate. We did not have the tourism drive-bys where you could pop in and buy a bottle of wine at the cellar door. Farmers had to have a way of getting their products into the marketplace. So they saw the wisdom of forming cooperatives and, in the process of forming those co-operatives, they also retained control of their product well past the farm gate—something, unfortunately, that is being eroded over time. We now see our farmers not having the control over their product that they used to. Most of our co-ops have folded, they have been corporatised or they have been bought out by big players. The big end of town now has a huge amount of control over our farming communities and it is probably one of the great reasons that our farmers out there are possibly struggling. But, as I said, the spirit of these communities is still alive and I think it can be rekindled. But the fabric of this is slowly being eroded and we would be very well advised to take a good look at it now and try to resurrect it before it is completely gone. The productivity of this country has been built on the back of these communities, which are self-sufficient and which did not rely on government handouts, which they are now being forced to do simply because of the overburden of things that are being forced on them.


There is no doubt and we have to acknowledge that things such as exchange rates and the globalisation of the world marketplace and commodity prices are all having a major impact on our farmers at the moment. There is probably not a great deal we can do about that. But in looking at that we also have to realise there are a number of things that are under our control. I commend this bill today because it actually seeks to improve:


… the effectiveness and efficiency of regulation, reducing red tape and creating clearer Commonwealth laws, the proposed amendments will reduce complexity and unnecessary regulation, provide consistency, amend outdated or unclear provisions and reduce the likelihood of reader confusion.


Those are very admirable aims that are being sought in this particular bill. We commend it for that. But the reality is that it really does not go very far when you consider the enormity of the things that this bill is seeking to achieve out of the five acts that it is looking to work on. It really does not go very far. Senator McKenzie outlined an absolute myriad of different burdens that are currently placed on our farmers and a myriad of different acts and regulations. I commend the bill, but I certainly suggest that we need to go a lot further.


Just this morning I was dealing with an issue where red tape and compliance costs and the unnecessary overburden of government regulation and involvement in a process, which I do not necessarily think the government needs to be involved in to the kind of degree that it is, have seen a small Riverland grower lose a lucrative export market. Why? Because of the cost of export certification. Mr Punturiero, who is a small Riverland grower—he and his wife have a small citrus orchard in Renmark—has been exporting a few pallets of very high-quality limes every year into New Zealand. He does it for a very small period and exports only a very small number of pallets. Last year the cost of certification for his shed, because New Zealand is a market that requires certification much the same way as we require certification for products coming into Australia, was $500. This year he will have to pay $1,800 because he will have the benefit of a rebate of almost $6,000. Next year he will have to pay $8,350 to export the same small quantity of limes into New Zealand that he paid $500 for the privilege of exporting last year. The reality of all this is that he is not going to export them. He cannot possibly afford to pay $1,000 a pallet to AQIS, or the department, just so that they can come in for a couple of hours and say that his shed meets the phytosanitary requirements that are demanded by this market. Last week, along with Senator Xenophon, I moved a motion in this place to ask AQIS if it would review this particular licensing system, because it is totally and utterly discriminatory and discouraging to small- and medium-sized growers like Mr Punturiero. 


Cost-saving reforms were supposed to have accompanied the move to cost recovery that was agreed to by both sides of the House when it was brought in, but what we have seen here is that the cost recovery activities have been introduced but we have not seen those cost-saving reforms that were supposed to overlay those changes. So, instead of seeing a situation where there might have been a small increase in the amount of money that was necessary for Mr Punturiero to pay for his certification, we now see a situation where it is now so exorbitant that he plainly cannot afford to pay it, and in the process of doing that has now lost—at least for this year, until we can get this matter sorted out—a very lucrative, albeit small, market into New Zealand.


It is not just horticultural industries that are being faced with this burden. I have had calls from people in the meat industry and the vegetable industry—it is across the board that the little guys are just not able to afford this amount of money. The really stupid part of all this is that we, as a country, end up being the net loser. Small growers, seasonal exporters, niche market exporters and growers who see a market opportunity will all be excluded from being able to export their products. These exporters—along with the big guys, who I acknowledge are obviously very important in the marketplace, but even the little exporters—earn export dollars. They are the ones who give us the plus side on our balance of trade, and let us not make too fine a point of it: those people that export are the ones that we really need to be looking after. We also need to realise that often a dollar spent in encouraging an export market to be developed or to be pursued ends up with a huge multiplier effect in terms of the money that is returned to the Australian economy by virtue of that.


When we pass this legislation today—which I am assuming we will—we need to be very aware of the consequences out there on the ground of putting in place legislative change, compliance and the burden of bureaucracy. As has been mentioned previously, one of the great things that we need to be doing is to encourage our research and development, which is something we have been cutting back on again. We need to encourage research and development, because it is our only competitive advantage in Australia. We certainly are not going to be able to compete in international markets on price, so we need to make sure that we are the smartest, the cleverest and the most innovative, as we have been in the past. I refer to this in terms of taking it back to the soldier settlers of the community, in which I grew up in. Those guys were innovative. We used to sell our irrigation technology into Israel. We now see that Israel has a huge irrigation technology business, and they are now selling to the rest of the world. We need to get back to a position where Australia is at the forefront of leading in technology, innovation and making sure that we take advantage of selling to the rest of the world what we do so fabulously well.


There were bills referred to this morning such as the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 that was supposed to decrease the amount of burden on growers for compliance. It seems a little odd that we can have an extra $2 million that has to be picked up by cost recovery to growers and that is not considered a burden. The Biosecurity Bill 2012 is another example, where the burden is on industry to prove. If we put as much effort into making the people who import into this country comply as we put into making our exporters comply when they send product offshore, I am sure we would see a better balance. I am not going to go on about the carbon tax and the increasing costs and import costs, but it is fair to say they are very real and, when you own a business in rural and regional Australia and you are fighting all the other things you have to fight, the increasing costs that we have seen, particularly in relation to those people who require refrigeration, have been exorbitant. 


While I am very happy today to support this bill as it does, in some small way, address the red tape, it highlights to me the huge job we have to unravel the bureaucratic burden that farmers have to deal with every day. So, with a great deal of sadness, I acknowledge the need to repeal the act in relation to the soldier settlements from the community that I grew up in, and I hope that, maybe, in the amending of this bill, we will see further amendments in further bills to get rid of the burden and the red tape that face our growers so that maybe the soldier settlements in the communities—the strong and vibrant communities which I and many other people from the country grew up in—can be restored for the future.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-03-13,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:35):  I endorse the remarks of Senator Ruston. Just this morning, we were both on Leon Byner's program on Radio FIVEaa to talk about the plight facing Mick and Tanya Punturiero—salt of the earth people, lime growers. They are innovators and hard workers in the Riverland of South Australia who are now in a position where they cannot export to New Zealand, a niche market that they need and that has been denied to them because the AQIS inspection fees have gone up from $550 to something like $8,530, a 1,300 per cent increase. I know there are rebates involved, but there is bureaucracy, paperwork and red tape involved in that. The fact is that it should not be that hard to be a farmer in this country. You have a situation where there are so many obstacles and barriers, particularly for smaller producers—for the Mick and Tanya Punturieros of this world, who are the innovators and have done the right thing. I and Senator Ruston know Mick and Tanya well. They have been overseas and they have looked at the latest technologies in terms of water-saving techniques. They have looked at ways of producing limes that are world quality—they are clean, green producers—yet they are missing out on an export market because these rules have been put in place that just do not make sense. We also have to look at the context of how important agriculture is to this country. The gross value of agricultural, fisheries and forestry production in 2010-11 was $51.8 billion. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs were created as a result of that, and yet we are making it more difficult for our farmers. Whilst I welcome this legislation, it does not address the fundamental issues and the fundamental challenges facing our farmers.


I note that Senator Colbeck in his contribution made reference to Asian honey bees. There was not adequate consultation and an opportunity was lost to eradicate the Asian honey bee when it was first discovered on a ship near Cairns. I note the work that Senator Milne has done in relation to this and her similar concerns. It is also worth mentioning, in terms of the context of labelling, that we are talking about wine labelling and improvements in respect of the integrity of our wonderful wine industry. 


Senator Siewert made mention of genetically modified organisms, GMOs, and how there are reports coming out of the United States that Monsanto's corn crops, which are GMO crops, are failing. I think that is very, very significant. We need better labelling of GMOs in this country not just so that consumers can make an informed choice as to whether they want to buy a product containing GMOs or not, but also to protect those farmers that want to be GMO free and that want to keep export markets in Europe, in Japan and throughout the world where there is a clear preference for non-GMO crops. That would mean that those farmers would not be prejudiced as well.


I note that Senator Edwards made reference to the forward selling of the forestry contracts by the South Australian government—a stupid, stupid decision that will prejudice the vitality and the economic development of the south-east of South Australia in particular. It does not make sense. One issue I have is not with Senator Edwards but with the endorsed Liberal candidate for Barker—we have had a bit of an interchange in the media about what a state Liberal government could do to cancel that contract. The advice I have sought and had from constitutional law experts such as Professor John Williams, the Dean of the University of Adelaide Law School, is that there is no constitutional prohibition in the South Australian Constitution to stop any future government tearing up that contract and saying, 'We will go back to our original position.' Of course there are issues of sovereign risk, but there is no legal impediment to any future South Australian government to say, 'We will take back a particular contract and keep it in state hands.' I maintain that position is technically and legally correct. There is an issue of sovereign risk, but I would have thought that the risk to the people of the south-east—their jobs, the future of the timber industry and associated industries—is too great as a result of what the government has done.


This bill also looks at wine labelling. There is another issue that has not been touched on, and that goes to fraud. That goes to winemakers, particularly in overseas markets, where there is counterfeit wine. I was involved in the case not so long involving Emanuel Skorpos, who runs the Flinders Run Winery. He is an award-winning winemaker on the Southern Flinders Ranges Estate. He had to spend his own money and chase up the counterfeiting of his labels in China. I think more needs to be done on this. We need to give as much support as we can, particularly for small producers, in respect of that.


The Blewett review has also been mentioned in the context of this debate, and I note that Senator Joyce made a useful contribution. Several years ago, in a very unusual unity ticket, Senator Joyce, then Leader of the Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown and I introduced a bill. We co-sponsored a bill in relation to the issue of food labelling and country-of-origin labelling. That shows that this is an issue that transcends party politics. It transcends ideologies and it is about common sense. We need to have effective food-labelling laws in this country in order to assist, as Senator McKenzie said and as Senator Ruston made the point in her contribution, people who want to be able to make a choice about buying Australian produce. Right now our food-labelling laws are an absolute disgrace. You have a situation where 'Made in Australia' just means that a product has been 'substantially transformed' by 51 per cent in the production process. What does that mean? It means that you can buy orange juice that says 'Made in Australia', yet 90 per cent of the concentrate of that juice could have come from Brazil, for instance, and consumers are none the wiser. The label says 'Made from local and imported ingredients'. That is an insult to consumers.


The Blewett review was a long time coming. It made some recommendations to improve the system. I thought the Blewett review was weak in many respects and that it did not go far enough. But at least it made some constructive recommendations, and I commend the work that Dr Blewett did in relation to that. But what did the government do? It ignored it. It ignored it to the cost of consumers. It ignored it to the cost of our farmers. Last year I went to a property in the Riverland where 50-year-old orange trees were being ripped out because the price of oranges was so terrible. If you talk to Ron Gray in the Riverland—a stalwart of and an advocate for strong food-labelling and country-of-origin labelling laws—he will tell you about the trees that he has had to rip out having turned off the water. His neighbours have done the same thing. Prices are so low, in part because our food-labelling laws are so weak. This bill does not address that and we need to address that.


Biosecurity was touched on by Senator Colbeck. It is worth mentioning that we have a situation where apples have been allowed in from New Zealand. AQIS says it has risk matrixes in place, but I do not know whether they are that effective. I am concerned that we are looking at bringing in potatoes from New Zealand which will potentially have a huge impact because of the zebra chip disease in New Zealand. If we get that disease in this country, we will never get rid of it. It is the same with fire blight. I really wonder whether the people in biosecurity are more interested in pursuing a free trade mantra than in pursuing what their core activity should be, and that is to guarantee the clean, green reputation of Australian produce and to keep it disease-free.


Senator McKenzie made a point about buying Australian products and how we need to have truth in labelling. We need to have truth in labelling because, if we do not have truth in labelling, Australian farmers will not stand a chance. This bill really just touches on the edges of that for wine labelling. It is worth reflecting on the issue of foreign ownership of our farmland. Despite my name, I am certainly not xenophobic, but I think there is a real need for appropriately balanced and appropriately targeted foreign investment in this country, particularly in greenfields sites. Our current foreign investment laws are so vague and so imprecise in terms of a national interest test. Also, the threshold is so high—something like $244 million before the Foreign Investment Review Board will even look at something. It is not in the national interest. 


We could learn, and it pains me to say this, from the Kiwis across the Tasman. The New Zealanders have an Overseas Investment Office where there is a more clearly defined national interest test, where they look at any transaction involving more than five hectares of prime agricultural land. I am not suggesting we go down the path of five hectares—though that was initially my view—but a $5 million threshold would seem to be more realistic and in line with the consumer price movements from the 1970s when the test was just $1 million.


We need to revamp our foreign investment rules, not in a way to discourage foreign investment but to encourage transparency. It also begs a number of big questions about sovereign funds—funds owned by other governments, effectively controlled by other governments, where the threshold is zero dollars, as it should be. Our national interest test is so vague and so imprecise as to be useless.


It is worth reflecting on what was said by David Farley, the chief executive of Australian Agricultural Co., whom I think is widely respected in the industry and who knows his stuff. He gave very useful evidence at an inquiry on foreign investment, which was instigated by Senator Heffernan. An opinion piece in the Australian Financial Review in June of last year stated, 'Why should China be given the inside running on a very promising agricultural project?'—and this was talking about Northern Australia—and Mr Farley said:


Our political and business leaders are arguing that we need to pay more respect to China and put more effort into our relations with the Chinese at the expense of our neighbouring South-East Asian countries. 


I would say more respect should be paid to the expertise contained in our own agricultural industry and more effort put into making sure that Australia is equipped to play its role in the global demand for food.


I agree with what Mr Farley says and that is not to say that we should not have significant investment from China and other countries in our agricultural sector, but we need to ask some fundamental, seminal questions. One of those questions needs to be: are there enough incentives for farmers and for superannuation funds to invest in agriculture? I do not think we have the relevant taxation and superannuation investment vehicles and incentives in this country to drive that investment, to drive R&D and to drive the changes that we need to be a powerhouse for the region and for the world in food production.


Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you are probably well aware of the article in the Adelaide Advertiser of 23 February this year by Cameron England which talked about a Qatari government owned company, Hassad Australia, that bought a $9 million cattle property near Bordertown and is understood to be negotiating with several farmers on the Eyre Peninsula to buy prime property and grazing land. The reason that Hassad Australia is doing that is the government of Qatar on behalf of the citizens of Qatar understand the potential of Australian agriculture. They get it. They understand that Australia has the potential to be the food bowl of the region, and indeed of the world. But we have a situation where our own farmers are driven out of business because we do not have the food labelling laws, the investment rules and the taxation rules to encourage investment. To me, we must redress that and this bill does not do that.


If I could just mention coal seam gas. The government have made some announcements on that and I congratulate the work that Senator Larissa Waters has done in this area, and it is an issue that Senator Joyce has raised on many occasions. There are going to be rules for coal seam gas and about the aquifer, but I worry that it might be too late for some of the developments that have been approved. Unless we give appropriate priority to our prime agricultural land, that is a real issue. I am hoping that it is not too little too late in terms of what the government announced only yesterday.


Finally, I want to comment on the Murray-Darling Basin. I note that Senator Hanson-Young, who is in the chamber, has been a very strong advocate in relation to ensuring the health of our river system. I think there is a real issue here concerning the early adopters of water-saving measures. Senator Ruston, who is from the Riverland, knows well that our producers in the Riverland had to be more water efficient much earlier because they are at the tail end of the river system. After the 1968 drought, a number of measures had to be implemented to ensure the survival of our food producers, the farmers and irrigators, in the Riverland. I do not believe there is anything in the current Murray-Darling Basin plan that gives adequate recognition to early adopters. It does not do that and that is a fatal flaw in this plan. You must of necessity, for the sake of equity and for the sake of rewarding good behaviour many years ago, give something back to those farmers whether it is encouraging research and development or whether it is providing a specialised fund for those farmers who have already done the hard yards and who can only access a tiny, tiny fraction of the $5.8 billion in water infrastructure programs. They cannot access those funds, by and large, because they are already too water sufficient to qualify. That is an anomaly and it is not just in South Australia's interests but also in the national interest to acknowledge those early adopters.


This bill does address some issues but it needs to go much further. If we are going to be serious about ensuring the viability and the strength of an industry worth over $50 billion a year to the Australian economy, with massive flow-on effects and with massive job impacts, we need to do much, much better. This parliament and this government, and future governments, must take up the challenge so that we can be the food bowl of Asia and so that we can also give our farmers a fair go.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (11:51):  I thank the senators for their contribution to this debate. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2012 will reduce red tape and make portfolio legislation clearer. This bill is an example of the government working with industry for more practical and effective regulation. It responds to industry requests for reform of regulation and streamlines administrative procedures. Some examples are amendments to the label integrity program which address concerns raised by retailers and wholesalers and amendments to the definition of 'vintage' which address concerns raised by some wine producers who harvest their grapes later than the normal harvest period. In addition, amendments to the fisheries legislation will simplify administration for business. It will also ensure that, when it is necessary for the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to issue directions to close a fishery, the requirements are clear for fishers. A further example is amendments to levies legislation which will provide an improved response time for our industry levy payers when they submit requests for the remission of late levy penalties. The portfolio continues to identify redundant legislation for removal from the statute books. The repeal of the States Grants (War Service Land Settlement) Act 1952 is a further example of the portfolio's efforts towards deregulation. Importantly, this bill provides a cost-effective opportunity to clean up portfolio legislation; the various technical amendments will improve readability, update references and remove redundant texts, resulting in clearer legislation. I commend bill to the Senate.

 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (09:41):  I would like to make a short contribution to this debate on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012, which is before us today. The federal government is very proud of its record of assistance to the rural and regional sector of Australia. I am pleased to have with me here today in the chamber the minister responsible, Senator Joe Ludwig, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This bill makes some amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. As a South Australian, anything to do with wine has much importance to me and my home state. I would like to take the opportunity a bit later in the debate to make a further contribution, but I notice that Senator Colbeck has arrived in the chamber. I will be pleased to hear from him.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (09:42):  In rising to make my contribution on behalf of the coalition to the debate on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012, which covers a number of different areas of the agriculture portfolio, I note that the coalition will be supporting the legislation. But there are a number of comments around the legislation and agriculture generally that I would like to make as part of my contribution.


This proposed legislation effectively makes some minor changes to a range of portfolio areas. As the government whip just noted, it makes some amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. It makes some modifications to the Fisheries Management Act 1994 to explain requirements for directions to close a fishery, particularly a specific part of a fishery, and also to correct some grammatical errors and delete some redundant text. The opposition supports those amendments.


It also makes some changes to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to allow the departmental secretary to consider requests made by levy payers for remission of penalties. It also makes some further technical amendments to the Fisheries Management Act, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act, the Export Control Act 1982 and the Quarantine Act. But none of the amendments make any substantial changes in substance to the law.


So, in that context, the coalition is quite happy to lend its support to the legislation, but I think it is pertinent at this stage to look at the way that the government has actually managed the agricultural portfolio. There is a long history of legitimate concern from the primary industry sector about the way that the government has managed this portfolio, and I suppose prime amongst those concerns would be the carbon tax. We are seeing right now the very negative impacts of additional cost imposed by this government on the rural sector, the farming sector and the fisheries sector right around the country. For example, in dairy, I acknowledge that there are global issues in respect of the market price and that the dollar is high, and that is having the impact, but that is being exacerbated by the additional costs imposed by this government through the carbon tax. The government has been trying to convince farmers that they are not subject to the carbon tax, but you tell that to a dairy farmer who has a quarterly power bill of $40,000 that is going to receive, and has received, a 10 per cent increase due to the carbon tax, or you tell that to the same dairy farmer, whose processor is also subject to significant extra costs. If their milk, for example, is going into milk powder, 30 per cent of the cost of producing that product is energy. The global market is not going to carry the cost; it is being sent back to the industry. We know that that is the case, because a number of organisations, including the government's own ABARES, have done some work to indicate that those costs will be pushed back to the agricultural sector. The government really has not understood that. Its line is, 'Well, agriculture's not subject to the carbon tax,' but agriculture is subject to the impacts. That needs to be remembered and understood.


Of course, if you live in Tasmania, the cost of shipping is impacted by the carbon tax. The minister came to Tasmania and was asked on Tasmanian radio about the costs of freight and the impact of the carbon tax on the costs of freight. The minister ridiculed the person who was asking the question on the radio, saying, 'You don't know what you're talking about, because freight is not subject to the carbon tax.' The minister did not even understand the impact of his own tax. I am not talking about the minister for agriculture; I am talking about Minister Albanese, the transport minister, who does not understand the impacts of the carbon tax on his own portfolio, much less the impacts that flow back to the rest of industry.


So it is important for the community to understand that this government continues to make decisions that are not in the interests of agriculture. We talk about being the food bowl for Asia and about sending our produce all across the globe, particularly into South-East Asia. Yet for seven years—two under the coalition, admittedly, but also the last five years—what has happened to the progress of the China free trade agreement? New Zealand commenced at the same time as we did and finalised theirs in three years. As of the beginning of this year, we are at a 15 per cent disadvantage for our fisheries sector into the Chinese market because this government has not progressed a free trade agreement. There is a free trade agreement with South Korea sitting there waiting to be signed. At the NFF blueprint launch a few weeks ago, the head of the NFF was asked, 'If there is one thing that the government could do for you, what would that be?' The very quick response was, 'Sign the South Korea FTA tomorrow.' Where is it? What is going on with that? How are we supposed to be providing agricultural produce from this country into those markets—markets that are growing and are demanding our product—if we are at such a significant price disadvantage compared to a country like New Zealand, which already has significant cost advantages over us for a number of other reasons, currency being one of them, but also labour cost?


We are seeing our food processing and our food manufacturing businesses go offshore because the government is not dealing with these particular issues. What it is doing is imposing additional costs. And so for an exporter to get licensed and to have export access, what has this government done? It has removed a 40 per cent rebate that assisted with markets, market development and access into those markets; it has made it more expensive to export. That is the legacy of this government; that is what it has done. It is forcing businesses to make the decision on whether they might stay registered as an exporter or not. That is what is starting to occur.


In the fishing sector, we have seen an increase in fees for access to some of the fisheries from $7,000 to $14,000 per unit for access to the fishery. And after huge swathe of industry players said, 'We can't afford that, we'll bail out; we'll surrender our licences', what happened next? The government changes the cost structure completely and makes it more affordable for these businesses to get in, but these businesses, having conceded their licenses, have no entitlement to get them back. The complete inconsistency in the decision-making of this government really does not stand up. The lack of consultation, the lack of consideration of the impacts of its decisions have been a real drag on the agricultural sector at a time when the global market and the dollar, because of the resource sector boom, have had a negative impact. And what has this government done? It has added additional costs over and above those broader economic conditions.


We have coming to us the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation that adds millions more to the cost of doing business for agriculture. How many more things can this government layer on top of all of the other impacts that it has had over the past four or five years? We have had a circumstance with access to markets where it just becomes slightly difficult to actually get into the markets. Lobsters into China has been a significant issue. I have to concede that the government, through the trade minister, has put into place a program to start dealing with lobsters and the supply chain project there, but that sat there for a couple of years while the industry suffered significant disadvantage. Bearing in mind that the New Zealand industry has a free trade agreement which gives it a 15 per cent advantage over the Australian fisheries sector, when you are talking about a commodity that is valued at between $65 and $95 a kilogram, then a 15 per cent disadvantage into that premium market is a significant one. That is having a major negative effect on our rock lobster sector, which is a major business for Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. We need to continue to work on the supply chain project, but where is the free trade agreement that is going to assist those industries getting into the country?


The relationship that we have with Indonesia has been so badly damaged by the decision to ban the live cattle export trade without notice. They heard about this on the radio after being told via our foreign minister the day before: 'Everything's okay. We'll continue to work with you. We'll sort something out here.' Then the next day a decision was made and the Indonesians found out about it on the radio. It is an absolute disgrace that we put countries and our trading partners through these things. How long is it going to take to repair the damage that has been done by that decision? Indonesia now says: 'Australia is a risk to our protein supply. We need to mitigate that risk.' And so from the situation where we were sending over more than 600,000 tonnes of product to them, we are now down to around 200,000 tonnes a year—and we will potentially receive further cuts. The relationship with China also needs to be managed. China is a huge opportunity for agriculture in Australia. In fact, it is one of the few really growing markets. If you go back to 2005-06, we were sending something in the order of $630 million worth of food to China. If you go forward to 2011-12, that is $2.1 billion. The growth in food sales from Australia to China was over threefold in that period of time. We hear complaints about the food imports from China which have grown by about $300 million in that same time frame, with imports less than doubling from China. How we manage our relationship with the Chinese has to be done in a way that continues to provide for that opportunity. 


I think that some of the scaremongering that goes on in this country around the relationship with China quite frankly needs to be reconsidered very carefully because, at the same time as there has been that threefold growth in our market to China, countries like the UK and the US, for example, have actually halved the amount of food produce that they are taking from Australia. So who should we be working with and who should we be maintaining a positive relationship with? Should we be going to China and in their language telling them how to run their own country? Is that the sort of thing that we ought to be doing?


Look at the circumstances that occurred around the management of the incursion of Asian bees where the critical scientist was not invited to the critical meeting to make decisions around whether or not to declare them endemic and if we cannot actually deal with them. Why didn't he get invited? Because we lost his email address. This is the most eminent scientist on bees in the country. He did not get invited to the key meeting to make a decision as to whether or not we think we can combat or eradicate the Asian bee incursion in and around Cairns. There are just completely absurd decisions. Something like 65 per cent of our agriculture relies on wild bees for its pollination. An incursion of Asian bees with varroa mite could wipe out our native bee population in two or three years. What is the potential impact on agriculture from that? Australia is the last continent on the planet that does not have varroa mite. We need to ensure that our borders are secure in respect of that and yet here we are at the critical point in time not inviting the guy who has the most knowledge about the issue to the meeting. It is just absolutely absurd.


In respect of something that is pretty close to my heart, the way that the government has dealt with the forestry industry in Tasmania is nothing short of a disgrace. The deal that they have on the table right now is being debated in the Tasmanian upper house. It basically spells the end of the native forestry industry in Tasmania by 2030. That is the effect of the deal. It is simple to work out. All you need to do is to look at the wood supply projections. The wood supply projections say that if you lock up half a million hectares that the government is proposing to lock up and harvest 137,000 cubic metres of category 1 sawlogs from now on, the industry will be gone by 2030. There will be between 25,000 and 40,000 cubic metres of category 1 sawlogs left by 2030. Industry will look at that and the decline will start straight away. Who is going to invest in an industry where the resource has a 17-year life? Who will make that decision? Yet that is what this government is doing to my home state of Tasmania. While the industry might continue to 2030, the death of the industry has already been determined if the Tasmanian upper house passes this sham legislation that is in front of it right now.


The government claims that a deal was negotiated between the environmental movement and the industry, and that is correct; it was. But the industry was negotiating for itself, not for the rest of Tasmania. And this piece of legislation deals with more than just the forest industry; it deals with the mining sector, the tourism sector and the agriculture sector. The absurdity is that this government is looking to move the forest industry out of the forest and into a plantation industry, which puts it onto our farmland. The proposal says that 20 per cent of Tasmania's agricultural land is to go under plantations—130,000 hectares. How is Tasmania supposed to be the food bowl of Australia—which is what is being claimed by some people in Tasmania—if we are going to put 20 per cent of our agricultural land into plantation? Why are we spending $400 million in Tasmania on irrigation development to irrigate trees? The complete lack of logic from this government—albeit Greens driven, because of their partnership with the Greens in this place and in Tasmania—is absolutely absurd. But here they are, proposing to take out one of the pillars of the Tasmanian economy. What was a $1.4 billion industry is now down to about $700 million but by 2030 will be zero. The native forest industry will be dead, because there is no viability in an industry where the supply volumes are between 25,000 and 40,000 cubic metres. It just does not exist.


That is what this government is doing to the forest sector, but it also applies to agriculture. And when you look at what they have done to the fishing industry through their management of significant fisheries issues over the last 12 months, taking political decisions rather than science based decisions, you get the picture. So, in respect of the marine planning process, they are doing deals with people in this place—a little piece here for a vote over there—and taking the side of the environmental groups over industry. If people in agriculture do not think they are next, they are kidding themselves, because once the environmental groups are finished with the forestry sector, the mining sector and the fishing sector they will come after them on the land. You only have to look at what they are doing in New Zealand.


This government's record in respect of the agricultural, fisheries and forestry sector is completely and utterly dismal—remember, they did not even have a policy at the last election. Having said that, the coalition will be supporting this piece of legislation.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2013-03-13,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (10:02):  I rise to speak in support of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. This bill makes some useful technical changes to a range of acts under the agriculture, fisheries and forestry portfolio, including the changes to wine labelling, which will implement changes that the industry has been calling for. As you know, the Greens are very committed to truth in labelling, whether it can be seen in wine standards or in the accurate labelling of ingredients such as genetically modified organisms and palm oil. I suspect that the next biggest issue relating to accuracy and truth in labelling to confront the agriculture industry will in fact be genetically modified crops. Recently we have begun to receive reports that Monsanto's genetically modified corn has begun to fail in the USA. There is growing consensus that GMOs are not the silver bullet that it was originally thought they would be and that in the meantime our farmers are beginning to command premium prices for non-GMO crops.


GMOs are and will continue to be a big issue for our farmers. At the very minimum, we need the robust engagement with industry and the willingness to listen to alternative voices from industry that are raising concerns about the impact of GMOs and the effect on their ability to command premium prices and to protect themselves from contamination. We believe it is essential that we introduce legislative protections for these farmers and for consumers the way we are introducing these protections for wine producers in Australia. Consumers have a right to know what they are consuming. Farmers also have the right to be able to label their products as GMO-free. You will recall that the Greens' and Senator Xenophon's private senators' bill on palm oil labelling successfully passed the Senate chamber last year only to become entangled in the House of Representatives in free trade issues and lobbying from the Malaysian government. So I have concerns that, despite the promising signs we see before us with this bill, there is no appetite to take on the other big issues that need to be taken on in labelling. My colleagues and I remain committed to truth in labelling. We welcome the work that has gone into resolving this issue and hope that the momentum will continue with other labelling issues, such as support for the country of origin labelling bill of my colleague and Leader of the Greens, Christine Milne, which is currently in the inquiry stage.


This bill also takes steps to correct a drafting error that was introduced two years ago when this government sought to introduce the legislative powers that would give substantive decision-making powers over the fisheries management at AFMA to fisheries users under a scheme of fisheries co-management. I want to take this time to reflect on the current state of fisheries management in Australia and the challenges that co-management faces. We need to look at what is good co-management. AFMA reports that a primary benefit of legislative powers to enable co-management comes from more cost-effectively administrating the fisheries. Admirable though it is to desire to ensure that there is efficiency in our public administration, we do not believe that efficiency alone is sufficient grounds for shifting responsibility in administration away from government. It is critical that the benefits we do achieve from co-management are not in fact short-term budgetary cycle gains at the expense of our ocean but actually lead to better management of our oceans.


As the Centre for Policy Development reported last year, our oceans are worth billions of dollars annually in tourism, recreation, carbon capture as well as commercial fisheries. Just yesterday in this place we had the release of Marine Nation 2025, which again clearly articulated the value of our oceans and particularly highlighted the potential value of what they call blue carbon. It is also important to note here the impact of climate change we are going to be seeing on our oceans. In fact, we have just seen that off the coast in my home state of Western Australia where we have had a marine heat wave, which has, as the name implies, increased the temperature of the water and has already resulted in impacts on commercial fisheries in terms of abalone deaths, impacts on the rock lobster industry and impacts on recreational fishers who for the first time are catching subtropical fish off the coast of Perth. While that may seem a bonus in the short term for those fishers, it has very serious ecological consequences. They also think that might be one of the reasons for sharks being closer to shore. That issue has had very substantial media coverage. It also has very important implications for fisheries management.


What did the minister for fisheries in Western Australia, Mr Moore, say? 'Hopefully, it is an aberration.' Well, it is not going to be an aberration. He was minister for fisheries at that time. Hoping it is just an aberration is not good enough. We actually need firm policy changes in order to look at how we manage our fisheries in a changing climate. The initial research on that incident has indicated that we need to be investing a lot more in research to look at what impacts this is going to have on our marine environment and then we need to be researching what adaptive management changes we need to be making. Above all else, leadership and community engagement are essential for these co-management changes. We need to confront a worrying trend where strong leadership and consultation are abandoned in favour of pitting the interests of industry against the other stakeholders, be they recreational users or environmentalists. How many times in this place have I listened to a beat-up, particularly from the other side of the chamber and the coalition, about the damage that changes to ensure sustainable, well-managed fisheries will have on that particular fishery, sometimes in the short term, and not taking the long-term consequences of business as usual into consideration? This does not constitute leadership, nor does it facilitate the kinds of meaningful engagement that fishers and fisheries managers need to have in order to pursue and ensure better management. It does not engender a good environment for co-management.


In 2006 the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation formed a working group to report on co-management in Australian fisheries. The working group report reflected the increasing recognition among fishers and fisheries managers alike of the need for a cultural change away from an untrusting, often conflicted 'them versus us' approach to one of partnership based on joint responsibility for decision-making and implementation in fisheries management. That is what they were saying needs to be done. The report talks about the transitional nature of the development from a centralised model to a delegated model. It is a staged process of development and not something that can be implemented immediately. It involves building relationships and trust so that a stage is reached where negotiated outcomes have been decided and functions and powers may be delegated to relevant stakeholders who then take on the responsibility of seeing that these functions are implemented within the terms of the formal agreement. The report describes a natural progression from a centralised model to a consultative model, which matures into a collaborative model and then, finally, results in a delegated model, where the people using the fishery are the ones operating the fishery and making the rules for it. I do believe this is a desirable outcome, particularly in having the users take a much more active role and greater responsibility for ensuring that their behaviours adapt to changing circumstances in that fishery. Business as usual should not be the opening assumption, particularly in these days of changing climate and overfishing in fisheries around the world.


However, before this greater control can happen, there needs to be cultural change, not just so that fishers see themselves as the managers of a fishery but also so that fisheries managers, whether they are fishers, policy makers, bureaucrats—and I mean that in a nice, loving way—scientists or whoever is involved, see the bigger picture. There needs to be a bioregional approach. Fisheries management has to stop being about individual targeted species, bycatch issues and how many tonnes you can take out before you start to undermine the capacity to restock—it has to start being about how actions within a fishery change that ecosystem and how that fishery is adjusting to ecosystem changes that are beyond our control such as, as I said, climate change and a warming ocean. Bioregional planning is not a new concept for this place, although by the reaction of some people in this place you would think it is. Both this government and the previous Liberal government—yes, under John Howard—have been working away for well over a decade and a half to comprehensively survey our marine environment and set up a world-class network of marine reserves based on the concept of bioregional planning. As you are aware, the process of bioregional planning is almost at the stage of being implemented around the country. Although the government did not go as far as some of us would have liked in terms of the areas that are protected by marine reserves, I am pleased to see that we now have a nearly national network of marine reserves that will help protect our marine life into the future. Marine reserves are the basis of good fisheries management—the basis of an ecosystemic approach.


But bioregional planning is not just about marine parks. It is an important tool for ensuring that we are making the best decisions for our ecosystem, based on more than just the value of fish stocks that are targeted in particular fisheries. We believe it is essential for good fisheries management. The bioregional approach to fisheries management has been painted as antithetical to the interests and goals of fishers. But an interest in fisheries management that is focused on ensuring a flourishing stock for future exploitation is a completely different mindset to that of a marine scientist, who can take a broader view about the intrinsic value of our marine system and see it not simply as a resource to be exploited but as an important piece of a bigger system that sustains a complex web of marine life. That is where we need to be changing our mindsets in order to be able to progressively go through the process of establishing co-management.


The 2010 amendment that introduced co-management powers also brought in changes to enable AFMA to rationalise the number of management advisory committees from 12 to six. This was promised to provide a more cost-effective and efficient consultative structure that would deliver better decisions and simpler administration and to enable the implementation of a dual advisory model. This will separate the provision of advice to AFMA: MACs will provide advice to AFMA on community interest issues, and advice on fishing operations will be provided by peak industry bodies.


The success of co-management should not be judged on the dollars that it saves our government and the extent to which it can pass on administrative overheads to the fisheries users, because this can encourage an increasing spiral of cost-cutting, rationalisation and emphasis on the margins, rather than inspiring collective effort, good long-term decision making and harmonisation between different models. The efforts to make a living today and to act as good stewards to the fishery, to maintain the health of the fishery and to see the fishery within the broader prospects of the bioregion, which is already under threat from multiple directions, need to be at the forefront of people's thinking.


I expect that finally giving the proper effect to this 2010 amendment, correcting the drafting error at a time when the bioregional planning process is moving from the research stage to the implementation stage, will mean that co-management is a very effective tool for shifting thinking about our fisheries away from just stocks and towards a more ecosystem based management plan. That is why we support co-management, but we believe that it needs to be done within the framework of understanding that there needs to be an ecosystem based approach.


The bill also repeals the States Grants (War Service Land Settlement Land) Act 1952. The War Service Land Settlement Scheme commenced in 1945 to assist returned soldiers into farming after World War II. Many areas in Western Australia, particularly on the south coast, were released under that scheme. Unfortunately, some of those areas of land should not have been released, despite the fact that the community was keen to help the returned soldiers. The truth is some marginal country was released and we are now paying for the consequences of that in excessive land degradation, loss of native species and loss of biodiversity. That is why we need to keep investing in natural resource management programs such as Caring for our Country and, in the past, the national Landcare program. I had the good fortune quite a significant time ago to work on the south coast in agriculture and on Landcare and salinity management, so I know firsthand the impact that clearing of some of the native vegetation had on that fragile land. We need to remember that decisions taken with a lack of information can have long-term consequences. I am extremely concerned that we are making decisions now that will have long-term consequences—or, should I say, not making decisions now that will have long-term consequences. On the front page of the West Australian last Thursday there was a story about farmers in my home state of Western Australia who are struggling with drought. The south-west of Western Australia is being hit the hardest by climate change. We have had dramatic drops in rainfall and high temperatures. We have had season after season when farmers are in drought or in rainfall deficiency. We are now faced with many farmers potentially having to walk off their land in the next season or considering not being able to put a crop in because they cannot get the finance. This is partly a consequence of the fact that we do not have adequate systems for agriculture in a changing climate because we have not invested in the research needed to enable our agriculture industry to adapt to a changing climate.


Ross Kingston, an economist who was working for the Department of Agriculture and Food in Western Australia, pointed out a number of years ago that our farmers in Western Australia are some of the most adaptive in the world. They have adapted to a changing climate, but they reached a point a number of years ago where they were unable to continue to adapt without a significant investment in research. That research is coming far too late, if at all. The Western Australian government invested only half of the money that they had allocated in their budget for research and climate change issues.


It is essential that we develop an agriculture system that can better adapt to the changing climate. I am deeply concerned about the future of agriculture, and Senator Colbeck was addressing the issue of the future of agriculture. Well, the future of agriculture is at risk through climate change in Western Australia—dire risk—because we have failed to take the necessary steps to invest in research and to understand what impact climate change will have on our agriculture. Various governments in Western Australia and in Australia buried their heads in the sand about the impact that climate change would have on agriculture. I do not want to see farmers walk off the land as a result of drought in Western Australia caused by climate change and our failure to adapt. We need to be taking action now before it is too late.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2013-03-13,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (10:22):  I rise today to speak on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. The coalition welcomes this bill as it attempts to simplify and remove some of the red tape associated with a number of agriculture related acts. It gives me great pleasure to join with Senator Colbeck in his comments and with Senator Siewert in her comments. I applaud the fact that the Greens recognise that we must remove costs, and I applaud the Greens' acknowledgement that farmers are struggling in Western Australia and in my home state of South Australia through what have been the vagaries of agriculture since we settled this land in 1788.


I think it is also an opportune time to talk about the fact that soil in this country has probably about 50 per cent less carbon stored in it than it did when we settled this country. That is an issue that we should be looking to address with our research and development, and trying to provide farmers in this country with tools of a scientific basis with which to improve their carbon. As we all know the Direct Action Plan of the coalition would seek to restore carbon levels in this country back to the levels of the time when we came here and to make it more productive.


This Labor government has certainly not been a friend of agriculture in this country so far. Those opposite may talk about Australia as being the food bowl of Asia but they certainly are not doing much to make it happen. Part of the problem is the actual representation on the other side of the chamber. Working for a city based trade union or spending time as a Labor staffer before getting the nod for a position on a Labor Senate ticket does not give a person much exposure to rural industries. Doing the numbers to eliminate factional rivals is a long way removed from meticulous circumstances with fishing, farming and fibre family businesses.


We on this side, however, have a strong rural and regional representation. Senator Colbeck himself comes from regional Tasmania, I from the Clare Valley in South Australia, Senator McKenzie from Bendigo in Victoria, Senator Williams from the bush in New South Wales, Senator Heffernan from Junee in New South Wales and my South Australian colleague Senator Anne Ruston from the Riverland in South Australia. All my colleagues, in some way or another, have a firsthand knowledge and understanding of agricultural issues and are able to successfully handle and negotiate those industry concerns.


This is clearly demonstrated by Labor's breakdown in Australia's free trade agreement talks with Korea. Senator Colbeck spoke so eloquently about the ramifications of having a trade barrier of 15 per cent on everything that is going into South Korea. How can agricultural industries grow and compete internationally when Labor's decision to ban live cattle exports and its about-face on the Abel Tasman fishing vessel are causing the international community to distrust the Australian government and remove opportunities for strengthening relationships and negotiation processes? With Australia's $1 billion-a-year beef export market to Korea, the coalition recognises the importance of signing an all-inclusive free trade agreement. The longer Australia delays finalising a free trade agreement deal with South Korea, the harder it gets for our beef exporters to stop the US trade push, which is outmanoeuvring this Gillard government.


Never mind the mess that Labor has made in Tasmania and the timber industry, also labelled a disgrace by Senator Colbeck earlier today, or the complete shambles in which its state counterparts in my home state of South Australia have mismanaged the forestry industry. The ongoing impact of the Forestry South Australia sale has led to job losses and small businesses downsizing or, worse, closing down. At all levels, Labor just cannot manage our productive industries in this country. It does not understand business. It is a 'tax and spend', not a 'support and grow', government.


Despite Labor's incompetence in agricultural industries, agriculture still contributes more than $5 billion annually in production to the South Australian economy, and more than double this in value-adding to Australia's small and medium-sized enterprises. On 13,475 farms, 31,400 people are employed in agricultural production jobs, with 146,000 in the food sector alone. Agriculture is very important to my home state of South Australia and it is one of our major export industries, so we need to make sure we have the right policy settings to allow it to continue to prosper.


This bill is a step, albeit small, in the right direction. It amends eight portfolio acts, including wine legislation amendments. There are a large number of small to large wine businesses in the regions, employing a large number of people, from grape growing through to tourism. The industry provides much-needed economic activity—specifically in my hometown federal electorate of Wakefield, where unemployment is approximately 9.4 per cent, nearly twice the national average. Outrageously, unemployment is up 50 per cent in the last 12 months across the entire northern suburbs of Adelaide.


This bill will make two amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. The first of these amendments relates to the Label Integrity Program, which seeks to ensure the accuracy of label claims on vintage, variety and geographical indication of wine manufactured in Australia. These changes will reduce the record-keeping requirements of people who supply or receive wine goods that are packaged for sale to a consumer. These are positive changes which will be welcomed by retailers, wholesalers and wine industry representative bodies.


The second amendment alters the definition of 'vintage'. It is up to a producer to choose whether they include the vintage on the wine label. However, if they do, they must follow the rules relating to vintage labelling. Currently a vintage year on a label is considered to be the period 1 July to 30 June the following year, and it appears on the label as the second of the two calendar years.


The majority of harvest occurs from late summer and finishing before 30 June; however, sometimes winemakers leave their grapes on the vines for a longer period in order to cultivate different flavours and create a higher sugar content—you might know that, Senator Williams, as botrytis. To allow for more accurate labelling of these late harvest wines, this amendment will change the definition of vintage year to be the period of 1 September to 31 August. 


Moves to simplify wine labelling are welcomed; however, there are moves to further complicate wine labelling and force winemakers to mandate unproven labelling requirements. For example, the Blewett review contained a series of recommendations that would significantly impact the wine sector. These included pregnancy warnings; mandating energy content; warnings as a part of broader health campaigns; minimum font size; contrast levels and boldness for warning messages and allergens et cetera; and clear 'Made in Australia' terminology and existing label compliance.


These and other spurious claims made by extremists made under the guise of health claims will only add regulation and bureaucratic red tape. How soon before the health zealots, emboldened by their success over the tobacco industry, start demanding similar so-called health warnings on the labels of wine containers? Make no mistake: well-meaning but poorly guided health groups will be pushing to get their way with their messages on labels. Backed by sympathetic academics wheeled out to speak for narrow-interest pressure groups, they will want wine and any other forms of alcohol to get the same treatment as cigarettes in terms of nonpromotion in an oversimplification of the debate which, if the wine industry does not respond to these insidious representations, it may face a campaign of misinformation and dumbing down of the facts.


Going back to the bill, it also contains some useful amendments to fisheries and levies legislation and some technical amendments. This bill will also repeal the now redundant States Grants (War Service and Land Settlement) Act 1952. Just as a point of interest, some 755,000 acres of land were acquired under the scheme in South Australia.


While this Bill may reduce some much needed red tape, there is so much more that this government could and should be doing in the agriculture portfolio. Of particular concern is educating our future work force—where are our trained and skilled agriculturalists going to come from? Only 800 agronomists are being trained in Australia each year when the demand is for around 5,000. What support is being given to agricultural industries to promote the increase of resources and opportunity for future sustainable practices?


There is an apparent disconnect between the need for more secondary school students to undertake science based courses, particularly those that have relevance to primary production and the information being provided to them when they are choosing courses for not only their late secondary years but also tertiary.


I have concerns that many school career advisers either do not mention courses with an agricultural component as a potential career or are consciously discouraging students from studying them. We need to increase the proportion but we need to be strategic about how we resource that increase to ensure that there are no gaps. Rural industries have concerns about their potential workforce in the future. Filling the increasing void between the number of jobs and the dwindling number of trained candidates is a worrying trend.


This issue needs to be viewed in light of Labor's crackdown on the 457 visa scheme and the concern amongst business leaders as to the damage this does to confidence, investment and ultimately economic growth, job creation and incomes. Increasingly, businesses are looking to bring in workers from overseas to fill the vacancies and, while I have no problem with bringing in skilled and unskilled labour, it is an issue when you have areas like Wakefield with 9.4 per cent unemployment and 42 per cent youth unemployment in its northern suburbs.


Thousands of people are in a position and want the opportunity to be working but they just do not have the right skills. Of equal concern, education and the support of careers in the agriculture sector are not given enough attention when developing industry growth mechanisms. It is important that a balance be struck in building agricultural industries in Australia. A holistic approach must be taken when considering developing local education, training initiatives and foreign labour opportunities.


Furthermore, of paramount importance with this approach, it is crucial that we continue to promote agriculture in this country. Agriculture is one of our great strengths. It is one of our areas of true competitive advantage. Our farmers successfully compete against other countries without the same kinds of subsidies or government assistance. This is why we must continue to reduce the red and green tape for our farmers, something which this bill thankfully does.


But it does not go far enough and that is why the coalition is committed to taking over $1 billion of red bureaucratic tape out of our economy, helping our producers and businesses to be more productive and internationally competitive. That is why the coalition in our plan of real solutions for all Australians has agriculture as one of core pillars in our plan for the economy. We will build on our comparative strength in food production and better manage our precious water resources to help our agriculture sector truly become the food bowl of Asia with food security in a world demanding more of our food resources. We will support our fishing industry and review the declaration of the marine protected areas. Unlike Labor, we will establish genuine consultation with the fishing industry on research and strengthen the connection between science and sound fishing policy. Most importantly, the coalition will provide policy stability and certainty to our agricultural and production exports, particularly live exports, unlike Labor, who so flippantly shut down the trade overnight that day in June 2011. 


Labor continued to add insult to injury when Mr Kelvin Thomson, Labor member for Wills, was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary for Trade. Mr Thomson told the ABC's PM program on 18 September 2012: 'We would be much better off if we transitioned out of live animal export altogether and moved towards domestic processing.' This is not the kind of talk live cattle producers want to hear from their Parliamentary Secretary for Trade. It doesn't provide the kind of certainty producers need and the coalition will provide. It does not provide the certainty that the bankers of cattle producers across northern Australia want to hear. It does not provide the security that the Indonesian government, looking to feed hundreds of millions of people, would like to hear. 


Agriculture and farming communities deserve to be given a fair go and the coalition is committed to deliver opportunity so that industries can grow and successfully compete on equal playing fields both domestically and internationally. I will support the passage of this bill but lay at the feet of the Labor Party that it could have been more extensive reform. But it seems they are still burdened with the yoke of the Greens and their socialistic ways.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-03-13,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (10:39):  This bill, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment bill (No.1) 2012, makes a number of changes to the acts that relate to agriculture, fisheries and forestry legislation, including the Wine Australia Corporation Act on which we have heard from Senator Edwards some very detailed deliberation; and the Fisheries Management Act, with a direction to close a fishery under statutory fishing concessions. I should note that Australia is overwhelmingly now an importer of fish. I think about 72 per cent of our fish is now imported, which is a disgrace. It is absurd that we have countries outside our zone collecting vastly more fish than we do. Basically we are creating a mechanism to feed Taiwanese and Papua New Guineans and whoever else wishes to turn up with their fishing vessels. We should have a greater capacity to manage our own fishery and to provide for the Australian people more of their own fish. We have heard even lately the huge concerns out there about the use of excessive antibiotics in farmed fish, especially coming out of Vietnam. This causes real health concerns in Australia. The Australian people should be aware that if you want to create a mechanism for the consumption of a superbug you are going about it the right way if you are consuming fish that come from an area where there has been an excessive use of antibiotics, so that you basically create an environment where the only form of bacteria that will survive will be the one that is resistant to antibiotics and you have served it up with peas and carrots at your dinner table. I do not think that is a very clever way to do business. What I would be doing is consuming fish caught from the wild in Australia which has all the natural forms of challenge and response affecting its life as opposed to what you are getting when you are buying a product that is imported. It might look like the domestic product but I can assure you it is totally and utterly different. So we have a role in the future to start informing the Australian people about the fact that we have a better product, that there is the capacity for a better utilisation of our fishery resource and to make sure we using more of that to feed the Australian people with a product they wish to purchase.


The legislation also deals with the Fisheries Administration Act and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act, which is basically going to enable the secretary to remit all or part of a penalty imposed for the late payment of the levy or charge. It also deals with the Farm Household Support Act to remove specific references to departments and secretaries. The coalition supports these changes because they streamline administration and reduce costs for the industry in some instances. But it is unfortunate that this bill is not reflective of the government's broader approach to our primary industries. Australia's agricultural exports still account for more than 20 per cent of our exports. 


We have to realise that we should never get confused between the GDP argument and where the money in reality actually turns up. In the chamber here at the moment there are seven senators, eight with you in the chair, Mr Acting Deputy President. If we have a case where someone brings in $10 and spins it around to every senator in this chamber, they say, 'Whoopee, the GDP of this chamber is now $80.' That sounds great. They will say, 'That is $80 and around 88 per cent of it came from all those people inside the chamber, who are the service sector. Therefore the service sector is incredibly important.' But the reality is that if the gentleman in the chair had not put his $10 forward first then no-one in the chamber would have any money, because it is that money that has been spun around. So the actual delivery of money into the economy, the actual delivery of funds in a primary source, is vitally important for the economic sustenance of this nation, and 20 per cent of that comes from the agricultural sector. Then you have mining, obviously Australia's biggest export. It is for our own survival as a nation that we must be cognisant of where primary industry is going and we must make sure it is sustained. I know the farming sector has always been the harbinger of people who have generally got a gripe. I grew up in that sector and I am still part of that sector. But now there really is a problem. We are losing farmers. They are going out the back door. I went to Western Australia and spoke to farmers there. I went there as a politician and I came away feeling like a psychologist. It is quite disturbing how much under the pump they are. In the wheat industry they have been frosted and they are dealing with the corruption of global world prices by reason of a manipulated global currency. In Western Australia they had the live sheep trade, but of course those in the radical environmental movement want to shut down the live sheep trade. We are just making people destitute. We are making them poor. We are destroying their quality of life—and, in so doing, we are doing it to ourselves.


There are 134,000 farm businesses in Australia and there are 307,000 people employed in Australian agriculture. That is vastly more than is employed in the mining industry—vastly more. People are always thinking that the farm sector does not pull its weight, but from 1974-75 to 2003-04 it grew just shy of three per cent per annum. It was consistently outperforming other sectors. So, when you are looking for productivity increases, the farming sector—when it has the right government policy surrounding it—will actually deliver it. When I started in the cotton industry, we used to budget on 2.7 bales to the acre. There are 2.471 acres to the hectare, but we were still working on acres. So it was about 2.7 bales to the acre, and with that it was thought that you were doing the job well. Now it is four bales to the acre. Imagine if we could do that in other sectors of our economy. The economy would boom. We have been doing that in agriculture.


I remember when there was a discussion about GPS. They were going to GPS for the delivery of the chemical requirements of the land, because we needed to save money. If you look at the scope and structure and carcass size in the abattoirs, you see that it has gone up immensely. The marbling content has gone up immensely. The quality of the product has gone up immensely. There have been real productivity increases, but we cannot be constricted by certain regulations which are more emotive than realistic. The inclusion of buffel grass into the pasture in red soils has given us an incredible increase in the capacity for the delivery of protein per acre off country which otherwise is not able to deliver an outcome. There have been watering issues. In my own family hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent on piping and boring groundwater to save that resource. That is why we get so hot under the collar when we hear about coal seam gas and other people utilising the resource without the same sanctity with which we hold that water resource. These are the things that agriculture has been delivering.


This has been one of our strengths for so long but we are now losing farming families. There are 100,000 fewer farming families now then there were 30 years ago. Even the size of our agricultural area is reducing. In 1980 we had about 496 million hectares of farming land. In 2010 there was just shy of 400 million hectares. We have lost about 100 million hectares of farming country. If we look anecdotally at one of the industries that was at one stage the key of the providence of this nation we see that in 1980 we had 136 million sheep and in 2010 we had 68 million sheep—and it is going down even more.


This is a sign that our policy structure is not correct. There is an epiphany we have got to have as we go stammering and tripping along to an election, who knows when. If we want to have a real debate—something that the Australian people will be engaged with—another area that we should be looking at is farm policy. We need to look at how we make sure that we keep these people on the land, how we make sure that we give a fair return to people on the land and how we make sure that we are part of a process that actually deals with issues. Anybody can have empathy. Empathy is easy. Just stick on a pair of elastic-sided boots, put on an akubra and talk out the side of your mouth and you have got empathy all worked out. But that just does not cut it.


What people are looking for now is policy that is going to address the needs and requirements of the industry to bring a future back into agriculture. The only way that you will get a future in agriculture is if you are determined to bring about a fairer outcome at the farm gate. There are a range of things that have been working against us at the farm gate. First and foremost we have the dollar. We have the United States which is in a period of quantitative easing; we have the Chinese who have basically manipulated their currency and tied it to the Americans who are printing their own dollars; we have the Europeans who are in a period of quantitative easing and subsidies; and we have England quantitatively easing. 


We have to starting asking the question: are we going to be pure in debt? Are we going to be the people who never broke a rule but we all went broke? The return at the farm gate is getting smashed by the global corruption in the currency market. What is the government's policy for this? How are they going to deal with this? Coming up with a constructive outcome in that area would be vastly beneficial. You can do that in a Giorgio Armani suit with Jimmy Choo shoes on, and that is going to be a vastly better outcome than wearing an akubra hat and elastic-sided books and not having anything really to say.


There is also the exploitation of the farmer by an overcentralised retail market. In the past it was like: 'Oh, we can't talk about that.' Well, we have got to talk about that. It is just unnatural. We are the only place in the world that has the form of centralisation that we have got—except North Korea. It has probably got more centralisation than us. But, apart from that, we are it. There is nothing wrong with a company being powerful—good luck to Coles, good luck to Woolworths; well done—but there is a problem if they use that market power for the exploitation of the farmer. We have a Competition and Consumer Act that talks about the competitive stresses between two competitors in a market, but it does not properly address the exploitation between the supplier and the retailer. It does not properly deal with that relationship. We should have a policy discussion—the coalition has a root-and-branch review, but that is a policy discussion that the government should also be engaged in. How do we go about bringing a fairer term back to people?


The obvious example out there is $1-per-litre milk. You cannot produce milk for a $1 a litre—not on the farm. By the time the processer has had a chop at it and the retailer has had a chop at it, it is corrupting the marketplace. The retailers say, 'We're not affecting the farm price,' and they are right, because they buy it off the processer. The processor says, 'We can't do anything about it because we're supplying the retailer.' And the farmer just suffers. We have to go into the space and say that we want Coles and Woolworths to survive, prosper and thrive, but we cannot do it at the cost of exploitation of people on the land. We cannot have people turning up with the unilateral variation of contracts. If we did it to a wage and salary earner there would be an outcry. Imagine turning up to a wage and salary earner and saying: 'You know how I was paying you $800 a week last week? This week I've decided I am going to pay you only $300 a week, and I know you have nowhere to go.' If we did that to individuals people would be disgusted, but that is happening to farmers and we are all sitting back and saying: 'Oh, that's shocking, but we can't say anything about it. We can't interfere in the market.'


When there is exploitation it means that the market principles are not at work. The situation is devoid of the market principles, and when it is devoid of market principles then you have a role for bringing about fairness. If there were ease of entry, ease of exit, transparency in negotiations, multiplicity of players—with those sorts of terms you could say, 'I'll walk,' but farmers cannot do that, especially in the horticultural sector. Tomatoes, peas, carrots, onions—those farmers get held over a barrel. They are terrified to talk about it because they know that if they talk about it and the major retailer finds out about it then they will get cut out and go broke. We found out that the average price a dairy farmer is working for is $7 an hour. Who in this building would work for $7 an hour? Who in Australia these days would work for $7 an hour? If you want to look after working families then where is the policy that deals with that?


We need new infrastructure and we need to open up new areas of irrigation. We need to have a future. There is a great capacity, especially in the north of this nation and with the utilisation of genetic modification in some areas, for the advancement of agriculture in these areas. You cannot say: 'I'm a friend to the farmer but I don't want any new farming areas. I'm a friend to the farmer but I don't believe in the live cattle trade. I'm a friend to the farmer but I want to make life even tougher for the people of south-west Western Australia who are dealing with the live sheep trade. I'm a friend to the farmer, but I believe it is morally justifiable that some Australians today, in the year of our Lord 2013, are getting paid $7 an hour.' That is not being a friend to anybody. If we are going to be fair dinkum about this we have to have an holistic view and say, 'Right, we're going to walk into this space and before this election we will make sure we are not talking about who said what to whom, and having some peripheral personality discussion in the election, but that we will be having a discussion about concrete policy issues that involves the Australian people and that brings us to a conclusion that is a betterment to the agricultural sector, because the Australian people need the agricultural sector.' We really do need it.


We have to look at the ethos of it. In my own small way I am trying to be part of the dams task force to build dams and create another mechanism of investment in agriculture, and I think that is positive. We have to touch base with the marketing department in trade. We are having real problems. It is no good going over to Beijing, Taipei, Tokyo or Seoul and coming back with photos full of happy, smiling people drinking cups of tea, but with no contract. You have to come home with something hard, something that shows you have opened up the market, something that shows a new form of advantage. We cannot develop new agricultural areas if we cannot move the product. We have to be able to follow that through, and that is something that needs a succinct group of people who work as closely with the Prime Minister as possible, who have the capacity and the runs on the board to deliver trade outcomes. We have to get them to work.


Minister Craig Emerson is supposed to be the trade minister, but what has he ever brought back? What has he ever delivered as a trade outcome? What is a deal that he has structured for us? If he were good at his job then farmers would be doing it better, but they are not—he has failed. Whenever I think of Dr Craig Emerson I have a picture of a man doing a dance in our courtyard. I cannot get it out of my head. I cannot see how he could be the trade minister. Now we have Minister Kelvin Thomson assisting him. The last thing I remember about Minister Kelvin Thomson is that he wanted to shut down the live cattle trade. In fact, he was playing his banjo at the Midwinter Ball and shutting down the live cattle trade. This is not much use to us. This is not much of a help. To give him his due, in the past Minister Simon Crean was not a bad agricultural minister, but we do not have him now. And Minister Burke has enough problems of his own at the moment.


We have to engage in this discussion about how a farm sector that is truly under the pump can be picked up and moved forward. All Australian people look to the farm sector as representative of how competent we are. They empathise with people on the land because they know they do it tough—and they do. They recognise that every farmer is also an agronomist, a veterinarian and a diesel fitter, and they do it for nothing. People recognise that they have done what the nation has asked of them: they went out west and scratched a living out of the dirt to provide a providence for this nation. We owe it to that farm sector to go back to that space right now and start coming up with a farm policy to bring forward at the election so that we can deliver a better horizon for them right now.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2013-03-13,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (10:59):  I also rise to speak on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I would like to congratulate the government and the department on a bill that aspires to do such fantastic things, some of these things we really support not only throughout the agriculture, fisheries and forestry legislation but right throughout the government's work. It reduces red tape, creates clearer Commonwealth laws and improves the effectiveness and efficiency of regulation. I would encourage the government, having taken this very small step, to take some giant strides using this same underpinning principle right across its portfolios. It shows that the department has been listening to industry with the future in mind. The coalition obviously will be supporting measures by the government to reduce regulation and make things simpler for those who live outside capital cities and work in agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries.


The bill before us will make minor amendments to eight portfolio acts to improve the operation of the existing legislation and make some technical amendments. As I have mentioned, the bill will reduce red tape. This is fantastic considering that the current regulatory ratio for this government is 200 to one: 200 new regulations in, one out—quite a poor performance. So we are absolutely going to be supporting some streamlining efforts here today. It is going to reduce complexity and unnecessary regulation, and I welcome that. I particularly mention a group within the agricultural sector: the chemical suppliers. Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 is another bill we have been debating lately. The inquiry that we have been having in the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport committeehas shown that the government's changes under that particular group of new regulations is going to be quite significant to industry. 


The regulatory impact statement of that legislation called for 'better regulation of agriculture and veterinary chemicals'—better for whom? The Deloitte Access Economics report showed there had been increasing costs of $8 million per year to product registrations. How does that actually help farmers compete globally and become the food bowl for Asia? There is no clear cost-benefit analysis done, but then again this government has form. Maybe it almost has an aversion to cost benefit analysis. When we think of the NBN, if only it had done one it might tell a different story today. Chemical registration has increased by nearly a third, increasing not just the cost but also the time. This is the time that it takes people working in the sector to do the audit. As it is reviewed every five years, they are going to have to redo this.


One of the acts that will be amended is the wine legislation amendments. Schedules 1 and 2 of the bill make two amendments to the Wine Australia Corporation Act 1980. The first amendment relates to the label integrity program. We know how important having integrity and truth in labelling laws is, particularly to the agricultural sector. Research shows that Australians want to buy Australian products. They need to know that it is an Australian product. There needs to be no deception about what proportion or percentage of the product before them on their supermarket shelves is home-grown, homemade and owned by Australians. We need to be supporting labelling laws that give truth in labelling.


It is useful to know that these changes to the wine legislation amendments are supported and agreed to by the retailer, wholesaler and wine industry representative bodies. As Senator Joyce mentioned, it would be great to get all of those players around the supply chain on the same page when it comes to dealing with issues, particularly around supermarkets. There are significant issues in our community right throughout the supply chain in how suppliers and processors are dealt with all in the name of chasing a cheap product for the end consumer. I am sure that, if consumers were made aware of what was occurring further back in the supply chain, they would be more than happy to adjust their spending habits.


The second area that is going to be amended under this bill is the fisheries legislation amendment. Schedule 3 of the bill before us will amend theFisheries Management Act 1991to explain requirements for directions to close a fishery or a particular part of a fishery to fishing. The government has form in that area too. Whilst tightening regulation and reducing red and green tape is commendable in this bill, there are issues around fisheries legislation with this government that need putting on the record. We have argued this time and time again in this place over recent times.


We have the best managed fisheries in the world. We use science to manage those fisheries. It has been quite interesting how this government has chosen to be a subscriber of scientific method and scientific outcomes when it suits them. The Abel Tasman decision was a triumph of politics over science and one that increased our sovereign risk as a nation. If you go out into the community and talk to our fishers right around the country about this government's track record in supporting them, you will find a very different story.


The third area that will be addressed in the bill before us is the levies legislation amendment. Schedule 5 of the bill will amend the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to allow the departmental secretary to consider all requests made by levy payers for the remission of penalties. It actually is providing recourse for those who are paying levies and for the variety of levies as we have moved to a user pays system across various aspects of our agriculture, forestry and fishery industries. At the moment, the provision applies only if the levy is over $5,000. This change will actually allow anyone who is paying a levy to make a request to the departmental secretary for the remission of that penalty. That is a good decision, because whilst $5,000 might not seem a lot of money to some people, for small businesses that are working within these industries and paying these levies that amount can be quite significant in terms of their operating costs. 


Schedule 6 of the bill makes technical amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, the Export Control Act 1982 and the Quarantine Act 1908. We support this bill and we welcome the changes the government has made, but when we talk about research into agriculture, yes, we can fiddle around and make technical amendments, as we are doing in this bill, but this government has not supported agricultural research. We have seen cuts to CSIRO funding and cuts to agricultural R&D over time and all the time. If we are going to develop and drive further innovation in our already highly efficient and effective agricultural sector then R&D funding is essential. Senator Edwards, in his contribution, made reference to the lack of undergraduate students in our agricultural education degrees, and that is a huge concern for those of us who have a passion for agriculture and sustainability of our local communities in regional Australia. We need to get more young people interested in and studying agriculture. If they are not going through at the undergrad level, we are not producing any great researchers at the postgrad level. I notice Senator Siewert nodding, as a proud holder of an agricultural science degree. We need to be producing a high proportion of undergrad ag scientists so that we can have the skills and expertise that are specific to our nation, to our farming methods and to our land and that will allow the research and development required to drive innovation for our agricultural industries. This government has poor form in that area—a lot of talk but no action.


The bill also contains amendments to modernise the language in two acts. Talking about modernising language reminds me of something I have been thinking about which does have a regional perspective. In looking at legislation around education—which I have been doing this week—I note that the government wants all schools to teach one of four Asian languages to all students in our nation. It can be Hindi, Mandarin, Japanese or Indonesian. My issue is that we are not graduating enough teachers from university who are specialised in these languages as it is now—let alone enough to be putting them right across the country. I am thinking of places like Wycheproof and Echuca, and right throughout regional areas. If we cannot fill our LOTE requirement in our capital cities, I am really struggling to understand how we are going to do it out in the regions.


The bill will also be amending the Export Control Act. That brings me to another Labor failure in the agriculture portfolio, and that would be the live cattle exports. I am sure that others have made worthy mention of this government's poor track record in dealing with that issue, such as the damaged relationships with our Indonesian neighbours and the crisis that is occurring on farm, even today, as farmers deal with the fallout of decisions made for political reasons, as a reaction to public pressure rather than in a leadership-focused manner. 


The Quarantine Act 1908 will also be amended by the bill. When I think about the Quarantine Act and agriculture, I think about the New Zealand apples issue from last year. In my own home state the Goulburn Valley produces 80 per cent of the national pear crop and a significant amount of our national apple crop, and the biosecurity issues around the importation of New Zealand apples had a severe impact on that community in terms of confidence and in terms of what this government understands about how they live, how they work and what they require in terms of leadership from a government out there in the regions. This was all going on at the same time that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan consultations were happening right across that area of northern Victoria, and it led to huge uncertainty and a huge lack of confidence. If this government were serious about supporting agriculture, fisheries and forestry, it could do more around quarantine and biosecurity. It could do more to support our potato growers and our ginger growers. We have so many inquiries into biosecurity issues within the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee at the moment, it seems that this whole area needs to be looked at and the government needs to get serious about supporting our industries and protecting them—and I am not afraid to say 'protecting our local industries from international threats.' When I go back to Shepparton I think of the closed shops right around that area as a result of a combination of this government's response to environmental watering and their relationship with the Greens. 


Schedules 7 and 8 make some other amendments. Schedule 7 will amend the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to remove specific references to departments and secretaries in the act so that when changes are made to the administrative arrangements orders the act will not require amendment. With respect to the Farm Household Support Act, I am still waiting to hear from the minister on an act of grace payment around farm exit grants. So, when we are talking about supporting farm households, they are doing it tough. As Senator Joyce outlined, they are not just dealing with a decrease in income; the increase in input costs for farms is ridiculous. 


I was out at Tongala with the dairy farmers with Senator Joyce a few weeks ago, hearing their direct tales. This carbon tax was not actually going to affect agriculture, but the impact on our dairy farmers has been significant. There are people who cannot pump water because of the carbon tax. There are people who have to pay exorbitant electricity costs to keep their milk fresh and safe for human consumption, costs that have just risen exponentially under the carbon tax.


It was not just increased electricity costs and input costs; they were talking about increased labour costs and increased costs of fertiliser—right across the board, their inputs are increasing. You just cannot keep doing this. You cannot keep absorbing. Across the way says: 'It's only a one per cent increase. It's only a 0.5 per cent increase'. But, when your margin is less than four per cent, that very quickly adds up to an unsustainable business, and that is what we are dealing with. It is as a result of an increasing number of green and environmentalist agendas right throughout this government. 


The coalition is interested in reducing not only red tape to our small businesses but also green tape. It is very disappointing that the federal government has walked away from negotiations with the states to streamline the assessment and approval processes under the EPBC Act. There was a commitment that all levels of government would work together to ensure that our environment is protected and our businesses can still make a dollar. It is not rocket science; we have just got to make it simpler, without sacrificing the environment. It is possible if we work together and worry less about the fallout in Brunswick and more about the actual outcomes. 


I am reminded of the Prime Minister's visit to Western Sydney last week. I mirror the concerns of the National Party leader, Warren Truss, when he very sensibly asked the Prime Minister to spend a week in regional Australia, living and working with us, seeing firsthand the frustrations that we experience. No, we are not congested with traffic, but we have a lot of other challenges—don't we, Senator Ruston, out there—challenges that the Prime Minister would do well to actually see and feel firsthand—not just fly in for the photo op, for the flood or the fire, but to actually come and see how we live and work, and understand us. And then maybe this great bit of legislation before us, making minor amendments to a variety of bills around the agriculture, forestry and fisheries portfolio, would become a cause for the Prime Minister; maybe she could encourage the minister to seek other ways, more significant ways, to assist agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries. She is welcome down my way, if she wants to come down to Victoria. But I am sure there are multiple communities right throughout Australia that would love to host the Prime Minister for a week. 


At the end of the day, regional Australia does produce the wealth. The agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries contribute 20 per cent, as Senator Joyce said, to our economic future. They are innovative; they are world's best practice. The way we are able to manage our environment and our agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries together and ensure best outcomes for both is world leading and we need to be celebrating that and supporting that. This government has—in the examples I have outlined for you—a poor track record over its time. 


Despite the government, the department is very capable of taking action in this area. I would really like to commend them and encourage them to go further. It also shows this government is capable of reducing regulation, despite the modesty of the ones before us. I support this bill and commend it to the Senate.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2013-03-13,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (11:19):  A number of the things raised by Senator McKenzie are fantastic examples of where the agricultural sector in this country is overburdened by the weight of compliance regulation and red tape.


I stand to speak on the Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. This bill seeks to make a range of amendments on a range of different bills. I would like to briefly comment on the wine legislation amendments, but I would like to reserve the majority of my comments today for the States Grants (War Service Land Settlement) Act 1952, which is to be repealed as part of this bill. 


I was involved in the development of the wine integrity program that the wine industry developed a number of years ago. It is a very good example of a labelling program. However, nobody in this place should be fooled that that was the most extraordinarily difficult program to put together. The Winemakers' Federation, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and their state affiliate associations went through an inordinate amount of trouble trying to get some sort of consensus position about just developing that one homogenous product, the labelling program. So I think we would be well advised to take on some of the examples and the experiences of the development of that program when we have a look at some of the wider labelling programs that we are looking at. 


Certainly, labelling has been the perennial issue, particularly with regard to identification of Australian product and Australian produce and the differentiation between our clean home-grown product in Australia and imported products. The debate is obviously further confused when we get out into the wider marketplace: 'product of Australia', 'made in Australia', 'packaged in Australia'; and the issues of seasonality, consistency of supply and ingredients that are not available in Australia. I would suggest that we would do well to have a look at the experience of the wine industry's Label Integrity Program in the process of trying to develop a labelling program for the benefit of Australian producers. And, in remembering this, we certainly need to have a look at the Greens bill that has been put before this place. We will see that it is fraught with a lot of danger if we try to go forward and make a one-size-fits-all labelling program, notwithstanding the fact that there is an urgent need for such a program.


It is actually with a level of sadness that I am here today to witness, I assume, with the passage of this bill, the repealing of the State Grants (War Service Land Settlement) Act 1952. The region that I was born in, that I was brought up in and that I now, again, live in was built as a soldier settlement. Post the First World War a number of soldier settlers came and lived in towns such as Cobdogla, Waikerie, Berri, Cadell, Chaffey and the town in which I live, Renmark. Some horrendous mistakes were made by these soldier settlers because they certainly did not have the kind of information about irrigation technologies and the things that we now so take for granted. They had no idea how to get access to market, to move their products to where they were to be purchased. Obviously, the tyranny of distance, following the First World War, was quite significant in comparison to our ability to quickly move product and produce as we do today. And bear in mind that a lot of this product was perishable, so it was not a case of putting it on a truck or a dray being pulled by a horse and letting it wander off to Adelaide in due course, because the product just would not get there. So there were many mistakes in the first soldier settlement in the region in which I live.


But, following the Second World War, we had another influx of soldier settlement properties, particularly in the town of Loxton, which was developed post Second World War and which is probably the major town we are referring to today with the repealing of this act. A number of other areas in South Australia were also developed as soldier settlements following the Second World War—places such as Parndana on Kangaroo Island and Padthaway in the south-east of our state. These were thriving regional communities. They had extraordinarily strong cultures. They were built on a sense of 'can do' in the face of extraordinary adversity. They had wonderful organisations of people who got together—the foundation of organisations such as the CWA, Civil Defence and RSL, which were all hugely active participants in the community. They built these communities into very strong, self-sufficient communities. They had no reliance on the outside world for what they did.


As a child I can remember that, if there were a bushfire in the surrounding area, my father and everybody else's father would all jump in somebody's ute. There would be 10 guys with shovels in the back of the ute. They would go off and they would dig firebreaks. Nobody put up their hand and said: 'Where's the government funding? Where's the front-end loader or the grader that is going to turn up, that somebody else will provide?' They just went out there and did it themselves. This pioneering spirit that was developed in these communities following the soldier settlements, I think, is intrinsic in the culture that still largely exists in these communities.


Another great thing that was born of the soldier settlements was the cooperatives. The growers, by necessity, got together and formed cooperatives so that they could actually market and sell their products. Of course, in those days it was difficult to sell individually from the farm gate. We did not have the tourism drive-bys where you could pop in and buy a bottle of wine at the cellar door. Farmers had to have a way of getting their products into the marketplace. So they saw the wisdom of forming cooperatives and, in the process of forming those co-operatives, they also retained control of their product well past the farm gate—something, unfortunately, that is being eroded over time. We now see our farmers not having the control over their product that they used to. Most of our co-ops have folded, they have been corporatised or they have been bought out by big players. The big end of town now has a huge amount of control over our farming communities and it is probably one of the great reasons that our farmers out there are possibly struggling. But, as I said, the spirit of these communities is still alive and I think it can be rekindled. But the fabric of this is slowly being eroded and we would be very well advised to take a good look at it now and try to resurrect it before it is completely gone. The productivity of this country has been built on the back of these communities, which are self-sufficient and which did not rely on government handouts, which they are now being forced to do simply because of the overburden of things that are being forced on them.


There is no doubt and we have to acknowledge that things such as exchange rates and the globalisation of the world marketplace and commodity prices are all having a major impact on our farmers at the moment. There is probably not a great deal we can do about that. But in looking at that we also have to realise there are a number of things that are under our control. I commend this bill today because it actually seeks to improve:


… the effectiveness and efficiency of regulation, reducing red tape and creating clearer Commonwealth laws, the proposed amendments will reduce complexity and unnecessary regulation, provide consistency, amend outdated or unclear provisions and reduce the likelihood of reader confusion.


Those are very admirable aims that are being sought in this particular bill. We commend it for that. But the reality is that it really does not go very far when you consider the enormity of the things that this bill is seeking to achieve out of the five acts that it is looking to work on. It really does not go very far. Senator McKenzie outlined an absolute myriad of different burdens that are currently placed on our farmers and a myriad of different acts and regulations. I commend the bill, but I certainly suggest that we need to go a lot further.


Just this morning I was dealing with an issue where red tape and compliance costs and the unnecessary overburden of government regulation and involvement in a process, which I do not necessarily think the government needs to be involved in to the kind of degree that it is, have seen a small Riverland grower lose a lucrative export market. Why? Because of the cost of export certification. Mr Punturiero, who is a small Riverland grower—he and his wife have a small citrus orchard in Renmark—has been exporting a few pallets of very high-quality limes every year into New Zealand. He does it for a very small period and exports only a very small number of pallets. Last year the cost of certification for his shed, because New Zealand is a market that requires certification much the same way as we require certification for products coming into Australia, was $500. This year he will have to pay $1,800 because he will have the benefit of a rebate of almost $6,000. Next year he will have to pay $8,350 to export the same small quantity of limes into New Zealand that he paid $500 for the privilege of exporting last year. The reality of all this is that he is not going to export them. He cannot possibly afford to pay $1,000 a pallet to AQIS, or the department, just so that they can come in for a couple of hours and say that his shed meets the phytosanitary requirements that are demanded by this market. Last week, along with Senator Xenophon, I moved a motion in this place to ask AQIS if it would review this particular licensing system, because it is totally and utterly discriminatory and discouraging to small- and medium-sized growers like Mr Punturiero. 


Cost-saving reforms were supposed to have accompanied the move to cost recovery that was agreed to by both sides of the House when it was brought in, but what we have seen here is that the cost recovery activities have been introduced but we have not seen those cost-saving reforms that were supposed to overlay those changes. So, instead of seeing a situation where there might have been a small increase in the amount of money that was necessary for Mr Punturiero to pay for his certification, we now see a situation where it is now so exorbitant that he plainly cannot afford to pay it, and in the process of doing that has now lost—at least for this year, until we can get this matter sorted out—a very lucrative, albeit small, market into New Zealand.


It is not just horticultural industries that are being faced with this burden. I have had calls from people in the meat industry and the vegetable industry—it is across the board that the little guys are just not able to afford this amount of money. The really stupid part of all this is that we, as a country, end up being the net loser. Small growers, seasonal exporters, niche market exporters and growers who see a market opportunity will all be excluded from being able to export their products. These exporters—along with the big guys, who I acknowledge are obviously very important in the marketplace, but even the little exporters—earn export dollars. They are the ones who give us the plus side on our balance of trade, and let us not make too fine a point of it: those people that export are the ones that we really need to be looking after. We also need to realise that often a dollar spent in encouraging an export market to be developed or to be pursued ends up with a huge multiplier effect in terms of the money that is returned to the Australian economy by virtue of that.


When we pass this legislation today—which I am assuming we will—we need to be very aware of the consequences out there on the ground of putting in place legislative change, compliance and the burden of bureaucracy. As has been mentioned previously, one of the great things that we need to be doing is to encourage our research and development, which is something we have been cutting back on again. We need to encourage research and development, because it is our only competitive advantage in Australia. We certainly are not going to be able to compete in international markets on price, so we need to make sure that we are the smartest, the cleverest and the most innovative, as we have been in the past. I refer to this in terms of taking it back to the soldier settlers of the community, in which I grew up in. Those guys were innovative. We used to sell our irrigation technology into Israel. We now see that Israel has a huge irrigation technology business, and they are now selling to the rest of the world. We need to get back to a position where Australia is at the forefront of leading in technology, innovation and making sure that we take advantage of selling to the rest of the world what we do so fabulously well.


There were bills referred to this morning such as the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 that was supposed to decrease the amount of burden on growers for compliance. It seems a little odd that we can have an extra $2 million that has to be picked up by cost recovery to growers and that is not considered a burden. The Biosecurity Bill 2012 is another example, where the burden is on industry to prove. If we put as much effort into making the people who import into this country comply as we put into making our exporters comply when they send product offshore, I am sure we would see a better balance. I am not going to go on about the carbon tax and the increasing costs and import costs, but it is fair to say they are very real and, when you own a business in rural and regional Australia and you are fighting all the other things you have to fight, the increasing costs that we have seen, particularly in relation to those people who require refrigeration, have been exorbitant. 


While I am very happy today to support this bill as it does, in some small way, address the red tape, it highlights to me the huge job we have to unravel the bureaucratic burden that farmers have to deal with every day. So, with a great deal of sadness, I acknowledge the need to repeal the act in relation to the soldier settlements from the community that I grew up in, and I hope that, maybe, in the amending of this bill, we will see further amendments in further bills to get rid of the burden and the red tape that face our growers so that maybe the soldier settlements in the communities—the strong and vibrant communities which I and many other people from the country grew up in—can be restored for the future.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-03-13,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:35):  I endorse the remarks of Senator Ruston. Just this morning, we were both on Leon Byner's program on Radio FIVEaa to talk about the plight facing Mick and Tanya Punturiero—salt of the earth people, lime growers. They are innovators and hard workers in the Riverland of South Australia who are now in a position where they cannot export to New Zealand, a niche market that they need and that has been denied to them because the AQIS inspection fees have gone up from $550 to something like $8,530, a 1,300 per cent increase. I know there are rebates involved, but there is bureaucracy, paperwork and red tape involved in that. The fact is that it should not be that hard to be a farmer in this country. You have a situation where there are so many obstacles and barriers, particularly for smaller producers—for the Mick and Tanya Punturieros of this world, who are the innovators and have done the right thing. I and Senator Ruston know Mick and Tanya well. They have been overseas and they have looked at the latest technologies in terms of water-saving techniques. They have looked at ways of producing limes that are world quality—they are clean, green producers—yet they are missing out on an export market because these rules have been put in place that just do not make sense. We also have to look at the context of how important agriculture is to this country. The gross value of agricultural, fisheries and forestry production in 2010-11 was $51.8 billion. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs were created as a result of that, and yet we are making it more difficult for our farmers. Whilst I welcome this legislation, it does not address the fundamental issues and the fundamental challenges facing our farmers.


I note that Senator Colbeck in his contribution made reference to Asian honey bees. There was not adequate consultation and an opportunity was lost to eradicate the Asian honey bee when it was first discovered on a ship near Cairns. I note the work that Senator Milne has done in relation to this and her similar concerns. It is also worth mentioning, in terms of the context of labelling, that we are talking about wine labelling and improvements in respect of the integrity of our wonderful wine industry. 


Senator Siewert made mention of genetically modified organisms, GMOs, and how there are reports coming out of the United States that Monsanto's corn crops, which are GMO crops, are failing. I think that is very, very significant. We need better labelling of GMOs in this country not just so that consumers can make an informed choice as to whether they want to buy a product containing GMOs or not, but also to protect those farmers that want to be GMO free and that want to keep export markets in Europe, in Japan and throughout the world where there is a clear preference for non-GMO crops. That would mean that those farmers would not be prejudiced as well.


I note that Senator Edwards made reference to the forward selling of the forestry contracts by the South Australian government—a stupid, stupid decision that will prejudice the vitality and the economic development of the south-east of South Australia in particular. It does not make sense. One issue I have is not with Senator Edwards but with the endorsed Liberal candidate for Barker—we have had a bit of an interchange in the media about what a state Liberal government could do to cancel that contract. The advice I have sought and had from constitutional law experts such as Professor John Williams, the Dean of the University of Adelaide Law School, is that there is no constitutional prohibition in the South Australian Constitution to stop any future government tearing up that contract and saying, 'We will go back to our original position.' Of course there are issues of sovereign risk, but there is no legal impediment to any future South Australian government to say, 'We will take back a particular contract and keep it in state hands.' I maintain that position is technically and legally correct. There is an issue of sovereign risk, but I would have thought that the risk to the people of the south-east—their jobs, the future of the timber industry and associated industries—is too great as a result of what the government has done.


This bill also looks at wine labelling. There is another issue that has not been touched on, and that goes to fraud. That goes to winemakers, particularly in overseas markets, where there is counterfeit wine. I was involved in the case not so long involving Emanuel Skorpos, who runs the Flinders Run Winery. He is an award-winning winemaker on the Southern Flinders Ranges Estate. He had to spend his own money and chase up the counterfeiting of his labels in China. I think more needs to be done on this. We need to give as much support as we can, particularly for small producers, in respect of that.


The Blewett review has also been mentioned in the context of this debate, and I note that Senator Joyce made a useful contribution. Several years ago, in a very unusual unity ticket, Senator Joyce, then Leader of the Australian Greens Senator Bob Brown and I introduced a bill. We co-sponsored a bill in relation to the issue of food labelling and country-of-origin labelling. That shows that this is an issue that transcends party politics. It transcends ideologies and it is about common sense. We need to have effective food-labelling laws in this country in order to assist, as Senator McKenzie said and as Senator Ruston made the point in her contribution, people who want to be able to make a choice about buying Australian produce. Right now our food-labelling laws are an absolute disgrace. You have a situation where 'Made in Australia' just means that a product has been 'substantially transformed' by 51 per cent in the production process. What does that mean? It means that you can buy orange juice that says 'Made in Australia', yet 90 per cent of the concentrate of that juice could have come from Brazil, for instance, and consumers are none the wiser. The label says 'Made from local and imported ingredients'. That is an insult to consumers.


The Blewett review was a long time coming. It made some recommendations to improve the system. I thought the Blewett review was weak in many respects and that it did not go far enough. But at least it made some constructive recommendations, and I commend the work that Dr Blewett did in relation to that. But what did the government do? It ignored it. It ignored it to the cost of consumers. It ignored it to the cost of our farmers. Last year I went to a property in the Riverland where 50-year-old orange trees were being ripped out because the price of oranges was so terrible. If you talk to Ron Gray in the Riverland—a stalwart of and an advocate for strong food-labelling and country-of-origin labelling laws—he will tell you about the trees that he has had to rip out having turned off the water. His neighbours have done the same thing. Prices are so low, in part because our food-labelling laws are so weak. This bill does not address that and we need to address that.


Biosecurity was touched on by Senator Colbeck. It is worth mentioning that we have a situation where apples have been allowed in from New Zealand. AQIS says it has risk matrixes in place, but I do not know whether they are that effective. I am concerned that we are looking at bringing in potatoes from New Zealand which will potentially have a huge impact because of the zebra chip disease in New Zealand. If we get that disease in this country, we will never get rid of it. It is the same with fire blight. I really wonder whether the people in biosecurity are more interested in pursuing a free trade mantra than in pursuing what their core activity should be, and that is to guarantee the clean, green reputation of Australian produce and to keep it disease-free.


Senator McKenzie made a point about buying Australian products and how we need to have truth in labelling. We need to have truth in labelling because, if we do not have truth in labelling, Australian farmers will not stand a chance. This bill really just touches on the edges of that for wine labelling. It is worth reflecting on the issue of foreign ownership of our farmland. Despite my name, I am certainly not xenophobic, but I think there is a real need for appropriately balanced and appropriately targeted foreign investment in this country, particularly in greenfields sites. Our current foreign investment laws are so vague and so imprecise in terms of a national interest test. Also, the threshold is so high—something like $244 million before the Foreign Investment Review Board will even look at something. It is not in the national interest. 


We could learn, and it pains me to say this, from the Kiwis across the Tasman. The New Zealanders have an Overseas Investment Office where there is a more clearly defined national interest test, where they look at any transaction involving more than five hectares of prime agricultural land. I am not suggesting we go down the path of five hectares—though that was initially my view—but a $5 million threshold would seem to be more realistic and in line with the consumer price movements from the 1970s when the test was just $1 million.


We need to revamp our foreign investment rules, not in a way to discourage foreign investment but to encourage transparency. It also begs a number of big questions about sovereign funds—funds owned by other governments, effectively controlled by other governments, where the threshold is zero dollars, as it should be. Our national interest test is so vague and so imprecise as to be useless.


It is worth reflecting on what was said by David Farley, the chief executive of Australian Agricultural Co., whom I think is widely respected in the industry and who knows his stuff. He gave very useful evidence at an inquiry on foreign investment, which was instigated by Senator Heffernan. An opinion piece in the Australian Financial Review in June of last year stated, 'Why should China be given the inside running on a very promising agricultural project?'—and this was talking about Northern Australia—and Mr Farley said:


Our political and business leaders are arguing that we need to pay more respect to China and put more effort into our relations with the Chinese at the expense of our neighbouring South-East Asian countries. 


I would say more respect should be paid to the expertise contained in our own agricultural industry and more effort put into making sure that Australia is equipped to play its role in the global demand for food.


I agree with what Mr Farley says and that is not to say that we should not have significant investment from China and other countries in our agricultural sector, but we need to ask some fundamental, seminal questions. One of those questions needs to be: are there enough incentives for farmers and for superannuation funds to invest in agriculture? I do not think we have the relevant taxation and superannuation investment vehicles and incentives in this country to drive that investment, to drive R&D and to drive the changes that we need to be a powerhouse for the region and for the world in food production.


Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, you are probably well aware of the article in the Adelaide Advertiser of 23 February this year by Cameron England which talked about a Qatari government owned company, Hassad Australia, that bought a $9 million cattle property near Bordertown and is understood to be negotiating with several farmers on the Eyre Peninsula to buy prime property and grazing land. The reason that Hassad Australia is doing that is the government of Qatar on behalf of the citizens of Qatar understand the potential of Australian agriculture. They get it. They understand that Australia has the potential to be the food bowl of the region, and indeed of the world. But we have a situation where our own farmers are driven out of business because we do not have the food labelling laws, the investment rules and the taxation rules to encourage investment. To me, we must redress that and this bill does not do that.


If I could just mention coal seam gas. The government have made some announcements on that and I congratulate the work that Senator Larissa Waters has done in this area, and it is an issue that Senator Joyce has raised on many occasions. There are going to be rules for coal seam gas and about the aquifer, but I worry that it might be too late for some of the developments that have been approved. Unless we give appropriate priority to our prime agricultural land, that is a real issue. I am hoping that it is not too little too late in terms of what the government announced only yesterday.


Finally, I want to comment on the Murray-Darling Basin. I note that Senator Hanson-Young, who is in the chamber, has been a very strong advocate in relation to ensuring the health of our river system. I think there is a real issue here concerning the early adopters of water-saving measures. Senator Ruston, who is from the Riverland, knows well that our producers in the Riverland had to be more water efficient much earlier because they are at the tail end of the river system. After the 1968 drought, a number of measures had to be implemented to ensure the survival of our food producers, the farmers and irrigators, in the Riverland. I do not believe there is anything in the current Murray-Darling Basin plan that gives adequate recognition to early adopters. It does not do that and that is a fatal flaw in this plan. You must of necessity, for the sake of equity and for the sake of rewarding good behaviour many years ago, give something back to those farmers whether it is encouraging research and development or whether it is providing a specialised fund for those farmers who have already done the hard yards and who can only access a tiny, tiny fraction of the $5.8 billion in water infrastructure programs. They cannot access those funds, by and large, because they are already too water sufficient to qualify. That is an anomaly and it is not just in South Australia's interests but also in the national interest to acknowledge those early adopters.


This bill does address some issues but it needs to go much further. If we are going to be serious about ensuring the viability and the strength of an industry worth over $50 billion a year to the Australian economy, with massive flow-on effects and with massive job impacts, we need to do much, much better. This parliament and this government, and future governments, must take up the challenge so that we can be the food bowl of Asia and so that we can also give our farmers a fair go.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (11:51):  I thank the senators for their contribution to this debate. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2012 will reduce red tape and make portfolio legislation clearer. This bill is an example of the government working with industry for more practical and effective regulation. It responds to industry requests for reform of regulation and streamlines administrative procedures. Some examples are amendments to the label integrity program which address concerns raised by retailers and wholesalers and amendments to the definition of 'vintage' which address concerns raised by some wine producers who harvest their grapes later than the normal harvest period. In addition, amendments to the fisheries legislation will simplify administration for business. It will also ensure that, when it is necessary for the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to issue directions to close a fishery, the requirements are clear for fishers. A further example is amendments to levies legislation which will provide an improved response time for our industry levy payers when they submit requests for the remission of late levy penalties. The portfolio continues to identify redundant legislation for removal from the statute books. The repeal of the States Grants (War Service Land Settlement) Act 1952 is a further example of the portfolio's efforts towards deregulation. Importantly, this bill provides a cost-effective opportunity to clean up portfolio legislation; the various technical amendments will improve readability, update references and remove redundant texts, resulting in clearer legislation. I commend bill to the Senate.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (12:45):  I wish to raise as a matter of public interest Senator Sinodinos's statement of private interests. As senators may recall, Senator Sinodinos entered the chamber in the dying moments of the previous sitting week to confess to omitting several company directorships from his statement of private interests, and to attempt to clarify his very murky dealings with the increasingly infamous company known as Australian Water Holdings. Not only was this a cynical attempt from Senator Sinodinos to deflect attention away from his dodgy dealings but it is not how—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator is reflecting on another senator. That is plainly in violation of the standing orders and she should be sat down.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I find no point of order at this stage.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Thank you Mr Acting Deputy President. I was not reflecting on Senator Sinodinos, but indeed reflecting on the content of his contribution to the Senate in the adjournment speech of last sitting Thursday.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator has now explained why it is she is reflecting on Senator Sinodinos. She used the phrase 'dodgy dealings'. That implies impropriety, and you should, applying the standing orders, require her to withdraw that imputation. If it were said outside this chamber it would be plainly actionable.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  What I heard was that there was no reflection on Senator Sinodinos himself but on the content of his debate.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. What I was about to say—and to remind Senator Brandis, as he full knows—is that this is not the way the Senate usually deals with personal explanations. But I will come to that in a moment.


It was, however, a remarkable confession, received with great scepticism by senators on this side of the chamber. Senators would be aware of the significance of honouring the very important obligation to maintain a complete and accurate statement of private interests. Holding office as a senator is a privilege that carries with it an obligation to behave at all times with the utmost integrity and to act in the public interest. I am sure that none of my Senate colleagues would argue with this very important statement of principle, even those on the other side of the chamber. I am sure we would all agree that a critical component of our ethical obligations is making a full and frank disclosure of our private interests so that the Australian people can have confidence that our private interests do not conflict with our official duties as senators.


It is indisputable that those who hold leadership positions ought to be held to an even higher—I stress, an even higher—standard than normal. Senator Sinodinos, for example, is the shadow parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, a position of great trust. The Australian people expect those of us who are privileged to hold such positions to lead by example, and they will rightly condemn us when we fail to conduct ourselves appropriately. Political life is littered with sad tales of those who lost office because of impropriety, maladministration or indeed misconduct.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator has now plainly reflected on Senator Sinodinos. She has accused him of impropriety and dishonesty. I take you to standing order 193, substanding order (3):


(3) A senator shall not use offensive words—


it is not possible to dispute that the words Senator Collins has used are offensive—


against … any member of such House, … and all imputations of improper motives—


the senator herself used the word 'impropriety'—


and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.


Senator Furner, I am inviting you as a neutral chairman to rule that the assertion of impropriety against the senator, which was Senator Collins's very word—



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator Brandis:
  is a plain and, indeed, flagrant breach of standing order 193.




Senator Faulkner:
  On the point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President, I was listening to Senator Collins's contribution and have just listened to the first point of order that Senator Brandis raised and to his second point of order—I was listening very carefully. Of course, Senator Brandis would be right if a senator had been accused of impropriety; that would be disorderly. But, as I heard Senator Collins comment, I would respectfully suggest that she used words to the effect—I cannot say I can recall precisely the language used, but they were effectively words to the effect—that 'political life is littered with examples of impropriety'. That is the context in which Senator Collins used the word 'impropriety' and I suggest that it is actually a statement of fact. If it were applied to a senator or, as Senator Brandis says, to any member of a house of parliament in this country, that would be disorderly. But I think that in the context it was used it was not disorderly. I tend to be a stickler for these sorts of things, so I would respectfully make that submission to you on the point of order in this case.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, you were on your feet first.




Senator Brandis:
  I will yield to Senator Macdonald for the moment, but I do want to address what Senator Faulkner had to say.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have not given you the call, Senator Macdonald. I am ruling on the point of order: I find that at this time no disorderly language was directed at Senator Sinodinos, so I call Senator Collins.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order on your ruling. Where a point of order is raised, you take debate on that to help you assess the issues. I was on my feet to do that and I was going to assist you by pointing out that, when the opposition accused Senator Conroy, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, of failing to properly do his duties in not reporting that he had stayed at a house with Mr Obeid, the President at the time said that that was not appropriate. I am suggesting to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you should follow that precedent.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a new point of order. Senator Furner, you refused to allow Senator Macdonald to continue to address you. The time limited for Senator Macdonald to address you had not expired. No senator had objected to the remarks made by Senator Macdonald, but you of your own volition, at a time when a senator was within his time period and not out of order, simply brayed at him—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, there is no time limit—




Senator Brandis:
  I have not finished, Mr Chairman.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  with regard to what you are referring to.




Senator Brandis:
  Indeed. No time limit had expired. That is what I said.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Once again, I have made a ruling on this and I intend to call Senator Collins. Sit down, Senator Brandis!




Senator Brandis:
  I have a new point of order. Senator Furner, when you ruled, as you did a moment ago, that I should sit down, I had not finished addressing the point of order that I was raising. In fact, I had not even made my point of order. You sat me down without ruling the point of order not to be a valid point of order, and therefore you prevented me from exercising my rights as a senator to make a point of order and, further, you did not discharge your obligation as the presiding officer to deliberate on the point of order. Senator Furner, I have no objection—no senator could have any objection—to the presiding officer ruling the point of order out of order, but you did not do that. First of all, you did not hear the point of order; secondly, you did not deliberate on the point of order; and, thirdly, you did not rule the point of order out of order.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am afraid you are wrong there, Senator Brandis. I did all those things.




Senator Brandis:
  On a point of order—




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  There cannot be a new point of order now, George.




Senator Brandis:
  On a new point of order, Senator Furner, I request that you state the reasons for your ruling on my earlier point of order.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have already made my reasons—



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Excuse me. I have made my reasons clear: that there were no improprieties directed to Senator Sinodinos made in the address in this speech by Senator Collins.




Senator Brandis:
  I have a new point of order.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Well, you cannot, George.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, can you make the point of order you are intending to make.




Senator Brandis:
  Yes, I will, but I ask to be heard, not interrupted before I finish my point of order.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will allow you to be heard, providing you address a new point of order.




Senator Brandis:
  The new point of order, Senator Furner, is this: when you indicated in response to my previous point of order that you had in fact given a reason, the reason you then recited did not relate to the point of order I had taken. It related to an earlier point of order on which you had already ruled. So I ask you to give the reason for your ruling on the point of order taken by me most recently before this, which you have not ruled on.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I think I have covered off in terms of the point of order I made in regard to the earlier point that was made. In terms of what you were discussing subsequent to that point—it was a matter in terms of sitting you down—I made the decision on that basis due to the fact that there was no time limit, as you were referring to in your point, and it is not a matter of time to have that point of order relate. Therefore, they were the grounds on which I sat you down.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  It seems as if Senator Brandis's ailments from question time are extending into other components of debate in this chamber, because Senator Brandis needs to listen to what I actually say rather than what he fears I might say. So I will repeat the point that, roughly, Senator Faulkner relayed quite correctly. The point I made is that political life is littered with sad tales of those who lost office because of impropriety, maladministration or misconduct. So I suggest that Senator Brandis actually listens to what is being said here rather than what he fears is occurring and not interrupt the debate for 10 minutes with spurious points of order.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The senator is reflecting on Senator Conroy for not putting in his register of interests that he stayed with Eddie Obeid.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  I do not think that is a point of order. Resume your seat, Senator Macdonald. That is not a point of order.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Macdonald raises one example, but perhaps I could give him another. Senator Bernardi, Senator Sinodinos's predecessor as shadow parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, resigned from this position after admitting that he had failed to meet the standards of conduct expected of those holding high public office.


The circumstances of the Senator Sinodinos's confession are very concerning and they leave several important questions unanswered. Senator Brandis, I am not seeking to answer those questions or, indeed, imply what the answer may be. I am raising before the Senate that there are many unanswered questions.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order relating to standing order 193 about imputations. It has been resolved many times by presiding officers that imputations may be cast both by assertion and by question.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  You cannot raise questions in the Senate now, George?




Senator Brandis:
  Just as in a court of law, an interrogative statement may contain a defamatory imputation—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! I ask all senators to come to order. Senator Brandis, continue with your point of order.




Senator Brandis:
  An interrogative statement may just as easily be a breach of standing order 193 for carrying an imputation as in a court of law an interrogative statement may be held to be defamatory if it contains a defamatory imputation. Senator Collins has now said that she considers that she is at liberty without violating standing order 193 to ask any questions she chooses.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I did not say 'any'!




Senator Brandis:
  The fact is that, although of course a senator may ask questions, it is possible, by the manner in which a question is phrased and the context in which it is asked, to be in violation of standing order 193 and, given the context that arises from what Senator Collins has already said, which you may or may not have heard, she has violated standing order 193.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am prepared to rule, but if you want to speak to it, Senator Collins, I will allow it.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  On the point of order, I just do not think that Senator Brandis can continue like this unchallenged. It is starting to get ridiculous. Not only is he hearing things that have not been said, but now he is anticipating his fears, not through any question that I have raised that makes any imputation, but that I might. This is just absolutely ridiculous. You are time wasting and you should allow us to continue with this debate.




Senator Faulkner:
  On the same point of order, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I believe on this that you should rule that all senators are obligated to conform with all the standing orders of the Senate, including of course standing order 193. I believe that whoever is presiding should be referred to by title and not by name, I would suggest, and whoever is presiding is obligated—and in this case it is you, Mr Acting Deputy President—to ensure that those standing orders are adhered to.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I am prepared to rule. I have been listening carefully to what Senator Collins is saying even though that has been difficult with some of the interjections coming across the chamber. I do not think that she out of order at this point. Senator Collins, continue.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I indicated, Senator Sinodinos's statement leaves several important questions unanswered. Senators should ask themselves whether Senator Sinodinos's last-minute confession complies with both the letter and the spirit of the requirement to fully and frankly disclose their private interests.




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. You just heard Senator Collins say, 'Senators should ask themselves whether Senator Sinodinos's last-minute confession complies with the letter or the spirit of the standing orders.' Although dressed up as a question, that is plainly an imputation and I ask you to rule accordingly that it is a reflection on a senator in flagrant breach of standing order 193(3).



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I think that is more of a debating point and I do not believe that there is a point of order.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Back to these questions: To begin with, Senator Sinodinos did not make his last minute confession of his own volition. Rather, he was dragged into it kicking and screaming—



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, this is unacceptable behaviour. Your yelling and screeching across the chamber is totally disorderly and you will desist from it.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Indeed, I was making the same point that Senator Sinodinos made in his contribution. He came forward after questioning from a journalist who had covered the holes in Senator Sinodinos's story. One wonders whether—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins, just resume your seat. Senator Brandis on a point of order.




Senator Brandis:
  On a point of order, that was not a question. That was—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  What is your point of order, Senator Brandis? I am not having you get up and simply start debating the issues before the chamber. If you have got a point of order, raise it.




Senator Brandis:
  I am raising it.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Well then raise it.




Senator Brandis:
  Okay. That was not a question; it was an assertion.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  What is your point of order, Senator Brandis?




Senator Brandis:
  The point of order is that the words 'the holes in Senator Sinodinos's statement'—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Again, I think we are getting to a debating point, Senator Brandis.




Senator Brandis:
  That being a statement to the chamber is a reflection of Senator Sinodinos under section 193.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, there is no point of order. Resume your seat.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  One wonders whether Senator Sinodinos may have ever corrected the record if the forensic research necessary to uncover these failings had not occurred. In addition, Senator Sinodinos did not make his confession in an open and transparent manner—



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis! Again you are screeching across the chamber. This is completely disorderly and I again ask you to desist.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Senator Sinodinos did not make his confession in an open and transparent manner, instead waiting until five minutes to midnight to enter the chamber at the last moment—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order. Senator Collins just said, 'Senator Sinodinos did not make his disclosure in an open and transparent manner.' That is the verbatim of what she said—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Are you making a point of order or are you debating what Senator Collins is saying?




Senator Brandis:
  That is a reflection on Senator Sinodinos, plainly in breach of standing order 193(3). To say that a senator's statement to the Senate was not made in an open and transparent manner is a reflection!




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You were just screeching that I was a liar, George!




Senator Brandis:
  I just asked a question.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Look, you have even got the grace to blush on that.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Again, I believe that the point of order you are raising is a debating point, Senator Brandis. Are you raising another point of order, Senator Fifield?




Senator Fifield:
  On the same point.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I have already ruled on that point of order, Senator Fifield.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I was making the point that Senator Sinodinos's disclosure was presented in the last sitting week, at the very last moment likely to attract the least possible attention before the chamber and offered no opportunity for any other senators to respond. Senator Sinodinos's decision to execute this mea culpa in this regrettable fashion robbed the Senate of the opportunity to promptly address his behaviour, because the Senate did not sit again, as we all know, until approximately a week and a half later. I have heard it remarked that this was a cynical and manipulative measure, but I will leave that to the commentariat to reflect on.




Senator Brandis:
  You are a grub!



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Brandis!




Senator Brandis:
  Withdrawn.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Importantly, I ask the Senate to consider whether Senator Sinodinos's explanation for his failure to declare his interests is plausible. Senator Sinodinos essentially said that he had forgotten several company directorships and insinuated that this failure was due to an ignorance of the rules for declaring private interests. I seriously question whether Senator Sinodinos's assertions pass the person-in-the-street test or indeed any test that any senator in this place might seek to apply. Senator Sinodinos is a seasoned corporate operator and a career capitalist, with executive experience with some of the world's largest corporations, including the National Australia Bank, Goldman Sachs and JBWere. I question whether it is plausible that an experienced corporate executive would simply forget several company directorships. I also question Senator Sinodinos's feigned ignorance of the rules relating to the declaration of private interests. Senator Sinodinos should be well versed—




Senator Fifield:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order in relation to standing order 193, 'Rules of debate', at item (3), which says:


A senator shall not use offensive words …


Fair enough; she is not being offensive, but it goes on to speak against 'all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections'. Accusing a senator of 'feigning' something is the same as saying that a senator is lying. You cannot construe it in any other way. In relation to what was a very serious, sober and thoughtful contribution by Senator Sinodinos, saying that Senator Sinodinos was feigning something is a reflection on him.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I think I have heard your point. Senator Collins, using the word 'feigning' may be something you might want to reconsider and potentially withdraw at this point.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I will withdraw the words 'feigned ignorance', but I will continue to ask senators to make their own conclusions on the quality of the contribution, because Senator Sinodinos should be well versed in the private interest obligations that apply to all senators. It is well known that Senator Sinodinos was a longstanding chief of staff to former Prime Minister John Howard. In this role, Senator Sinodinos was responsible for disciplining coalition MPs and senators for failure to comply with private interest rules and other scandals that may have occurred. What is more, Senator Sinodinos ascended to the office of chief of staff after his predecessor, Grahame Morris, was forced to resign in disgrace after it emerged that he had covered up failures by Howard government ministers to meet their private interest obligations under the Standards of Ministerial Ethics. Senators might recall that so many ministers—




Senator Fifield:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I seek your guidance and assistance in this matter: the reference to Mr Morris resigning 'in disgrace'. I know that there are clear standing orders in relation to reflections on senators, but I just seek your guidance on reflections on those who do not have the opportunity to defend themselves in this place.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I cannot see a point of order at this stage, Senator Fifield.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I was indicating just now that senators might recall that so many ministers fell foul of the Howard government's ministerial code that Mr Howard was forced to further water down his already weak standards for fear that he might otherwise be left with no cabinet. That is how many casualties there were during that time.


I remind the Senate of the sorry tale of former Senator Santo Santoro, who resigned as a minister and left the Senate under a cloud of deep suspicion after his gross failure to properly declare scores of share trades was revealed. This is a scandal that has haunted Mr Santoro to this very day, and I would not be surprised if it remains burned in the memory of Senator Sinodinos. It has been reported that Senator Sinodinos, as John Howard's chief of staff, was intimately involved in responding to the ethical crisis that Mr Santoro's regrettable behaviour sparked within the coalition. In these circumstances, I question whether anybody could sincerely expect the Senate to believe that Senator Sinodinos is ignorant of private interest rules. Further to this let us consider the detail of the multitude of company directorships that mysteriously slipped Senator Sinodinos's mind. These are not just a couple of not-for-profit directorships as suggested by Mr Abbott. That simply does not stand scrutiny. First we have Senator Sinodinos's directorship of Move to Live Pty Ltd, which the senator described as a healthcare company. I believe there are unanswered questions about Senator Sinodinos's involvement in this company. These are serious questions indeed and they relate to the much-maligned Santo Santoro.


What Senator Sinodinos did not volunteer to the Senate during his late-night mea culpa was that Santo Santoro was deeply, intimately involved in Move to Live. Senators may be interested to learn that the now-infamous Mr Santoro,who, as I previously mentioned, was forced to terminate his own political career as a result of drastic failings of judgement, was also a director of this company. Senators opposite complained, but indeed I am not even quoting the former Prime Minister John Howard on this matter, which would certainly add some more meat to these bones. But, I return to Senator Sinodinos. It turns out that Senator Sinodinos and Santo Santoro sat around the Move to Live board table. Why did Senator Sinodinos fail to mention Santo Santoro's involvement in this company? Given Santo Santoro's own history with private interest matters, are we to believe that Senator Sinodinos thought Mr Santoro's involvement was not a legitimate matter of public interest? Was Senator Sinodinos concerned that revelation of his involvement with Mr Santoro would raise damaging questions about his own political judgement? Was Senator Sinodinos trying to hide something? Is Senator Sinodinos hiding any other aspect of his involvement with Move to Live or the operations of the company?


There are serious questions that must be answered about Senator Sinodinos's corporate links to this disgraced former politician. As Senator Brandis is fully aware, this is not the first time that Senator Sinodinos has been caught out exercising poor judgement and establishing murky associations. The committee of privileges—




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. This was not a question. Senator Collins, in breach of standing order 193(3), reflected upon Senator Sinodinos by saying this was not the first time he had been caught out, implying wrongdoing in relation to murky associations. The assertion 'caught out' implies a person has been exposed in wrongdoing. That is plainly a reflection on the senator.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  On the point of order, I did not say that he had been caught out and exposed of wrongdoing but rather of poor political judgement.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you. I think, Senator Brandis, you have raised a debating point and I do not see a point of order that this point. Senator Collins.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I was about to remind Senator Brandis of the work of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges into how Senator Sinodinos was heavily implicated in the Godwin Grech affair.



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, I would ask you again to stop screeching across the chamber. I do not really care what you are pointing out, Senator Brandis; it is disorderly to yell across the chamber, and again I ask you to desist. Senator Collins.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  During that time of the Godwin Grech affair, Senator Sinodinos was in a private sector job with the National Australia Bank, emailing as the Regional General Manager Government Business Performance and GoNASB Professional Development, according to the documents that were tabled in the Senate with the report. One questions why Senator Sinodinos—Mr Sinodinos at the time—was conspiring with a senior public servant who was leaking false information to the press. We know that is what Godwin Grech was doing. Was this core business for the National Australia Bank? Senator Sinodinos was also implicated in Mr Grech's making special effort for a strong financial donor to the Liberal Party and he also knew of Mr Grech's lies to the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. These are all matters that have been tabled before the Senate. Senator Sinodinos has, it seems, a long history of blurring the lines, exercising poor judgement and acting in his and the Liberal Party's own interest, yet this is the man Tony Abbott trusts for advice. 


My next set of questions relates to the intricate web of Liberal Party entities to which Senator Sinodinos has belatedly declared his directorship. As the former president of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party, what role did Senator Sinodinos play in the establishment of these entities? Why is it necessary for the Liberal Party to operate such an impenetrably treat complex corporate structure? What tax benefits does the Liberal Party derive from this structure? Can Senator Sinodinos guarantee that the Liberal Party has not utilised this tricky corporate arrangement to evade its tax obligations or its workers compensation, insurance, superannuation or other obligations? 


Senator Sinodinos was appointed to a casual vacancy in late 2011. Shortly thereafter, he submitted a statement of private interests that omitted directorships of several companies: Move to Live, Firestick ICT, Bunori, Liberal Asset Management (Custodians), and Liberal Properties Ltd.He had failed to declare directorships— (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2013-03-13,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (15:01):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to proposed media legislation.


I am very fond of Senator Conroy, and so is the Daily Telegraph. I am stuck with the Media Monitors version. I tried to get an original copy of the Daily Telegraph but they have sold out at Aussie's. I am told they are sold out in the CBD in Sydney. I even rang my office in Brisbane, and they have sold out up there. They have become collectors' items already. I understand there are several hundred copies in Senator Conroy's office. So he appreciates it. I have no doubt that Senator Conroy is outraged at being compared to various despots on the front page of the Daily Telegraph: Stalin, Mao, Castro, Ahmadinejad, Mugabe and Kim. Because of the pixelation, I am not sure if 'Kim' is Kim Carr or Kim Jong-un.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Mason, refer to senators by their correct title.




Senator MASON:
  I believe it is Senator Carr, but Senator Bernardi tells me it is Kim Jong-un. It could be an early picture of Senator Kim Carr without a beard. The point is very obvious. It does not really matter; unreconstructed Marxists could never be compared to Senator Conroy, could they? He would hate that. 


This is not a laughing matter. This is a very serious matter. What Senator Conroy is proposing effectively is a media tsar: the 'public interest media advocate', George Orwell at his very best—an Orwellian titular head, something that circumscribes the media in this country. The proposed legislation will establish a statutory authority to rule on the way the Australian Press Council and similar bodies adjudicate complaints against the press. It will have the power to approve or reject the standards enforced by those bodies. 


What do we have? We have this: ultimately a statutory authority appointed by the executive will tell the Press Council whether they have done a good job. This in fact is government by another name. This is the executive ultimately telling the press how to behave, not a court. There is no separation of powers argument here. This is the executive telling the press how to act. That signifies, all senators would understand, a huge power shift from the media, from the press, to the executive government. That, in a sentence, is what is occurring. In effect what we have—and I think Senator Birmingham pointed this out in his question—is a government seeking to license newspapers and other media. I think Senator Birmingham mentioned that Governor Darling was the last person to do that. I am told in Britain it has not happened since the 17th century, the century in which they used to lop off the heads of kings. I am not sure if Senator Conroy is more like Charles I or Oliver Cromwell. Nonetheless he has not done very well. 


Can I just say this: it is actually getting worse, because the protections under the Privacy Act seek to protect the press, but they will go in many instances in this case. What will happen is that the confidentiality requirements will be obliterated and potentially the press will have to give up their sources. They may be forced to disclose confidential information and details about articles before they are even published. 



The concern of the opposition is simple: this is a huge power grab by the government against the press. There is no demonstrated case for this. The current regulatory arrangements do work and have worked very well. I know that Senator Conroy consistently said this is about media diversity, greater and greater diversity. Of course he did not talk about the internet and blogs and tweets that offer all that enormous diversity. As Mr Turnbull has said repeatedly over the last few days, the media in this country has never been more diverse in its entire history, since the founding of this nation—nor has the government, of course, been more unpopular.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2013-03-13,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (15:06):  I rise also to take note of answers provided in today's proceedings. I want to start off by indicating that I have had some involvement in working for the press for approximately six years—certainly not in the role of a journalist but over time through my involvement following that period of employment and moving into my position as a trade union official and having some exposure to them there. My interest in and my exposure to the press has developed over those years.


In terms of the companies I worked for in the eighties—Queensland Newspapers and, later on in the eighties, News Limited—we saw significant changes over that period. We saw changes from the production of a broadsheet newspaper to the production of a tabloid. Of course, we have seen changes as a result of a move to electronic media, social media and reaction that we see in today's hands. There is always a chance, an opportunity and a need to look at change and to scrutinise. There is a need to look at changes to media reforms in the bills that we will see come through this chamber shortly.


It is not about reframing or winding back on free speech. It is not about allowing people to have diversity of voices when it comes round to media outlets and organisations. You hear contributions by those opposite when they defend News Limited, because we know as a fact and I know most certainly that, when the opposition brought in their Work Choices legislation and introduced Australian workplace agreements, News Limited was one of the first organisations that took up the opportunity to put their employees on Australian workplace agreements. I wonder whether that is why the coalition are so defensive of News Limited, when it was the champion of one of their particular pieces of Work Choices legislation: Australian workplace agreements. I personally believe that might be a reason.


Over those years I had exposure to the press. Most recently a good friend of mine who works for Channel 9, a freelance journalist on the Gold Coast, Petrina Zaphir, explained to me about these particular changes. She explained to me her involvement in the media. She also spoke about her opportunities, including where she goes out with media cadets or journalist cadets and talks to them about the ethics. I do not think anyone should be frightened about discussing ethics when it comes to reporting news. I think it is important that we live in a society where we need to be free to hear what is ethically reported in the media. At times, I know that those opposite question the ethics of some of the media outlets on what they are reporting, and we do as well. But we should not be worried about this particular reform that we are looking at. We should not be concerned about where this is heading, because it is an example of where we are going to lead, in looking at some of the publications and news organisations that certainly conduct themselves professionally. We do, and they respect privacy and reporting with fairness and accuracy as well. We know that is the case out there and that no-one should be frightened of scrutiny and ethics, particularly in the media.


I just want to put on record the government's record when it comes to freedom of speech, because I think we were challenged today during question time on that. We should be reminded that the government have implemented the most important amendments to the Commonwealth shield laws for the protection of journalists' sources. Labor's decision to introduce journalist shield laws was, in part, motivated by the Howard government's disgraceful conduct towards News Limited journalists Harvey and McManus, who faced contempt of court. Our record stands when it comes to protections for and scrutiny of journalists in particular. Certainly, the protections for those particular journalists who were targeted by the Howard government demonstrate our commitment to the need for protection for journalists, rather than being a case of watering down examples of shield laws, protection for whistleblowers in the media, in times of need.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (15:12):  As Senator Furner has just, once again, alluded to, following in the footsteps of Senator Cameron previously and Mr Murphy in the other place, these reforms are about vengeance, not vision. These reforms are coming from a government that does not like what the print media and other media outlets have said about it and reported about it and, as a result, it is out to get them. That is the simple fact here: these reforms are about vengeance.


Senator Conroy is proposing to establish the Orwellian titled Public Interest Media Advocate. This will not be an advocate for the public interest; it will be an advocate for the government's interest. That is what Senator Conroy is hoping he gets here. He claimed in answer to questions today that this new statutory body that he proposes to establish would not be a regulator. Yet what he is proposing this advocate will do is to actually accredit media complaints processes, as well as to assess proposals for media acquisitions and mergers against a vaguely defined public interest test. If that is not a new regulator, I do not know what is. It is going to regulate the process of media acquisitions and mergers. It is going to regulate and oversee the processes of media complaints processes. It is very clearly a new regulator. It is a new regulator who will be appointed by the government of the day, could be removed by the government of the day, could be a mate of the government of the day—




Senator Ryan:
  They wouldn't appoint a mate!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Senator Ryan, I am amazed at your shock, but this government has form.




Senator Thorp:
  He's feigning it!




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I suspect you could be right just this once, Senator Thorp. Senator Conroy and the Prime Minister claimed that the opposition will be consulted about the appointment. We have no detail to these reforms, but there has been absolutely no commitment on whether such consultation will be mandated, whether it will be a requirement that the opposition actually agree to the appointment or how such processes will work. In the end, there is every chance this will be a dog of the government and the government will tell it how and when to bark.


Equally, Senator Conroy claims that these reforms are about protecting a diversity of voices. Do not take my word for the fact that we have greater diversity than ever before. Do not take Mr Turnbull's word for it. How about we take the managing director of the ABC, Mr Mark Scott, who said, way back in 2010 when these reform processes were started:


Now there are multiple players. Anyone with a mobile phone, laptop or camcorder can be a broadcaster.


That is right, Mr Deputy President: anyone can be, just as anyone with a keyboard and an internet connection can be a publisher and just as we have, of course, millions of people worldwide through Twitter and other fora who are ensuring their voices are heard. The opportunity and the capacity for people to have their voices heard, and for them to be critics of the media, are greater than ever before—they have greater opportunities than ever before.


Senator Conroy says we should look to what the rest of the world is doing, and in doing so I note he says that he will proudly frame the front page of today's Daily Telegraph, which does indeed highlight what some other parts of the world have sadly done with press freedoms. Rather than looking to what the rest of the world is doing when it comes to media freedom, I would prefer we lead the rest of the world when it comes to media freedom. As I believe the Convergence Review was initially intended to do—before it was sidetracked by the claims around the hate media and by the Finkelstein review that was just bolted on at short notice to the whole Convergence Review process to address the gripes of the Greens and some in the Labor caucus about what they saw as unfair treatment—I believe that we should recognise that we live in a world with more voices than ever before and more opportunity than ever before. Far from needing more regulation and control over the media, this is an era in which we should be seeing less regulation and greater freedom for expression and greater freedom of the media. Indeed, as Senator Bob Carr even told this Senate recently—in terms of what is needed in Fiji—we should be having robust freedom of expression, association and the media. (Time expired)

"Thorp, Sen Lin",ALP,2013-03-13,"



Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (15:17):  In rising here today I must express a certain amount of—the perfect word is not coming to me, but it seems to me there is a mismatch in the arguments coming from the other side when it comes to the issue of freedom of speech, because it is those opposite who were responsible for the legislation that required not-for-profit organisations to have gag clauses in their contracts. These organisations are groups that look after issues such as welfare, job seekers or people who are involved in juvenile justice or in sexual assault. They are community groups, environmental groups, child protection groups—the list goes on. All of these front-line people know very well the reality of what is happening out in the real world and have an opportunity to give feedback to any government of the day about the reality of their work, yet it was those opposite whose government made sure that those people would not get funded for the important community work that they do, unless they signed a gag clause in their contracts. To come out from a position like that and then turn around and say that the legislation that we are talking about here is a restriction on freedom of speech is to completely misrepresent what is going on and in fact, I would have to say, is disingenuous.


In doing so, those opposite have proven once again that they care more about the interests of media moguls than the public good. They do not care about diversity or quality journalism and they clearly do not care about freedom of speech. What they really care about is protecting their big business buddies against any moves to secure diversity in the public arena. When we have an environment where two newspaper companies hold 86 per cent market share, it is entirely appropriate for an independent regulator to make judgements upon further consolidation of media companies. We know that the smaller the number of newspapers and other media owners, the less opportunity the Australian people have to hear a range of points of view. As a result, clearly, they are less able to form an opinion based on fact, which has a terrible impact on their ability to make effective decisions on issues that affect them.


This bill will help to ensure that we do not lose this vital diversity from our community—factors like audience reach. As opposed to what the honourable senator opposite said about everyone today being a writer, that is one thing, but not everybody is part of that audience that is getting its information from these two sources that I just mentioned—86 per cent of audience reach. We have to talk about the frequency and depth of services and the cumulative impact. They all have to be taken into account before we accept any moves that will reduce the diversity of media in this country. What the proposed bill will do is to ensure that smaller voices do not get drowned out and that a multiplicity of voices are communicated through our media. 


I want to be clear here: this is not an attack on freedom of speech, despite the way some have attempted to portray it. Freedom of the press and freedom of expression are a cornerstone of our democracy and something that this government supports passionately. This government is not directly regulating in any way the activities of journalists, and the bill will in no way take away from individual journalists the benefit of shield laws, as my colleague said earlier. It simply is not true and all the reframing in the world from those opposite will not make it true. Similarly, the bill will make absolutely no changes to the standards that are applied to journalists. It is not about making new standards; it is about making sure the standards that we currently have are adhered to. There have long been concerns about how self-regulation is working through the Press Council, and this bill is an important part of addressing some of those weaknesses.


You only have to look at the News of the World debacle that happened last year to realise the mistakes that can be made with self-regulation. Those opposite also conveniently omitted the fact that they themselves would be involved in the public interest media advocate appointments. 




Senator Fifield:
  We don't want them!




Senator THORP:
  Well, to participate in democracy is a privilege and a right. This bill is an important step forward for the diversity of voices in our public sphere and for the quality of journalism. Frankly, all the baying and howling that we have seen today from those opposite is just a desperate attempt to protect those with the most to lose.

"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2013-03-13,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (15:22):  If we on this side are going to be accused of baying and howling in defence of freedom of speech, I plead guilty. For the modern-day Labor Party to come in here and say this side of parliament is trying to take care of media moguls, given their own history, shows the bankruptcy of their knowledge of their behaviour when they were last in office. Everyone here remembers what the Labor Party did to the Herald and Weekly Times, Australia's largest and oldest media group, and it was referred to on Melbourne radio this morning. Because the Melbourne Herald held Labor to account in 1984 and because it attacked Labor for introducing a pension assets and means test which Labor had promised not to introduce, Paul Keating went out and made sure Labor fixed the Herald and Weekly Times. He changed the law to create the so-called princes of print or queens of the screen, all as a means to go after the then independent Herald and Weekly Times, which was the owner of most of the popular mastheads in Australia. That has been preached about by Labor Party luminaries. That is not a secret, so the Labor Party's behaviour about appeasing moguls and trying to buy favours is well established. And Australia, as many people have said for a long time, is at a loss for the loss of the Herald and Weekly Times. Everyone who worked there will tell you what it was about: it was about Labor going after the independent Herald and Weekly Times because they dared oppose the Hawke government and were holding it to account for breaching a promise.


Senator Conroy's hypocrisy here is equal in doses to what we have had from every other Labor speaker. This is something Senator Conroy said in 2006 and it was tweeted today:


Helen Coonan's announcements today represent an arrogant Government that's ramming through the Parliament the most significant changes in 20 years, and they are only going to allow one month of consultations for the public, despite them spending 12 months having private consultations with all the media moguls.




Senator Birmingham:
  A whole month!




Senator RYAN:
  An entire month for the public to consider it, let alone the parliament to consider it, when Senator Conroy is announcing to the people of Australia: 'We're going to regulate the media, we're going to set up an effective licensing regime for journalists and we are going to give you eight days to think about it.' If you actually raise any questions, if you dare to express a concern about the regulation of journalistic behaviour, then the government will not listen to it because Senator Conroy, wise as he is, has made his decision. This is a vehicle for regulation.


The Labor Party will obfuscate and try and muddy the waters by asserting in Orwellian tones: 'This is not regulation. We're not licensing journalists.' Yet when every significant media player in this country, whether it is Business Spectator, the Fairfax press, the ABC or News Ltd, is saying what a chilling effect this will have on the independence of the free press we know what the real impact is. This government, to its credit, has never, with its Greens cousins and allies, hidden its agenda. You dare criticise them and they will come after you, except if you happen to go skiing at Aspen, or wherever Senator Conroy went skiing and halved the licence fee. Apparently that is not doing a deal with a media mogul, but imagine if it happened elsewhere. I should say, before he corrects the record, it was snowboarding and not skiing.


This is a threat, because what we have is a threat by the government to use the power it has to pass laws to provide extra regulations for journalists and press organisations if they do not comply with what the government deems to be an appropriate regulatory mechanism. That is the gun to the head of an independent media. The other side rightly quotes the shield laws. We rightly have long had special rules and principles for a free media. They are not called the fourth estate for nothing, because even though we will all be criticised by them they play the most valuable role in a free democracy. Freedom of speech, along with freedom of property and freedom of religion—two other rights under threat by this government—is the very basis of a liberal democracy. Freedom of the ballot came along after we had freedom of speech and people could demand it. But that is not good enough for this government. That is not good enough for Senator Conroy, who seeks to regulate the behaviour of journalists, because they have been critical of a government that deserves it.


I could not go past this debate without a couple of Orwellian quotes. In Animal Farm there is a famous character called Comrade Napoleon. If it were parliamentary I would refer to him as Senator Napoleon, but that would not be parliamentary. Comrade Napoleon says all animals are equal. He goes on:


He would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. But sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be? 


We would be in a free and liberal society which is under threat from Senator Conroy's vindictive measures.

The PRESIDENT
 (15:32):  It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 10 March 2013 of Brian Roper Archer, a senator from Tasmania for the period 1975 to 1994.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (15:33):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 10 March 2013, of Brian Roper Archer, former senator for Tasmania, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


Brian was born on 21 August 1929 at Calder, Tasmania. Before entering parliament, Brian was a real estate consultant and a farmer. He was elected to the Senate in July 1975 and served until his resignation in January 1994, when his replacement was Senator Abetz. Brian Archer was an active and engaged member of numerous committees throughout his near 20-year service to the Senate, chairing several of these committees. Brian was also a parliamentary representative to many conferences, delegations and visits. For a period in the mid-1980s, Brian also served as the shadow special minister of state and spokesman on science in Mr Howard's shadow ministries.


Before he was elected to the Senate, Brian had a background as a real estate consultant and a cattle breeder, well known for developing the limousin breed of cattle on his farm in Northern Tasmania. Brian's knowledge of farming, cattle breeding and fishing informed his work in the Senate. Always the advocate for Tasmania and all things Tasmanian, Brian's ongoing support of the resources and primary industries sectors of Tasmania remained central to his work in the Senate. I am sure that Brian was immensely proud of the development in recent years of Tasmania's reputation for fine foods and especially for the development of the dairy, farmed fish, wine and fresh fruit and vegetable industries. 


Brian was known as a quiet achiever for his productive work as a senator. He was also respected and admired by his colleagues for the support he gave to them. Brian regarded the Senate as the more civilised of the two chambers of this parliament, and I am sure that is a view shared by all present. His attitude was that senators represented their respective states. On several occasions, he crossed the floor to vote with the ALP on issues, yet he was also a strong supporter of the role of the Senate in scrutinising policy legislation, and his considerable contribution to committee work was widely recognised by all on his retirement. On behalf of the government, I offer condolences to his family.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:35):  Tasmanians lost a fine man with the passing of Brian Roper Archer on 10 March. On behalf of the coalition, I salute his service to the nation. On the behalf of my Tasmanian Liberal Senate team colleagues, Senators Colbeck, Parry and Bushby, I salute the service of Brian Archer to his state of Tasmania and to his beloved north-west coast. I believe it is a wonderful gesture that you now, Mr Deputy President, are in the chair, as a person who came from the same area of Tasmania as former Senator Archer. I also note that you will be representing the Tasmanian Senate Liberal team, and more importantly the President, at Brian Archer's funeral service tomorrow. Brian Archer was a passionate Tasmanian, noting in his first speech he was a Tasmanian by birth, by inclination and by conviction. And of course, on top of all that he was a north-west coaster. He epitomised the north-west coast; not only was he born there, lived there, raised a family there, established a highly reputable real estate firm and a farm, he also believed in those north-west values of hard work and reward for effort. He loved the productive sectors of our economy. His first speech to this place some 37 years ago covered apples, small fruits, potatoes, dairying, beef, sheep, goats and horses, vegetables, mining, fishing and forestry. There was one oversight—and that was a hobby that my father and I engaged in for some years—namely, beekeeping. But, he did make up for that in his later parliamentary activities with a press release in 1989 discussing the issues faced by beekeepers.


Brian Archer served as a senator for three full terms or 18 years. His committee work covers a full half page of his biographical details provided by the parliamentary library. He was hardworking. He was a great help to new senators, something former Senator Kay Patterson noted in the valedictories to Senator Archer—which, might I add, he did not want. He was a man of principle and, to correct Senator Conroy, he did not cross the floor several times; he crossed the floor 14 times. He was a shadow minister in the areas of science and special minister of state. Despite that distinguished record his entry into politics was in a way accidental. Do not get me wrong; he was a committed Liberal, committed to the philosophy of private enterprise and reward for effort, but he was sufficiently involved in the Liberal party to be approached with a task of searching out a suitable senate candidate. In the end, he had to draft himself. He was swept into the Senate in 1975 double dissolution election at which the Whitlam experiment was judged as a dismal failure by the people of Australia and especially the people of Tasmania, whose verdict was to return every House of Representatives seat to the Liberals—how I look forward to that occurring again sometime!—and, of course, a new Senator Archer.


So began his 18 years of advocacy for the productive sectors of our economy. His legacy of support for the productive sector should not be lost on us today, and we should remember the importance of that sector in sustaining our economy and our lifestyle. His manner was always mild and professional and self-effacing. I understand he might have a record that he was never requested to withdraw a comment in the Senate. The most aggressive statement in the media attributed to Senator Archer that I could find was when he described Gorbachev as 'ruthless' in 1991. The house magazine in its edition of 23 February 1994, commenting on Brian Archer's retirement, said after referring to his extensive and distinguished parliamentary career, 'Brian Archer is free to revive his interests in breeding and judging budgies, daffodils, poppies, cows and sheep'—clearly a man of great variety of interests. On retiring, Senator Archer—and this is a great self-summary of the man—in his media statement simply said, 'I look forward to being just Brian Archer again, being home much more and spending time with my children and grandchildren.' I am delighted that he was given about 15 years for exactly that, noting that in recent times he was afflicted with serious ill-health, necessitating his move to a nursing home. It is a honour on behalf of the coalition and especially the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team to pay this tribute to such a wonderful Tasmanian. I am also sure that former senators Calvert, Watson, Walters, Newman and Townley would also wish to be associated with these remarks. On behalf of the coalition I extend our sincere condolences to Brian Archer's widow, Dorothy, their children and grandchildren.

That these bills be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech of the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Amendment Bill 2013 incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Amendment Bill 2013 amends the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 to bring the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) within the scope of the act.


The effect of the bill will be to provide a legislative basis for the subsequent enactment of Regulations conferring certain privileges and immunities on the ICRC and ICC.


In relation to the ICRC, the bill introduces a new section 9D into the act, which provides a basis for the conferral of privileges and immunities on the ICRC in accordance with the 2005 'Arrangement between Australia and the ICRC on a Regional Headquarters in Australia'.  This Memorandum of Understanding confers legal personality on the ICRC in Australia and other privileges and immunities needed to facilitate its work in Australia and the Pacific Region.  The ICRC is Australia's largest partner organisation in humanitarian action. The amendments will allow the Government to implement this Memorandum of Understanding.


In the case of the ICC, the bill introduces a new section 9C which provides a basis for the conferral of privileges and immunities on the ICC in accordance with the 'Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court'.  This will enable steps to be taken towards Australia's accession to the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court.  This will be a further expression of Australia's strong support for the International Criminal Court.


The bill also makes consequential amendments to sections 3 and 7 of the act, regarding international conferences, to ensure that section 7 can also be used in future in relation to the ICRC and ICC, as with international organisations to which the act applies. There is no automaticity to this provision and it would require a future determination by the Governor-General plus the enactment of further regulations.


In conclusion, the bill will amend the act to allow the enactment of regulations conferring privileges and immunities on the ICRC and ICC. This will enable implementation of the Government's commitments in its Memorandum of Understanding with the ICRC and will enable steps to be taken towards Australia's accession to the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  I seek leave to have the second reading speech of the Not-for-profit Sector Freedom to Advocate Bill 2013 incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted. 




The speech read as follows—



The proposed Not-for-profit Sector Freedom to Advocate Bill 2013 will promote ongoing positive engagement, together with open communication and debate, between the Federal Government and the not-for-profit sector. The bill, if enacted, would prohibit and invalidate clauses in Commonwealth agreements that seek to limit or restrict not‑for-profit entities from advocating on Commonwealth policy issues. 


An unfettered not‑for-profit sector is essential to building a democratic and inclusive community. Other governments have mandated 'gag clauses' in agreements with the not‑for‑profit sector, preventing them from advocating on government policy. This bill, if enacted, will prevent this from occurring at the Commonwealth level. 


The Commonwealth Government recognises that a strong, independent and innovative not-for-profit sector is essential to building an inclusive community. The not‑for‑profit sector is made up of around 600,000 organisations and accounts for approximately eight per cent of employment nationally. Providing Commonwealth funding to not-for-profit entities or entering into other agreements should not prohibit the sector from engaging in policy and debate.


The bill, if enacted, will apply to all Commonwealth agreements with the not‑for‑profit sector, regardless of whether they were entered into prior to the commencement of the legislation. The Not-for-profit Sector Freedom to Advocate Bill 2013 specifically addresses circumstances where, despite current Commonwealth Government policy to the contrary, there may still be 'gag clauses' in existing Commonwealth agreements with the not‑for-profit sector. The bill, if enacted, will invalidate any such clauses in existing agreements. This will ensure that not-for-profit entities are not disadvantaged due to clauses in existing Commonwealth agreements that should not have been included. The bill, if enacted, will also prevent any clauses in future Commonwealth agreements that purport to 'gag' the not-for-profit sector. 


The proposed bill operates retrospectively, and includes a clause relating to compensation. This is intended to cover the highly unlikely circumstance where a party suffers loss because a 'gag clause' in a pre‑existing agreement is invalidated by the legislation. In that rare situation, the Commonwealth will pay 'reasonable compensation' to that person. 


This bill should be supported as it protects the rights of the not-for-profit entity to engage in debate and advocate on Commonwealth policy. It recognises and supports the critical role that the not-for-profit sector has in developing public policy and advocating on behalf of the community. 


Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2013-03-13,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (16:18): I thank the for Senate the opportunity to make a contribution with my Greens New South Wales colleague, Senator Lee Rhiannon on the matter that the Deputy President has just read into the record. Senator Rhiannon is going to address it at greater length, but I will acknowledge the coalition of eight groups that has today launched an exceptionally important and timely report into the state of Australian cities and in particular what the design of our cities is doing to our population, our kids, our time, our jobs and where we can live. This new study was commissioned, conducted and supported by eight groups ranging from the Planning Institute, the Heart Foundation, public transport advocates and the property sector to take a long, hard look at what has happened in Australian cities in the last 50 or 60 years—effectively in the postwar era—where we have allowed the domination and priorities of the private car to take priority over people and over the livableness of our great cities.


This report estimates that traffic congestion now costs the economy $9 billion per year. It is not the first time I have seen figures like that as to the economic cost of traffic congestion, but let us pull apart how these estimates are made. That figure is made up, in part, of your unpaid time sitting in traffic jams between where you live and where you work and the loss of that productive time to you which you could have been spending in leisure pursuits, with family, studying or at work earning an income. The staggering figure of the of $9 billion per year cost of congestion is derived in part from this gigantic loss of amenity and loss of time for each of us who find ourselves condemned to traffic congestion. 


I note this study is not anticar, and there is no purpose to being anticar. There is no imperative here to ban the use of private cars, but we actually need to knock it off its pedestal and provide transport choice to people. What we have done in the planning of our great cities is eliminate choice. If you live in the middle ring or outer suburbs in an Australian city, particularly if you have kids, you need one private car per working adult whether you are a greenie or not, whether or not you care about atmospheric pollution, the cost of petrol, lost time, the frustration of sitting in traffic jams, the elimination of urban bushland for road projects or the unsustainable sprawl of our cities. Whether or not you pay regard to those things and whether or not those are your priorities you have no choice. It is very difficult as a working adult to live in an Australian city without a private vehicle unless, like me, you are lucky enough to live close to a major railway line and have access to cycling infrastructure. That infrastructure costs money and it requires investment. It requires planning and requires a change in the way that we think about our cities 


The way that we have planned transport has also had a dramatic impact on housing affordability. It has become something of a cruel joke that the concept of housing affordability in Australia now means a brick-and-tile air-conditioned box, way over the horizon—20, 30 or 40 kilometres from where a person works. Maybe that is where the cheap land is, where we build over urban bushland or plough under market gardens or peri-urban agricultural land, losing forever the valuable soils and biodiversity. Maybe it is affordable to get into those areas, but it is certainly not very affordable to live there. What you never see in the glossy real estate ads is the cost of maintaining a private car per working adult because you have been stranded on the fringes of a city. The $9 billion a year in congestion costs do not accommodate those costs. They are absorbed by private individuals, as is the lost time sitting in the car trying to get to work, trying to get the kids to and from child care or trying to get out of the city. So transport affects housing affordability, it affects amenity and it affects many, many other things. We have never really acknowledged in the Australian context the true cost of building ever-larger houses, with ever-shrinking numbers of people living in them, further and further away from centres of amenity, jobs, services and public transport. We have to reverse this tide. Today's report is one important step towards doing that.


Australian cities are some of the most car-dependent in the world, and the greater Perth metropolitan area now stretches nearly 120 kilometres from end to end. To my mind a coalition government in Western Australia has never laid a single kilometre of railway line. They talk about it, and every now and again they close a railway line, but they have never taken the time or the investment to open one. But, with the support of the Greens, Perth does have a good public transport network, but it simply has not kept pace with the growth of the city, and now many residents of Perth have been stranded.


These challenges are very, very difficult to confront and cities move slowly; there is no quick fix. Planning decisions made in haste can be regretted for many years and decades afterwards. One of the ways in which the Greens have chosen to make an impact is to co-author, with the Property Council of Australia and the Australian Urban Design Research Centre, AUDRC, a report called Transforming Perth, which I was proud to launch with those two organisations and Senator Milne when she was in Perth with us last week. The report is effectively a study that builds on the work of Victorian urban planner Professor Rob Adams, who is the Director of City Design at the City of Melbourne. It asks: what if, instead of simply letting the sprawl go and maintaining an effectively unregulated or even over-regulated low-density sprawl in Perth, we developed medium-density corridors along public transport corridors—areas where high-capacity public transport can take some of the road space and give people that transport choice that they need? When you combine that with networked cycling infrastructure and a reorientation of the bus network, you can do extraordinary things. The Transforming Perth study identified more than 1,500 hectares of land along seven high-capacity transit corridors in Perth and showed that if you built medium density dwellings—not high rise; not Hong Kong-looking towers along these corridors—of four or five storeys, you could potentially fit between 94,000 and 250,000 dwellings along these corridors. This would effectively overbuild areas of urban blight—light industrial areas along these corridors, areas of car parks. The study took out heritage areas, green space and areas that local communities find valuable and netted out 50 per cent of strata title blocks and said, 'What would happen if you took the remaining space and created diverse, sustainable, affordable, medium-density housing?' What that has done in the context of this study and Professor Adams's work is that it leaves 90 or 95 per cent of the urban fabric untouched, and it simply develops and concentrates people along these activities corridors. If they are put in appropriate housing that is designed for that context—diverse and affordable housing—we can actually eliminate sprawl. We can not just reduce but actually eliminate greenfields development and bring the city back to the people; we can bring services, public transport, childcare centres and jobs back to the suburbs which long since ceased to have access to those things. That is the reason why you see these extraordinary figures being quoted in this report that has been released today.


It is a study that I am proud to have been a part of. It has been an unexpected joy working with the Property Council and a cohort of developers that they brought in to keep our feet on the ground. My thanks go to William de Haer and to Joe Lenzo, the Executive Director of the Property Council of Australia, for their committed work in bringing this report to fruition; to Dr Anthony Duckworth-Smith, who is assistant professor with AUDRC; and principally to Chantal Caruso and her team of volunteers and interns in my office for bringing a lot of very, very sharp policy ideas to bear. Now comes the crunch. This work needs to be funded. The public transport infrastructure does not come for free; neither does the cycling infrastructure. It will pay for itself, including in those reduced $9 billion congestion charges that we all absorb as citizens of poorly designed cities. It is imperative for the government to levy appropriate taxation on some of the companies that are dragging extraordinary profits out of this country so that we can afford to build the infrastructure in Perth and in other cities around the Australian continent, so that we can afford to put in the infrastructure that people deserve. Without appropriate taxation, that will never become a reality.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2013-03-13,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (16:29):  I was very interested to hear that Senator Ludlam is basically running the argument that Australians' right to drive their cars in whatever part of Australia they like should be examined very closely to be efficient—I think he does not give credit to the drivers of those cars, because they always look at the efficiency of their means of transport—and that choosing a three or four-bedroom house on the outskirts of a city at the time of your working life because that is what you can afford is something that also may need to be reviewed. Interestingly enough, the city of Adelaide does have some of the proposals that Senator Ludlam has suggested on the books. If you had talked to the Deputy Premier of South Australia as late as last week, he would be able to point you to the vigorous opposition to not multistorey but four- or five-storey planning approvals on major arterial roads—the same principle of infilling the city and infilling the major arterial roads with higher density housing. And it has been vigorously disputed by at least one council. The complaint people have is that there is nowhere to park the car. It is going to be a very long and arduous debate to take Senator Ludlam's position and carry it off. 


I suppose it is important that we place on the record what the Labor government is doing in addressing the challenges of our city. I am fortunate enough to live in a city which is still easy to get around. Even in the alleged peak hours, we are probably no more than 20 minutes point to point for almost anywhere you want to go. That sort of ease of transport in Adelaide is not likely to bring any urgent change, but it is very important that we have a federal Labor government which since 2007 has placed the plight of 18 major cities on the national agenda. It is also important to place on the record that the previous coalition government, in keeping with coalition governments of the past, abandoned programs to improve our cities, such as the Hawke-Keating $2.3 billion Building Better Cities Program. 


Our cities are home to seven out of 10 Australians and generate 80 per cent of the national income. This Labor government believes cities are too important to ignore. That is why, after national consultation, this federal government introduced Our Cities, Our Future, a national urban policy for a productive, sustainable and livable future, in May 2011. That is why we established a Major Cities Unit. The aim of the urban policy is to keep our cities globally competitive, productive, sustainable and livable. 


Through a COAG agreement, state and territory leaders have been required to produce long-term strategic planning systems for their capital cities, taking into account a range of criteria, including: preservation of the transport corridors needed for the future, preparing for population growth and demographic change, planned evidence-based land release and an appropriate balance of infill and greenfield developments, climate change mitigation, better urban development and environmental management of water, energy and waste. This Labor government is very visible and active on all of those fronts.


Infrastructure funding under the Nation Building Program is linked to progress with these strategic city plans. So Senator Ludlam was on the right mark; he has Buckley's and none of having the reforms he is mooting being supported by a popular vote, but is important that this Labor government is proceeding in a sensible, thorough and strategic way to achieve what can be some remarkable outcomes, in a cooperative and proactive way. 


In their 12 years in government, those opposite did not contribute one cent to a single public transport project, anywhere in Australia. In Melbourne's western suburbs, work is well underway on the Regional Rail Link. This is currently the biggest public transport project anywhere in the country, with the federal government contributing more than $3.2 billion towards its construction. In addition, this government has: invested $20 million through the Liveable Cities program for a raft of planning and demonstration projects directly improving our urban centres, transport links, cycling and walking paths and urban energy programs; produced three editions of the State of Australian cities, a national snapshot of our 18 major cities, fully downloaded more than two million times; established a national urban policy forum of experts to provide the best advice to government and to ensure that we get the policies right; contributed $58 million to two cooperative research centres, the CRC for Low Carbon Living and the CRC for Water Sensitive Cities; and launched an urban design protocol, providing a simple design guide and check sheet for governments and organisations. The list goes on and on. 


Some of the commitments that have been made in public transport are: Victorian Regional Rail Link, $3.225 billion; Moreton Bay Rail Link, $742 million; Gold Coast Light Rail, $365 million; Noarlunga to Seaford Rail Extension, $291 million; Melbourne Metro One, pre-con, $40 million; Brisbane Inner City Rail Study, $20 million; and the Perth Light Rail Study. So the government is proactive along the lines of making sure that major cities provide long-term sustainable public transport. Where it is practical, possible and efficient, rail has been funded.


I think it is really important to move quickly to another really great initiative of this government, the NBN. What may well happen in a lot of our major cities is that people may choose to work from home. If you are going to choose to work from home, you are going to need high-speed, high-upload, high-download connection. Guess what? That is what the NBN does. There will be many businesses—and I have operated a couple of organisations which would have been well suited to people working from home. It is not hard to do your bookkeeping from home. You can scan the invoices in, email them across, and people can put the figures in MYOB or whatever accounting suite they use. People would not have to drive the hour to work and would perhaps be able to match some of their childcare commitments with their work. I think some studies say that it is actually a very productive way of people working. In terms of productivity, people working from home are measured as being perhaps higher than the morning around the morning tea and the coffee and the chat, as you get into work every day. So if we are to make our cities more livable then teleworking could well be the way to go. 


There are some stats which indicate enormous savings in the downtime that Senator Ludlam spoke about—some 120 million litres of fuel, avoiding 320,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide and reducing congestion costs, of $470 million. These things are not new items. This government is on the job. As far as taxing the superprofits of mining companies is concerned, that is happening. We are not taxing the superprofits of mining companies, as some of the states do, in terms of royalties, which have no regard for profitability; it is a just a tax on a tonne out of the ground. The superprofits are being taxed and those taxable dollars are being put to good use. I am sure that, when the revenue reaches the appropriate level, consideration will be given as to how we can better use those dollars and get our cities to be more livable, more productive and more efficient places of work, and places of good living.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2013-03-13,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:39):  Today we are debating a matter of public importance, put up by the Greens political party, which in effect says: tax the mining industry, tax them again and again, and with those taxes we will be able to fix the roads, housing and natural habitat that have been lost. That is, in effect, the matter that we are debating today.


I acknowledge that some of our cities are finding difficulties with traffic congestion and some loss of habitat. But if you look at Melbourne, under a Liberal-National state government, you will see these magnificent freeways and ring-roads through the city that really have addressed some of Labor's mismanagement of our cities. If you look at the capital of my home state, Brisbane, you will see that it had a Liberal and then LNP city council under Campbell Newman that built tunnels, that really addressed the issues of traffic congestion and housing affordability and that was renowned for the work that it did on the protection of natural habitat in that state. Contrast that with Sydney, under years of Labor rule and a Labor government that was only interested in giving mining leases to the friends of the mining minister or playing games with the unions that control the Australian Labor Party, and you have a good contrast of Labor administration in the cities. Look at Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne and at the Liberal-National governments. Mr O'Farrell is now starting the long task of fixing up Sydney's traffic congestion and housing difficulties. But it will take a long time.


The Greens think that you can tax your way to prosperity. Little do they recognise or acknowledge that, in 2010-11 alone, the mining industry contributed in royalty revenue some $9.5 billion. That is in addition to the so-called superprofits tax—that is, company tax that mining companies pay when they make any sort of profit—and it is also in addition to all the payroll taxes that go to state governments.


So the mining industry in Australia has, until recently, contributed to its way. Regrettably, with the combination of the Labor Party and the Greens, investment in the so-called goose that lays the golden egg is starting to falter because you have these crazy left-wing policies of the Labor-Greens alliance of wanting to tax mining out of our nation.


The Greens in their 'best of 2012' press release, issued towards the end of last year, were actually claiming credit for the best broken promise. They are claiming the benefit of dropping the surplus fetish. The Greens do not understand that, for Australia to be strong and for Australia to have the money to invest in and build the sort of infrastructure they are bleating about and that we need such as dams and water storages throughout Australia, you need to run a tight financial ship.


I note that the Greens and Labor talk about major public transport options. They never seem to remember that the last major railway built in Australia was the Alice to Darwin railway. Built by which government? The John Howard government built that magnificent piece of Australian infrastructure. Why were we able to do it? Because the country was successful. There was investment coming into the country and we were able to afford those sorts of things.


Have a look at Western Australia, an exemplar state after three years of a Liberal-National Party government, where the economy is now booming. Why? Because investment has been encouraged. People know that that is a state where they can make profits and, out of the profits, they pay money in one form or another to the state and federal governments. You only have to look at the magnificent job that is happening in Western Australia, with all of the new proposals for public transport and better traffic flow. I would have to say with some pride for my fellow Australians in Western Australia that they understand that you do not fix Australia by taxing the goose that lays the golden egg. The people of Western Australia clearly recognised that last Saturday, when they not only overwhelmingly turned to the Liberal and National parties and destroyed and decimated the Australian Labor Party but at last count—as I read it—completely decimated the Greens political party. That is a forerunner of what will happen with a policy-free group—they are certainly not policy-free; I take that back when I refer to the Greens. That will happen to a group who have these pie in the sky, airy-fairy, 'fairies at the bottom of the garden' sort of policies that read well if you get a grade 4 kid to write out a wish list of what they would want for Australia but are without any understanding of what it requires to run a complex business like the Australian nation. Unfortunately, the Greens have these thought bubbles about how they would like to see Australia, but their actions do anything but give Australia the wherewithal it needs to be strong and to provide the sort of infrastructure that the Greens are talking about.


You only have to look at history and see that the only true parties of the environment in the Australian parliament over decades have been the Liberal and National parties. Go through any measure of the environment—the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Kakadu, natural resource management—




Senator Thistlethwaite:
  Shooting in national parks!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Thank you to the Labor Party senator—banning of guns in Australia and all those sorts of things. But, if you go through any serious environmental forward steps in Australia, you will see that they have been introduced by a Liberal and National Party government. Why? Because we had the sort of economy that allowed us to pour millions of dollars into the Natural Heritage Trust and to do things for the environment, for country towns and even for regional cities. But the Greens and the Labor Party do not understand that. They think you just tax, tax, tax investors that have lots of options around the world—Australia is not the only kid on the block with good mineral resources. What the Greens and their Labor allies want to do is to tax the mining industry out of existence so that the wealth that Australia gets from them, and the wealth that allows us to build infrastructure and look after the environment, will disappear.


Only the Greens and the Labor Party could introduce a minerals resource rent tax that does not raise any tax, but that is another issue. The fact that they are doing this—the sovereign risk issues that continually come because of a Labor government that is hanging on by its fingernails with the support of the Australian Greens and is so dependent on the Australian Greens that they will do any of these crazy left-wing proposals that the Greens click their fingers at—is the problem that all Australians understand. I do not want to predict future elections, but I ask you to look at past elections, and clearly people in my state of Queensland, in New South Wales and in Western Australia have understood that you do not make Australia strong by making our major industries weak. That is the issue that the Greens should really be looking at, rather than this airy-fairy stuff they come up with.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2013-03-13,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (16:49):  I congratulate Senator Scott Ludlam for moving this matter of public importance on the acute urban challenges in Australian cities. An urgent challenge facing our major cities is solving the growing traffic congestion crisis. Traffic congestion is costing Australia $9 billion a year and estimates say that that will reach about $20 billion by 2020. It is $9 billion already—think of the lost jobs and the lost productivity for business. This is a huge issue.


When I joined the New South Wales parliament in 1999, Sydney residents and businesses were already stuck in traffic jams. You could not wind down your windows on a hot day because the air pollution was so bad. You could not let your kids ride their bikes on the clogged roads. Buses and trains were lagging behind population growth. In the New South Wales parliament the Greens regularly spoke up for public transport and against motorway expansion, but through the 2000s things only got worse. Labor, with the support of the coalition, changed laws to benefit big developers and motorway builders. CityRail's late-running trains became a political crisis. The only way out for the Labor government that they saw was to slash the train timetables. The trains may have run on time for a period, but we got reduced services. The Roads and Traffic Authority was all powerful in this era and, instead of expanding the CityRail network as a priority, the government's road budget was triple the transport budget. We got more motorways and more traffic jams as a result. We got more urban sprawl, not serviced with public transport, and public land was sold off to private developers, locking up strategic transport corridors. Every year the problem grew bigger and the solutions became more costly.


In Sydney there has been a succession of failed toll roads, motorways and tunnels that have simply induced more traffic on our roads. The M5 East tunnel became so heavily congested that the government had to advise motorists to keep their windows closed. The M5, M4 and M2 motorways are like parking lots in the morning and evening peak. The Cross City Tunnel and Lane Cove Tunnel ventures were white elephants that faltered under the weight of rubbery traffic modelling that underpinned their base case financial models 


The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics has reported:


In general, the forecasting performance for toll roads in the world has been found to be poorer than for toll-free roads. There is an asymmetrical patterns of forecasting errors, that is, consistent overestimation. Australia is no exception.


And certainly Sydney saw it up close: so much of the cost when the motorways went under came back to the public. So often road projects are built on these false promises. They make wildly optimistic claims to reduce traffic congestion and divert focus and funds away from urgently needed improvements to the public transport network. 


Melbourne and Brisbane have similar toll road problems. Melbourne has a myriad of motorways and toll roads and yet traffic continues to grow. The latest road project, the East-West Tunnel, has been described as the next toll road white elephant. It is being compared to the BrisConnections Airport Link toll road that went into receivership last year.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Pretty good road, though!




Senator RHIANNON:
  What a foolish interjection. The Greens in Melbourne are campaigning for new east-west public transport links, improved services and an investment in a real metro network. The travelling public want better public transport too, but the government is firmly backing the toll road.


It does not have to be this way. Tonight I have the pleasure of speaking at the launch of the Moving Australia 2030 report and I very warmly congratulate those who have worked on this outstanding document. It is a vision for integrated and sustainable transport and land-use planning that the Greens have shared and advocated for over 20 years, a world-class sustainable transport network servicing green, livable cities. It is a clear, bold vision for tackling the fundamental transport challenges of the 21st century: climate change, energy security, population growth, public health and quality of life. The Moving People 2030 Taskforce is made up of the local government association, planning, public transport and bicycle groups, and the Heart Foundation. I think the authors have done an excellent job. It is an exciting collaboration which will inform and influence decision makers at every level of government if they are willing to allow that to happen. It is exactly the kind of integrated approach that we need for transport planning and future-proofing our cities.


The Greens have a longstanding record of support for public transport, cycling and walking. We have worked hard in state and local governments for community-driven planning decisions that elevate the principles of ecologically sustainable development and promote clean air and healthy lifestyles. We have campaigned for the preservation of integrated land-use planning to halt urban sprawl, create more livable suburbs and secure strategic corridors and green spaces for the future.


There are fundamental reasons why this sustainable cities vision is still to be realised despite the overwhelming public support and strong economic and environmental grounds. For eight years in New South Wales, the Greens campaigned to expose the undue influence of developer donations in New South Wales. Our work and that of many community groups resulted in a ban on developer donations and then a ban on all corporate donations. The campaign was grounded in the idea that greedy developers and corporations were buying influence to win favourable planning decisions. For a dark decade in New South Wales under the Labor government, while the vested interests of developers trumped the public interest, these developers donated $20 million—over $12 million to the New South Wales Labor Party and over $7.5 million to the coalition in opposition. At the height of these donations in 2005 the Labor, Liberal and National parties joined forces to pass the now infamous part 3A planning laws that eroded the state's planning controls and led to an ad hoc growth strategy. The major parties put part 3A on the map. It was used to rubber-stamp bad developments based on concept plans, with minimal environmental assessment and without meaningful community consultation.


The losers were Sydney residents who now live in poorly planned suburbs and who struggle every day with worsening air quality, long travel times on congested roads and an ailing public transport network to get to and from work. This is costing Sydney's economy billions of dollars and making our city less livable. The situation is not intractable, however. But it will take a huge commitment and support of the state and federal governments to overcome this legacy. The problems in New South Wales have spread much wider than Sydney. In the Hunter Valley there has been a strong local campaign to improve public transport and for better land-use planning. 


The community are calling for the retention of Newcastle rail. Successive governments in New South Wales, Labor and coalition, are for ripping up heavy rail that goes into the heart of Newcastle, something that should be used to help develop that city in the most livable way. The federal Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport's Hunter division has produced an excellent report that showcases a range of planning strategies to make Hunter communities more livable and more sustainable to grow the local community beyond coal. But the Department of Infrastructure and Transport is not funding this excellent work. Instead, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Mr Anthony Albanese, has pledged a $3.5 billion investment in a new coal rail line for the Hunter Valley's fourth coal loader in Newcastle Harbour—yes, that is $3.5 billion. Mr Albanese might try and call this money for freight public transport, but the reality is that it is assistance to the coal industry and robbing money for public transport and for integrated planning.


The problem is not confined to New South Wales. Every capital city carries a backlog of public transport infrastructure. Major regional centres need improved passenger connection with the surrounding communities. We could carry a massive increase in bicycle and walking infrastructure in major cities and centres across the country. For the Moving Australia 2030 recommendations to become reality we will require a huge shift both in the car culture that still dominates and in the funding bias that grossly favours roads over public and active transport. The federal government, through the excellent strategies outlined by the Major Cities Unit and the department of regional development, has set the right direction.


What will it take for the government to get on board and make the shift to fund more public transport and active transport infrastructure projects? There are huge gains to be made for our economy and for our community and the environment. Now is the time for Minister Albanese to show leadership and to step up support for public transport and active transport infrastructure funding support—support that is critical to making our cities more livable.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:59):  When one travels around the world and visits global cities, you appreciate how well we have done in Australia when it comes to planning and urban development, particularly the planning of our big cities. Anyone who returns home to Sydney would appreciate that Sydney is probably the best city in the world. There is nothing like flying in over Sydney Harbour and seeing that golden jewel of a harbour, the wonderful beaches and the large metropolis that is Sydney. We really have got it right when it comes to planning and urban development. If you look at big global cities like Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo, New York or London, they all have congestion and smog, and people predominantly live in high-rises without backyards and there is very little green space. In Australia, these are things that we cherish and come through in our urban development and planning laws. I think you can say that in Australia we have planned and developed well. But we cannot take what we have for granted.


There are challenges in urban development and in maintaining the liveability of our cities—and by liveability, I mean affordability of housing; jobs that are close to where people live so they do not have to travel for hours each day to get to work; adequate public transport that delivers people in a clean, on-time environment; affordable renewable energy; and access to leisure and green spaces. Labor believe that the federal government should play an active role in urban development. Indeed, it probably was a Labor government that first took an active role in our nation's urban development when the Whitlam government established the Department of Urban and Regional Development.


Labor are committed to better urban planning, better development and greater liveability of our cities. That stands in stark contrast to the opposition. What is the approach of the opposition? Their approach was enunciated in a recent comment by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Tony Abbott, who stated: 'Transport infrastructure is a state responsibility. The Commonwealth government should no more have to fund it than a state government should have to buy new tanks for the Army.' That is the approach of the coalition when it comes to urban development. 'We won't worry about it. We'll wash our hands of it and just hand it all over to the states'—a beautiful little hospital pass. Haven't the states done a wonderful job with urban development! Isn't Campbell Newman doing a wonderful job with protection of the environment in Queensland!


Labor believe that the federal government should take a role in urban development and that is why Labor developed a national urban policy. For the first time in our nation's history, a national government has a clearly articulated set of aspirations for our cities, and it is delivered and updated through the annual report State of Australian Cities, which reports on the progress that we are making on national urban policy. 


This is an area that has traditionally been covered by the states but Labor believe that it should be a partnership—the state governments working with the national government to deliver better planning and urban development. Through this national urban policy, we are working with the states and territories to improve urban planning. It includes preserving future transport corridors, a better balance between land release and urban infill, climate change mitigation, better urban design to reduce water and energy usage and preparedness for the ageing of the population. We are doing that in a collaborative manner, just as we are doing it in a collaborative manner when it comes to infrastructure development in this country through the Infrastructure Australia model, where organisations are able to put in bids that are assessed by an independent body. It is all about improving the productivity of our economy.


But there are some challenges in urban development, particularly when it comes to transport. In Sydney now, it is almost impossible in peak hour to tell someone what time you are going to get to a meeting. You could be one hour either side because of transport congestion. Unfortunately, I think the current Liberal government has missed the mark when it comes to transport and fixing some of those problems—but that is another issue. 


Over the next 20 years, Labor have committed to working with state governments to fix some of our transport problems, particularly when it comes to freight transport and getting freight off our roads. Much of the investment that we have made in this area has been about improving the accessibility of freight on rail and decoupling some of the entanglement that occurs between passenger rail lines and freight rail lines. Over the next 20 years, the amount of freight carried in Australia will double and that will mean that there will be extra pressure on our transport system. We are working to ensure that we are detangling the bottlenecks that have existed and we are doing this in a number of areas. 


With regard to roads, we have doubled the roads budget since we came to office and that has meant that we are constructing more than 7,500 kilometres of new and upgraded lanes throughout the country. This is in addition to more than 14,000 local government road projects under the Roads to Recovery program, 2,000 black spot projects and 350 heavy vehicle safety and productivity projects. In my state of New South Wales, the Pacific Highway between Sydney and Brisbane is being upgraded. Two major works are underway: the Pacific Highway bypass at Kempsey and the Pacific Highway bypass at Bulahdelah. As we speak, there are 1,300 people working on those bypass projects in New South Wales and they are being funded by this federal Labor government.


On rail, we have had a massive investment in new rail infrastructure. We have increased the investment in rail in this country tenfold since we came to office compared to the time of the Howard government. We have ended the previous curfew which operated during peak morning and afternoon periods for road rail from Port Botany because the passenger line received priority. We began construction on the North Sydney freight corridor project. We are investing in the development of the Moorebank intermodal terminal, which will take about 3,300 trucks off Sydney's roads everyday and will create 700 jobs. Recently, the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport opened the southern Sydney freight line, a $1 billion investment aimed at detangling that bottleneck infrastructure that traditionally existed between passenger and freight rail in this country. Another big issue in Sydney is of course a second Sydney airport. When you go to the airport now at 5.30 in the morning you will get caught in traffic around Sydney airport. You will be guaranteed to get caught in a traffic jam. Passenger numbers going through the airport will double by 2035. Most global cities have two airports, and it is simply unacceptable for Australia not to be looking at a second airport for Sydney. Unfortunately, the approach of the O'Farrell government again has been: 'We don't need a second Sydney airport. It's not our problem. We won't worry about it. We'll wait until sometime into the future.' That is the approach of the Liberals.


Another important issue regarding liveability and urban development is the environment and access to green space. In New South Wales the contrast is stark when it comes to protection of the environment and promotion of green space. The Carr Labor government declared more marine parks and more new national parks than any other government in history. What has been the approach of the Liberals? The Liberals have allowed people to shoot in them. They have allowed people to shoot in national parks. That is their approach to saving the environment: to allow people to go shooting in national parks in New South Wales. 


If you go down in the woods today in New South Wales, be sure of a big surprise. And, if you go down in the woods today, you better not go in disguise, Senator Joyce. You better not go dressed as a kangaroo, you better not go dressed as a bear, you better not go dressed as a possum, because there will be someone there to ping you off and shoot you right through the nose. That is what the approach is in New South Wales. Who is there to load the gun for you? None other than New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell and his bumbling Minister for the Environment, Robyn Parker. They are loading the gun for you as shooters ping off people in the national parks. That is the approach of the Liberal government when it comes to the protection of our environment. It is a stark contrast between Labor, who are protecting the environment, and the Liberals in the New South Wales, who are allowing people to shoot.


You also have the likes of Andrew Stoner with an Uzi or something like that, spraying bullets around and taking out kangaroos and bears and things like that— (Time expired)

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (17:09):  If you down to the woods today you are certain of a big surprise, because you will probably find in the woods a little cabinet, and in that cabinet you will find Eddie Obeid being appointed there by the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr. That is as big a surprise as you will get with the ALP. Lots of surprises with the ALP in New South Wales. Lots of surprises: Eddie Obeid, Ian McDonald. Lots and lots of surprises.


Going back to the issue. I find it rather amusing that here we have the Greens' motion saying there is urgent need for the government to apply the benefits of the mining boom when the Greens do not believe in mining. I can help the Labor Party out here. You are supposed to get stuck into the Greens because of the hypocrisy of the statement. The Greens do not believe in mining. Which mine do the Greens believe in? They do not believe in coal mining, they want to shut it all down. They do not believe in any of the infrastructure that goes with mining. They do not believe in any form of mining. They are applying the benefits of the mining boom, but tell us: which mines? Which mines do you believe are culturally sensitive? Which mines do you want to go forward with? Which mines are you proposing? Everything about the Greens is hypocrisy.  


The Greens motion also mentions dealing with the issues of addressing acute urban challenges. This is the other part of the logic of the Greens: you take the wealth from the regional areas and you move it to the urban areas. Forget about all the people who live in between. Forget about regional Australia. Let's just take the wealth out of the regional areas—out of Blackwater, out of Singleton, out of Cessnock—and move it to Paddington and West End. That is where you need the wealth of the mining areas—in Darling Harbour. We just heard the Labor Party talking about this. Congratulations: Sydney is a beautiful city. But one of the problems we have got with the rail issue—and they talked about all their investment in rail—is that they have never built the inland rail, they have never brought about intermodal port access, they have not connected Melbourne up to Brisbane. We are the only nation on earth where our second-biggest city is not directly connected to our third-biggest city. They do not believe in that. $30 million is all they have put in the forward estimates for that, but they are investing it all in Sydney.


Yet the obvious one they will not build. And you know why they will not build it? Because they have got to look after their mates at Port Botany. We should be doing the logical thing and creating a corridor of commerce so the people of the Tamworth, the people of Dubbo and the people of Victoria get the capacity to link up to the mining fields of central Queensland. We would have the capacity to move product and we could create the commercial opportunities so people could get in on the ground floor. That is the sort of vision that people want. That is the sort of vision that the National Party offers. That is the sort of vision that the coalition offers.


But let's go back to the Greens. They always tell us about their economic credibility. This is how deep their economic credibility goes. They do not believe in mining, but they want the mining tax to pay for Gonski, the NDIS, Denticare and high-speed rail. That is $280 billion worth of promises. The problem we have got is even Rudd's mining tax only brings in about $100 billion. We have got in one item of their so-called fiscal oversight a $180 billion black hole. This is because they are incredible. They lack credibility. This is the conclusion people came to in Western Australia, where they have said that they are well-meaning but they are just off with the fairies. Nothing they say, if you hold their hand to the flame, makes any sense. We have got this inner urban sort of nostalgia that is desirous of the regional areas to basically give the benevolence of the resources that live in their areas to make their lives better. That would make sense because, when you go to the Greens senators, it is easy to work out what they believe in by where they live.


Senator Wright's office is in 100 King William Street, Adelaide—5000—right on the knocker. 5000—bang smack in the middle of town. We have got Larissa Waters—251 Given Street, Paddington. Paddington is a lovely spot. That is where you want to be, it is a lovely spot. Rachel Siewert—she lives in Northbridge—bang smack in the middle of Perth—6003. You cannot get much closer to the middle of the circle than that. Senator Lee Rhiannon is right out there in the sticks—she lives in Surry Hills. She is a long way out. Senator Milne—Hobart 7000—smack, bang in the middle again. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator McKenzie
):  Senator Joyce, you will refer to your colleagues in this chamber by their proper titles. 




Senator Ludlam:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: I ask you to draw Senator Joyce—I do not know what random tangent he is on listing people's home addresses; I believe he is actually listing offices as far as I can tell. I ask you, Madam Acting Deputy President, to draw him back to the substance of the motion about traffic congestion in Australian cities and the challenges facing Australian residents in Australia cities—that would be great.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Ludlam, there is no point of order. 




Senator JOYCE:
  I am definitely mentioning office addresses; I would not mention their private addresses—that is their private thing.


What we find at the Manic Monkey Cafe of inner suburban Nirvanaville are the Greens offices. They are saying once more that we should be taking the wealth from regional areas and helping out the traffic congestion in the centre of Adelaide, in Surry Hills, in Paddington. This is why people believe their whole political philosophy is so fanciful. And where are they getting this money from? They are getting it from the mining tax. What don't they believe in? They don't believe in mining. What have they asked for it to do? They have asked for it to pay $280 billion worth of expenses. How much does the mining tax bring in? It brings in $100 billion. So how much is their black hole? $180 billion. What do they bang on about at the door? 'You've got a black hole.' You have just got one issue—you fall flat on your face. This is why it is just total and utter hypocrisy. 


Why don't you move a motion, if you believe in the regions, to discuss the inland rail? We should be discussing sealing the third road across Australia. We only have two sealed roads going from east to west in this nation. There are only two possible ways you can go from east to west in the nation of Australia in the year of our Lord 2013 and remain on a sealed road, and that is bizarre. Why don't you move a motion about that? Why don't you move a motion about the Indigenous communities out west and how we should get mining resources to finance their services? 


To be honest, I believe that the benefits from the mining boom should be invested in regional areas. That is why we believe in royalties to regions at a state level, because the royalties are a mechanism of state government, so royalties from state governments should be invested back into regional areas. I have got no arguments with that whatsoever. I think that Brendon Grylls in Western Australia has been commended by the people of his state when they gave him a seat because that is what he stood behind: royalties to regions. The issue is the absolute hypocrisy of the Greens who are becoming less believable by the moment. 


Because this motion is so hypocritical and so unbelievable, it calls into question things that are going to come to light in the very near future. We have also to test the Greens' belief in whether they are going to vote for the censorship of the Australian media as it comes forward with this so-called media policy from Senator Conroy, which in regional areas is going to bring about greater centralisation. He is dead right: he said that I crossed the floor against centralisation; I absolutely did. This piece of legislation he proposes brings about greater centralisation of the media in regional areas, and it will be interesting to see whether the hypocrisy in this is also evident in how the Greens vote in that media legislation. It brings about censorship. It is absolutely bizarre.


It will be interesting to see whether the Greens, who are the shining orb of life, truth and wonder, will vote for transparency in the media in this legislation or for censorship. That will be another interesting thing. It will be interesting to see whether they vote for the guillotine to shut down the debate just like they want to shut down the media. It will be a fascinating to see as to whether they take it to a Senate inquiry, because they believe in the committee system. Will they take it to a thorough Senate inquiry or will they crawl under a rock because that is what their coalition partners, the Labor Party, tell them to do? It is all going to be there for us to see within seven days. It will be very interesting. 


You cannot wonder why the people of Western Australia no longer vote for you, because then there will be other states that will not vote for you. They are watching you closely, and the Greens seem to have lost their soul—they continue to lose their soul. This is an absolutely hypocritical motion, because you do not believe in the mining tax. It says you want to get money from an industry that you do not believe in and you want to invest it in your backyard where your offices are. You are where you live, and you live in the inner urban areas. You want the money from the regional areas to prop you up.

Australian Capital Territory (Self Government) Act Amendment Bill 2013



Today I introduce the Australian Capital Territory (Self Government) Act Amendment Bill 2013. 


The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Self Government) Act 1988 to grant the ACT Legislative Assembly the power to determine its own numbers without reference to the Commonwealth. 


The current process to change the number of members of the ACT Legislative Assembly requires a resolution to be passed by the ACT Legislative Assembly and then regulations to be made by the Commonwealth to change the size of the Assembly from the specified number of members under section 8(2) of the Act, that then receive support from the Assembly. This Bill grants the Assembly the power to independently determine and amend its own numbers and removes the Commonwealth role in the process.


The Centenary of Canberra year presents us with a timely opportunity to reflect on Australia’s national capital and all that it has achieved over the last 100 years. 


Since the ACT was granted self-government 25 years ago, the ACT has grown into a fully functional, self-governing territory with a vibrant and engaged community and a Legislative Assembly that is recognised as a regional leader. 


This Bill acknowledges the capacity of the ACT to run its own affairs, and provides it the power to determine the number of members it requires in its Legislative Assembly to efficiently and effectively perform its functions. 


This Bill does not change the size of the Assembly. It amends the mechanism by which the size of the Assembly can be changed by removing the Commonwealth’s role in the process of approving amendments to the size of the Assembly, and vesting this power into the Assembly to independently fulfil this function. The Bill incorporates a requirement for any change to the size of the Assembly to be passed by a two thirds majority of the members of the Assembly. By promoting the need for bipartisan support for such changes to the governance of the territory, a safeguard is present, protecting our democratic traditions.


Questions about size of the ACT Legislative Assembly and the datedness of a mature parliament relying on another parliament to determine its size have been raised on multiple occasions. Only last year the ACT Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Administration and Procedure conducted a review of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act. The Committee’s report, released in August recommended amending the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act to allow for the Legislative Assembly to determine its size without reference to the Commonwealth.  


And this is not only a recommendation of the ACT Assembly.


In his 2011 review of the relationship between the Commonwealth and the ACT, Canberra Capital Place, Dr Allan Hawke AC, provided advice to this Government on how to find the right balance for planning responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the ACT Government.


In response to that review the Australian Government and the ACT Government agreed to work collaboratively to:


improve the structure and expression of matters of national significance 


simplify the capital’s planning system


reduce overlap and duplication by better alignment of land management and planning responsibilities;


clarify the National Capital Authority's role in the promotion of the capital; and


take account of both local and national interest through the appointment of an ACT Government nominee from the Canberra community to the board of the National Capital Authority.


I am pleased to report to the House that all these initiatives are underway, but, we also considered the gravity of Dr Hawke’s discussion on political representation in the Territory and the size of the Assembly.


While his review did not make a specific recommendation around the size of the Assembly, because it was outside the terms of reference, Hawke made it clear:


“In light of the importance of robust and accountable democratic processes in the ACT – characterised by high standards of parliamentary debate, a legislative program covering a range of complex issues, and an active Assembly Committee process – and the significant under-representation of the citizens of the ACT, there is an overwhelming case for increasing the size of the Assembly.”


So, this Government is responding to this additional challenge in Dr Hawke’s 2011 report with action. 


The reasons for pursuing this Bill are clear and sound. 


It is appropriate: the ACT Legislative Assembly is a mature parliament. It is appropriate that it should assume responsibility for determining the number of members needed to ensure its efficient functioning and the mechanism with which the size of the Legislative Assembly is altered. 


The ACT Legislative Assembly is capable and ready: the passage of the Bill would provide just recognition of the maturity and capacity that the ACT Legislative Assembly has demonstrated since it attained self-government. It is a vote of confidence in the capacity of the ACT to manage its own affairs and its governance arrangements.


It simplifies a complex process: the Bill reduces administrative effort and streamlines the process to effect change in the numbers of the ACT Legislative Assembly.


The Centenary year is an apt time for the Commonwealth to make this simple yet enduring change for the future of the ACT.


I commend the Bill to the Senate.


 




Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013



The Bill will introduce a number of measures to further strengthen and streamline the


Higher Education Support Act 2003 (the Act), resulting in more effective and efficient administration of the Australian Government’s Higher Education Loan Program or ‘HELP’, specifically, FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP.


The Bill builds on amendments made in the Higher Education Support Amendment (Streamlining and Other Measures) Act 2012, and further supports recommendations made in the Post Implementation Review of the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme Final Report 2011. The amendments follow extensive consultation and contribute to commitments made under the April 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform.


The Bill will enhance the quality and accountability framework underpinning HELP by providing for the automatic revocation of providers in specific circumstances where there is a high risk to students and public monies. Those circumstances will apply where a provider’s registration with the relevant tertiary education regulator ceases, or if a winding-up order is made by a court against a provider. Importantly, provider protection measures have been included in the Bill as it is a condition that automatic revocation action cannot occur before all review or appeal action by an Administrative Appeal Tribunal or court has been finalised. 


The Bill will strengthen the compliance framework underpinning HELP by enabling the Minister to issue a provider with a compliance notice. This will enhance the range of provider compliance actions available to the Government in circumstances that present risk to students and public monies where suspension or revocation action is not warranted.


The amendments will also provide for the streamlining of administrative arrangements to allow the Government to amend a provider’s approval when informed of a change in business entity name, in a more efficient manner.


The existing arrangements for seeking information from the relevant tertiary education regulators are further enhanced by consolidating these provisions into one general provision. This amendment will also have the added benefit of reducing the complexity of the Act.


Further, the Bill will enable individuals to continue to repay their HELP debt based on appropriately calculated repayment thresholds by updating the calculation of indexation to apply to HELP repayment thresholds. This amendment reflects the move by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from quarterly to biannual publication of average weekly earnings data.


Finally, the Bill will improve consistency across the tertiary sector by updating qualification definitions in the Act to align with changes to the Australian Qualifications Framework.


 




Royal Commissions Amendment Bill 2013



In January this year, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, the Governor-General issued Letters Patent appointing six commissioners who will work together as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. This Bill makes important changes to the Royal Commission Act to assist the Commission in conducting its inquiry.


Speaker, this Government has a proud track record of helping the vulnerable, and working to deliver reforms that will help future generations of Australians.


The Gillard Labor Government has not shied away from the big challenges. It has not been afraid to take action and introduce the reforms, for example the Clean Energy Future Plan, National Disability Insurance Scheme and Gonski education reforms, which will shape this country for years to come.


Establishing a Royal Commission into Institutional Child Abuse is another of these important initiatives — one which will shine a light on the injustices that have occurred in places where the most vulnerable in our society should have been cared for and protected.


The Commission will investigate and make recommendations on how to improve laws, policies and practices to prevent and better respond to child sexual abuse in institutions. Its recommendations will provide an opportunity to make sure that the failings of those institutions in the past is never allowed to happen again, and that"" survivors receive the support and justice they deserve.


The establishment of this Commission is the Government's recognition of all those who have tried to bring the horrors of institutional child abuse out into the open and been ignored, scorned, shunned or simply disbelieved.


The voices of these individuals must be heard. Victims must feel properly supported to stand up to tell their stories, and the Government must acknowledge how such horrific crimes have affected their lives.


The Government recognises that for many people this will be very difficult. It is not going to be an easy process, but that does not mean that any of us should shy away from the challenge. We need to do away with the culture of silence. We need to listen to what has gone before so we can do everything possible to stop these crimes happening again.


Those affected should draw strength from the knowledge that, through their bravery, the Royal Commission will truly understand the horrors it is dealing with and be assisted in developing recommendations on what institutions and governments should do in the future to better protect children against child sexual abuse.


In developing the Terms of Reference for the Commission, the Government worked with people from all parts of Australia. The Government listened to organisations representing survivors of child abuse, community and legal leaders, law enforcement, governments and religious organisations.


One of the key themes that arose in this consultation process was the importance of having hearing processes sensitive to the needs of victims, so that they feel supported in preparing and giving evidence. And this bill will assist the Commission to put into place the most appropriate processes to hear the stories of those affected.


The bill will allow the Chair of the Commission, the Honourable Justice Peter McClellan AM, to authorise a fellow commissioner to hold a private session to receive information from victims and others affected by child sexual abuse. A traditional Royal Commission hearing setting will not generally serve as the best way to facilitate participation in the Royal Commission by those people affected by child sexual abuse.


For many, telling their story will be deeply personal and traumatic. While we cannot know at this time how many people will wish to participate, sadly we know that this crime has affected many in our community.


In order to carry out its inquiry, the private session mechanism will give the Royal Commission greater flexibility to directly hear from a potentially large number of people. Participants will not need to tell their accounts on oath or affirmation. These private sessions will not be open to the public and participation will be voluntary.


Acknowledging the distressing nature of these personal accounts, the Commissioners will be able to authorise support people to attend with witnesses giving information at a private session. Importantly, the Bill will also establish protections for those giving information at a private session. These protections are in essence the same as would apply when a witness is giving evidence at a hearing.


The second main purpose of the Bill is to enable the Chair of a Royal Commission to authorise one or more members to hold a hearing to take evidence. The Bill refers to this measure as an `authorised member hearing'. Currently under the Royal Commissions Act 1902 a hearing can only be held by the Commission as a whole or by a quorum.


In the case of multi-member Commissions, the proposed amendment will give a Chair Commissioner the means to efficiently distribute hearing workload where he or she is satisfied that this would be appropriate. This measure would have general application to Royal Commissions, including the Royal


Commission into Institutional Reponses to Child Sexual Abuse.


The Royal Commission must be thorough, but it must also move as quickly as possible to cover the masses of evidence, and personal stories, to help craft the necessary institutional reforms. This amendment will help to achieve that goal.


Child sexual abuse is a terrible crime. The Royal Commission will expose the far-reaching consequences of children affected by this abuse. It takes away the right of every child to grow up safe and happy. But as a community we have previously refused to face the fact that the systems and processes in place may not have only allowed this crime to occur in institutions where children should have been safe, but also assisted in making sure that the crime never came to light.


The Government cannot undo the past. It cannot take away the pain. But we can listen and we can bear witness. And, when the Royal Commission has completed its work, we can act to prevent these crimes and injustices from happening again.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2013-03-13,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (18:25):  I rise to speak to the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012, which amends the Fisheries Management Act 1991. The fishing industry, like so many other primary industries in this country, is vital to Australia's productivity, and it is an industry that the Gillard Labor government has neglected in its time in office. Senators Joyce and Williams would no doubt know that there has been a procession of agriculture ministers in the time of the Rudd and Gillard governments—five, I believe—which is an indication of the contempt in which Labor holds this very important industry.


As a South Australian senator, the fishing industry is very near and dear to my heart, and is a vital cog in the economic livelihood of my state. Just last month I visited Port Lincoln on the west coast of South Australia, and Robe on the south-east coast, with my colleague and shadow parliamentary secretary for fisheries and forestry, Senator Richard Colbeck. Port Lincoln is a major tuna fishing area situated on the southern tip of the Eyre Peninsula, and it has a successful aquaculture industry that farms tuna, yellowtail kingfish, abalone, mussels and oysters, and houses some of the biggest research and experimental farming areas in seahorses and spiny lobsters. Robe is renowned for its extensive shark and lobster fishing, all ecosystems very well managed by industry but, sadly, treated with contempt by government.


The debate on this bill gives me the perfect opportunity to discuss how successful Port Lincoln has become and how Labor's incompetence has harmed what is a very important industry in a state now technically in recession. Not only is Port Lincoln home to Makybe Diva, the winner of three Melbourne Cups, but it also boasts TIME Magazine's Best Invention of 2009: tank-bred tuna. Cleanseas developed the technology to enable bluefin tuna to spawn in captivity, and this has meant the entire lifecycle of southern bluefin tuna can be carried out in a commercial setting. This is unprecedented, which is why it was afforded such a prestigious honour in 2009.


The tuna industry is key to Port Lincoln, and the people involved are very conscious of putting back into the region to make sure that the locals and the town thrive. In fact, at least one in seven of the fishing town's 14,000 residents is employed by the $260 million fish industry alone. Speaking with the tuna industry I have found they have great concerns about the government and its lack of understanding of how they operate. This bill is a perfect example of that lack of understanding displayed by the two ministers whose portfolios impact this important industry: namely, Senator Ludwig and Minister Burke.


This bill looks to facilitate the implementation of electronic monitoring, or e-monitoring, in Commonwealth fisheries. That in itself would be a very good initiative if it were finalised and proven. This e-monitoring will now use new stereo video technology which at this point in time is unautomated. This industry has great concerns that this initiative will cause substantial husbandry and quota management problems in the Australian industry, but they do not feel that the government is listening to them or their concerns, which is something of a hallmark of this government. It is what we in the political sphere call an 'announce and defend' style of management. Whilst we all encourage the use of new technology to improve productivity, it is imperative that we listen to the industry. The ministers should listen to their industry. When I spoke to the industry they had serious concerns that the new technology was not ready to be used because it was not fully developed. 


The information collected through this e-monitoring is required by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, a very credible government authority—AFMA as we know it—to ensure those in the industry are following the rules and regulations. In the past this information has been gathered through logbook returns, vessel monitoring systems and independent AFMA observers on the ships. These new systems have been trialled, but they are not complete. It is vital that, if we are to roll out new technologies and put new systems in place to increase efficiencies and monitoring of the fishing industry, we make sure the new systems work and they do not inhibit productivity at a practical level. That just makes sense. From the tuna industry people I spoke to the message was strong that the Gillard Labor government is proposing a new system that is not better but will cost at least double what the current system costs. That has a familiar ring, Senator Williams.




Senator Williams:
  Yes, more cost and no benefit.




Senator EDWARDS:
  Yes Senator Williams. In the short term the government is again failing industry and business by not fully exploring technologies that work. It does not operate collaboratively with industries to ensure that it provides practical outcomes. The industry is happy to move into new ground and eager to have new technologies streamline their operations and the operation of the industry the world over, but they want the technologies simply to work. They do not currently work. 


We held a local industry forum with the number of attendees in the hundreds. All of the people I spoke to at the local industry forum were scathing of Minister Ludwig, questioning why he had dropped the ball on their issues. Like the mining tax and the carbon tax, this government is again providing problems and not a solution to take this country forward. This government is happy to take away our competitive advantage in complete isolation of the world business stage and the world industry stage and to place a burden on this vibrant industry that will prevent them putting back into a community such as Port Lincoln. It just seems somewhat ludicrous.


It is not just the tuna industry that has the issues. When it was known that we were in town, fishers came from everywhere to have their say on where this government was failing to help and in a lot of cases actually hindering their prosperity. It is no wonder that the ministers never venture into the regions where they overlay these legislative burdens; if they did, they would find out how palpable the views on this legislation are. 


The prawn industry has its issues. The abalone industry also raised concerns about the ridiculous red tape that is stifling their productivity and preventing them from achieving their true potential. The abalone industry has concerns about its viability—fancy that. This is a very much revered industry with a product which goes all over Asia. It is a high-value item, and they are worried about their viability. In fact, the Abalone Council of Australia met with Safe Work Australia because the workplace safety regulations were developed recently with no consultation with any commercial dive harvest organisation around Australia. That is right, no consultation. Quite reasonably, the Abalone Council appreciates the need for harmonisation of legislation around the country, but it is the height of arrogance not to consult them before implementing these changes. Regulations and legislation need to be workable for an industry to survive. The industry does not want the regulations removed—they want a safe work environment—but they do want to make the legislation workable and practical.


Marine parks were another serious concern for the industry. I have spoken numerous times in this chamber about the impact that both federal and state Labor marine parks regulations are having on both recreational and commercial fishers not only in South Australia but around the country. We on this side of the chamber know about the lack of consultation and unscientific designation of marine parks. The science is being held to account at numerous times by eminent scientists, yet the minister remains mute on any review for both recreational and commercial fishers. The fishers of Australia want more than anyone to ensure that the fishing environment in their region is sustainable, and to suggest otherwise is just mischievous. This is their livelihood or their recreation; it is their passion, and they want it to be there for the generations to come. The marine parks proposal has commercial fishers very concerned that they will be pushed closer to shore and on top of the recreational fishers, which pits fisher against fisher. That is hardly a result that any government would be looking at for an outcome. The fishers that I spoke with believe the government has not given this proper consideration and that the government has come up with a recipe for disaster. The industry was asking me why they have not seen or heard from Minister Ludwig or Minister Burke—again, announce and defend. Australia already imports more than 70 per cent of the seafood we consume. I think Senator Joyce said this morning that it is currently at 72 per cent. Under Labor's plan this will only grow. As recently as last Friday, I went to a supermarket freezer to try to buy some fish for the weekend, and I struggled to find anything that was grown or produced in Australia in that entire freezer compartment. Senator Back, you would know how distressing that would be for anybody who is looking to ensure that they support the Australian fishing industry. When you see a packet stating 'whiting' you would assume, if you were in South Australia, that it would be local whiting. But it said 'Product of Thailand'. That whiting is a bit different from the King George whiting that I have come to expect, know and love from my native South Australia. 


While the Gillard Labor government and Ministers Ludwig and Burke have failed to take into consideration the future need for seafood from a sustainable source, with the demand predicted to grow by 850,000 tonnes by 2020, I suggest that they are both paying lip service to this industry. They promote how wonderful and important the industry is—and rightly so—but their actions suggest otherwise. I would like to draw the attention of those opposite to the hypocrisy of their South Australian Labor colleagues when it comes to the fishing industry. Late last year, the South Australian Labor Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Gail Gago, said, 'South Australians are spoilt for home-grown choice.' In the lead-up to Christmas, Minister Gago encouraged South Australians to eat South Australian seafood, including 'a seafood platter gloriously piled with smoked salmon, marinated calamari and octopus, Spencer Gulf King Prawns.' She went on to explain the benefits of sourcing our food from within our state when she said, 'Buying local food and beverages supports our farmers and producers, which in turns helps generate income, create jobs, build our regions and boost the economy.' I agree with that, but if you are going to talk the talk you have to walk the walk. And when you are the minister for agriculture and fisheries you actually have to make the difference and ensure that these things come to hand.


On 11 February this year, the minister claimed that the South Australian government's strategic priority of premium food and wine was one of seven key areas on which the state government was focusing its efforts. And no doubt the federal government's food plan will equally promote Australia's premium food. Then, on 1 March 2013, at one of the state's premier tourism and sporting events, the Clipsal V8 race, guests in the South Australian government's own suite were offered fish. It was Queensland barramundi. There is nothing wrong with Queensland barramundi; however, I know that the aquaculture industry in South Australia is very successful in growing barramundi. I think that, if Minister Gago is going to talk the talk, she should walk the walk. Labor just do not get it. And, just as South Australian Labor are trying to promote South Australian seafood to the world, federal Labor are doing the same with Australian seafood—but they are both so hypocritical about it.




Senator Feeney:
  You bet we are!




Senator EDWARDS:
  It is good to see you are awake on the other side. Do you really want to push for more production offshore with these marine parks, Senator Feeney? Do you feel all warm and cosy about the fact that you are going to lock up one of the biggest marine park areas in the world? What you completely ignore is that all you are doing is pushing that fishing into unsustainable regions around us in the Asia-Pacific region.


While this bill looks to make changes to the closure of fisheries, the waiver of levies and the liability of corporations and other principles, Labor are missing the bigger picture. In the longer term, we need to look at freeing up the impasse that has come about with obtaining free trade agreements with China and South Korea. I have got your attention now, Senator Feeney, because surely you would also be disappointed with the progress that your government is making. I pointed out earlier today that our $1 billion a year beef trade is significantly disadvantaged in South Korea because we do not have an agreement and there has been no urgency to get an agreement—and we did not hear anything from the Minister for Foreign Affairs about this at all when he was asked in question time. To listen and to understand the issues facing the fishing industry was the main purpose of my visit around South Australia several weeks ago. As I pointed out to the locals, who confirmed my suspicions, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, and the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, have largely been absent from this region of Australia for a very long time. That is telling on Labor's attitude toward this industry, the country and the bush—given that Lincoln and Robe are the source of more than 60 per cent of the country's seafood. Rather than standing in the chamber postulating, I challenge the minister to get down there, talk to those fishermen and listen to them.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Edwards. You have certainly whetted our appetites for dinner tonight. I call Senator Back.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2013-03-13,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:44):  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. If I were relying on your fishing expertise I also would be lining up behind Senator Edwards. On the face of it, isn't it wonderful to be able to stand and actually support some amendments to legislation—in this case, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2012. So it was with some degree of enthusiasm that I also consulted members of the fishing industry, only to be told by one of them that the best way to describe this Labor government is as a CFZ—a consultation-free zone. Unfortunately, I pick up on the comments of my colleague Senator Edwards. The point he makes and that the fishers have made to me around Western Australia is that there has been a total lack of consultation with people who are highly skilled, who have enormous investment over long periods of time and whose families would normally have been looking to follow them into this industry, but consultation by Minister Ludwig and now Minister Burke really means dictation—being dictated to and picking up the pieces afterwards. 


Again, on the face of it, electronic monitoring in relation to Commonwealth fisheries is something to be applauded. When the time is right, when the technology is mature, if we are able to use it to actually improve surveillance and to reduce costs—heaven forbid that that might ever happen under a Labor government, in the sense that it may no longer be necessary to have the actual number of observers on vessels—of course it would be the subject of strong support. As a person who has spent some time working in the electronics industry, particularly in relation to auditing of high-value assets, I know the value of this technology—particularly, linking it to satellite, GPS and other technologies, the potential is there. But when I ask these people, 'To what extent have you been consulted? To what extent are you satisfied with the validity and the accuracy of data?' it all starts to fall apart. 


In the time available to me this evening, I would like to reflect, if I may, for a moment on an area of the industry that has been high value but is high risk, and that of course is the subantarctic fishing areas which are so valuable to Australia. It is tremendous to have this evening in the chamber with me my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald, who in his capacity as fisheries minister under the John Howard government actually applied in 2000 and afterwards a high level of protection to the waters fished by Australians in our economic exclusion zone. I also give credit, if I may, to our leader, Senator Abetz, who in his turn, I understand, was also involved here; and my predecessor, the then Customs minister Chris Ellison. Because of the work that they did, we got to the stage where we did actually have a high level of protection, particularly for those of our fishermen involved in the Patagonian toothfish industry. More particularly, listening to Senator Feeney, he is quite right about sustainability, but our government, Senator Feeney, is something unusual, something you would not know too much about: we actually did something about it. We protected our fishing industry and we protected that zone against the rapacious illegal fishing of that high-value product.


I said to my fishing colleagues the other day: 'Give me some idea of the value of this particular fishery.' They said: 'Well, Chris, they fish all year round, regardless of season, and 200 tonnes of Patagonian toothfish yields them some A$4 million.' Isn't that amazing? So of course I went looking and I started to examine whether or not this government had followed the lead of the Howard government and fisheries ministers Abetz and Macdonald to see what level of protection we now had for this economic zone and for our fishermen in the subantarctic area.


I immediately go to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, and it is all good news. The Australian government, it says on the website, 'takes the protection of its sovereign territories and assets very seriously'. It speaks about illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean, and it presents a great story about the Southern Ocean patrol vessel, Ocean Protector. I went on to read that, as a result of this excellence by the now Labor government, there is 'a level of surveillance', and 'apprehended vessels operating illegally in this remote area can expect to be apprehended'. Of course it goes on to speak about the involvement with France. And thank heavens France is involved—I will explain why in a moment. 



We are then told that in 2009-10 the government committed an additional 80 patrol days per year. It then went on to tell us that the Ocean Protector is available for operations 300 days per annum. Isn't this exciting! And it 'undertakes patrols in the Southern Ocean' and they are 'part of Australia's commitment to intercepting vessels and apprehending people suspected to be illegally fishing in ecologically fragile subantarctic waters'. I do not know whether Senator Feeney was in some way involved in the writing of this. We then went on to learn that they would be undertaking marine patrols for a minimum of 120 days per year in the Southern Ocean. Isn't this wonderful! The 'desired outcomes of the program are the protection of the Patagonian'—


Debate interrupted.

The fishers of Australia want more than anyone to ensure that the fishing environment in their region is sustainable, and to suggest otherwise is just mischievous. This is their livelihood or their recreation; it is their passion, and they want it to be there for the generations to come. The marine parks proposal has commercial fishers very concerned that they will be pushed closer to shore and on top of the recreational fishers, which pits fisher against fisher. That is hardly a result that any government would be looking at for an outcome. The fishers that I spoke with believe the government has not given this proper consideration and that the government has come up with a recipe for disaster. The industry was asking me why they have not seen or heard from Minister Ludwig or Minister Burke—again, announce and defend. Australia already imports more than 70 per cent of the seafood we consume. I think Senator Joyce said this morning that it is currently at 72 per cent. Under Labor's plan this will only grow. As recently as last Friday, I went to a supermarket freezer to try to buy some fish for the weekend, and I struggled to find anything that was grown or produced in Australia in that entire freezer compartment. Senator Back, you would know how distressing that would be for anybody who is looking to ensure that they support the Australian fishing industry. When you see a packet stating 'whiting' you would assume, if you were in South Australia, that it would be local whiting. But it said 'Product of Thailand'. That whiting is a bit different from the King George whiting that I have come to expect, know and love from my native South Australia. 


While the Gillard Labor government and Ministers Ludwig and Burke have failed to take into consideration the future need for seafood from a sustainable source, with the demand predicted to grow by 850,000 tonnes by 2020, I suggest that they are both paying lip service to this industry. They promote how wonderful and important the industry is—and rightly so—but their actions suggest otherwise. I would like to draw the attention of those opposite to the hypocrisy of their South Australian Labor colleagues when it comes to the fishing industry. Late last year, the South Australian Labor Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, Gail Gago, said, 'South Australians are spoilt for home-grown choice.' In the lead-up to Christmas, Minister Gago encouraged South Australians to eat South Australian seafood, including 'a seafood platter gloriously piled with smoked salmon, marinated calamari and octopus, Spencer Gulf King Prawns.' She went on to explain the benefits of sourcing our food from within our state when she said, 'Buying local food and beverages supports our farmers and producers, which in turns helps generate income, create jobs, build our regions and boost the economy.' I agree with that, but if you are going to talk the talk you have to walk the walk. And when you are the minister for agriculture and fisheries you actually have to make the difference and ensure that these things come to hand.


On 11 February this year, the minister claimed that the South Australian government's strategic priority of premium food and wine was one of seven key areas on which the state government was focusing its efforts. And no doubt the federal government's food plan will equally promote Australia's premium food. Then, on 1 March 2013, at one of the state's premier tourism and sporting events, the Clipsal V8 race, guests in the South Australian government's own suite were offered fish. It was Queensland barramundi. There is nothing wrong with Queensland barramundi; however, I know that the aquaculture industry in South Australia is very successful in growing barramundi. I think that, if Minister Gago is going to talk the talk, she should walk the walk. Labor just do not get it. And, just as South Australian Labor are trying to promote South Australian seafood to the world, federal Labor are doing the same with Australian seafood—but they are both so hypocritical about it.




Senator Feeney:
  You bet we are!




Senator EDWARDS:
  It is good to see you are awake on the other side. Do you really want to push for more production offshore with these marine parks, Senator Feeney? Do you feel all warm and cosy about the fact that you are going to lock up one of the biggest marine park areas in the world? What you completely ignore is that all you are doing is pushing that fishing into unsustainable regions around us in the Asia-Pacific region.


While this bill looks to make changes to the closure of fisheries, the waiver of levies and the liability of corporations and other principles, Labor are missing the bigger picture. In the longer term, we need to look at freeing up the impasse that has come about with obtaining free trade agreements with China and South Korea. I have got your attention now, Senator Feeney, because surely you would also be disappointed with the progress that your government is making. I pointed out earlier today that our $1 billion a year beef trade is significantly disadvantaged in South Korea because we do not have an agreement and there has been no urgency to get an agreement—and we did not hear anything from the Minister for Foreign Affairs about this at all when he was asked in question time. To listen and to understand the issues facing the fishing industry was the main purpose of my visit around South Australia several weeks ago. As I pointed out to the locals, who confirmed my suspicions, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, and the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, have largely been absent from this region of Australia for a very long time. That is telling on Labor's attitude toward this industry, the country and the bush—given that Lincoln and Robe are the source of more than 60 per cent of the country's seafood. Rather than standing in the chamber postulating, I challenge the minister to get down there, talk to those fishermen and listen to them.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Edwards. You have certainly whetted our appetites for dinner tonight. I call Senator Back.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:44):  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. If I were relying on your fishing expertise I also would be lining up behind Senator Edwards. On the face of it, isn't it wonderful to be able to stand and actually support some amendments to legislation—in this case, the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2012. So it was with some degree of enthusiasm that I also consulted members of the fishing industry, only to be told by one of them that the best way to describe this Labor government is as a CFZ—a consultation-free zone. Unfortunately, I pick up on the comments of my colleague Senator Edwards. The point he makes and that the fishers have made to me around Western Australia is that there has been a total lack of consultation with people who are highly skilled, who have enormous investment over long periods of time and whose families would normally have been looking to follow them into this industry, but consultation by Minister Ludwig and now Minister Burke really means dictation—being dictated to and picking up the pieces afterwards. 


Again, on the face of it, electronic monitoring in relation to Commonwealth fisheries is something to be applauded. When the time is right, when the technology is mature, if we are able to use it to actually improve surveillance and to reduce costs—heaven forbid that that might ever happen under a Labor government, in the sense that it may no longer be necessary to have the actual number of observers on vessels—of course it would be the subject of strong support. As a person who has spent some time working in the electronics industry, particularly in relation to auditing of high-value assets, I know the value of this technology—particularly, linking it to satellite, GPS and other technologies, the potential is there. But when I ask these people, 'To what extent have you been consulted? To what extent are you satisfied with the validity and the accuracy of data?' it all starts to fall apart. 


In the time available to me this evening, I would like to reflect, if I may, for a moment on an area of the industry that has been high value but is high risk, and that of course is the subantarctic fishing areas which are so valuable to Australia. It is tremendous to have this evening in the chamber with me my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald, who in his capacity as fisheries minister under the John Howard government actually applied in 2000 and afterwards a high level of protection to the waters fished by Australians in our economic exclusion zone. I also give credit, if I may, to our leader, Senator Abetz, who in his turn, I understand, was also involved here; and my predecessor, the then Customs minister Chris Ellison. Because of the work that they did, we got to the stage where we did actually have a high level of protection, particularly for those of our fishermen involved in the Patagonian toothfish industry. More particularly, listening to Senator Feeney, he is quite right about sustainability, but our government, Senator Feeney, is something unusual, something you would not know too much about: we actually did something about it. We protected our fishing industry and we protected that zone against the rapacious illegal fishing of that high-value product.


I said to my fishing colleagues the other day: 'Give me some idea of the value of this particular fishery.' They said: 'Well, Chris, they fish all year round, regardless of season, and 200 tonnes of Patagonian toothfish yields them some A$4 million.' Isn't that amazing? So of course I went looking and I started to examine whether or not this government had followed the lead of the Howard government and fisheries ministers Abetz and Macdonald to see what level of protection we now had for this economic zone and for our fishermen in the subantarctic area.


I immediately go to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, and it is all good news. The Australian government, it says on the website, 'takes the protection of its sovereign territories and assets very seriously'. It speaks about illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Southern Ocean, and it presents a great story about the Southern Ocean patrol vessel, Ocean Protector. I went on to read that, as a result of this excellence by the now Labor government, there is 'a level of surveillance', and 'apprehended vessels operating illegally in this remote area can expect to be apprehended'. Of course it goes on to speak about the involvement with France. And thank heavens France is involved—I will explain why in a moment. 



We are then told that in 2009-10 the government committed an additional 80 patrol days per year. It then went on to tell us that the Ocean Protector is available for operations 300 days per annum. Isn't this exciting! And it 'undertakes patrols in the Southern Ocean' and they are 'part of Australia's commitment to intercepting vessels and apprehending people suspected to be illegally fishing in ecologically fragile subantarctic waters'. I do not know whether Senator Feeney was in some way involved in the writing of this. We then went on to learn that they would be undertaking marine patrols for a minimum of 120 days per year in the Southern Ocean. Isn't this wonderful! The 'desired outcomes of the program are the protection of the Patagonian'—


Debate interrupted.

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (18:50):  I rise in tonight's adjournment debate to reflect on International Women's Day 2013 and some of the events that occurred to celebrate this important day.


Of course, as senators in this chamber would be aware, 2013 International Women's Day was celebrated on Friday, 8 March. Many here would have had an opportunity to attend the many and varied events that were held over the last week across Australia to celebrate the milestones and social, economic and political achievements and importantly to discuss challenges before us. There were many, many hundreds of International Women's Day events that were sponsored, organised and supported by schools, the corporate sector, trade unions, women's groups, governments and many other organisations and individuals.


International Women's Day can be traced back to the USA in February 1909 when the first National Women's Day was celebrated to honour women who had protested against working conditions in the garment industry the previous year. Since that time International Women's Day has developed a long and proud history of drawing attention to issues that affect women. Nationally and internationally, events to celebrate International Women's Day were held and, in Tasmania, there were also some wonderful local events taking place.


On Wednesday, 6 March, I was able to attend the annual International Women's Day Breakfast, along with hundreds of other women and a smattering of men—they are more than welcome—and the guest speaker was former Senator Natasha Stott Despoja. Natasha, as we would expect, gave a wonderful speech, both entertaining and heart-warming, with a strong message about discrimination and equality. As we know, Natasha Stott Despoja is an inspiration to women and plays an important role in public life through the media and her work in the mental health area.


I also attended the annual Unions Tasmania International Women's Day Quiz Night, which is an excellent event organised by the President of Unions Tasmania, Roz Madsen, and the Unions Tasmania Women's Committee. Again, it was an excellent turnout, with over 100 people in attendance. The money raised went to the bushfire appeal to assist local communities impacted by Tasmania's summer bushfires.


On that night I also had the pleasure of being able to present International Women's Day Awards, which Unions Tasmania awards each year. Of the many awards that were announced on the night, I would particularly like to congratulate Leanne Cohen from HACSU and Robyn McQueeney from the AMWU on receiving International Women's Day Awards in recognition of their work in support of the women's movement.


The theme for this year's International Women's Day is 'A promise is a promise: time for action to end violence against women.' Jenny Macklin, Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and Minister for Disability Reform, said on International Women's Day, when talking about what the theme was for this year:


And it is time.


Because we have seen too many tragedies recently.


In Pakistan, where 14 year old Malala was shot because she wanted to go to school.


In India, where the brutal rape of a young woman on a bus has acted as a catalyst for others to stand up and protest. And here in Melbourne, where the murder of Jill Meagher shocked our entire city.


UN figures show that 603 million women live in countries where violence against women is not considered a crime.


Sadly, in Australia, around one in three women have experienced physical violence and almost one in five have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15.


The government has implemented the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. It is a 12-year strategy, running from 2010 to 2022. The plan brings together governments from across Australia to make a real and sustained reduction in the levels of violence against women. It delivers an unprecedented focus on preventing violence by raising awareness and building respectful relationships in the next generation.


The national plan has been built from new evidence, based on research and extensive consultation with experts and the community. By working together we can challenge attitudes and behaviours that allow violence to occur and make it clear that all Australian governments say no to violence against women. To build upon this plan, the Prime Minister announced a new anti-slavery initiative, which seeks to eliminate slavery from Australia and overseas. Over the past decade more than 20 million people from around the world have been subject to forced labour, slavery and human trafficking. That is why we are implementing a whole-of-government strategy which improves procurement arrangements to assist in identifying and stamping out slavery.


As part of the federal Labor government's celebration of International Women's Day, my colleague the Minister for the Status of Women and member for Franklin, Julie Collins MP, travelled to New York to lead Australia's delegation at the 57th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. This is the world's main policymaking body, at which countries agree to set concrete recommendations to be implemented to improve gender equality. Whilst visiting the United States of America, Minister Collins also participated in a panel discussion in Washington, examining domestic and international initiatives aimed at improving gender equality and also attended the International Women of Courage Ceremony.


In conclusion, Mr Deputy President, as you can see, this year's International Women's Day was celebrated in a number of ways all over the world. The message remains the same, no matter what world events were held and that is that discrimination and violence against women and girls have no place in modern society and governments around the world must continue to work together and stand together to ensure that we eliminate violence against women and girls.


As the United Nations Women Executive Director, Michelle Bachelet, said in her 2013 International Women's Day Message:


… I join every individual who believes that change is possible. We are guided by a founding principle of the United Nations: the equal rights of men and women.


All around the world, our voices are rising, and silence and indifference are declining. Change is possible. And change is happening.
