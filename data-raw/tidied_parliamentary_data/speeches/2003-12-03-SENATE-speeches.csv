"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I would like to continue my remarks on the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 and the Age Discrimination (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2003. I had reached the point where I was highlighting another issue of concern for Labor members of the Senate committee inquiry into this bill. This was the omission in the legislation of sections dealing with age based harassment.
Unlike other Commonwealth anti-discrimination law, the bill does not prohibit harassment based on age. Harassment is an important issue and, if the government is serious about implementing a comprehensive anti age discrimination solution, then the legislation cannot reasonably fail to address harassment. This matter was of concern to Labor members of the Senate committee. As the department's information paper noted, the Northern Territory Anti-Discrimination Act 1992 includes such a prohibition against harassment in relation to age.
We in the Australian Labor Party believe that federal human rights legislation should embody the best protections against unlawful discrimination and that a prohibition on age based harassment would be useful in addressing what was drawn to the attention of the department as a significant problem in the workplace. Australian Lawyers for Human Rights also supported such a prohibition. They noted:
Failure to provide specific protection against harassment will force parties to re-argue what is already settled law in this country.
For many years harassment has been recognised as one of the major forms of discrimination, and the placing of such claims outside the reach of this legislation is both illogical and unwarranted. The denial of reasonable avenues of protection to those suffering age based harassment will undercut the fundamental basis for the introduction of this legislation. The decision not to address this issue is clear evidence, I believe, of a lack of courage on behalf of the government in relation to age based discrimination. The Labor senators on the committee made the recommendation that the bill be amended to include a specific prohibition on age based harassment. 
These factors represent a serious impediment to the ability of this legislation to offer real and effective protection against age discrimination to Australian citizens. The Australian Labor Party wishes to see anti age discrimination legislation passed but we believe that any such legislation should have the full and genuine commitment of the government—something which at present appears to be lacking. It is disappointing to see that the government does continue to struggle with human rights issues. The past and present actions of the government demonstrate that it does not consider human rights to be a matter of high importance. This dismissive attitude has been demonstrated on many occasions and, as I mentioned last night, is seen in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission legislation that is before this parliament at present. As I also mentioned last night, this measure, if it were to be enacted, combined with the 40 per cent reduction in HREOC's funding that has occurred since the Howard government came to office, would further undermine the ability of the commission to function effectively and, as a consequence, would significantly inhibit its ability to offer meaningful protection to Australian citizens against discriminatory behaviour and other human rights abuses. 
Although age discrimination is recognised as somewhat less contentious in nature than other forms of discrimination such as race and sex discrimination, this does not, in our opinion, warrant a soft legislative approach to the issue. It is important that any government response to age discrimination be a complete and inclusive one. The bill in its current form does not do this. It is a ship without sails. The weaknesses I have identified here today and also in my speech last night should be carefully considered by the government. They are issues that must be addressed in order to make this legislation better. The changes advocated by the Australian Labor Party are necessary to ensure the protection of Australians from age based discrimination and, if the government wishes to convince the Australian people of its earnestness in this regard, it must take action to amend the weaknesses in this bill.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-12-03,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this debate. It is worthwhile at this stage to recall exactly what the Age Discrimination Bill 2003 does. This bill implements the government's 2001 election commitment to develop national legislation prohibiting age discrimination. Despite existing state and territory laws, age discrimination is an increasingly significant problem for our society. The social and economic costs of age discrimination will only increase with demographic change in Australia. We cannot afford to ignore the important social and economic contribution that older and younger Australians make to the community. 
The bill was developed following extensive consultation with business and community groups. It has attracted wide support as a measure of fundamental importance in protecting older and younger Australians against age discrimination. It will prohibit unlawful discrimination in the area of employment and protect access to goods and services, including health and medical services, education and accommodation. It covers for the first time the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs. The bill strikes a careful balance between the need to eliminate unfair age discrimination and the need to permit legitimate age distinctions. It will play a key role in changing negative attitudes about older and younger Australians. It will remove barriers to work force participation. Capacity to do the job and not age will become the focus as the bill encourages attitudinal change regarding our ageing society. The community will benefit from the enhanced role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in promoting community awareness and attitudinal change and in conciliating age discrimination complaints. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee considered the bill and issued its report on 18 September this year. I thank the members of the committee for the work they did and note that the committee commented very favourably on the extensive consultation process which informed the development of this bill. It noted that there was wide support for the bill. 
I would like to reiterate briefly the government's response to the five recommendations which were made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. Firstly, the committee recommended that the scope of the dominant reason test in clause 16 be further defined and the clause amended to specify who bears the onus of proof in establishing the dominant reason for discrimination. The government does not consider that the recommended amendments are necessary. In the area of age discrimination, action should be unlawful only where age is the dominant consideration. It is the government's view that this test would be most appropriate to promote the attitudinal changes it seeks to achieve. The bill, including clause 16, is designed to send a clear message that age stereotyping is unacceptable, without suggesting that age can never be a relevant consideration.
The committee's second recommendation was that the government consider expanding the workplace relations exemption in subclause 39(8) to cover industrial agreements made under state law. The case for such an expansion has not been made out. The current exemption covers federal agreements. In the federal sphere the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the Employment Advocate must have regard for the need to eliminate discrimination, including age discrimination. State industrial relations arrangements vary between jurisdictions. Some states make no mention of antidiscrimination provisions or the need to eliminate age discrimination. The Commonwealth cannot be confident that all state arrangements deal with the potential for age discrimination.
The committee's third recommendation was to amend clause 15, which effectively defines indirect discrimination to specify what factors must be taken into account when considering whether action is reasonable in the circumstances. Action that is reasonable cannot constitute indirect discrimination. Inclusion, however, of a list of matters to be taken into account in determining what is reasonable, as in the Sex Discrimination Act, could result in a more restrictive interpretation. There is likely to be a wide range of reasonable circumstances in relation to age discrimination. The explanatory memorandum identifies some of these. The bill needs to be flexible enough to cover all such circumstances. As the proposed amendment would not work to that end it is not supported by the government.
The committee's fourth recommendation is that the government consider whether the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission requires additional funding. The government's general position is that agencies are not provided with new resources for functions that can and should be absorbed in the normal process of adjusting priorities as circumstances change. The commission receives a total budget to deal with the entire spread of its responsibilities, not separate budgets for particular areas of discrimination. Age discrimination already falls within the commission's broader education and inquiry function. The government is still considering the 2003-04 budget for the commission.
The committee's fifth and final recommendation was to extend the concept of age discrimination to cover an aggrieved person's relative or associate. A case for an extension of the legislation to this area of public life has not been made out. The report's case for new provisions covering discrimination on the grounds of the age of a person's associate appear for the moment to rest on less compelling grounds. The government accordingly is not minded to support that recommendation. 
I note that the opposition and Democrats will be moving amendments at the committee stage and I will reserve my comments for that stage. The government is committed to implementing its election commitment to develop national legislation prohibiting age discrimination. This bill fulfils that election commitment and I commend the bill to the Senate.

Ordered that consideration of these bills in Committee of the Whole be made an order of the day for a later hour.",SENATE,<title>AGE DISCRIMINATION BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-12-03,"—The motion is not agreed to. This is a motion which has no validity. The government is trying to ram through this parliament, on the second last day of sitting, an obnoxious piece of legislation which cuts back the right of all Australians in an open democracy to not be treated as people in a police state. The ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is police state legislation.
I note that the government has put itself in the position of saying, `We don't have an excuse for bringing this motion forward in this way but we'll try to fox the Senate anyway.' When you look at the text of the motion put forward by the government, you will see that it is totally specious. The reason given by the government for rushing this bill on is a one- or two-sentence cursory thumbing of the nose at the Senate. One expects that these exemptions from the cut-off are going to have force; they are going to have logic; and they are going to have content. But none of those things is contained in the reason given to the Senate.
The reason for the cut-off, I will remind the Senate, is that it gives the opportunity to have important legislation taken to the Australian people and experts in the community. I do not think there is anybody in this place who can argue that this is not important legislation. What we are voting on now denies the Australian public, the law community, non-government organisations such as Amnesty International, the Australian Council of Civil Liberties, Liberty Victoria, QCs and people concerned about human, civil and political rights right across the field the opportunity to have a say and inform we their representatives so that the debate can properly be undertaken. It says, `Let's ram this through so that we can go home for Christmas.' It is presumably supported by Labor, because it voted down the motion yesterday for this legislation to be sent to a committee. 
But when we do ram this through, and Labor will be part of the problem here, we will go home for Christmas with a piece of legislation which says, `When it comes to people being arrested and detained secretly, whether it be done legally or illegally for the purposes of questioning about terrorism by ASIO, that is a matter that cannot be discussed in the Australian community. It is a matter that cannot be discussed by politicians in the Australian community; it is a matter that cannot be discussed by journalists in the Australian community; it is a matter that cannot be discussed by lawyers in the Australian community, because if you do you face a five-year jail sentence.' Imagine that. Who is going to argue that that is not police state legislation? 
As I pointed out yesterday, this legislation cuts right across what is expected in an open Australian democracy which is based on the free flow of information. Where you have to be most careful about this is where you are dealing with secret agencies—in this case, ASIO. What Labor is going to support here today is a Howard government concocted—an Attorney-General Ruddock concocted—piece of legislation which cuts right across those expected norms which cannot be breached in a democratic society.
The very last component of this legislation is to remove parliamentary review. I remember Senator Faulkner fighting for that very strongly. But what it says is, `No, parliament can't review this either. We'll tie the hands of parliament—if you don't mind. We're going to remove the clause fought for by Labor in June this year which says it's up to the parliament to ask for a review of the workings of this piece of legislation, which allows citizens to be taken off the street, held secretly for seven days and questioned in blocks of some hours even when it's known that they are innocent and have done nothing wrong.' That was the argument—remember? That was the legislation that went through. But it is important that we have a review when you are giving a secret service agency the ability to do that to innocent Australian citizens. Now what we get in this piece of legislation removes the parliamentary review capability.
So there is a lot to be debated, and it will be debated. The Greens will be circulating amendments which oppose almost every clause of this bill; and I presume that the Labor Party will be joining the government in supporting almost every clause of this bill—in fact, the whole lot. There has not been a squeak out of Labor on this. It is a remarkable failure by the Labor Party to stand up for democratic rights and liberties in this country, and it is a very stupid piece of politics by the Labor Party as well. As soon as we come back from the short Christmas break we are going to have another piece of legislation in here from Attorney-General Ruddock and endorsed by Prime Minister Howard to further cut the rights of 20 million Australian citizens as they crank up the fear factor in the run to the next election.
We heard yesterday from the alternative prime minister, the new Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, that he is going to be strong on terrorism—just as the Greens are strong on terrorism and every other party is strong on terrorism. But the implication is different—that is, he means the Blair direction, the `Third Way', which says, `Yes, we'll follow George Bush in truncating democracy and liberty on the altar of a politics which uses fear as a means of winning at the ballot box.' Certainly we have to make sure that we have the intelligence capacity and the policing capacity to maximise our national security and the security of every Australian against terrorists. Nobody is going to dispute that. Where the dispute comes is over how much you give away in the name of the fight against terrorism—as against real terrorism—of what you are defending, of what you are fighting for. It is the rule of law; this bill cuts the rule of law. It is the rule of democracy; this bill truncates that. It is the rule of the rights of the individual; this bill cuts right across that.
But here is Labor saying: `Oh, goodness, we're frightened of what the Howard government is going to do to us in the run to the election. We will give up at the first staging post. We will collapse when it comes to defending ourselves and this country from another erosion of rights.' For what? What has happened since last June? The arrest of Mr Brigitte and the questioning of his associates was done outside of this bill; it was not used. The minister says so. We know it was not used. But they come in here and say: `We want to review this bill. It has to have stronger measures built into it.' When you look into the second reading speech from Attorney-General Ruddock to try to find out why, because the bill has not been used—the draconian infringements that this Senate passed in June have not been implemented; there has not been a test of them—this is what you find. Let me paraphrase what Attorney-General Ruddock said: `Well, no, ASIO has not asked for this, ASIS has not asked for this, ONA did not ask for this. I told them I want stronger measures. I have told the bureaucracy to bring up stronger measures because it is a political winner for the Howard government and because Labor will fall for it.' That is what is happening today. 
So here we have a motion which says, `We'll ram this through the parliament today without reference to the community.' Across the board we are getting very strong submissions from experts in this field who say: `Don't do this. You must at least give an opportunity for community input on this piece of legislation.' Labor voted that down yesterday. They said: `No, we won't have an inquiry. The crossbenchers might want that, but we're not the watchdogs of this and we don't communicate with the community on something that we are frightened of politically.' So today we have a move to treat this legislation differently from a suite of social innovations that the government has on its legislative list and differently from a whole tranche of other pieces of legislation. This one is urgent. This one has to be exempted from the normal process of review—that is, from time given to the Senate so that all senators can go to their communities or receive submissions from them, even if there is no inquiry, and be properly informed. There is none of that. Labor are going to join the coalition; Latham is going to join Howard in ramming this draconian piece of legislation through this parliament today because it is politically expedient for both sides. What an appalling situation that is from this government and from this opposition.
When the bill comes on very shortly, as it will, we will have our amendments ready, and the government had better have their answers ready. One of the questions I will be asking the government is: what does this do concerning we members of parliament speaking up about mistreatment in the application of these laws to citizens? Are we going to be muzzled in here? Does this law reach into this parliament and say, `If you, as a member of parliament, report on what ASIO is doing with citizens, you are at risk of prosecution under this law'? Does this law override parliamentary privilege? Is the minister—who is not in his place and not listening at the moment—going to answer that one? I will be putting that question to him in the course of the debate. If Labor does not care, the Greens do. We want answers to that. If Labor has made up its mind before asking questions like that, we have not. If the government thinks questions like that should not be asked, they will be, and it is up to the government to give answers. I will want those reassurances amongst many others in the course of that debate.
This is a heinous piece of legislation. The politics of it are awesome and awful. I would have thought the opposition—which at least put in a vigorous debate on the last piece of legislation, which this amends and makes much more draconian—would have at least wanted to be informed and to give space to the community to have an input into this legislation, rather than voting for this motion.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I will deal with the merits of the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 later. I totally reject the view that Senator Brown has put, that this is heinous legislation—it is not. I do not accept the view that has been put in relation to the motivations for this legislation coming forward. It is possible, as Senator Brown has suggested, that in time further legislation will come before the parliament—in this case driven out of the Attorney-General's or the Prime Minister's office—which might have some of the concerns that Senator Brown has addressed in his contribution. My attitude to all these things is to deal with each piece of legislation that comes forward on its merits. That is what the opposition have done in relation to this legislation. As always, we have dealt with the matters on their merits.  
This bill has received the unanimous support of the Labor caucus. I do not believe the motivations for this bill have been political motivations driven out of the office of the Attorney-General or the office of the Prime Minister. I have been assured—and I accept those assurances—that the need for this legislation has been recommended by the Director-General of ASIO. I am also pleased to say that this legislation is limited to technical amendments to close loopholes that were discovered by ASIO during and after the Willie Brigitte incident. 
ASIO, as they have gone about their important work, have discovered some loopholes in their new laws when questioning people about terrorism, especially when those people are foreign nationals. So the amendments before the parliament are technical in nature and are aimed at closing those loopholes. Most of these amendments should have been made law last year but, unfortunately, at the time the government's motivation was very different to what I think the motivation has been behind this legislation. It was busy playing politics with the then ASIO bill, rather than doing what any responsible government should have been doing—keeping a weather eye out for potential loopholes in proposed laws, particularly in relation to issues such as those arising with passports held by foreigners who were being questioned. 
To address that issue: Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be aware that one amendment in this bill will introduce new offences for failing to surrender a passport or leaving the country after being notified of the issuing of a warrant. This is plain commonsense if there is a foreign national whom the authorities need to question. It is plain commonsense. People who have important information regarding terrorism cannot be allowed either to slip out of the country or to avoid questioning. This is an obvious flaw in the legislation. It should not have arisen in the first place. It is there. We have a responsibility in the parliament to address it. 
The amendments close a loophole in the new questioning regime in relation to interpreters. A prescribed authority can, if needed, extend the questioning time where an interpreter is used to a maximum of 48 hours—that is, allow for six eight-hour blocks of questioning rather than three eight-hour blocks of questioning. The amendments do not extend the maximum period of detention for questioning. They do not limit access to legal advice or change the very strong safeguards that the Senate—and the opposition, in particular—insisted on in earlier debate. 
Another amendment changes the non-disclosure provisions to cover a wider range of information and people. These new laws will mean that, after 28 days, a person could reveal that the warrant had been issued and they had been questioned by ASIO, but they could not reveal the contents of the questioning until after two years. When a person is being questioned, they still have their lawyer present and, of course, questioning will be supervised by a senior judge. So the person being questioned still retains important legal rights. What will be curtailed is the capacity of a person to blab to anyone or everyone about what they were being questioned about. Again, I say that this is a sensible change, a sensible proposal. ASIO and the police cannot operate to protect Australia if these investigations are in the media every day. 
As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, highfalutin rhetoric often happens in the chamber. Some would say you have even been guilty of it yourself at times—I certainly have.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Inadvertently.
—That is in the eye of the beholder. I will take your word for it; thousands would not. It is important to remember that these secrecy provisions being proposed in this legislation are less stringent than those of other organisations responsible for the investigation of criminal activity. It is important to place that on the record. Crime commissions, courts and royal commissions all have the power to impose secrecy on their investigations or proceedings.
In fact, I want to remind the Senate and anyone else who is listening to this debate, though I am sure the ratings are not very high, that when the previous ASIO legislation was debated—and it was a very controversial piece of legislation—Labor supported stronger secrecy provisions applying to the subject of the warrant and their lawyer. Our unsuccessful amendment at that time would have made it an offence to disclose anything about the questioning under the warrant for an indefinite period. I think that the government has finally caught up with those concerns that the opposition had when the debate occurred around the ASIO bill last year and earlier this year.
There is a fourth category of amendments that goes to removing any doubt about the ability of the prescribed authority to give directions consistent with questioning warrants, including in relation to detention. Again, this is a technical amendment being made out of abundant caution. It is not intended to, and will not, alter the powers of the prescribed authority. That is the substance of the issues arising from the legislation that will come before the chamber if the Senate agrees to this exemption proposed by the minister.
Of course, it is proper that a government justify the case for urgency in such a situation. There has been some criticism—and, frankly, I think it has been fair criticism—about the statement of reasons justifying the need for the bill. The statement is very brief. It says:
Purpose of the Bill
The bill will amend the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 to refine ASIO's intelligence collection capabilities relating to terrorism offences.
Reasons for Urgency
The bill is designed to address practical issues that have been identified in the context of implementing ASIO's new powers relating to terrorism offences. Failure to take urgent action could detract from Australia's counter-terrorism capability.
That is all well and good as far as it goes, but it is a very cursory justification from the government. I think the government could have done a great deal better in putting its case. The case here is a strong one and, when such a flimsy argument is put forward, it inevitably raises concerns among senators in the chamber. I do not doubt that it will raise concerns more broadly in the community too.
For its part, the opposition has taken the opportunity to question officers of the Attorney-General's Department and senior officials and the Director-General of ASIO about the background to, and reasons for, these proposed amendments to the ASIO legislation. It is not right that—as Senator Brown has said—these changes, if agreed to by the parliament, will not be subject to review. They will be subject to the existing review and sunset provisions which Labor ensured were put into the original bill. They will be subject to that review, as they should be subject to that review. 
But the case for urgency is this. The question of balance on these issues is always a difficult one for people of goodwill to address. The late time in the parliamentary sittings period at which this bill has been introduced means that there is not an opportunity for an adequate Senate committee process. I am not going to stand up here in the Senate and say that there is. The point that has been made in relation to that is correct.
Here is a very blunt choice, if you like, for the Senate. We can have a full Senate committee inquiry into these changes, and this legislation can come back some time early in the new year. I think that Senator Brown, in a motion he proposed, suggested late March 2004. That is an option, and a serious option, for the Senate to consider. On the other hand, given that certain technical weaknesses have been identified by ASIO, the relevant agency, in a regime and in provisions that have been agreed to by this Senate, we can address those concerns, because of the sensitivities in these matters and because we are dealing here with national security interests, which ought to be an absolute priority, if not the highest priority, for senators in this chamber to consider.
There is a balance here. One choice is to fix these technical problems, and fix them now, so that inquiries into sensitive matters of national security are not impeded over the next few months because of those flaws in the original legislation brought into this parliament by the government—fix those technical flaws identified by the relevant agencies concerned. The other choice is to have a full committee inquiry into the proposed changes.
There are arguments both ways. I would have preferred an opportunity—I think all senators would; I would even hope that the government would have preferred it—for us to have a thorough committee investigation. But it is a stark choice. When presented with that choice, we thought, at the end of the day, that it was a no-brainer. We have to fix these technical flaws in this bill. They are technical flaws; they are not matters of substance. They are loopholes in the law that have been discovered effectively as a result of questioning that has come about from the Willie Brigitte incident. It is a no-brainer; it is sure. It is a question that we have to address—to have an inquiry or to fix the laws. The federal parliamentary Labor Party came very quickly to a very clear and unanimous view: we have to fix these technical problems with the law, and we have to do it urgently—we have to do it now. That is why the opposition will be supporting the exemption motion before the chair.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,2,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-12-03,"—There is a horrible sense of deja vu in what we are dealing with here this morning. As I said in a speech yesterday, this time last year the Senate was faced with very much the same political dynamic, which I have described as emotional and political pressure from the government in a form of wedge politics to try and create difficulties, principally for the opposition, while at the same time the government is giving itself its continued agenda and platform to promote what it sees as the war on terror and what it sees as a political strength—its pursuit of mechanisms to address the war on terror. 
I agree with Senator Faulkner that the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is not as heinous or as draconian as the original suite of bills in the ASIO legislation that we were confronted with this time last year. I agree with that, and I dismiss much of the hyperbole that there has been around this legislation. Having said that, there are elements of concern which have been expressed by some constituents in community groups, which we Democrats share and which I believe are strong enough to warrant the proposal that this legislation not be urgent.
That is the motion that we are dealing with. The motion by the government that the bill not be exempt from the cut-off is just another way of saying that this bill will be rushed. We do not believe this bill ought to be rushed. As a spokesperson on this issue for my party, I am placed in an extraordinary situation in that, having been offered a briefing from the Attorney-General's office on this legislation, I now find, although the briefing has yet to happen, that the legislation may well be debated—we may well begin speeches on the second reading—in a matter of moments. Without having had the opportunity to ask some questions and get further information and put some questions to the Attorney-General's Department, we now find that we are almost in the thick of debate on the legislation itself. That is no way to form legislation and it is no way to go about proper governance.
I fail to see the urgency in this. In question time yesterday, I asked a question of Senator Ellison, representing the Attorney, as to how the operation of the ASIO legislation has been conducted since its implementation. I asked how many warrants had been issued and how many people had been detained and questioned. Just a few moments ago, the minister informally explained to me that the answer he gave yesterday was in part wrong. A little later this morning, he is going to take an opportunity to correct the record and explain where he was wrong. I do not want to be too harsh on the minister for that. I understand that he is representing the Attorney—he is not the Attorney himself—that the issues can be complex and that it is unreasonable to expect all representative ministers to be across all briefs in question time. But it does concern me that the Minister for Justice and Customs is not fully aware of or properly briefed on the operations of ASIO.
We need to take time to consider this. There is, in my view, no urgency. We have heard Senator Faulkner, in part, say that ASIO or the authorities have discovered, and the government has been alerted to, technical difficulties in the bill. I am yet to be convinced of that. As we have heard, notwithstanding the mixed messages thus far from Senator Ellison, at least up until the week prior to 8 November this year there has been no detention or questioning of people under the existing laws. If it is the case that all of these technical difficulties suddenly arose out of one incident—that of Mr Willie Brigitte—then I think we need to take time to consider more thoroughly what the consequences of that might be and why they were not considered in the first round of debate, parliamentary scrutiny and Senate committee scrutiny on the original legislation.
Let us just go through briefly what I would describe as the six key points in the proposed legislation. Firstly, the bill aims to double the amount of time during which a person can be questioned if that person requires an interpreter because he or she does not speak fluent English or has a physical disability. I would say at first glance that that does not seem unreasonable. But there have been legitimate community concerns raised as to whether that would impose undue unfairness on those people from non-English-speaking backgrounds. It raises the question of whether, directly or indirectly, the passage of that particular proposed amendment or change to the bill would focus unfairly on people of Middle Eastern background and those of Arabic-speaking countries. Senator Nettle put the notion that in her view this aspect of the bill was a breach of article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I am not certain if she is correct on that point, but I do believe that it should be tested and challenged and that we should have a proper debate and discussion about that before rushing into it. 
The second point of the bill would require a person who is subject to questioning to surrender any passports in their possession or control, regardless of whether the passports are Australian or foreign. Again, that does not strike me as unreasonable, but I would want to hear some independent views on that before forming a strong position on it. The third point of the bill would oblige the director-general to return any surrendered passports as soon as practicable after the expiration of the warrant. Again, that seems to me perfectly reasonable. The fourth point of the bill would make it an offence for a person to leave Australia without the permission of the director-general while a warrant is in force. Again, at face value that does not strike me as unreasonable.
The fifth point of the bill would enable the prescribed authority, before whom a questioning is being conducted, to order the immediate detention of a person without first obtaining the written approval of the minister. That does concern me because it seems that that removes the role and responsibility of parliamentary oversight. It worries me because it places in the hands of a public servant—a senior public servant, nonetheless—some extraordinary powers which I think are best kept within the purview of parliamentary oversight and, in particular, the Attorney-General.
Finally, the last point of the bill would create new offences relating to the primary or secondary disclosure of information regarding warrants or operational information associated with ASIO. These offences carry strict liability. They apply whether the disclosure is made in Australia or overseas. Again I am most deeply concerned about that aspect of the legislation. It is my view that if we are going to go down that path then it must be expressly, explicitly and specifically clear that such information would be primarily or secondarily disclosed—if it was leaked or got out in some way—deliberately, maliciously and in a calculated way. People who might inadvertently, accidentally or unwittingly divulge information under this proposed amendment would not be caught up with criminal sanctions and be faced with criminal prosecution.
There are other issues in terms of freedom of speech, notwithstanding that freedom of speech is not absolute and comes also with a responsibility. But senators would be aware that there have been a number of opinion pieces from academics and human rights lawyers who have raised the question or made the claim that this would wrongly capture politicians who may raise concerns about inappropriate warrants or inappropriate detention or journalists who may do similarly.
For those reasons I think we ought to approach this legislation with cool heads, sensibly and calmly, and to not rush it through on what is the second last day of the very last sitting week. We should not rush it through without the crossbenchers, and others who want to, having had the opportunity to seek and be provided with a comprehensive briefing from the Attorney. We should not rush it through without the non-government members having had the opportunity to have a good think about it, to produce what they would argue would be their better speeches on the second reading and to produce and circulate any amendments that may be considered required. As a party we feel that some of this legislation is not unreasonable—but we seek further briefings on that—while other aspects of it are deeply concerning to us and we would seek to amend and/or oppose. 
In closing I reiterate that this is, I think, another piece of politics from the government rather than policy. This is another opportunity for the opposition and the crossbenches to insist that the government provide appropriate time and briefings over the break so that we can return to Canberra in February next year and produce quality, sensible, considered legislation which has the faith of the community. That is important, too. If for no other reason, if this legislation is rushed through today, those individuals and community groups who have raised what they consider to be legitimate concerns will have been utterly dismissed. It feeds into the conspiracy that some people have about the unfettered power of parliament and/or ASIO in dealing with, disseminating and making use of this legislation. We need to make certain that those people, whether they are right or wrong, are heard and have an opportunity for their views to be put. Where such people raise these concerns and they are wrong, ill-founded or misguided, where possible time should be taken to explain to those people that their views are wrong—and they perhaps could be brought on board to support what might at the end of day be better and fairer legislation.
There is no rush. We should not panic and push this through. The technical points—some of which I would argue are not technical but go beyond that—are not so critical or so urgent that we must make clumsy, hasty decisions that so fundamentally affect the human rights and civil liberties of citizens. As a party, we cannot support exemption from the cut-off. We believe that this legislation should be dealt with properly.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,2,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-12-03,"—The Greens have been strong supporters of not exempting bills from the cut-off, because not exempting them allows debate and discussion to occur with the community and in the Senate when we deal with legislation. This is a classic example of where we have heard from the community that they want to be involved in understanding what the government is proposing in the ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 with regard to increasing the powers of ASIO. 
Senator Greig spoke before me and said that he had some sense of deja vu because last year we were here debating the primary ASIO legislation that the government brought in. That was a slightly different scenario because at that time the opposition had decided to stand strong on these issues, to stand up for people's civil liberties and to maintain their stance of defending civil rights. That is not the situation that we are in today. This time last year, when the opposition made the choice to stand up for civil liberties, the government backed off and agreed to a range of amendments and safeguards, which we have heard Senator Faulkner speak much of in this chamber in the past. There is a lesson in that: there is benefit and value in standing strong and defending our civil liberties. Hopefully this cave-in that we are seeing from the opposition today is not a sign of things to come with the new Labor Party leader, Mr Latham.
One of the changes that the government did agree to when the opposition decided to stand strong was a review of this legislation. In the amendments that we are now seeing from the government there is a proposal to take away this capacity to review the legislation. This was one of the safeguards that Senator Faulkner has talked about at length and many times in this chamber and elsewhere, believing that it was one of the great victories that the opposition achieved when passing the most draconian legislation in the form of the ASIO bills. Yet, in this legislation, in which the government seeks to take away one of those safeguards that the opposition argued for, Senator Faulkner describes the amendments as `technical'. If at the time we were dealing with the ASIO legislation last year it was so fundamental for the opposition to draw a line in the sand and put in place these safeguards, why all of a sudden has that review of that legislation by the parliament become a technical matter and therefore this bill must be exempted from the cut-off, must not go to a committee for inquiry to hear from the community and must be passed with the support of the government and the opposition? 
Yesterday, when we debated the Greens' proposal to send this legislation off to a committee for inquiry, Senator Ludwig got up for the opposition and argued the case that this legislation has been ameliorated through the opposition's proposals. One of the examples he used in that debate was that a review of the legislation would occur in 2½ years. Perhaps Senator Ludwig had not read through to the end of the bill to find out that these amendments seek to take away that capacity to review the legislation. We have some sense of deja vu in debating this legislation again right at the end of the year, but we are not seeing senators stand up for civil liberties, which is what we should see in this parliament and we should expect to see that from people on this side of the chamber. It is left to the Greens, the Democrats and other crossbenchers to stand up for these civil liberties where we see the new, Mr Latham led opposition caving in to the government's demands in relation to increasing the powers of ASIO. The Greens will not be supporting this cut-off motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-12-03,"—At the outset, I will say that the government rejects Senator Brown's assertion that this is bad law and that there are political motives behind it. The ASIO Legislation Amendment Bill 2003 is urgent and necessary and comes as a result of advice from ASIO in relation to the exercise of its powers, which the parliament bestowed upon it only recently. The bill addresses urgent practical issues that have been identified in the context of implementing ASIO's new powers relating to terrorism offences, and that has been alluded to by the opposition. The proposed amendments clarify ASIO's existing powers, introduce necessary measures to further enhance terrorist investigations conducted by ASIO and protect those investigations from being compromised. The bill does not make fundamental changes to the legislative framework that governs ASIO's questioning and detention powers. Rather, the bill ensures that the powers that have been authorised by the parliament can be exercised appropriately and effectively. What it does is reinforce what the parliament passed only recently.
It is imperative that the bill be passed in this sitting period to give full effect to ASIO's existing powers. The recent Brigitte investigation has demonstrated the kinds of things that can arise unexpectedly. The government has brought these amendments forward only after serious consideration and in response to genuine concerns about the integrity and effectiveness of the new regime. Our objective is to ensure that ASIO has the necessary tools to do its job, and it would be irresponsible to leave this until parliament resumes next year. The opposition have alluded to the fact that the proposed amendments are practical. They have received a briefing from ASIO in relation to this and they are satisfied that that is the reason for them. There is no political motive whatsoever for these amendments. The motive is one of ensuring that ASIO can exercise its powers appropriately. 
Of course, the proposed amendments are directed at addressing practical issues. They will extend the questioning period when interpreters are used, minimise flight risk, clarify the powers of the prescribed authority and strengthen secrecy provisions. They are urgent because, as the Brigitte investigation demonstrates, you can have things emerge out of the blue and it is important that any shortcomings be rectified quickly. Our objective is to ensure that ASIO has the tools it needs to do its job.
The government will, as a matter of course, continue to monitor the adequacy and effectiveness of the legislation. To impute a motive other than that is not only wrong but spurious, and the government rejects Senator Brown's statements in that regard. When we debated the powers of ASIO when this was last before the Senate, we did not have the benefit of recent experience which we now have. That is the reason for the urgency we have today.
There is one aspect that I do want to bring to the Senate's attention. I have discussed this with Senator Greig and he mentioned it a short moment ago. Yesterday I advised the Senate that the Attorney-General had authorised the use of some of ASIO's powers in specific operations. The brief I had stated that other powers, including the ability to seek warrants to question or detain individuals, had not been used to date. That is what I advised the Senate. I would like to correct one aspect of that comment. ASIO has neither sought nor executed any warrants authorising the detention of any individuals pursuant to the new powers. I am able, however, to confirm that questioning warrants have recently been executed in relation to the Brigitte investigation. Of course, for operational reasons, I am unable to go into further detail in relation to what was transacted at those meetings or other aspects of ASIO's actions in relation to that investigation. That was an aspect I needed to clarify at the first available opportunity, and I was only made aware of that aspect this morning.
The bill that is before the Senate is important—it is important for operational reasons for the protection of Australia's national security. That is the reason for the exemption motion. It makes sense for it to be put whilst parliament is still sitting rather than wait for when we resume early in 2004, which is some time away. That would leave a gap for a period of time which would be just untenable—a gap in ASIO's ability to perform, which we could not, as a responsible government, contemplate. I commend the motion to the Senate.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-12-03,"—I table a revised supplementary memorandum and an additional supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments and requests for amendments to be moved to the Higher Education Support Bill 2003, and a correction to the explanatory memorandum. The memoranda were circulated in the chamber on 1 and 2 December. I also table a supplementary explanatory memorandum and an additional supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments and requests for amendments to be moved to the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The opposition will be opposing these amendments. These government amendments go to the objects of the act in terms of the principles of the bill outlined so far. The government's changes in recent times have been a moving feast. Given that amendments are now being tabled for the first time, you can understand why there might be some apprehension in regard to the opposition's view as to what the government intends to do. Essentially, we have alternative amendments with regard to the definition of higher education providers. We have made the point repeatedly that this bill fails to appreciate or reflect the nature or the standing of universities and their role in Australian society.
Those Independents who have signed up to a government package of measures ought to understand the consequences of their actions. What it boils down to is the future role of major public institutions in this country. These are things that should not be treated in a cavalier way as a result of a political sweetheart deal put together in back rooms in this building late at night in the final week of a parliamentary session. These are matters that go to some basic, core institutions in our society. I think we should remind ourselves that our universities are established under their own state acts of parliament, that they have traditionally been guaranteed autonomy and intellectual independence, that academic staff have intellectual freedom and that universities themselves have the right to determine what they teach.
In making these fundamental points, it is important that these provisions are actually written into legislation, and that is what our amendments would do. In my judgment, the government's amendments do not make those points in a way that could justify our confidence that a future Tory government will not seek to fundamentally redefine what it is to be a university in this country. What has been laid bare in recent weeks is the true philosophy of this government. When it comes to universities, they have a view that some public servants, working in conjunction with a minister who seems to have lost control of the debate within his own department, should have the power to intervene in the day-to-day running of universities.
These are not academic or abstract concepts; these are fundamental principles that ought to be articulated clearly in any legislation of this type, because we now know clearly what this government's intentions are. They may well have had to make some tactical retreats. The fact remains that they have spelt out what their attitudes are. The very fact that they could allow a bill of this type to be put on the floor of this chamber indicates how truly appalling their attitudes are.
This is a bill that should never have seen the light of day. It should never have been allowed out of the parliamentary draftsman's office. Either it is political incompetence on the part of this government or, as I said, it reflects their real agenda—to turn their backs on what is essentially 600 years of political debate in terms of the role of universities and to turn their minds back to the notion of a police state whereby public servants can pick and choose what is politically acceptable, what should and should not be taught, whether or not some persons are acceptable to work at university and whether or not the Commonwealth will fund what it regards as suitable for teaching in our universities. 
These are basic questions. This is not mere political rhetoric. These are as fundamental as the right to the freedom of the press. The fact that the government could produce a bill of this type suggests to me that this government has no right to call itself a Liberal government. It has abandoned that fundamental principle of a democratic society. As far as I am concerned, these are issues that we cannot simply turn aside from. The criticism that we raise is heartfelt. As a consequence, we will be pressing our amendments, and we call on this chamber to acknowledge its responsibilities and not be subject to some sweetheart deal that undermines these fundamental principles.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-12-03,"—On behalf of the Democrats, I indicate that, like the opposition, we are opposed to the government amendments that have been moved. Like the opposition, we have an amendment that goes to the issue of the reorganisation of the lists of higher education providers, or indeed the definition of what constitutes a higher education provider. I will try to constrain my comments as much as I can in relation to each amendment because I know that there are many. For many of the reasons outlined by Senator Carr, we are very keen to ensure that the notion of public funding of universities and what constitutes a university—those liberal, democratic and enlightened elements to which Senator Carr referred—are enshrined in the legislation.
I have mentioned that it is going to be a long debate and that there are many amendments. I want to give a very brief overview of what the Australian Democrats will seek to do in this debate. I suspect that Senator Carr mirrors somewhat the despondency that some of us are feeling today in that we know a number of our amendments, which we think are worthy and appropriate, are not going to receive the majority support of the chamber. But it is important that they are moved and possibly debated, because this legislation is fundamentally flawed and requires not only scrutiny and analysis but also amendment. 
We will seek to change some of the more regressive aspects of this legislation in the FEE-HELP provisions and the real interest rate, the thresholds, and the coercive tying of workplace practices and governance to additional funding for universities. We will address the issue of indexation, the issue of university autonomy and—indeed, in the amendments that we are talking about and foreshadowing now in relation to what constitutes a university—the powers of a university and its autonomy. All of these are contained within the amendments that the Democrats will be moving today. In addition to that, the issues of privacy, accountability and the student learning entitlement will be addressed by our amendments, and we will continue to proceed with those amendments even, unfortunately in some cases, where it looks like they will not receive support for the reason that Senator Carr has outlined, and that is that there seems to have been an agreement on a majority of the government amendments before us.
We will not be supporting the first set of the amendments put forward by the government, preferring our own amendment that deals with the issue of defining what constitutes a higher education provider and, specifically, public universities and public institutions—the institutions that are in receipt of taxpayer funds, which are public money. We will also seek to enshrine in this legislation, if it becomes an act, what the role, functions and powers of a university are, because I think that has been lost in this debate. I will tell you something else that has been lost in this debate, and that is recognition of the needs and the dreams of current and aspiring students. I look forward to the debate on fees and charges because I believe the bottom line of this debate today has to be whether or not poor kids can get into universities. That is why the amendments we are foreshadowing now and the ones we are debating relate so importantly to the issue of public funding, because that is what ensures accessibility and equity in our higher education institutions.

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-12-03,"—I will be speaking about the issue of private providers, but let me say from the outset that the Greens, like the two speakers previously from the opposition and the Democrats, are concerned about the future of public education in this country. The amendments being brought into the chamber by the government, and the agreements that they have reached with Independent senators, will damage the future of public education and higher education in this country. The government will do this through a raft of measures, which we will go into in detail in this debate, but what is fundamental to the drive for this legislation is the government seeking to remove itself from the responsibility of funding the higher education sector. This raft of amendments that we are about to debate has as its primary focus the shifting of the responsibility for funding higher education from the government onto the shoulders of students and their families. We will see throughout this legislation an emphasis on the government removing itself from the responsibility of funding higher education in this country and encouraging people to be engaged in a form of privatisation of the higher education sector. That is what we will see throughout these amendments.
This first set of amendments about recognising the value of our public higher education institutions goes to this issue of the privatisation and the encouragement for private companies to run institutions that will compete against our public universities. The government fails to recognise the value of the comprehensive education that is available in Australian universities. This bill constantly refers to higher education providers as if there were no difference between an English diploma school being run above a shop in a main street in any part of suburban Australia and, for example, the University of New South Wales. This is a deliberate measure by the government in line with its clear ideology of uncoupling the Commonwealth from the business—and that is how they see it: as a business—of running tertiary education in this country.
Under the bill as proposed, the minister acquires new powers to bring some 80-odd private providers of higher education into direct competition with our public universities by extending elements of the funding stream to those private providers. These providers do not provide the breadth of services that are part of a traditional university's role. If the government has its way, they will be competing on a very uneven playing field with comprehensive, tertiary higher education institutions. The private providers the government is seeking to extend public funding to are those like the ones the government extended the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to last year: the Christian Heritage College and the Tabor College—Christian colleges that seek to limit enrolments to people with particular religious beliefs. 
There are a multitude of language colleges that offer streamlined courses with little or no opportunity for students to be involved in broader student life. Whilst some of these may provide comprehensive learning experiences, they do not come close to what the public understand to be a public university. Each time the funds appropriated in these bills find their way to such a provider, it is money that is lost to our public universities and ultimately a blow to the quality of our public education system. 
This is not the future that the Greens want to see, and we believe it is not the future the community wants to see. This has been the strong message to the Senate inquiry that travelled around the country hearing from local communities and people involved in the higher education sector. The Greens will not be supporting this push of amendments from the government. We will continue in this debate to advocate for public education and the responsibility of government to fund our public education institutions—our universities—properly, rather than trying to shovel people and public funds into private providers of education. That simply cannot and will not provide the same comprehensive education opportunities as Australia's public universities do.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-12-03,"—I rise to comment on this legislation at the committee stage. With respect to the senators who have already spoken, not one has raised the significant issue of the consultation with the vice-chancellors of the universities that will come under this legislation. Therein lies the difference in the approach between the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens and the three Independents and One Nation. We have formed a balanced opinion in relation to this legislation, but a balanced opinion that may not necessarily deliver all that each different sector is requesting—that is, the university vice-chancellors, the academic staff, the postgraduate students and the undergraduates. All these sectors have differing ideas about this legislation. One Nation has been very careful to ensure that the outcome is a balance of the needs of all of those sectors rather than just a focus on having this bill defeated. It has been to that end that One Nation, along with Senator Lees, Senator Murphy and Senator Harradine, has been discussing with the government ways to achieve that. It is somewhat hypocritical, particularly of the Labor Party and the Democrats, to stand in this chamber and say that sweetheart deals have been done.
—I don't think I said that, Len.
—I withdraw the reference to the Democrats, but the Labor Party definitely implied that sweetheart deals had been done.
I have a philosophy that people who live in glass houses should not throw stones. Yet that is exactly what happens in this Senate when a bill comes forward that the Labor Party are generally in support of. We have only to look at the antiterrorism legislation that was recently passed by this chamber. I am not saying that the Labor Party totally supported it—there were issues that they probably disagreed with—but, on the balance of the legislation, they did agree with the government. So why is it acceptable in some cases for the Labor Party—and obviously in some cases the Democrats where they have agreed with the government—to sit down and come to a balanced opinion, yet when it is done by One Nation, Senator Murphy, Senator Harradine and Senator Lees all of a sudden it is not acceptable? I call that hypocrisy. 
The legislation will progress through this chamber based on the debate in this chamber. There are issues on which we have not agreed with the government and, if that agreement is not successfully orchestrated in this chamber, I for one will not vote for the legislation. I have said that all the way through the progression of this legislation. I have been very honest with the government. One Nation's support or opposition to this legislation clearly rests on the debate in this chamber—and that is where it should be. We ought not come into this chamber with fixed positions that have actually been orchestrated in a party room. The debate in this chamber should be where legislation is finally assessed for its benefit or its detriment to the states that we represent—and I emphasise that it is to the states that we represent, not the parties that we belong to. That is One Nation's position. It has been very clearly orchestrated and laid out to the government that One Nation's support for this legislation is wholly dependent upon how this bill forms in this chamber.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-12-03,"—Senator Harris has provided us with a remarkable insight into the way in which this parliament works. I never cease to be amazed by One Nation's views on how the political process works. I think that insight ought to be used for the benefit of some of our political science students as perhaps a primer on the views of One Nation and how those views have been used. One Nation talked about its consultation with the vice-chancellors and implied that no-one else had talks with the vice-chancellors and, for that matter, that the vice-chancellors have a united view on these questions or that they have a particular view on the specific clauses before the committee at the moment. I would defy you to produce a vice-chancellor who would turn their back on the principles that I have articulated here today or, for that matter, the clauses outlined by the opposition. I ask you, since you have had these extensive orchestrations—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Please address your remarks through the chair, Senator Carr.
—I ask the good senator to explain to us in terms of the orchestration and the discussion he refers to where in the amendment that I presume he is proposing to support there is reference to free and open inquiry, for instance? We are talking about what a university does. I presume, from what he has said, that he is supporting a government amendment that does not include the words that our amendment does with regard to what a university actually does.
We say that, in terms of this particular bill, a university should be identified with a reference to legislative protection for free and open inquiry or, for that matter, a reference to engagement with the community or with a commitment to academic freedom or, for that matter, legislative protection that so that a university is able to express controversial and unpopular opinions. It is an interesting concept that we see here—the nature of the way in which oppression occurs within academic freedom. It always starts on the basis of some ludicrous notion, as this minister has advanced, that some courses are unworthy of academic study. He will pick out some ludicrous concept such as cappuccino courses. It is only a matter of time before the government says, `We don't want you to teach this matter because it's not suitable,' and, `We don't think you should be having a looking at Marxist economics because that's not the sort of thing that is appropriate in this day and age.' After that, it is only a matter of time before there is a discussion on whether or not stem cell research should be undertaken. 
What is the thin end of the wedge when it comes to the question of freedom of academic opinion and the capacities of our public institutions to undertake their responsibilities to society? That is why we say that these provisions should be written into the bill—as it currently is; the act, as it will be. That is why we ask you, Senator Harris: does your commitment to the government exclude you from voting for such propositions? That is the reason I raised these issues in the terms I have raised them. What is the extent of your agreement with the government? You say that not all things are agreed, but I ask you this: are you entitled, under the terms of that agreement, to vote for these fundamental principles? We are waiting to see that. You say that you have reached a balanced position with the government, but it would be fascinating to see what the level of balance really is. I say these are basic principles that ought to be written into a piece of legislation, and I look forward to the argument that says that they should not be.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-12-03,"—I have to respond to Senator Carr's comments. I thought we could get on with the amendments but Senator Carr is simply not right in his allegations. Firstly, let us take the matter of the vice-chancellors. All those governance issues were issues that they took up with the minister. They were issues that they negotiated, worked through and got into a format that they, as vice-chancellors, were comfortable with. What the vice-chancellors want—I know they told this very clearly to the Senate committee and, indeed, I know that you are aware of it—and the prime thing that the universities want is for this Senate to work with government and get an agreement so that they can get what is now over $1.8 billion more money. The four of us—I speak on behalf of the Progressive Alliance; Senator Harris speaks for One Nation; and there are the two Independents from Tasmania—worked with the government to get this money flowing to universities in an acceptable form. It has taken a while because we had to work on a raft of issues, not just on this issue of governance.
Again, we hear about cappuccino courses, but that issue has been sorted out. Indeed, if Senator Carr reads through the amendments, he will see that in fact we have a better system than that which operates now. It has to be a disallowable instrument before the chamber, and there is a time line. The minister cannot step in in February and say, `Oh, I hear a course is starting up next week; I'm going to stop it.' It has to be done in the preceding year before the course is offered. Courses become available and students know what is available in April, and by about September they are starting to make concrete decisions. That is when the minister—he or she; hopefully she, one day—needs to put a disallowable instrument before both houses of parliament so that we will have an opportunity to have some say on it.
I say to other senators in the chamber that a number of the issues that the Greens and the Democrats have raised have been dealt with, are in our amendments and have been ticked off by the vice-chancellors as being workable, or have been looked at by the union. As we get through the legislation—and I will make these points in my speech in the third reading stage—we now have a package that is very different from the one that was originally put on the table. We cannot keep referring to the one that was originally on the table, as it is no longer on the table; it has been rewritten. So let us get on with the amendments step by step and, in the third reading stage, deal with where we are up to.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-12-03,"—In looking at the running order, I think that a number of amendments may inevitably collapse. For example, I think there are many similarities in the Democrat and opposition amendment in relation to objects of the act and our attempts to enshrine in the legislation these fundamental principles to which we have referred. I will put on the record very briefly to Senator Harris that I do not mind doing deals; I just object to bad deals. That is my problem with this legislation and with the impression, and certainly the information, that has been given about what has been agreed to. Based on the government amendments that are fast appearing before us, they do not seem to address my fundamental concerns, which are the issues of indexation and, more importantly, fees for students. There is no suggestion that it is inappropriate for you to talk to the government about these issues, but I was hoping that we would see some better amendments; hence my concern and despondency earlier. 
In relation to the balance, I think it is tipped very clearly in favour of perhaps one powerful group in the sector—that is, the vice-chancellors. In relation to consultation, I think the public needs to know that, with the amendments before us that will enshrine these principles, there is the issue of whether or not a minister can determine a course provided by a university. It is not an issue of a time frame—that they have a year to plan—rather it is the fundamental issue of intrusion into university autonomy. That is what we are trying to protect. That is why the Labor Party and the Democrat amendments seek to enshrine in legislation a commitment to free thought and inquiry, university independence, democracy and autonomy while, of course, allowing for accountability provisions.
In relation to consultation, these amendments have grown out of the consultative and comprehensive process that was a Senate inquiry participated in by Senators Carr, Tierney and Nettle and me and a number of other senators, and three of us are putting forward amendments that relate to the information that came through the consultative process. For the record, lest anyone think that I do not regularly meet and liaise with all groups in the sector, including the AVCC, I do. The very early and strong impression I got from vice-chancellors, not only their sector group but individually, was that they liked the amendments. They liked the amendments that enshrine university autonomy in the bill and they liked the language that we used.
In relation to the unanimity of the vice-chancellors, I have already put on record some of the comments that vice-chancellors have made to me. One from an outer metropolitan university said about the legislation, `This will kill us.' Another one said, `These are chocolate-coated euthanasia pills.' There are some grave concerns in the sector, and particularly among vice-chancellors, about this legislation. So let us not only enshrine in the bill this issue relating to higher education providers and public funding but also go on to discuss the objects and ensure that these definitions are in the act. Let us also ensure that what constitutes a university does not allow for the intrusions that the legislation currently allows for and that, indeed, the amendments put forward by the government would actually allow for.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-12-03,"—I want to address the issue of the need to listen to the concerns of vice-chancellors because, as other senators have articulated, all the senators in here dealing with this issue have on various occasions throughout the course of this discussion and public debate on the Higher Education Support Bill 2003 and the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2003 met with a whole range of different vice-chancellors and heard their concerns. I think that senators are very well aware of the concerns of vice-chancellors. Partly that is because the vice-chancellors are in a position at this time of year to be here in the gallery, listening to the debate and lobbying and letting senators know what their views are on these issues. 
That is not the same for all of the other people who are included in the higher education sector. For example, students at the moment are having their end-of-year exams or they are involved in other activities such as earning income to be able to fund their way through their university studies. Yes, it is important to listen to the views of vice-chancellors. It is equally important to listen to the views of the students and the staff, be they academic or general staff, who make up the higher education sector. There are going to be disagreements and agreements about the different positions that those sectors are putting forward. For example, the Greens do not agree with the position of the vice-chancellors that they should be able to deregulate university fees and charge students what they like for being able to study at universities. 
The Greens take a different position on that. We believe that higher education should be funded by the government rather than by individual students. We believe it should be funded through progressive taxation whereby people contribute, depending on what they earn, to pay for a service that is provided based on people's willingness to learn and engage in higher education. We do not agree with the vice-chancellors on that. But we have certainly heard the vice-chancellors' views and we are well aware that the vice-chancellors have argued, and continue to argue around this legislation, to be able to charge students greater fees for studying at universities. The Greens simply do not agree with that. We agree with what has been voiced by the students, who say that in this package the government is proposing to increase the amount of money that students need to pay in contributing to their higher education—an increase of half a billion dollars on what they are already paying. We do not believe that is appropriate. It is those concerns from the students that the Greens have been listening to and have been articulating in our debate and argument around these issues.
Equally, we have been listening to the concerns of academic and general staff who say that they want to be able to negotiate with their trade unions about the conditions that they face in universities. In considering the amendments we will be talking about the role of staff; where it is appropriate for staff, be they general or academic, they should be able to come together with their trade unions and say, `Let's bargain collectively for improved conditions in our workplace.' 
These are the sorts of voices the Greens agree with and listen to. We have heard all of the voices and we support a publicly funded higher education system that does not see the government pouring the costs of universities onto the shoulders of students and not allowing academic staff and general staff to engage in decision making at university or to engage in collectively bargaining for their workplace conditions. All of us are well aware of the arguments. People have chosen whether they want to listen to the deregulation arguments being put up by vice-chancellors or whether they want to listen to the views of students and academics about how to improve quality teaching and learning outcomes at university by taking away those financial barriers for students who want to be able to engage in the intellectual pursuit of knowledge that is possible in Australian universities. 
So we will continue to have this debate and we will continue to listen to the voices that advocate for a quality public higher education system in this country. They are not always the views of the vice-chancellors. The vice-chancellors have concerns and, on this particular issue that we are considering, regarding objects of the act, the Greens, the Democrats and the opposition all have proposals about universities being free and open places for the pursuit of knowledge, where universities do not feel constrained by the requirements of the government of the day about the sort of study that they can engage in and about the sort of research that they can be involved in. These are the reasons why we are putting forward other amendments which say that they should be free and open. University should be a place which can provide an independent social critique of a whole range of issues going on in our communities. They are issues that all of us have spoken about with vice-chancellors and we recognise that vice-chancellors value the capacity of universities to do that. That is the emphasis behind the amendments that we are putting up. This debate will continue and, having heard the voices of each along the way, senators will make decisions about those voices that they most clearly want to listen to in relation to industrial relations, student fees, the autonomy of universities, and a whole range of other issues.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I indicate that we will be dividing on this issue. We will not be dividing on everything in this debate because we know the deals have been done. But I think it needs to be clearly understood that what we are talking about here are some of the fundamentals regarding what it is to be a university. These are not simple matters to be dismissed lightly by some sort of patter about balance, about whether the vice-chancellors have been signed up to some arrangements. These are critical issues and I would like once again to ask senators, when they are casting a judgment about the preferred objects of the act, which of the documents before them is superior. If your deal means that you have to lock into the government irrespective of the written documents, so be it. But let us get that clear. There are issues here, such as the role of the university in society, academic freedom, the capacity to pursue controversial, unpopular issues and the freedom to regulate subject matter and content of courses without political interference. I do not buy this argument that we have some sort of special arrangement because we have a disallowable instrument in the Senate.
—It is not better to have politicians pick and choose what is taught at a university. It is wrong. No matter how you try to justify it, it is wrong for politicians to politicise what is taught at universities. That is essentially what you are asking us to accept—the politicisation of the subject matter taught at universities. That is not a position in which I find any great comfort.
Question put:

"Senator SANTORO,",LP,2003-12-03,"—I have spoken numerous times in this place on the issue of the Queensland government's appalling failure to meet its duty of care to children in that state who are in its care legally and, in some cases, physically. It is an unhappy topic. It is something that is painful for everyone to contemplate. But it is most of all painful for the children concerned that they should be so ill-served by the authorities as to be deprived of effective and caring management of cases and, even more painfully, that they are sometimes, it would seem, denied even a modicum of interest in their welfare.
The present situation in Queensland is as thorough an indictment of the Premier, of his former Minister for Families, Anna Bligh, now education minister and his apparently favoured heir apparent, and current families minister, Judy Spence, as one could imagine. Ms Bligh ignored warnings from two members of the Queensland legislature in 1999 about a specific case of sexual abuse that is horrific. I should note here that one of the members of the Legislative Assembly who provided information to the then minister was in fact a member of her own party and member of her own caucus.
The allegations were that the departmental officers were covering up longstanding abuse by members of one foster family but all she did was refer the allegations to the department. The present minister, Judy Spence, is the one who, this year, confronted with the horrible truth about her department's chronic underresourcing and consequent inability to act, quipped that she would call in some computer operators to get things going. 
The Premier, of course, played to the crowd with his Pontius Pilate act that—he thinks—always throws people off the scent. The Premier is supposed to know what is going on, especially in areas as sensitive and potentially ruinous of lives as allegations of sexual abuse in state funded foster family situations. It is funny—as in it is strange, and I believe unsettlingly so—that he always seems to know the good news, and generally claims it as his own, but never the bad. If caught out, if pressed, he will sometimes produce someone or something that proves he was kept in the dark. He has done that with the child abuse scandal. He referred it to the Crime and Misconduct Commission—on the face of it, the right thing to do. But the CMC, as I have stated previously in this place, is already busy looking at other parts of the Beattie empire that are not functioning properly. It is resourced on an annual budget basis—not for specific inquiries. It in no way reflects on the good officers of the CMC or the organisation's capacity to produce results within its limits. It is the CMC's limits that are the problem, not the CMC itself.
Queensland—and I suggest, in the overall context, Australia as a whole—is still waiting for leadership and action by Premier Beattie and his government. This week, in this place, we have heard strong arguments in favour of searching inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the so-called Heiner affair. This was the case where, confronted by the imminent threat of a case going to court, the cabinet of the former Goss Labor government in Queensland shredded documents it knew would be required as evidence if a case eventuated.
It is worth pausing there just for a moment to reflect that the Goss Labor government, just like the present Beattie Labor government, was highly adept at singing its own praises—and very keen to be heard doing so at every turn. Some of the more musically inclined of those in Queensland who observed this curious phenomenon aver that it was an a capella performance the like of which had never before been seen or, indeed, heard. The descants are said to have deafened critics whenever they were heard, which was often and widely. It is even said that such was the pitch of this chorus of self-praise that windows were apt to shatter from one end of the state to the other.
Unfortunately for Queensland and Queenslanders—leaving aside the fact that Goss Labor, just like Beattie Labor, while astonishingly good at looking as if it were doing things, was even more skilled at doing nothing and, when it thought it might be spotted in this frenetic inactivity, swiftly bound up in red tape anyone it suspected might have noticed that nothing was happening—the Goss government was not very good at anything much at all. It was astonishingly, almost criminally in my view, bad at managing children in state care, or those for whom the state had responsibility.
The Heiner case involved an inquiry by a magistrate into the alleged gang rape of a young teenage girl in state care. The inquiry established a body of evidence that said not only that this incident covered up but that institutionalised abuse—sexual and otherwise—was a frequent factor in the lives of many young people for whom the state had primary care. The remedy for this cruel situation is to be found in having an inquiry—indeed, a royal commission—in Queensland. Responsibility for taking children into care and caring for them in that environment as well as outside it is the job of a state government. It is the Queensland authorities who are culpable, it is from Queensland that answers must be sought and it is the Queensland jurisdiction that must mete out any penalties that are judged to be deserved. That is why I previously called in this place for a full and searching probe by a Queensland inquiry, and I am doing so again today.
That again comes down to leadership by the Premier, which is sadly lacking. These are very serious matters. There should be, and there probably are, some seriously compromised consciences over this whole horrible affair. There must be an accounting. It is 13 years since the painstaking work of Chief Magistrate Heiner went to the shredder. The moral outrage of that act has not diminished, nor should it have. The Heiner events point to a dreadful situation that breaks the heart of anyone who knows even half the story. Those who are responsible have escaped sanction thus far, and that is an utter disgrace. The cabinet ministers who agreed to or acquiesced in the destruction of the Heiner files are, by their actions, a disgrace themselves, collectively and individually. If they are not legally accountable, they are certainly morally so. There can be no half measures in condemning their conduct. 
I state plainly today to this chamber that I am deeply offended as a Queenslander that so heinous an injury was done to my state by a government that acted as it did solely because it found itself with a potato that was too hot to handle. I listened on Monday to the thoughtful speeches made by my Queensland colleagues Senator Harris and Senator Brandis. I deeply respect the points they made. I am as offended as they are by the travesty of the Heiner case, but we know where the remedy is to be found. It is to be found in Queensland. It is an intrastate matter and a matter for the Australian parliament by default. The default is the Premier's. For many years now I have had contact with Mr Kevin Lindeberg, a Queenslander who has single-mindedly pursued the hope of justice in relation to the shredding of the Heiner documents. For many years Mr Lindeberg has been a voice in the wilderness on this issue, and that is a very sad fact. He is to be commended for his energy in pursuit of the truth, for his patience and persistence and for his fortitude in pursuing this objective.
The facts are clear: the Goss Labor cabinet panicked and ordered the shredding of documents that it should instead have ordered to be preserved. The Beattie Labor government, in which ministers serve who were in the Goss cabinet that ordered the destruction of documents that might have become evidence, should insist on a proper inquiry being made. If heads have to roll all these years later, then so be it. Such an inquiry should in any event be much wider than just Heiner. We know that for years children in the care of the state in Queensland, in institutions or foster homes supposedly policed by the state Department of Families, have been the subject of horrific abuse. We know that the Beattie Labor government will not do anything about that in terms of making proper inquiries of those responsible and ensuring not only that such behaviour ceases forthwith but that anyone culpable is called to account, without a focused, forthright and relentless campaign to make this happen.
For evidence of the fact that, where the care of children at risk is concerned, Queensland's ship of state still lies firmly tied to the wharf, we need look no further than today's Courier-Mail newspaper. There is a headline on page 4 over a report written by that newspaper's family services writer, Margaret Wenham, that says, `Department shelves child abuse cases'. It did not add `again' or `still' or even `after all this time and all these promises' but it could have done so very usefully and very truthfully. Ms Wenham reports that thousands of child abuse cases are to be mothballed because of crippling workloads in most families department area offices. The Queensland Public Sector Union said that a meeting with senior management had resulted in an agreement that front-line family services officers could `unassign' cases with which they had no hope of dealing.
So there you have it: not only has the Beattie Labor government now caused the English language to be reinvented, as in `unassign', but also it has apparently `de-invented' the wheel where caring for at-risk children is concerned.
The report in this morning's newspaper is a shocking indictment of continued Beattie government inaction. That this inaction continues, apart from clouds of smoke and lots of mirrors, testifies to the complete inability of the Premier to control the functions of the government he heads. It might indicate something more; it might indicate that, despite all the claims he has made to the contrary, he actually is not too worried about the situation. That would be a travesty of responsibility for public administration. 
There is some evidence for drawing that conclusion in another story that is circulating today in both the Courier-Mail and the Bulletin magazine. It concerns the treatment of people with disabilities at a Bribie Island residential care lodge which apparently first surfaced in 2000 when neighbours videotaped a boy in a cage at the facility. According to the crime investigator Bob Bottom, who wrote the Bulletin magazine article, it was only the intervention of a federal disability agency which acted immediately—one of its own social workers reported the circumstances—that brought abuses of this type to a halt in June this year. No wonder the Bulletin headlined its report `The man who wasn't there' next to a picture of Premier Beattie looking pensive—caught out again, Peter—and over a subheading that read: `After being informed about a child-abuse scandal a year ago, Premier Peter Beattie promised action. So why was nothing done?'
The Premier of Queensland has a duty to tell people why he has done nothing. The Premier of Queensland must now come clean on why, after all the arm waving and the promises of action, nothing has been done that would have fixed the new problems revealed today in the media. If 400 cases in the high-demand Logan-Ipswich area alone have to be set aside, `unassigned', by families department staff, it is very clear that things are dreadfully wrong, and crystal clear that nothing of any significance has been done to put them right.
Let me summarise what this issue is all about. Clearly, ministers Bligh and Spence failed dismally in their responsibilities; clearly, they displayed administrative and moral failure. Clearly, the Premier, the leader of the state and the leader of the cabinet, similarly displayed and continues to display administrative and moral failure. As other senators have stated, when you compare the Premier's attitude towards calls for a royal commission—for a fair dinkum, well-resourced and well-focused inquiry—to his actions and his statements in relation to the Hollingworth case, you can see the hypocrisy reeking through his whole attitude, through his statements and through the inaction that are evident in this case.
Clearly the CMC, which I support and recognise as a very worthwhile and fair dinkum institution, has not got the resources to get to the bottom of the issue. When you look at what the Department of Families has had to do, as reported in the Courier-Mail today—that is, `unassign' hundreds of cases because of the workload—can you imagine the enormous resource strain that would be inflicted on the CMC if it had to look at each and every one of those cases, as a royal commission should do, in order to come up with some factually based conclusions and sensible recommendations?
Clearly, Mr Beattie and the Queensland government are failing in their duties. One of their most sacred duties as legislators and representatives is to look after children. I have often said that a society is judged on how it looks after three living things: older people, younger people and animals. In the main, they are at various times defenceless living beings in our society. They need at critical times the protection and the care of people who are charged with the giving of that protection and care. All I can say is that, when I look at what is happening in Queensland today in relation to young people, the government there is singularly failing in that sacred and essential duty of care. 
I am just going to keep getting up in this place and talking about these things until something cracks and something happens. It is essential that people like Bob Bottom, Margaret Wenham, Senator Harris, Senator Brandis and, I would hope, every decent senator in this place eventually see reality and action applied to their concerns in the state of Queensland. As with the ABC and SBS, this is an issue that I am not going to let go in this place. I place the Queensland Premier and his government on notice that there are many people in this place—on both sides and on the crossbenches, including the Independents and the Democrats—who will continue to pursue this issue until obscene headlines like the one in the Courier-Mail this morning, `Department shelves child abuse cases', stop appearing. I had thought of delivering a speech on this topic today, but I was not quite sure that I would be so determined to do so until my senior adviser asked me if I had seen today's headline in the Courier-Mail.

In light of the final report of the Young Carers Research Project by Carers Australia, is the minister aware that at least 388,800 carers are under the age of 26 and that 18,000 of these are primary carers? Given that there are so many young carers in Australia, why has the government taken no action in relation to the recommendations of the report?

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-12-03,"—Senator Denman comes from Tasmania—a state where the issue of the contributions of the state to people with disabilities is not as serious as it is in other states. I give credit to Tasmania for the way it is dealing with people with disabilities. Senator Denman most probably is not aware that some other states are not doing as well as Tasmania. Some of the issues she has raised are not issues for the Commonwealth. I know people get irritated when they hear federal members say there are issues which are state based, but some of the services to which Senator Denman refers are services which should be provided by the states. 
Day after day since I have been in this portfolio I have been reading about various services for the disabled being withdrawn—withdrawn in Victoria, withdrawn in Western Australia and withdrawn in New South Wales. Only today I came across the case of a young person who is being employed by a state Labor government to do some work for them. She said to me, `Senator, they promised to pay me, and they are not paying me.' So I am about to ring the minister for community services in that jurisdiction and tell them what they are doing.  
—Name them. 
—No. I have just met the person. I am going to raise the issue. The education minister might be aware of it but the person responsible may not be. I will give them a chance, because I am concerned about the individual—not about making grandstanding statements in here. Senator Denman needs to go and talk to the state ministers and get them to do something about people with a disability. It is the United Nations day for recognising people with disabilities and the challenges they face. 
—So you can't answer the question.
—I can answer the question. Day by day the states are withdrawing services for people with disabilities. Day by day I hear stories about the way the states are performing. Senator Denman needs to get the states to do something. Let us compare what this government has done and what Senator Newman did. We have done things that the Labor Party never did. We brought in a carers payment for people caring for children under 16 who previously did not get a carers payment. Where there were two children with a disability who did not on their own qualify their carer to receive a carers payment, we allowed the disability of those two children to be put together to entitle the person caring for them to get some benefit. They are the sorts of caring things this government has done. Labor needs to talk to its Labor mates in the states and urge them to get on and deliver services to people with disabilities.

—Minister, I would ask you to ignore the interjections. 
—we have provided carers with direct payments totalling almost $1.5 billion per annum. We have carers payments being made to approximately 76,000 customers at a cost of $700 million a year. Senator Denman raises the issue of young carers. That is an issue that this government has been concerned about. We are looking at those issues. If Senator Denman really cares about people with disabilities, she will go back to the states and get them focused on what they should be doing because they are withdrawing services at a rate of knots. I read it day by day in the newspapers. The states need to get on and do something about the things which they are responsible for and in which they are lagging behind. We have got nearly $1 billion more in funding under the agreements. We need to see the states doing what they should be doing.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2003-12-03,"—My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin. Will the minister advise the Senate of recent indicators of the strength of the Australian economy and how the government's responsible economic management is continuing to boost economic growth? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy: Growth</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2003-12-03,"—I thank Senator Lightfoot for that well-written question. Today's national accounts confirm the continuing strong performance of the Australian economy. The economy grew by no less than 1.2 per cent in the September quarter and 2.6 per cent during the year. That is our best quarterly growth figure since the December quarter 2001. It comes after the low figure of 0.3 per cent in the June quarter, which was affected by the war in Iraq, SARS and, of course, the drought. We have weathered that storm in June and the economy is roaring back to strong growth.
Exports of goods and services rose by 1½ per cent in the quarter, reflecting the recovery from the drought. Farm production rebounded by 17 per cent and private business investment was up 2.1 per cent. The gross operating surplus—which, as former Treasurer John Kerin now knows, is an indication of profitability in the economy—grew by two per cent in the quarter and 4.9 per cent throughout the year. These very good figures in today's national accounts show that we have come through very significant challenges early this year and returned to strong economic growth. We have continuing low inflation, solid company profits and very strong business investment.
These figures are consistent with the budget forecast for 2003-04 and will continue to put us very close to the top, if not at the top, of the growth league for the developed world. As I said earlier this week, these great economic outcomes are not the result of chance; they are the result of 20 years of economic reform led honourably by the former Hawke-Keating government with our support and continued by us in government. But we cannot assume that these good economic results will simply continue no matter what. They will only be continued if we have a government committed to ongoing economic reform and committed to making often tough decisions in the long-term national interest. For that reason, we on this side of the chamber welcome the comments from the newly elected opposition leader, Mr Latham, that he intends to be a positive contributor to policy development and economic growth and development. He stated that he will abandon the failed approach of his two predecessors and take a constructive, bipartisan approach rather than the opportunistic, obstructionist approach which has characterised the Labor Party for the last seven years.
We would like to give him some gratuitous advice and suggest that he might commence this process of bipartisanship by showing his commitment to sound economic reform. For example, he could agree to pass our legislation to contain the growth in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which those opposite know is running out of control. He could pass our reforms to the disability support pension to make sure that that is a sustainable program. He could help us by passing our unfair dismissal exemptions for small business; he could do something for small business in this country. He could support the full privatisation of Telstra, which those opposite know must and should happen. He could pass our higher education reform package so that we can make a big injection into higher education reform in this country. He could support our reforms to cross-media ownership laws. He could pass our MedicarePlus safety package with its safety net for all Australian families. He could reverse Labor's opposition to our reforms to international tax arrangements and reverse Labor's opposition to tax changes to encourage foreign workers to come to Australia and work and contribute to the Australian economy. He could reverse all this negativity which we have seen from the Labor Party. He could give reality to his statement that he will now support a positive, constructive program. He now has the opportunity to demonstrate his own economic reform credentials and his rejection of Labor's `just say no' mantra of the last seven years.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked by Senator Sherry today relating to superannuation.
The question I want to ask is: what happens to Australian workers' superannuation in the event of theft and fraud? What is not understood, I think, by a significant number of people in the Australian community is that in Australia when the nine per cent compulsory superannuation guarantee contributions are made they are not protected in respect of theft and fraud when their money has been stolen. 
Why is it important that there should be full protection in the event of theft and fraud of superannuation moneys? Firstly, superannuation is compulsory in Australia and, secondly, it is for retirement. Australians may have to wait for 30 or 40 years before they collect their money. If their money is stolen it can have a truly catastrophic impact on their retirement income and their retirement circumstances. 
There are a number of problems in respect of compensation and protection where superannuation is stolen in Australia. Firstly, if a business goes bankrupt or fails and an employer has not paid all their compulsory superannuation contributions, the employee loses them. There is no compensation. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer today outlined what she argued were solutions. They are not solutions. There is no compensation in the event of a business failure where superannuation contributions are outstanding—no contribution, not one cent.
The second area where we do not have full and complete compensation is in the event of theft and fraud. Again, it would probably surprise a lot of Australians listening to this debate that if their money is stolen from a superannuation fund there is not full and total compensation in those circumstances. In a similar set of circumstances, if the trustees who are responsible for the governance—the overseeing of the investment and the administration of moneys—are negligent, there is also a problem. If there is trustee negligence and they do not adhere to the superannuation industry supervision law which regulates superannuation, again, there is no compensation if the trustees are negligent in law.  
Another circumstance which I think would surprise many Australians is that if they reach the point of retirement and they decide to purchase a pension or an annuity—that is, an income stream product—with their superannuation, if the money is stolen from their pension or annuity product when they are in retirement, they may not be compensated. It depends on the type of pension or annuity product.
Labor takes a fundamental position of principle in this regard. In the case of theft and fraud or business failure or insolvency or in the case of trustee negligence or in the case of pension annuities when a person has retired, in those circumstances it is catastrophic for the individuals so affected—absolutely catastrophic. In respect of the compulsory superannuation guarantee, where an employer goes bankrupt, that is an employee entitlement. It is a statutory entitlement. Yet the government, whilst it protects some other statutory entitlements where an employer fails and a business goes under, will not protect and compensate the compulsory superannuation guarantee. The Liberal government has no solution. It does not believe that Australians should be protected and compensated in these circumstances, and the Labor Party would like to know why. Why aren't Australians deserving of full protection and compensation in respect of their superannuation in the circumstances that the minister was asked about today?
The Labor Party—and I am very proud of it—has released some 30 individual policies on simpler and safer super, and four of those policies go to the Labor Party committing itself to ensuring full compensation and full protection in the event of theft and fraud, trustee negligence, a business going under or becoming insolvent or a person's money being stolen from their retirement pension or annuity. The Labor Party will strengthen the security in retirement of Australians in the circumstances I have outlined. The Liberal Party is the do-nothing party. It does not want to do anything to protect Australians' superannuation.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-12-03,"—I welcome this opportunity to take part in this debate. I raised the question last night in the adjournment debate of the Labor Party's superannuation policies and the fact that they were fairly deficient in terms of detail. There were certainly lots of threats about increasing regulation, more funding was going to be thrown at the items and obviously more control. It is good to have this sort of debate in this chamber because superannuation is for the long term. In recent times the disappointing feature about the debates on superannuation has been the lack of bipartisanship. You will recall, Mr Deputy President, that during the years when Dawkins was Treasurer a lot of good things came in on superannuation which did attract bipartisan support. I hope that we can, under Mr Latham, get a return to what all Australians are seeking—bipartisanship.
One of Senator Sherry's very good policies was raising the standards for trustees. But what he is suggesting in terms of compensating for business failure is tantamount to lessening that responsibility of the trustees. As I said last night, there is a lot of internal inconsistency in the Labor Party's policies. That is the problem. I reminded the Senate last night that Senator Sherry was very good at borrowing systems from overseas. This 100 per cent recovery is one of them. In fact, I think it probably came from the USA's Employee Retirement Income Security Act 1974, often known as ERISA. This is where we get the idea of 100 per cent restitution of assets that are lost as a result of fraud et cetera. In such circumstances Australia has restitution but it is at 90 per cent, not 100 per cent. I remind the Senate that that system was not a resounding success in the US because it was underpinned by moral hazard and it stripped trustees of the responsibility to act prudently. That is the thrust of the problem that you are raising today. 
The other point, Senator Sherry, is that you are asking all those members of well-run super funds to make up for the recklessness of trustees who act negligently, who lose members' money. Already we have seen a reaction from some of the super fund members and trustees against being asked to make a contribution to fund the $30-odd million that currently has had to be repaid in accordance with the SIS Act provisions. I think you have to think a little more deeply unless you are going to change the policy and have the taxpayers at large funding this policy, in which case you will take it to another stage of irresponsibility.
I remind the Senate that the government has already provided additional funding for APRA. This is quite substantial. I reject completely Labor's assertions that the ATO has been unsuccessful in enforcing the superannuation guarantee. That just lacks factual support. In fact, I draw the Senate's attention to ASFA's director of policy research, Dr Michaela Anderson, who noted that the assertion that the ATO has not been successful in enforcing the collection of the nine per cent superannuation guarantee was a bit `puzzling'. We on this side of the Senate are certainly a little puzzled at Senator Sherry challenging that, particularly when it comes from an authority such as Michaela Anderson from ASFA. I believe it lacks substance. Senator Sherry, we ask you to put a little bit more flesh on those superannuation bones because you have to do better than just throwing more money and more regulation at the matter, with a lack of direction and focus. This is just too important to have broad, uncosted, unfunded policies in the manner you have suggested so far.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Superannuation</title>,Questions Without Notice,9,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I rise to speak on Senator Sherry's motion to take note of the answers given to his questions by Senator Coonan. Before I get to the substance of some of the answers given by the Assistant Treasurer, I want to make some comments about the contribution made just now by Senator Watson. Senator Watson called on Labor to show bipartisanship on the issue of superannuation and said `as we have in the past'—that is, as the government says it has in the past on the issue of superannuation. I remind the Senate—and any Australians who are interested in super should also listen to this—that this government when in opposition opposed the introduction of superannuation for working Australians. You opposed it, you did not show bipartisanship in what is one of the greatest achievements of Labor and that is to bring superannuation to ordinary working families. So do not stand here and lecture us about bipartisanship. Your support for superannuation is as lukewarm and hollow as your newfound support for Medicare.
In times past, the member for Bennelong described the superannuation system for ordinary working Australians, for which Senator Watson now urges us to engage in bipartisan support, `theft'. That is what he called the introduction of the superannuation guarantee system in Australia. He described it as `theft'. It is akin to some of his remarks on Medicare. We all know that the Prime Minister in his former life in opposition opposed the introduction of Medicare just as his party opposed the introduction of the superannuation system. So any rhetoric from the other side of the chamber urging bipartisanship should be met with some scepticism by those who are listening.
I want to turn briefly to the issue of lost superannuation. In Australia, we have some 25 million superannuation accounts, despite the fact that there are only nine million fund members and most people understand why that is the case. When people change jobs, they tend to also—unless they are working in the same industry—change superannuation accounts and employers will automatically open another account for them. For a range of reasons, Australians have not been particularly good at consolidating their accounts. For that reason, we have 4.6 million lost accounts in this country and some $7.3 billion in declared lost moneys. 
This is an enormous public policy issue because it effectively ensures that Australians have a number of accounts. It means that their balances in the most recent account are obviously reduced because they do not roll over, into that account, moneys that they have previously earned. In addition to the loss to the member, the maintenance of these accounts costs hundreds of millions of dollars a year in extra administration fees. What is the government doing about this issue? The answer is very little and the answers today by Senator Coonan, the Assistant Treasurer, demonstrated the government's inaction in this regard.
Since 1998-99 there has been an increase in lost moneys from $3.6 billion to over $7.3 billion—more than double. Under the last few years of this government, there has been over a doubling of the amount of money that is in lost accounts. Senator Coonan says, `The government's not responsible for that.' She runs away from the responsibility instead of looking at some of the parameters of their policies which prevent or fail to properly deal with the issue of lost superannuation. She simply runs away from it and says, `It's not our responsibility.' In fact, by some convoluted logic I think the minister suggested that the Labor Party was somehow responsible for lost superannuation. Somehow, we have contributed to Australians being disconnected from their super. It is an absurd argument.
What is needed is a policy such as Labor's—that is, for automatic consolidation to ensure that people with superannuation in previous accounts automatically have their money from their past accounts consolidated into their current active account when they change jobs. Obviously Labor's policy also indicates that if people want to keep more than one account, they can, they are free to do that, but this policy would ensure that the public policy problem we have at the moment in this country with billions of dollars in lost superannuation would be resolved.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2003-12-03,"—In rising to speak to this motion today, let me remind Senator Wong that although she has not been in this place for a long time, she does not know much about the bipartisanship that took place in the early days of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which Senator Watson was on for some 12 years and which I later joined and spent five years working with Senator Watson. In those early days, when we were in opposition and the Labor Party were in government there was a spirit of bipartisanship. The bipartisanship that existed in those days and the reports that we wrote, which in most cases were unanimous, helped to give us the world-class system that we have today.
It is only since 1996 and in more recent times that the bipartisanship that existed in the early nineties has been departed from by a Labor opposition that wants to put politics back into superannuation to try to gain some traction. In the early days of the select committee on superannuation, there was an extreme amount of bipartisanship. I know that because, for 7½ years prior to coming to this place, I worked in the superannuation industry and I understand some of the problems that confronted the industry at that time and some of the wrongs that were taking place. In fact, the bipartisanship and the bipartisan approach taken by the coalition in relation to matters dealing with superannuation and in setting up a framework, which we knew would be world-class, were very important. 
We heard Senator Sherry today try to explain certain points in his policy—which he calls `his policy'—which has taken some 7½ years to develop and which in fact delivers very little. After 7½ years, I would have thought that there would have been something much more comprehensive than that in any sort of superannuation policy. He talks about the recovery of moneys that might have been lost by theft or by fraud. What Senator Sherry would like us to do is to have a system that underwrites every action taken by trustees, paid for by other superannuation contributors. This will only encourage trustees to be less careful when they are making decisions in relation to the funds and the people who belong to those funds. Senator Sherry is saying that Australians who are in very responsible funds with responsible trustees will have to bail out the others. Quite frankly, I do not believe that 100 per cent recovery exists anywhere else in the world. That would tend to put trustees in a position where they do not have to be nearly as careful as they do when they are trying to make sure that the investments that they make on behalf of their fund members are both responsible and bring good returns.
When Senator Sherry asks a couple of questions in a row, nitpicking about the current government's attitude towards superannuation, what he overlooks is what this government has already done for superannuation, particularly in the initiatives that were announced by the government in A Better Superannuation System. The Labor Party fail to show any leadership at all. All Senator Sherry has ever done is to oppose and to criticise. When it came to reports from the select committee and when, in fact, the committee had looked into many issues that he wanted to raise, there was never any spirit of bipartisanship. A Better Superannuation System put forward by this government has already enhanced and will continue to enhance the overall attractiveness, the accessibility and the security of superannuation in this country. It builds on this government's outstanding achievement in retirement income policy.
Quite frankly, I think superannuation is one of the worst words that was ever invented; we should only ever talk about retirement incomes and retirement incomes policy. A Better Superannuation System further demonstrates this government's commitment to assist Australians to build some financial self-reliance for their retirement and in their retirement incomes. In the area of tax concessions, the concessions that are provided for superannuation make it the single largest tax expenditure item in the budget, amounting to approximately $11.2 billion in 2003-04. That is how important we think superannuation and retirement incomes policy are to this country. We are prepared to put our money where our mouth is when it comes to these matters.

"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I too rise to take note of the answers given to Senator Sherry by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan. For most Australians, superannuation is their most substantial asset after their family home. For some, it is equivalent to their family car; for others, it is indeed the most substantial asset they have. Superannuation is a compulsory long-term investment specifically directed at producing retirement income and is therefore unlike any other financial product. One thing I agree on with Senator Ferguson is that I too would much prefer to be talking about retirement income than using the word `superannuation', but that is the way it is. 
The loss of a person's superannuation can have a catastrophic impact on an individual's life in retirement, justifying a more vigorous degree of protection of superannuation products than that afforded to other investment products, but the Howard government shows little compassion for ordinary Australians who are suddenly confronted with hardship, those people who have had their dreams and aspirations for their retiring years shattered. The present compensation for losses of superannuation savings and earnings is limited to victims of theft and fraud. Unfortunately, theft and fraud are not the only causes of losses of superannuation savings. Losses can also occur when a business becomes insolvent and it has outstanding superannuation guarantee debts, or when the trustees have been negligent in managing the investments of a fund—in other words, when mismanaging other people's money.
In the wake of a small number of significant superannuation theft and fraud cases and continued reporting of serious losses to workers where failed businesses have not met their superannuation guarantee commitments, Labor believe that substantial improvements to the compensation regime are essential. Labor, of course, have always been the champions of superannuation and will continue to be. Minister Coonan's answer to Senator Sherry made it clear that she does not know the history of superannuation in Australia. In fact, it was Labor who introduced compulsory superannuation and it is only Labor who care about workers' superannuation interests.
Some of the substantial improvements Labor proposes include increasing the amount of compensation, which is presently subject to ministerial discretion, to fully cover losses. Labor also plans to expand the scope of the compensation legislation to go beyond losses for theft and fraud, as I have already outlined. It also proposes to protect post-retirement products, such as pensions and annuities. In addition, corresponding improvements to the regulatory system that are necessary to minimise losses in the first place will be implemented. These changes are outlined in Labor's policy document. Currently, compensation is financed by a levy on all superannuation funds. This arrangement will be continued and extended to cover the new matters qualifying for compensation. The cost to each member has been costed at less than $1 per year.
Theft and fraud in superannuation is in fact very rare. Until commercial trustee company Commercial Nominees Australia Ltd collapsed in 2001, the compensation provisions had not been activated. The collapse of CNAL left hundreds of fund members with little or no retirement income. Ordinary Australians who had saved and planned for a degree of comfort in their retirement years were hit with the catastrophic acknowledgement that they were now confronted with doing it tough in their retirement.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2003-12-03,"—I seek leave to make a short statement about a return to order which has not been delivered. 
Leave granted. 
—I thank you and the Senate. Page 47 of today's Notice Paper outlines the return to order, which was supported by the Senate, for two documents to be tabled on 29 October 2003. It is now over a month since then. I acknowledge that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, has done his best to obtain the papers that have been sought to be tabled. The two documents were prepared by the National Health and Medical Research Council. At least one of them was referred to by the leaders forum which took place in late August as being the basis upon which a decision was made by some of the states to abolish the protection given by the act for human embryos which have been developed after 2002. The decision by some states purports to enable researchers and experimenters to experiment on embryos which have been developed since that date. 
It is vital for the public to know the basis for that decision. One of the reasons the return to order was sought was to ensure that parliamentarians and the people of Australia are aware of the basis upon which these matters are determined. I understand that the Premier of New South Wales is not prepared to provide the relevant documents. That concerns me. It must concern all members of parliament who believe in parliamentary democracy and who believe in transparency, particularly when decisions, and the documents upon which basis those decisions are made, are secret. I seek guidance from the Leader of the Government here. It is obvious that, in response to his attempts, certain of the states thumbed their noses at him. Others have not. This matter is important. It is outlined on page 47 of today's Notice Paper. I wonder what the way forward is on this matter because it is now 3½ months since those documents were utilised.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2003-12-03,"—by leave—I understand the points being made by Senator Harradine. What we have said in the past is that COAG documents require the approval of all COAG ministers to be released. That creates a particular problem, at least in the first instance. It is a matter of courtesy rather than anything more concrete. If a state premier or state premiers refuse agreement to the release of a document, that could create the stalemate that Senator Harradine refers to. I think in such circumstances the matter should be referred back to the Prime Minister, who can consider whether he is able to release the document with the objection of a particular premier or premiers. On that basis I will take the matter back to the Prime Minister and seek further advice.",SENATE,<title>SCIENCE: ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,10,1,speech

At the end of the motion, add “and, in respect of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 and the Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2003, the provisions of the bills be referred to the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee for inquiry and report, together with the committee's inquiry into the exposure draft of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003”.
I will make some brief comments in relation to this amendment to the report. Essentially, it puts into effect an earlier reference that has occurred in relation to the exposure draft. That earlier reference specifically referred to the provisions of the draft Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 or any version thereof that the government might subsequently introduce into the parliament. Obviously these bills have subsequently been introduced into the parliament. Whilst they were not before the parliament when that earlier reference was made, this is consistent with that decision.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,12,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-12-03,"—I might say a very brief word in response. The reference of a piece of legislation to a references committee is not the usual way for legislation to proceed, but we recognise that from time to time the majority in this place choose to go to a references committee rather than a legislation committee for reasons that the majority come to. We understand that the Democrats will support the reference of the bills now that they have come into the parliament to this committee. Although we will not vote for it, we certainly will not oppose it.
However, I do understand that there is a proposal to extend the period of reporting for this committee. Notice has been given, and I presume we will be dealing with that tomorrow under normal circumstances. My understanding of the broad agreement that was made by the previous Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Abbott, was that he would refer these draft bills to this committee before they were introduced into the parliament and at an early date so that consideration by the committee could commence in a timely manner. The reporting period from when it was first referred to this references committee to when it should then report in February next year was a period of just under 20 weeks, which is an extraordinary length of time for bills to be considered by a committee. I do not have the statistics at hand, but I understand it would in fact equal the record of the Medicare package as one of the longest committee references in the history of parliament.
As I understand it, there was an agreement that that would be the process with the bills. We predicted that the bills would come to the parliament in the latter period of the sittings and that, therefore, the references committee could get ahead of the game and have the last six weeks to start doing their work and community consultation on those provisions. Now that the bills have arrived, we have a proposal put before us by the Labor Party, I think, that we extend that inquiry from reporting in February to reporting in May. I do not want to pre-empt debate on a motion we will probably debate tomorrow, but this is intrinsically linked to this proposal to refer the bills to the committee. It seems to me that the process proposed and, I thought, agreed to by the former minister has on the face of it been breached. I cannot see the reason for that. I guess I will have that explained to me by opposition and Democrat senators tomorrow. 
If the Senate refers these bills to the references committee today and extends the reporting date into May—and I really hope it does not—the Senate will probably not deal with the legislation until potentially June or beyond, depending on what budget week is like. Budget week is a short week and there are usually a whole range of other measures on the table. The effect will be that, at the very minimum, you will have ensured that these bills, which form a centrepiece of the government's proposals to reform the building and construction industries, are not available for consideration by the Senate as a whole for a period of 30 weeks, which I am absolutely certain will become the longest Senate inquiry into a piece of legislation in Australian history.
—Thirty weeks?
—The committee would then have had 30 weeks to deal with these bills. That is extraordinary. As I have said, I will not oppose the reference of the bills to this committee. The committee already has the provisions before it. It is appropriate, although it is against the government's protocol, which would say that they should go to a legislation committee. But I seriously ask the Senate to think about whether, if they are fair dinkum about being a house of review, they are making a mockery of the Senate's role as a house of review by referring provisions off for 30 weeks.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,Committees,12,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-12-03,"—As has been endlessly stated in this place when these matters were debated, the bills reflect just half of the 212 recommendations of the Cole royal commission and yet have an absolutely symbiotic relationship with those recommendations. Simply put, the bills had to go to a references committee because, as a workplace relations set of bills, they have to be put into perspective with all those other matters which deal with occupational health and safety, corporations law, criminal law, insolvency law, taxation law and various other whole-of-government issues which the government, in its immense wisdom, has decided not to put forward as a package despite the very strong recommendation, from my party in particular, that it does so. That is the first issue. There are a number of issues which are to be addressed and which are clearly matters of reference. So, for convenience, rather than running two inquiries—one legislation committee inquiry for the bills and one reference committee inquiry for all the other matters—the two are combined into a references committee inquiry. It is a perfectly logical and sensible decision that the Senate came to to deal with a matter like this.
The second point is that, when the draft bill was produced on 15 September, I rang the then minister, Mr Abbott, and said, `If you want those bills referred now, you had better do so straightaway. If you want to get those in and dealt with and examined by a committee as early as possible, you need to start at once.' Mr Abbott did not do so. It was not until very late in the piece—late in October—that the government came to me and said, `We are now ready for these bills to be referred.' Within four days, I had the reference before the Senate. The Senate then considered the matter and passed the reference. They then had to advertise the due date for submissions. It was impossible for hearings to commence earlier than December. The first of these hearings start in a very short time—next week. You then have to say, `What else would delay consideration of these matters?' Well, unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately for the people concerned in the industry—January is known as a builder's holiday. People involved in the industry—both from the employer's side and from the employee's side—are on holiday and are not available to interact with the Senate. And, of course, many of the senators are on holiday. 
The third thing that happened was that late in the piece we received the Senate agenda for next year and notification of when sittings would be held. The nature of this inquiry is such that it has to go to the affected states. These matters are of great concern in Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and New South Wales, and there is interest in the Northern Territory as well. Therefore the hearings had to be held out of sitting weeks; they could not be held in sitting weeks. That meant that we had to find time. The consequence of that is that a planned reporting date in February has had to be shifted out for the committee to do its work. I have made it very clear to both the committee and the public at large that I believe these bills have to be debated by the Senate and resolved prior to 30 June next year because the government has an agenda to put together a new institution with a great deal of money affected, and it would be wrong not to deal with it by then. The committee has come to the view that the earliest date for reporting would be early in May—I forget the exact date, but I think it is 11 May—and that gives plenty of time for the bills to be either rejected or amended in time for 30 June.
Whilst in theory you might be accurate in terms of weeks, Minister, the practical effect of the process is that it will take a great deal longer than it should have. If the government had been smart enough, brainy enough and far-sighted enough to produce a whole-of-government response to the Cole report and had produced all the bills—(Time expired)

The reporting period from when it was first referred to this references committee to when it should then report in February next year was a period of just under 20 weeks, which is an extraordinary length of time for bills to be considered by a committee. I do not have the statistics at hand, but I understand it would in fact equal the record of the Medicare package as one of the longest committee references in the history of parliament.
As I understand it, there was an agreement that that would be the process with the bills. We predicted that the bills would come to the parliament in the latter period of the sittings and that, therefore, the references committee could get ahead of the game and have the last six weeks to start doing their work and community consultation on those provisions. Now that the bills have arrived, we have a proposal put before us by the Labor Party, I think, that we extend that inquiry from reporting in February to reporting in May. I do not want to pre-empt debate on a motion we will probably debate tomorrow, but this is intrinsically linked to this proposal to refer the bills to the committee. It seems to me that the process proposed and, I thought, agreed to by the former minister has on the face of it been breached. I cannot see the reason for that. I guess I will have that explained to me by opposition and Democrat senators tomorrow. 
If the Senate refers these bills to the references committee today and extends the reporting date into May—and I really hope it does not—the Senate will probably not deal with the legislation until potentially June or beyond, depending on what budget week is like. Budget week is a short week and there are usually a whole range of other measures on the table. The effect will be that, at the very minimum, you will have ensured that these bills, which form a centrepiece of the government's proposals to reform the building and construction industries, are not available for consideration by the Senate as a whole for a period of 30 weeks, which I am absolutely certain will become the longest Senate inquiry into a piece of legislation in Australian history.
—Thirty weeks?
—The committee would then have had 30 weeks to deal with these bills. That is extraordinary. As I have said, I will not oppose the reference of the bills to this committee. The committee already has the provisions before it. It is appropriate, although it is against the government's protocol, which would say that they should go to a legislation committee. But I seriously ask the Senate to think about whether, if they are fair dinkum about being a house of review, they are making a mockery of the Senate's role as a house of review by referring provisions off for 30 weeks.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,12,2,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-12-03,"—As has been endlessly stated in this place when these matters were debated, the bills reflect just half of the 212 recommendations of the Cole royal commission and yet have an absolutely symbiotic relationship with those recommendations. Simply put, the bills had to go to a references committee because, as a workplace relations set of bills, they have to be put into perspective with all those other matters which deal with occupational health and safety, corporations law, criminal law, insolvency law, taxation law and various other whole-of-government issues which the government, in its immense wisdom, has decided not to put forward as a package despite the very strong recommendation, from my party in particular, that it does so. That is the first issue. There are a number of issues which are to be addressed and which are clearly matters of reference. So, for convenience, rather than running two inquiries—one legislation committee inquiry for the bills and one reference committee inquiry for all the other matters—the two are combined into a references committee inquiry. It is a perfectly logical and sensible decision that the Senate came to to deal with a matter like this.
The second point is that, when the draft bill was produced on 15 September, I rang the then minister, Mr Abbott, and said, `If you want those bills referred now, you had better do so straightaway. If you want to get those in and dealt with and examined by a committee as early as possible, you need to start at once.' Mr Abbott did not do so. It was not until very late in the piece—late in October—that the government came to me and said, `We are now ready for these bills to be referred.' Within four days, I had the reference before the Senate. The Senate then considered the matter and passed the reference. They then had to advertise the due date for submissions. It was impossible for hearings to commence earlier than December. The first of these hearings start in a very short time—next week. You then have to say, `What else would delay consideration of these matters?' Well, unfortunately—or perhaps fortunately for the people concerned in the industry—January is known as a builder's holiday. People involved in the industry—both from the employer's side and from the employee's side—are on holiday and are not available to interact with the Senate. And, of course, many of the senators are on holiday. 
The third thing that happened was that late in the piece we received the Senate agenda for next year and notification of when sittings would be held. The nature of this inquiry is such that it has to go to the affected states. These matters are of great concern in Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and New South Wales, and there is interest in the Northern Territory as well. Therefore the hearings had to be held out of sitting weeks; they could not be held in sitting weeks. That meant that we had to find time. The consequence of that is that a planned reporting date in February has had to be shifted out for the committee to do its work. I have made it very clear to both the committee and the public at large that I believe these bills have to be debated by the Senate and resolved prior to 30 June next year because the government has an agenda to put together a new institution with a great deal of money affected, and it would be wrong not to deal with it by then. The committee has come to the view that the earliest date for reporting would be early in May—I forget the exact date, but I think it is 11 May—and that gives plenty of time for the bills to be either rejected or amended in time for 30 June.
Whilst in theory you might be accurate in terms of weeks, Minister, the practical effect of the process is that it will take a great deal longer than it should have. If the government had been smart enough, brainy enough and far-sighted enough to produce a whole-of-government response to the Cole report and had produced all the bills—(Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-12-03,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown from moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 740.
The motion reads:
That the Senate calls on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) to promote reform policies to halt logging of the Tarkine, which contains Australia's largest temperate rainforest.
At the outset, I thank Senator O'Brien for again giving the critical situation of the woodchip destruction of Tasmania's forests the opportunity to be debated in the Senate. Even though we only have five minutes each, I will try to outline what a disaster the encroachment on the Tarkine and adjacent regions is. Firstly, I want to pay tribute to the citizens of the locality who blockaded the encroachment by Forestry Tasmania and Gunns Pty Ltd onto the Eagle Hill—
—Another stunt.
—Rent-a-crowd.
—Government members say that what Gunns and Forestry Tasmania are doing is a stunt; I can tell you it is not. It is reality—and, if you lived in the area, you would find it would be much worse than a stunt. I quote from the Advocate newspaper's coverage of the logging protest on Monday:
PROTESTERS prevented logging at Eagle Hill yesterday—
this is just on the northern edge, outside the strictly-termed Tarkine but part of the Tarkine rainforest extent—
in a show of support for a proposed eco-tourism venture at the edge of the area known as the Tarkine.
Plans for a wilderness lodge by Phantom Farm owners Maree Jenkins and Richard Summers were crushed last month when they lost their fight to have the Eagle Hill area spared from logging.
After unsuccessful negotiations with Forestry Tasmania and Timber Communities Australia—
which is a front for the logging industries—
Ms Jenkins said the protest was an act of desperation to secure a logging moratorium.
Although the protest was never intended to be a blockade, Forestry Tasmania workers steered clear of the area.
Ms Jenkins said the proposed lodge would be reliant on the views of the Eagle Hill escarpment which, she claimed, would be destroyed with clear felling.
“Forestry Tasmania and Gunns are clear felling this coupe for woodchips. There's only 3.4 p.c. that's going to go into sawlogs and the rest will go to woodchips,” she said.
“It's a shame for the tourism industry in Tasmania and about time the Government really had a good hard look at what the timber industry is doing to tourism operators like myself.”
The protest enraged Forestry Tasmania—
and on it goes. The point to be made here, as with the Styx yesterday, is that there are far more jobs in Tasmania—and they are perpetual jobs—to be made out of proudly presenting great places like the Tarkine and its adjacent rainforest to the world than encroaching upon them, as is currently happening with Gunns Pty Ltd. It also has a sawmill, which takes a very tiny amount of the timber compared to the woodchips, which are over 90 per cent. If there is a difference in opinion or figures on that, Kerry O'Brien, when he gets to his feet in a moment, will be able to— 
—You should refer to the senator by his correct title.
—The senator will get to his feet in a moment and will, no doubt, give the correct figure. But I think we will find that the amount of forest being destroyed by woodchipping—and we got this in the news yesterday—has now gone above five million tonnes for Tasmania, with 150,000 log trucks a year. One of the prime targets is the north-west of Tasmania, including the Tarkine. Some areas of the south of the Tarkine were kept from logging—the 17,000 or 20,000 hectares of the Savage River National Park, which is a very small percentage of this 400,000-hectare area. Other areas were given over to mining but not logging. In the northern and eastern areas, intense logging continues. Now Britton Brothers at Smithton want to move into the heart of the myrtle rainforest.
At the Press Club at lunchtime, we had a very eloquent exposition by Peter Cundall, the doyen of gardening and things organic, on what drives the bulldozers and chainsaws into the rainforest. He put the driving factor for the destruction of Tasmania's grand forests—despite the economic and long-term advantages of not doing that—down to one word. That word is `greed': g-r-e-e-d.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2003-12-03,"—It was interesting that Senator Brown's motion talked about the Tarkine but then he extensively discussed an area that he conceded was outside the Tarkine. I want to address this matter because yesterday's motion—the motion that Senator Brown produced in a handwritten form for the Senate; he obviously dashed it off just so that he was sure he had something that would come up today—
—Can you handwrite too?
—Certainly I handwrite too. Sometimes I do it when I am in a rush and I want to get something before the Senate. The point I make is that Senator Brown was doing just that: he wanted something today—
—He does his own motions too.
—Oh, Senator Brown does his own motions—well, I am pleased to hear that because I would not want to be saying this if I thought that you did not endorse the motion that you put before the Senate, but you obviously do. This was just another stunt in an attempt to destroy the forest industry in Tasmania and the jobs of 10,000 Tasmanians. It calls on:
... the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) to promote reform policies to halt logging of the Tarkine ...
Policies are in place to adequately protect environmental values in the area referred to as the Tarkine. The Tarkine, firstly, is not a defined area on any official map. It is a construct of Senator Brown's and his colleagues in the Greens to provide an emotional label to an area of north-west Tasmania which he would have the community and the media believe is unprotected and under immediate threat from logging.
There is, however, a place on the Register of the National Estate called `the Tarkine wilderness area'. It lies in north-west Tasmania, roughly between the Murchison Highway to the east, the Indian Ocean to the west, the Arthur Highway to the north and the Pieman River to the south. If one considers that area to be a reasonable representation of where `the Tarkine' might be, one finds that it covers an area of approximately 334,000 hectares, or five per cent of Tasmania. It is transected by several major roads and the Australian bulk minerals Savage River iron ore pipeline and maintenance road. This area contains the township of Corinna, many former mines and tracks, some logged and regenerated forests, coastal shack settlements and some private land. About 240,000 hectares, or 75 per cent of this area, is in reserves in which no logging is permitted, including the 17,000-hectare Savage River National Park, the 102,000-hectare Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area, the 30,000-hectare Donaldson River nature recreation area and the 67,000-hectare Meredith Range Regional Reserve. Mr Deputy President, most of these reserves were created as a result of—you guessed it—the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement and include vast areas of rainforest, eucalypt forests, rivers, mountain ranges, coastal areas, Aboriginal heritage sites and wilderness—in short, the sorts of scenes that you see in Wilderness Society calendars, films and posters. 
It is planned to log only 10 per cent of the Tarkine. Parts of it have already been logged. Most of the future logging is within designated special timbers management zones allocated specifically for the long-term supply of Tasmanian fine timbers such as myrtle, blackwood, sassafras and celery-top pine for use by the furniture and craft industries. Harvesting in these areas will be small-scale, selective operations based on 30 years of research into the best way of harvesting these stands. There will be no clear-felling, no burning and no plantations in these areas. Places such as the Hellyer Gorge, Dip Falls and Eagle Hill near Meunna—where there was a blockade organised by the Tarkine National Coalition this week—are regularly portrayed by the Greens and their supporters in the Tasmanian media as being part of the Tarkine and as being under threat from logging. None of these places is in the area listed by the Australian Heritage Commission as being the Tarkine wilderness. They are many kilometres away.
I go back to the statistic that 75 per cent of the area is protected and remind the Senate that yesterday I referred to the Canadian boreal sub-Arctic forest area where environmentalists have acclaimed 50 per cent of that area being protected from logging. The Tarkine in Tasmania is 75 per cent protected. But that is not good enough for the Greens; that is not good enough for Senator Brown. As I said at the outset, they want to destroy the timber industry in Tasmania and the jobs of 10,000 Tasmanians. To do that they are prepared to misrepresent coupes in Tasmania as being part of the Tarkine when the facts show that they may be just outside it or they may be a long way outside it. Let us look at the statistics, but they are outside the Tarkine. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>FORESTRY: LOGGING</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-12-03,"—It is quite clear—from the performance of the Labor Party in government in Tasmania, the Labor Party in government here in the national capital up until 1996, and the coalition government since 1996—that a number of people who are very strongly committed to improving Australia's forest conservation practices have put enormous policy effort into this area over a period of more than a decade. I give credit to people like former minister David Beddall, former environment minister John Faulkner and a range of other former environment ministers, including Senator the Hon. Graham Richardson and our own forestry ministers and environment ministers, including Senator the Hon. Robert Hill and his successor David Kemp. But I give credit mostly to Robert Hill because he was in charge of the implementation of the national forest policy statement, which was a process and an agreement we inherited from the then Labor government.
Many ministers, many dedicated people in the conservation movement—and the environment movement more generally—and officers within the Commonwealth and state bureaucracies expended enormous energy and were enormously dedicated to creating for Australia a conservation system for our forests that is nothing other than world standard. That occurred across the political divide. Senator Brown would have us believe that he is the only person who cares about Australia's forests and that there is a sort of conspiracy between the major parties on this. The reality, however, is that this is a result of the hard work by politicians from both political parties with no help at all from the Greens. All the Greens have been able to do in this time is to pull stunts. They have not achieved a single outcome in any of this. All they have done is to be wreckers, whingers, carpers and stunt pullers. They have not saved a single tree but they want to destroy all the jobs.  
What have we achieved? As I said in a similar debate yesterday, 95 per cent of Tasmania's high-quality wilderness is now protected in reserves and is not available for timber harvesting. The people of Australia need to know that. That is the achievement of this government in implementing, in good faith, the agreement signed under the national forest policy agreement. What else does it mean? It means that 70 per cent of the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area—within which the Tarkine area is located—is reserved for conservation purposes, which means there is no timber harvesting. Senator Brown would have us and the Australian people believe that we could kill the timber industry entirely and therefore import more timber. I think we are already importing about $1 billion worth of timber products from other parts of the world. So presumably Australia's need for timber, which is a wonderful renewable resource and a sustainable industry, would be closed down. That would kick 86,000 people out of jobs, and Senator Brown would have you believe they could get jobs in ecotourism. 
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. We export twice as much timber as we import. I just thought I would correct him on that one.
—There is no point of order.
—The Australian government believe that ecotourism is important. It is a wonderful industry for Australia but to pretend you can shut down a sustainable, renewable industry like timber harvesting and replace it with ecotourism is absolutely loony land. The government provide $3 million in funding for the development of tourism infrastructure under the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement. We believe that tourism can make a contribution. It certainly provides a great boost for local economies. But only someone who seeks to deliberately mislead the Australian people would have them believe that ecotourism can entirely replace the timber industry. The two live side by side very successfully in many parts of Australia. We have sought and struck a very good balance for the conservation of forests in Australia and for our economy. That is a balance that Senator Brown would upset. All I can say is: let those who want balance to preserve—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>FORESTRY: LOGGING</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,25,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-12-03,"—I feel it is appropriate given my longstanding interest in forestry, both in my home state of Tasmania and nationally, that I say a few words in this debate on the suspension of standing orders and, more particularly, on Senator Brown's proposal relating to the logging of the Tarkine and some of the responses that have been given by the Labor Party and the government. I will say from the outset that I do not support Senator Brown's proposal, but both the government and the opposition in their contribution to this suspension debate have said things that really do not represent the facts. 
I agree with one comment that Senator Ian Campbell made: there has been a reasonable balance struck between conservation of Australia's forests—or, in this case, Tasmania's forests—on the one hand and commercial forest activity on the other. But the big problem for the forest industry is the way it is dealing with the resource available to it. That is the principal problem. It is a problem that was neither recognised nor dealt with by the previous federal Labor government and has not been recognised or dealt with by this government. It has not been recognised or dealt with by the state Labor government, and it appears that they are unlikely to do so.
Contrary to the claims that we have been growing employment in the forest industries, we have in fact been losing hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs. We have a plantation based strategy that lends itself not to the long-term interests of the development of the forestry manufacturing industry in this country but rather to the export industry in the form of either woodchips or log exports. In Tasmania at the moment, as Senator O'Brien would know, we have an oversupply of sawlogs that are being woodchipped. We have been exporting sawlogs and other logs as per the specifications set by Forestry Tasmania to China and Korea. We have been doing that for over 10 years on the basis that there would be some development with either the Koreans or the Chinese enabling the setting up of rotary peeling veneer factories in Tasmania.
The Tasmanian public have been misled and duped time and time again with respect to industry development in the state. The most recent way was by the claim that a pulp mill would be built. It beggars belief that Commonwealth governments, Commonwealth opposition parties and state governments cannot come to grips with the reality of the global forest industry and its development around the world. Sooner or later, at a federal level, the government will wake up. I do not believe the Tasmanian state government has the capacity to wake up; time will pass it by. All the while we have Senator Brown and the conservation movement trying to chip away at the area of forest available to the industry.
I respect Senator Brown's right to do that, but all the while the industry will continue to suffer because it has never been given the appropriate support and direction to develop itself into an industry that is of world's best practice. Until that happens, we will continue to have Senator Brown moving these types of motions and seeking the suspension of standing orders. That is a ridiculous situation for the industry to be in, because they are the ones that ultimately lose. As I said, the sooner governments wake up and deal with this issue appropriately, the better off we all will be.

Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
As senators are aware, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee considers legislation to ensure that it complies with appropriate civil liberties and principles of administrative fairness. It does this by bringing to the attention of the Senate provisions in bills that may infringe upon personal rights and liberties or delegate legislative powers inappropriately or without sufficient parliamentary scrutiny.
The committee has consistently raised concerns with provisions that allow persons to enter and search premises. These powers are essentially creations of statute and intrude on fundamental liberties that the common law protects. As such, they are exceptional powers and should only be included in legislation for compelling reasons. After commenting on these provisions for a number of years, the committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Cooney, undertook a detailed examination of these powers and tabled a report on 6 April 2000 that set out a series of principles against which all entry and search provisions should be judged. It has taken the government well over three years to table a response to our report, with the response having been tabled on 27 November 2003. Although the response was somewhat delayed, the committee thanks the Attorney-General for it.
A considerable period of time has lapsed since the committee considered the broader issues of the use of search and entry powers in Commonwealth legislation, and legislation has continued to provide for these powers, the most notable being in the antiterrorism bills considered this year. We therefore believe that there would be merit in giving further consideration to this matter with another re-examination of the issues.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-12-03,"—I present the report of the Economics Legislation Committee on the Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003 and certain associated regulations, dated December 2003, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I want very briefly to make two remarks about the report that has just been presented. Firstly, the Senate will note the recommendation of the committee that the legislation proceed as a matter of urgency. I think it is right to say that all but one of the witnesses who gave evidence at the hearings emphasised the urgency of the legislation proceeding in this session of parliament and spoke to the very grave consequences for the industry were the legislation not to proceed in this session of the parliament.
Secondly, I see that Senator Conroy is in the chamber. I want to say something about the rather unusual circumstances in which the hearing terminated last Monday evening, as revealed at page 26 of the Hansard report. The senators in attendance during the course of the evidence of a series of witnesses were Senator Conroy, a participating member of the committee and of course the opposition shadow spokesman with responsibility for the bill, and me as the chairman. As each of those witnesses presented their opening statement, Senator Conroy indicated that he had no questions for them. At a point at which there remained two brackets of witnesses still to give evidence—that is, officers of Treasury, all of whom I assume were resident in Canberra, but more importantly, officers of ASIC, all of whom had taken the trouble to come to Canberra for the day—Senator Conroy inquired of me, as the Hansard records, what the situation would be in relation to the quorum of the committee were he to withdraw. I indicated to him that, unless an opposition senator were present, the committee would be rendered inquorate. At that point, Senator Conroy withdrew.
The committee became inquorate. I sought the advice of the committee secretary, and standing order 29(2), which I will read quickly, provides:
If a senator draws attention to the lack of a quorum at a meeting of a committee, the proceedings shall be suspended until a quorum is present, or, if a quorum is not present after 15 minutes, the committee shall then be adjourned.
We waited for more than 15 minutes for the appearance of an opposition senator, during which time I caused the secretariat to seek to contact the two opposition members who are full members of the committee—without success. Under the operation of the standing order to which I have just referred, the committee adjourned.
I do not want to comment on the motive of Senator Conroy in acting as he did. It is not the custom of senators to render committees inquorate so as to prevent their proceeding with their business. It was regrettable that that was done. On behalf of the committee, I think an apology is owed to those officers of Treasury and ASIC—the latter, I understood, had come from Sydney—whose time was wasted as a result of what transpired.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Report of Economics Legislation        Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I would like to speak on the matters raised by Senator Brandis.
—Speak quickly.
—I will speak for as long as I like, thank you, Senator Lightfoot. Some day I hope to be able to hire Senator Brandis as my lawyer, because never have I seen such a barefaced and shamefaced misrepresentation of the facts. But when you are a good, paid lawyer, that is your job.
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. That is a reflection on me. I have been very careful to refer to no event other than what the Hansard record that I have just tabled demonstrates to be true. I ask you to require that reflection to be withdrawn.
—Senator Conroy, I would advise you to withdraw that imputation. 
—What is it that you require me to withdraw?
—I am asking you to withdraw the imputation on Senator Brandis.
—I do not understand: what words?
—I am not in the habit, Senator Conroy, of repeating remarks such as that. I am sure you are aware of the standing orders. You understand the words that need to be withdrawn.
—But I do not understand the words.
—Senator Conroy, make it easy for me at this hour of the afternoon and withdraw the imputation.
—You cast aspersions on him.
—No. I am casting aspersions on his excellent professional ability.
—Senator Conroy, withdraw the imputation.
—Is it the word `misrepresent' that you are seeking me to withdraw? You have been given a ruling by the Clerk; can you tell me whether that is the word?
—Senator Conroy, there is a series of words that you strung together there which need to be withdrawn.
—Is that the word?
—Senator Conroy, I am not going to sit here now and argue with you. I am just asking you very nicely to withdraw those words.
—I am simply asking what it is you want me to withdraw.
—As I have said, it is the imputation on Senator Brandis that I am asking you to withdraw.
—I will accept your ruling and I withdraw whatever imputation—
—Thank you very much.
—Certainly, Senator Brandis has misled the chamber. But as I said, some day I hope to be able—
—Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: I have been careful to record what is in the Hansard and nothing more. The imputation that I misled the chamber is out of order and it is absolutely false, as any reading of the Hansard will reveal.
—Senator Brandis, on your point of order, I am in a little bit of difficulty. I was interrupted by someone else wanting to seek some advice. I will have to seek the advice of the Clerk, Senator Brandis, given that I did not hear the words uttered by Senator Conroy. Senator Conroy, the Clerk advises me that the remark was taken by Senator Brandis as being an imputation against his character. I ask you to withdraw the reference to `misleading'.
—On the point of order—
—I have ruled on it. I am not going to argue with you on the point of order. You are quite entitled to put your view.
—I am just seeking to know whether the word `misled', which I understand has been allowed widely and on many occasions in the past, has been allowed.
—Again, Senator Conroy, it is not the word; it is the imputation. A better selection of words might be good advice. With your wide repertoire, Senator Conroy, I am sure you will be able to get around this minor difficulty at this moment. I just ask you to withdraw. 
—I will accept your ruling, Mr Deputy President—
—Thank you, Senator Conroy.
—but I would simply make the point that I have heard the word `misled' used—
—Senator Conroy, the point of order is now over. If you are continuing the debate, you may proceed.
—I will continue my remarks.
—Thank you.
—I have heard the word `misled' used many times in this chamber. I am continuing my remarks.
—Senator Conroy, resume your seat. You wish to raise a point of order, Senator McGauran?
—Yes. Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: after your wise counsel with the Clerk and your proper judgment on this matter—there was a clear imputation on the good Senator Brandis—we now have Senator Conroy clearly arguing and debating the point under the cover of continuing his debate. I ask you to bring him to order.
—Senator McGauran, I do not need a cheer squad in this debate, thank you. Senator Conroy, proceed.
—As I was saying, I have heard the word `misled' on many occasions in this chamber and I am somewhat surprised to find that you and the clerks are ruling, all of a sudden, that the use of the word `misled' is unparliamentary. I accept your ruling; I simply seek some advice from the Clerk—
—Is this a point of order or a continuation of the debate?
—Senator McGauran, keep out of this. Senator Conroy, resume your seat. We now have Senator Patterson on a point of order.
—Mr Deputy President, on the point of order: I do not want to continue this, but I want to put the record straight. The clerks do not order anything; it is the President's or the Deputy President's decision. I think that needs to be very clear on the record. They may take advice from the clerks, but the clerks make no decisions.
—Thank you, but that is no point of order. I return to Senator Conroy.
—Thank you. So I would seek some clarification from the Clerk about the use of the word `misled' in the future, because such a word is commonly used.
—Senator Conroy, I advise you that you would be wise to continue your remarks.
—As always, I accept your guidance.
—Some of us have other commitments around this place.
—As always, I accept your advice, Mr Deputy President. But, as I said, I am very entertained by Senator Brandis's performance. Someday I hope to be able to retain you, Senator Brandis. Your straight face as you deliver the most absurd speeches is a marvel to many of us on our side of the chamber.
—You are just envious because you cannot speak the way he does.
—I am very pleased I cannot speak the way he does—the way in which Senator Brandis kept himself constrained so tightly to just one or two minor matters surrounding this particular farce, which was the hearing. Unfortunately, it goes back some considerable days. It goes back to last week. Senator Brandis has failed to mention a number of the events in the lead-up. Senator Brandis has not actually wanted to raise them here today because they are of some embarrassment to him, as he well knows. And they are of some embarrassment to Parliamentary Secretary Ross Cameron, as Senator Brandis also knows, because last week the government and the opposition reached an agreement about the treatment of this bill and the calling of a committee hearing. It is not a secret that an agreement was reached. Hands were shaken, so to speak, about this matter and, unfortunately, the government reneged. The government chose to renege on its commitments. That is what is at stake here. This government is not a government that keeps its word. Parliamentary Secretary Ross Cameron was humiliated in the first few weeks of his job— 
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It is now a reflection on Mr Cameron—that he is somebody who has reneged, who has not kept his word. I think you ought to rule that out of order. Mr Deputy President, while I am on my feet, allow me for 30 seconds to read the Hansard to demonstrate that what Senator Conroy said earlier was simply wrong.
—No, Senator Brandis, you have taken a point of order. There is no point of order.
—This government humiliated Parliamentary Secretary Ross Cameron, because Mr Cameron, in good faith, gave his word. He gave it to me in front of Senator Brandis. Senator Brandis knows this. So the government came into the chamber, swept aside the agreement that had been in place and rammed in a hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. The government claimed that all the witnesses that could possibly be invited had been invited and contacted, they were all prepared to come—we can read you back the Hansard if you like, Senator Brandis—and they were all able to come. It was not until the Monday afternoon that we suddenly discovered that a whole range of witnesses were not even able to be contacted in time, never mind offered the opportunity. Key witnesses who would have provided very credible and important evidence to the committee were unable even to be contacted by the secretariat because there was not time.
One of the key witnesses who was able to turn up was unable to give an opinion on a raft of the matters before the committee, simply because they had not had time to finalise preparations for the hearing, and was somewhat embarrassed about it. The people who should have been embarrassed were not the witnesses. The people who should have been embarrassed were the government—Senator Brandis and Parliamentary Secretary Cameron. I think Mr Cameron is embarrassed. It is only that legal training and that marvellous voice we have heard Senator Patterson opining on which stop Senator Brandis too from demonstrating his embarrassment at the turn of events.
The government rammed through this hearing. There was insufficient time to notify witnesses, there was insufficient time for witnesses to prepare their submissions and there was not even sufficient time during the day for this government and its members to provide a chair for the committee. You see the committee, as Senator Brandis would know if he had read back a few pages in the Hansard—that is right; read the Hansard, Senator Brandis—actually lapsed during the course of one witness's evidence because the government could not even provide a senator to chair the meeting. I was left in the room by myself. Senator McGauran and Senator Brandis—the two offending senators who were attempting to chair the meeting and are both in the chamber now—both had to leave; neither could keep the committee going. So please do not come in here with a straight face—amused as I am by it—and talk about the committee lapsing. You could not even keep the committee quorum yourselves. 
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. That is not right either. In fact—
—Senator Brandis, resume your seat. There is no point of order.
—The point of order is that Senator Conroy again misled the chamber.
—Senator Brandis, that is not a point of order. If you want to debate the issue—
—Indeed, the suspension to which Senator Conroy refers was the time when he was on the telephone again trying to get the numbers for Mr Beazley.
—Sit down, Senator Brandis.
—We are a long way off your report, Senator Lightfoot.
—I am glad to see that the po face of Senator Brandis has finally cracked and that he cannot contain his embarrassment and blushes any longer.
—I'm very amused by the gloss you put on the suspension, Senator Conroy, when you were trying to get the numbers for your failed candidate.
—You've had too much red cordial.
—He has. But I am glad that we have brought Senator Brandis to life, because we much prefer him lively than with his po-faced lawyer face on. The government was not able to keep the committee quorum itself. I was left sitting in the room by myself while the committee chairs all vanished. And they come into this chamber and try to have a crack at me, saying I deprived the meeting of a quorum! I also had other business that day. It may or may not have been to do with the matters Senator Brandis is interjecting about—it actually was not.
The farce of this committee hearing was that the government lined up all its stooges who support the bill and raced them through. I barely asked a question in 2½ hours of presentations supporting the bill. We were only able to garner one other witness, who was embarrassed many times by having to say, `I'm sorry, I haven't had a chance.' This was an absolute farce. The government just wheeled its witnesses in—all the stooges who want concessions from the bill. Anyone who might have had an opposing view either could not be contacted, could not get there or—through no fault of their own—could not prepare a full and adequate submission. So let us not try to pretend that there were some unusual circumstances.
Senator Ian Campbell came into this chamber to ram the motion through parliament. He rolled Ross Cameron. He rolled Senator Brandis as well, mind you. Senator Brandis, a man of honour, was rolled. He gave his word and he was part of the deal. He was rolled by a man who continually demonstrates what an excellent real estate agent he was. We are now able to have the truth come out that this government pulled a stunt—it forced the bill in to look after the big end of town and a few of its mates. The big end of town is continually watering down the noble ambitions of former Minister for Financial Services and Regulation Joe Hockey in what was a noble cause: the Financial Services Reform Act. 
This bill now looks more like a Swiss cheese than any other piece of legislation I have dealt with in my parliamentary career. There are so many holes in it that I could drive the semitrailer of one of my old friends from the TWU through it. Every pleading interest that appeared before this committee has got the government to roll over for it, bar one. Only one group has been unsuccessful in getting the government to cave in. So the noble ambitions of former Minister Hockey have been trampled on by the real estate agent. They have been trampled on by government procedure—by the use of its numbers. The government is not interested in a fair dinkum discussion of the bill, so do not come in here crying poor. This government could not even maintain a quorum to ram its own bill through; so please, Senator Brandis, let us at least have some honesty in the debate.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SERVICES REFORM AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Report of Economics Legislation        Committee</title>,Bills,27,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2003-12-03,"—I would like to make some comments about the minority report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee on the Financial Services Reform Amendment Bill 2003, if I may.
—That will be refreshing, after that performance.
—Yes, it is a bit difficult but I will try. I want to reiterate that the Labor members of the committee are very concerned that the government continues to make substantial changes to a key piece of amending legislation in relation to the financial services reform regime, with little opportunity for scrutiny or debate. I draw the attention of my colleagues to the fact that as of yesterday, 2 December, the ASIC web site noted that there were only eight days to go until 10 December, after which there is no guarantee that participants will be licensed by 10 March 2004—which is of course the critical date.
Although the March 2004 deadline is approaching, the government brought the bill on for debate in the House of Representatives on 5 November. In addition, the last batch of amendments was posted on the Treasury web site on 23 October, whilst the latest batch of regulations was provided by Treasury only in late October. Further regulations are expected to follow, so there is a level of uncertainty within the industry about what is still to come. I know that some members and senators are concerned that, unless we rush this through, the industry will not have time to prepare; but that argument really does not stack up if the government is actually still drafting some regulations.
It is very important for people to understand clearly that Labor are concerned about these amendments. Labor support the objectives of the Financial Services Reform Act 2001. We are keen to ensure that the government monitors the implementation of the act and the related regulations, but we believe that a post-implementation review is important to make sure that what has been put in place is effective in achieving the intended aims of the reforms. What Labor believe needs greater clarification is whether the proposed stockbroker exemptions strike an appropriate balance between commercial expediency and consumer protection. This was raised in the debate in the House of Representatives by Alan Griffin and, despite being dismissed out of hand by the parliamentary secretary, Mr Cameron, it is a concern of consumers that has been raised with some members of the committee.
Labor also want to be clear about whether the dollar disclosure regime will enhance or detract from the disclosure regime and whether it is appropriate to restrict the use of certain terms, such as `independent', in the manner contemplated by the regulations. As we have heard already, the way in which this inquiry was conducted—with short notice to witnesses and an incomplete hearing—means that not all the issues were canvassed by the committee. We see that the financial services regime is structured so that much of the detail is included in the regulations. We know the dangers of being asked to pass legislation without knowing how the amendments will operate in practice, as the detail to be contained in the regulations is still outstanding—and, as is so often the case, the devil may well be in the detail. 
I would like to make some brief comments about the stockbroker exemption issue as well. Currently, section 946B relates to `execution related telephone advice', referred to in the explanatory memorandum as ERTA. That will be replaced by a new term, `further market related advice', in the latest amendments. We support the general approach taken by the amendments and recognise the practical difficulties faced by advisers in a live market situation. The further market related advice may be given over the telephone, by fax or by email, but the advice must be given in a live market situation. The key amendments to section 946B will mean that, although the client will be given a statement of advice initially, the provider will be exempt from the requirement to give a statement of advice for further market related advice. We have heard the argument that this makes sense, especially for stockbrokers, but it is fair to say that Labor want to be sure that we are delivering a balance between protecting consumers and responding to commercial needs. I do not think that that is an unreasonable proposition.
Section 945A creates a general obligation for entities to have a reasonable basis for any personal advice given which, according to the explanatory memorandum, requires them to determine the client's relevant personal circumstances. The Labor members of the committee are concerned that this general requirement may not be sufficient in this context. For example, it is unclear how an adviser such as a stockbroker would be aware whether a client's circumstances had in fact changed. We therefore believe that the new provision should include a requirement that the broker go back to the client at least annually to check whether their circumstances have changed. As noted in the minority report, even though the broker is no longer required to provide a statement, they are still required to make other disclosures in relation to issues such as remuneration and conflicts of interest. 
In relation to dollar disclosure, we acknowledge that the Corporations Amendment Regulations 2003 (No. 8) and Statutory Rules 2003 (No. 282), previously known as batch 5, are of concern to the superannuation and funds management industry, as they introduce a new fee disclosure regime. Disclosure documents under the FSR Act, such as statements of advice, product disclosure statements and periodic statements, are required to include details of benefits, fees and charges. While the FSR Act requires parties to provide information about these charges, what exactly needs to be disclosed? The explanatory memorandum to the regulations says:
The lack of clarity in this requirement may potentially result in details of these items being provided in a form that may be considered sub-optimal from the consumer comprehension viewpoint. Accordingly, these regulations require industry to disclose items in dollar terms in the first instance, but if this is not seen to be reasonably practicable then the item is required to be disclosed in percentage terms. 
Is it possible that the `reasonably practicable' test will allow providers to avoid disclosing fees and charges in dollar terms? Surely this could be the case, and certainly that is the concern of the Australian Consumers Association, which provided evidence to the inquiry. Ms Wolthuizen from the ACA said:
First of all, I think it would see not only a denial of relevant information contrary to the good disclosure principles enunciated by ASIC in PS 168 that disclosure be timely, relevant and complete, promote product understanding, promote comparison, highlight important information and have regard to consumers' needs, but in this case it would mean consumers are unlikely to get the very information they need when it comes to comparing different funds and the cost in particular of investing with different funds and different products.
People have a much poorer understanding of disclosures presented in percentage terms and we should not underestimate the importance of disclosure in dollar terms, because this is what consumers understand. Arguments that enhanced fee disclosure will increase costs are countered by Professor Ramsay in his report to ASIC entitled Disclosure of fees and charges in managed investments, where he suggests that fee disclosure is particularly important in periodic statements, as they give:
... details of the value of the investment and the investor therefore has a financial incentive to review the statement.
As the ACA reminded us, the importance of disclosure is all the more important in an environment of superannuation choice. ASIC has released a fee disclosure model incorporating an at-a-glance table, which does not allow investors to compare like with like. Labor's concerns about this approach are supported by research undertaken by the AFSA with Chant West, released in November, which found:
It is not clear that consumers will be able to understand ASIC's fee tables or make valid comparisons of bottom-line costs.
We are very sceptical that the industry will voluntarily disclose dollar amounts, although the Treasury suggests in the explanatory memorandum that it will increase over time. Labor strongly believe that changes to the fee disclosure models are required. Finally, Labor members of the committee are concerned about the proposal in batch 6 relating to the restriction of certain terms, such as `independent', and how the exemption would be granted, as well as the need for careful monitoring by ASIC of such a provision. The Labor members of the committee have reflected in the minority report our genuine concerns about the haste with which we have been required to deal with this bill and the lack of detail provided by a government still struggling to draft the appropriate regulations—hardly the best way to implement effective fiscal policy in the interests of all Australians. I predict that we will be back dealing with more amendments in relation to this bill in the not too distant future.

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2003-12-03,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, I have pleasure in presenting the committee's second report for 2003, Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?: inquiry into governance on Norfolk Island. I move: 
That the Senate take note of the report.
This is the first of two reports on the governance and financial sustainability of Norfolk Island. It is an attempt to recommend real and meaningful reform for Norfolk Island. The overwhelming evidence, from this inquiry and previous inquiries that this committee and others have conducted, is that Norfolk Island is in deep and growing trouble and needs help. In order to ensure that real and meaningful reform does take place, the committee has chosen to deliver an unambiguous and hard-hitting report that provides a catalyst and framework for reform to begin.
The committee has no doubt that the majority of the island community are peaceful and law abiding, hardworking, conscientious, possessing a strong sense of civic duty and with an inherent ethic of supporting those in the community who may be less well off. Yet evidence available to the committee points to the fact that elements within the community are able to exploit the current governance system, with its lack of effective checks and balances, for their own ends. It has become increasingly clear that when one looks beneath the surface, informal mechanisms can, and do, operate with relative impunity.
As on previous occasions, there will be a vocal, self-interested minority on the island that will criticise the committee's efforts and attempt to stifle considered debate on our recommendations. If history is a teacher, this minority group will organise a petition condemning the report and initiate a referendum to demonstrate popular opposition to federal government `interference' in the affairs of Norfolk Island. The committee, however, has serious concerns with the practices associated with the conduct of petitions and referenda on Norfolk Island. Those opposed to real reform on the island will, undoubtedly, endeavour to stymie any attempts at reform. They will seek to ensure this report joins the long list of other reports by federal and Norfolk Island inquiries that have never been implemented and which now gather dust. If they succeed, the committee will have failed and failed the island community. The cause of genuine reform on Norfolk Island will be set back irrevocably, with the future of the island community seriously undermined.
In this report, the committee seeks to preserve the principle of self-government for the island and to make it more effective through the introduction of a similar range of accountability and transparency mechanisms that apply to all levels of government elsewhere in Australia. The financial or administrative burden of implementing the report's recommendations, if they are accepted, will fall primarily on the federal government—and not the Norfolk Island government and community. The Commonwealth would bear the cost—as it should and must, given the nature of the Commonwealth's role and responsibilities for the Norfolk Island community. Nor on any dispassionate and impartial examination of the report's recommendations can there be any serious argument that implementation of those recommendations will have an undue cultural impact.
The findings and recommendations of the report are drawn primarily from, and are supported by, the evidence and suggestions of the Norfolk Island communities and from previous reports, especially the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and the Norfolk Island government reports. This report, however, is entirely consistent with previous reports of this committee, reports of other bodies and reports of Norfolk Island committees as well. The report is also entirely consistent with federal government policy. Australia's interest in facilitating good governance throughout the western and South Pacific must mean that all appropriate steps be taken to ensure that the same principles of good governance protect those who live in a part of Australia that happens to be in the Pacific. The committee, therefore, hopes that this report will be used by the Norfolk Island community and the federal government as the basis for real and meaningful reform on the island. The committee will continue to take a keen and active interest in the responses to this report and in ensuring a sustainable future for the Norfolk Island community. 
Mr Acting Deputy President, on behalf of the committee I would like to express our gratitude to all those who participated in the inquiry and to the staff of the secretariat—in particular to Quinton Clements, the inquiry secretary—for a very well written and researched paper. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues for their work and support throughout the course of the inquiry and the reporting process. That having been said, on behalf of my committee colleagues I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>National Capital and External Territories Committee</title>,Committees,29,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories is a very responsible report and I support the words just uttered by my colleague Senator Lightfoot. It addresses the issues, it is well structured and it is detailed. There is no doubt that it has been a long time coming and is necessary for the residents of Norfolk Island. But, most importantly, it is a unanimous report of the committee. There was no dissent at all within the committee about the recommendations in this report. That should be seen in the light that it needs to be seen, because it really gets to the heart of the problem affecting the people on Norfolk Island. There are a small group of people who say they are the voice of Norfolk Island, but they are not that at all. They misrepresent the true feelings of the people of Norfolk Island.
This report confirms very basic concerns held by the committee on very fundamental issues. I was struck by the fear and apprehension of some of the islanders to appear before the committee when it took evidence. Might I say that in my time here in the Senate there are very few people who have wanted to give their evidence before the committee in private, in camera, and then only for good business reasons or confidential reasons around security. But these people feared for their own personal safety. The unwillingness of people to be identified with their concerns on the public record was of grave concern to me and other members of the committee. I expressed my concern about in camera evidence and the need for as much to be said on the public record as was possible so that the debate around this Norfolk Island dilemma could be out in the public. 
Some, a minority of islanders with vested interests undoubtedly, have trotted out in the past and will trot out the perennial red herring they use that in some way Norfolk Island is not a part of Australia and that Norfolk Islanders and Norfolk Island are intrinsically different. That is absolute arrant nonsense—that is the only way one can describe it. The report, whilst recognising the unique background of those of Pitcairn descent, fundamentally rejected the argument of some special status for the island. It clearly was, is and will remain a territory of Australia and the responsibility for it falls within the domain of the parliament of Australia. 
There clearly was a lack of transparency and accountability of the island government. You did not have to be too bright to see that. I am now going to quote from sections of the report in the time that I have left because the report itself is so well structured it sums up most of the sentiments that I would want to express anyway. At paragraph 1.3, on page 2, the report says: 
The Committee has therefore focused its analysis in this report on the inadequacy of existing political arrangements and legal infrastructure, and on ways to improve and strengthen the governance arrangements for Norfolk Island.
The report goes on:
The Committee has formed the view that, in the absence of proper accountability mechanisms and stronger political leadership, it is unlikely the administration of the Island will improve.
So it is about accountability and transparency lacking on that island. The report continues:
The task of implementing and maintaining these review mechanisms falls singularly on the Commonwealth—
as Senator Lightfoot pointed out— 
The Committee does not intend for the Norfolk Island Government to take on additional, costly functions, nor should a small, isolated community, such as Norfolk Island, have to shoulder the burden of regulating itself alone.
That is a quite reasonable proposition. The issue of the fear of reprisal is covered at paragraph 2.11 of the report. It says:
The Committee has experience of other small, isolated communities where such phenomena do not exist and the allegations cannot simply be dismissed as the norm in such communities. Based on evidence presented to it, the Committee now has grave concerns that a culture of fear and intimidation has taken root on the Island to the detriment of the majority of the community.
Those are telling words indeed, and very condemnatory of certain practices on the island. The report at 2.12 goes on:
Whether these acts are highly organised or not is immaterial. The undercurrent of intimidation and the overt criticism of those who express a different view do not sit well with the image of a participatory consensual style of politics or cohesive community life.
So the report there is very telling indeed. The report goes on to address the issue of the financial and administrative incapacity. At 2.18 the report says:
A litany of problems was identified by a wide range of witnesses, most importantly, the general lack of administrative and financial capacity of the Territory Government to manage the broad range of responsibilities it has been given.
At paragraph 2.19 the report says:
Inadequate auditing and public reporting falling short of even the most very basic of parliamentary and corporate governance standards was also raised as emblematic of the deeper problem.
When it came to the solution, the committee put up two propositions: the withdrawal of self-government or modifying self-government. The committee identified some essential reforms at paragraph 2.32 on page 25. It noted four, and these were:
	modification to improve accountability and financial management;
	the resumption of Commonwealth responsibility for delivery of key services and programs on-Island such as social welfare, health and immigration;
	rectify the distortions in the electoral system to open the political and administrative systems to change; and
	impose an equitable tax regime, including on income, to provide financial sustainability.
The report went on to look at the issue of good governance, and this is the key to this report. On the issue of good governance, the report clearly identified the need for transparency and accountability, efficient and effective public administration, ethical use of public resources and individual liberty. In particular—and obviously time does not allow it here today—the report went into a number of areas where there needs to be real change made on the island. This includes codes of conduct, registers of pecuniary and non-pecuniary interests, anticorruption legislation, financial and performance audits, freedom of information legislation, privacy laws, the right for proper access to administrative tribunals and whistleblower legislation. The list goes on. There is a need for proper access to the likes of the Auditor-General of the federal parliament. Also in this report we make recommendations about the need to have the operation of the oversight of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit of this parliament, whose independence is beyond any doubt whatsoever and which performs such a marvellous role in ensuring that there is transparency and responsibility of government. 
One might ask why this has not been done by the Norfolk Island government before. It has not been done by the Norfolk Island government before because, firstly, there has been a lack of will; secondly, there has been a lack of capacity; and, thirdly, it has shown no desire over a long period to achieve the minimum standards that exist elsewhere. So it has been negligent, in my view, to the citizens of Norfolk Island in not delivering decent government and decent services to the people of Norfolk Island. The people have survived totally on mythology that has been of their own making and their own creation and now is the time for this parliament to stand up, take these people on and call upon the government to act positively to protect the people of Norfolk Island and ensure that they have basic rights, basic freedoms and basic protection, which every other citizen of Australia has been entitled to over a long period.
There are many very good people on Norfolk Island. Unfortunately, they are the silent majority. Their voices are not heard and they deserve better. I think the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, under the chairmanship of Senator Ross Lightfoot, have served that silent majority well. I commend the committee's report to the Senate. People should read it in its totality to get a full appreciation of the problems that exist, according to this committee, on Norfolk Island. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

That having been said, on behalf of my committee colleagues I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,29,2,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories is a very responsible report and I support the words just uttered by my colleague Senator Lightfoot. It addresses the issues, it is well structured and it is detailed. There is no doubt that it has been a long time coming and is necessary for the residents of Norfolk Island. But, most importantly, it is a unanimous report of the committee. There was no dissent at all within the committee about the recommendations in this report. That should be seen in the light that it needs to be seen, because it really gets to the heart of the problem affecting the people on Norfolk Island. There are a small group of people who say they are the voice of Norfolk Island, but they are not that at all. They misrepresent the true feelings of the people of Norfolk Island.
This report confirms very basic concerns held by the committee on very fundamental issues. I was struck by the fear and apprehension of some of the islanders to appear before the committee when it took evidence. Might I say that in my time here in the Senate there are very few people who have wanted to give their evidence before the committee in private, in camera, and then only for good business reasons or confidential reasons around security. But these people feared for their own personal safety. The unwillingness of people to be identified with their concerns on the public record was of grave concern to me and other members of the committee. I expressed my concern about in camera evidence and the need for as much to be said on the public record as was possible so that the debate around this Norfolk Island dilemma could be out in the public. 
Some, a minority of islanders with vested interests undoubtedly, have trotted out in the past and will trot out the perennial red herring they use that in some way Norfolk Island is not a part of Australia and that Norfolk Islanders and Norfolk Island are intrinsically different. That is absolute arrant nonsense—that is the only way one can describe it. The report, whilst recognising the unique background of those of Pitcairn descent, fundamentally rejected the argument of some special status for the island. It clearly was, is and will remain a territory of Australia and the responsibility for it falls within the domain of the parliament of Australia. 
There clearly was a lack of transparency and accountability of the island government. You did not have to be too bright to see that. I am now going to quote from sections of the report in the time that I have left because the report itself is so well structured it sums up most of the sentiments that I would want to express anyway. At paragraph 1.3, on page 2, the report says: 
The Committee has therefore focused its analysis in this report on the inadequacy of existing political arrangements and legal infrastructure, and on ways to improve and strengthen the governance arrangements for Norfolk Island.
The report goes on:
The Committee has formed the view that, in the absence of proper accountability mechanisms and stronger political leadership, it is unlikely the administration of the Island will improve.
So it is about accountability and transparency lacking on that island. The report continues:
The task of implementing and maintaining these review mechanisms falls singularly on the Commonwealth—
as Senator Lightfoot pointed out— 
The Committee does not intend for the Norfolk Island Government to take on additional, costly functions, nor should a small, isolated community, such as Norfolk Island, have to shoulder the burden of regulating itself alone.
That is a quite reasonable proposition. The issue of the fear of reprisal is covered at paragraph 2.11 of the report. It says:
The Committee has experience of other small, isolated communities where such phenomena do not exist and the allegations cannot simply be dismissed as the norm in such communities. Based on evidence presented to it, the Committee now has grave concerns that a culture of fear and intimidation has taken root on the Island to the detriment of the majority of the community.
Those are telling words indeed, and very condemnatory of certain practices on the island. The report at 2.12 goes on:
Whether these acts are highly organised or not is immaterial. The undercurrent of intimidation and the overt criticism of those who express a different view do not sit well with the image of a participatory consensual style of politics or cohesive community life.
So the report there is very telling indeed. The report goes on to address the issue of the financial and administrative incapacity. At 2.18 the report says:
A litany of problems was identified by a wide range of witnesses, most importantly, the general lack of administrative and financial capacity of the Territory Government to manage the broad range of responsibilities it has been given.
At paragraph 2.19 the report says:
Inadequate auditing and public reporting falling short of even the most very basic of parliamentary and corporate governance standards was also raised as emblematic of the deeper problem.
When it came to the solution, the committee put up two propositions: the withdrawal of self-government or modifying self-government. The committee identified some essential reforms at paragraph 2.32 on page 25. It noted four, and these were:
	modification to improve accountability and financial management;
	the resumption of Commonwealth responsibility for delivery of key services and programs on-Island such as social welfare, health and immigration;
	rectify the distortions in the electoral system to open the political and administrative systems to change; and
	impose an equitable tax regime, including on income, to provide financial sustainability.
The report went on to look at the issue of good governance, and this is the key to this report. On the issue of good governance, the report clearly identified the need for transparency and accountability, efficient and effective public administration, ethical use of public resources and individual liberty. In particular—and obviously time does not allow it here today—the report went into a number of areas where there needs to be real change made on the island. This includes codes of conduct, registers of pecuniary and non-pecuniary interests, anticorruption legislation, financial and performance audits, freedom of information legislation, privacy laws, the right for proper access to administrative tribunals and whistleblower legislation. The list goes on. There is a need for proper access to the likes of the Auditor-General of the federal parliament. Also in this report we make recommendations about the need to have the operation of the oversight of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit of this parliament, whose independence is beyond any doubt whatsoever and which performs such a marvellous role in ensuring that there is transparency and responsibility of government. 
One might ask why this has not been done by the Norfolk Island government before. It has not been done by the Norfolk Island government before because, firstly, there has been a lack of will; secondly, there has been a lack of capacity; and, thirdly, it has shown no desire over a long period to achieve the minimum standards that exist elsewhere. So it has been negligent, in my view, to the citizens of Norfolk Island in not delivering decent government and decent services to the people of Norfolk Island. The people have survived totally on mythology that has been of their own making and their own creation and now is the time for this parliament to stand up, take these people on and call upon the government to act positively to protect the people of Norfolk Island and ensure that they have basic rights, basic freedoms and basic protection, which every other citizen of Australia has been entitled to over a long period.
There are many very good people on Norfolk Island. Unfortunately, they are the silent majority. Their voices are not heard and they deserve better. I think the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, under the chairmanship of Senator Ross Lightfoot, have served that silent majority well. I commend the committee's report to the Senate. People should read it in its totality to get a full appreciation of the problems that exist, according to this committee, on Norfolk Island. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-12-03,"—The Australian Labor Party would like to provide some comments for the record in relation to this message that has been received from the House of Representatives on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003. Although we are not surprised, of course, that the House of Representatives would not agree to our amendments, we are very disappointed, because it just reaffirms that this government has no commitment to transparency and accountability when it comes to capital funding for private schools. This is a government that is prepared to allow a situation to continue where schools receive up to millions of dollars in capital funding that is essentially unaccounted for. The government itself published a report detailing last year's funding for schools capital works. Senator Carr quoted from this report in his speech in the second reading debate on this bill. It revealed that private schools were spending their Commonwealth grants on furniture, fees and other items, which he advised the Senate that he believed was inadmissible under the Commonwealth's own guidelines but which the Commonwealth itself reports with alacrity. This is its `don't care' attitude to what private schools do with taxpayers' money.
Today I notice that on the front page of the Sunshine Coast Daily—apart from the fact that it contains comment about the new leader of the Labor Party, Mark Latham—there is a report on a sensational scandal involving a private school in that area. The article says, among other things: the principal drives around in a red sports car provided by the school; the principal's wife, who is one of very few who are able to sign cheques for the school, received a $75,000 loan from the school this year, while her husband received $65,000; the school is $8 million in debt, even though it charges the highest school fees on the Sunshine Coast; the school charges parents $400 a year for a building fund but is doing no building until at least 2006 and consists largely of poorly maintained temporary buildings; the chairman of the school board received $100,000 as recompense for legal work for the school last year; and another board member received $60,000 for accounting fees. I understand that the Queensland authorities are considering closing the school down. The list about this school in this newspaper article goes on and on, and there are many other lists about many other schools. Yet the article tells us the Commonwealth has just said it will provide this school with $4 million in grants next year. Is any of that for capital works? Where is the accountability here?
The government's response to this relatively straightforward bill has been revealing. This bill has shown for all to see the government's arm's length approach to its responsibilities for schools. In the debate in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Education, Science and Training has refused to even talk about what might be done to improve the way in which capital funding for schools is provided. Labor's amendments were put forward in good faith. Our amendments were designed to enhance the integrity of the capital grants program, to position that program for the future—a future where the school-aged population overall is relatively stable, where any new school developments are more likely to be at the expense of existing government and non-government schools, where the public interest in capital facilities purchased with the support of public funds will increasingly be open to question and where the differences in the quality of capital facilities in schools will become increasingly apparent. Government school students receive, per capita, only 25 to 50 per cent of the amount spent on capital works and infrastructure in private schools. What does this say to the 70 per cent of Australian children who attend government schools? Who is valued more highly under the policies of this government? 
The minister has given us the old argument that non-government schools save public money, as if this was the purpose of the government's role in schooling. Labor reject this rationale for federal support of schools. We believe in supporting schools for the achievement of educational goals and in supporting schools for students, for their families and for society as a whole. We do not accept spurious arguments about cost saving and cost shifting as the basis for Commonwealth programs for schools. The Commonwealth has a responsibility to ensure equity in educational provision for Australian kids—wherever they go to school. This government never tires of quoting the statistic that `the kids from the wealthiest families attract 87 per cent less' public funding. This figure appears to be based on the fact that the minimum federal per capita grant for a student in a non-government school under the government's SES scheme is 13.7 per cent of the average government school recurrent costs. Only two schools across Australia receive this minimum grant—that is, two out of more than 2,650 non-government schools. Non-government schools also receive funding from state and territory governments. The level of this varies across the nation but, at the very minimum, it brings the level of total public funding to over 20 per cent of the average costs of education in a government school. Most receive much more than that.
This government has increased funding to some of the best resourced schools in the country so that those schools are able to operate with more than twice the resources available in public schools and with more resources than the majority of non-government schools. No wonder the minister was reluctant to include the needs principle in the legislation. This government does not believe in funding schools according to need, and this legislation proves that. The opposition accepts that all schools should receive some public funding in recognition of the contribution they make to education generally but we need to be very clear about priorities. We need transparent criteria for the allocation of that funding.
In 1987, the then education minister, Susan Ryan, said:
The Australian government will continue to set priorities for the use of its funds, and distribution proposals will require my approval. Funds will continue to be directed to the most disadvantaged schools and the most needy groups.
How things have changed! What a turnaround! Under this government this principle has been abandoned. This is a government that is irresponsible. It has a hands-off approach to accountability for private school funding.
Labor are not ideologically opposed to non-government schools. Labor have supported funding for non-government schools for over 30 years. We have been party to initiating and supporting billions of dollars of funding on the basis of meeting educational and financial need. We are entitled to ask that the integrity of the needs principle be protected by the legislation. We ask the government to engage constructively with the issues. Unfortunately, it appears that this is too much to ask. It is clear that the issues raised in this bill will not go away. In government and in opposition, Labor will renew our efforts to develop legislation that affirms the provision of federal funding for government and non-government schools on the basis of the educational and financial needs of school communities. That provides a more explicit link between policy goals, program administration and reporting of program outcomes. 
This will be done comprehensively by this party when the legislation for the next quadrennium is introduced in 2004. Unfortunately, in the meantime, as this bill is attached to funding dollars and this bill is in the best interests of the students and schools that stand to benefit from the educational resources it provides, Labor will not press for these amendments. But let it be clearly understood that when the funding for the next quadrennium comes before this parliament, which will be in the new year, in 2004, we will insist on these amendments and we will be making the relevant and the right changes so that this government becomes accountable for the amount of dollars channelled to non-government schools, particularly when it comes to capital funding works.",SENATE,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,34,1,speech

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-12-03,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 3209:
(1)	Page 1 (line 1) to page 208 (line 20), omit “higher education provider” wherever occurring, substitute “university/listed higher education institution”.
(2)	Page 1 (line 1), to page 208 (line 20), omit “higher education providers” wherever occurring, substitute “universities/listed higher education institutions”.
(3)	Page 1 (line 1), to page 208 (line 20), omit “providers” wherever occurring, substitute “institutions”.
These amendments predominantly make the same changes in the bill and that is to omit the words `higher education provider' wherever it occurs and substitute the words `university/listed higher education institutions'.
I clearly remember a number of periods in which we questioned the officials from the department in relation to why this was the case, particularly through the last Senate inquiry we had into this bill. We do not believe the answer they gave is satisfactory—that is, that a definition in this bill might encompass those institutions that provide higher education. In fact, there are only a couple of higher education providers listed in the bill. Over 97 per cent of this bill is targeted at universities or other listed higher education institutions, such as the Australian Maritime College or the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education in the Northern Territory. We believe that deleting `university' and putting in place the term `higher education provider' represents a significant mind shift in this bill. Of course, it is a mind shift based on the whole view that the higher education sector should be more privatised than it is currently, but we do not believe there is a need to comprehensively delete the word `university' from this bill. These three amendments seek to ensure that `university' is put back in its place to replace the reference to `higher education providers'. ",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-12-03,"—I rise to speak to Labor's amendments (1) to (3) relating to the definition of `higher education provider'. I think these Labor Party amendments will have an adverse effect, particularly on new higher education providers that may be approved by the minister, an example of which would be Avondale College. If Labor's amendments were to be passed, they would preclude Avondale College from being approved as a higher education provider. I do not believe that would be in the country's best interests.
More precisely, the government's amendments pick up the differentiation between the higher education providers, and One Nation feel that they are more appropriate. One of the difficulties that we are going to run into with this legislation and to a large degree with some of the amendments proposed by the Labor Party is that we will have to look at what legislation these universities are operating under. This piece of legislation relates to the federal government's appropriation of taxpayers' moneys to finance those institutions, but to a large degree these institutions operate under state legislation. In some cases, there is even individual legislation that has been passed for specific universities.
Some of the Labor Party's amendments are going to duplicate what already exists under state legislation and, unfortunately, we will then have the situation where they may actually be in conflict with that state legislation. We could have the universities operating under their state legislation and all of a sudden finding that there is federal legislation that either mirrors it or, in some cases, may be in conflict with it. As you are aware, Mr Temporary Chairman, if there is conflict then the federal legislation overrides that of the state. For clarity for the universities, it would be better if the amendments proposed by the Labor Party that have the possibility of conflicting with state legislation under which universities run were not accepted.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,35,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-12-03,"—Senator Harris, I need to draw your attention to a number of matters. Under our amendments, Avondale College is actually listed as a higher education institution, so you are not correct in assuming that our amendments would not pick it up. I have to say that I am impressed by the way in which you have been briefed by the minister's office on this matter. But our change reflects the overall intention of our amendments to the bill.
The Labor Party's underlying strategy is based on the fundamental view that universities as universities, not as higher education providers as specified in this bill, are in a unique category among education institutions—that is, they have certain characteristics which we believe need to be retained in the definition we are suggesting rather than the one the government is putting forward. They are defined in Australia by means of the MCEETYA national protocols. The protocols do not talk about higher education providers or de facto universities; they talk about universities. So this is a consistent line to run.
The definition of `university' and the use of the word `university' in this act are consistent with the MCEETYA national protocols as opposed to the government's proposal, which is not consistent. Central to the definition is the concept of university autonomy, and this essentially goes to its academic decision making processes and the freedom of its staff and students to teach, learn and research. It goes to the publication and dissemination of knowledge and ideas. The centrepiece for the national legislative edifice on which we rest our higher education system must be an appropriate definition of `university' to recognise the uniqueness and characteristics of that institution. We do not believe that is picked up in the government's proposal to have a higher education provider.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2003-12-03,"—I would also like to take this opportunity to say a few words about my friend and colleague Senator Richard Alston. My colleagues have spoken about Richard's massive ministerial legacy, and I will say nothing more about that. Rather, I would like to say just a few words of personal reflection about Richard's kindness and patience. I remember coming back on a couple of occasions to the unit we share outraged—absolutely outraged—about some perceived slight or some ignorant argument being made and Richard, being the kind and patient man he is, setting me straight. I think Richard sees politics more as a game than as a war. He has always had a marvellous insight into people, humanity and the human condition. But I have discovered his secret. Anyone who has read every single book that has ever been nominated for the Booker Prize understands every character that can possibly be. I do not think anyone in Australian politics has ever so effectively combined prose with politics. Richard, I will miss you. Thank you for being such a great colleague and friend. You were the very best.
Earlier this year I spoke in this chamber on the occasion of Citizenship Day, celebrated throughout Australia on 17 September. My speech focused on the symbolism employed during citizenship ceremonies and called for a more positive and inclusive manner of embracing the newest Australians and introducing them to their new home. Tonight I am very happy to be able to report back to the Senate on a very successful conclusion to issues raised in my speech. My initial remarks were prompted by the well-known practice of acknowledging, at citizenship and other official ceremonies, the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land on which the ceremony is being held. It is a common practice. In my speech I called for a more inclusive and positive formula which, in addition to recognising the undisputed contribution of Indigenous Australians to our society, would also acknowledge our debt and our gratitude to all Australians who have built this great country, regardless of race, creed or colour. I said: 
... when at citizenship ceremonies we acknowledge Indigenous Australians let us also acknowledge those men and women who tamed our harsh continent and, in doing so, brought into being one of the world's oldest democracies and most successful multicultural nations.
I went on to say:
Our new citizens should learn not only about the importance of Indigenous Australian history, as considerable and unique as it is, but also about the great debt we owe to all those who built our country—whether they be convicts, pioneering men and women, the Anzacs or the migrants who flocked to this country after World War II.
The new formula I proposed read:
I would also like to acknowledge our debt and gratitude to all our forebears: the men and women of all races and religions who through their courage, hard work and determination made Australia one of the freest, fairest and most prosperous countries on earth.
I was very fortunate. This initiative was widely publicised in the national media and the community response was overwhelmingly positive. There were also some predictable reactions, but those who called me a racist or a bigot have demonstrated once again how much out of step they are with mainstream Australia. They have also demonstrated that they have not understood my proposal in the first place. It was, as I said in my speech, `not about downplaying the role of Aboriginal Australians but about celebrating in a much more inclusive manner the contribution of all our ancestors'. Following my speech I wrote to my Queensland colleague the Hon. Gary Hardgrave, Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, asking him to consider amending any future edition of the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code to include in addition to the currently recommended recognition of Aboriginal culture my formula, which acknowledges the contribution of all our forebears to building our great country.
I can now report back to the Senate that the minister has written back to me to let me know that he has asked the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to include my proposed form of words when the code is next updated. The minister writes:
The Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code provides suggested paragraphs for use by presiding officers in their speeches. Australia's success as a democratic and multicultural society, and the role of our forebears in achieving that success, is a theme running through those paragraphs. There are many ways in which these sentiments can be expressed, and I have therefore asked my Department to include your proposed form of words when the Code is next updated.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the minister for his consideration of the issue and for his decision. I am heartened to note that colleagues have begun to use this formula and can only encourage others in light of its inclusion in the ceremonies code. I think this is a great day for commonsense and another positive step towards celebrating Australia's success as the world's greatest multicultural nation. 
I seek leave to incorporate a speech by Senator Ellison relating to the International Day of Disabled Persons.
Leave granted.
Senator Ellison's incorporated speech read as follows—
Members of this Chamber may recall that since 1999, I have been involved in the Politician Adoption Scheme. The Scheme is run by the Developmental Disability Council and I was subsequently adopted by Stephen Franklin and his family.
Stephen has Prader-Willi Syndrome, a condition which is categorised by severe physical disabilities and mental handicaps. The experiences that I have had through this Scheme have served to increase my understanding of the difficulties faced by people with disabilities and their families. These families often face incredible adversity in silence and their issues are often away from the view of other Australians. Yet they guide and care for their children with determination and dedication in what are very difficult circumstances and today we celebrate the achievement of people with disabilities and their families in the International Day of People with a DisAbility.
This past year has been an eventful one for Stephen and his family. In February, Stephen moved into a group home. The move has been a huge success for Stephen and increased his independence enormously. Carol can now enjoy spending time with Stephen without the constant strain and pressure of being his sole primary care giver. However, not one to sit back and relax now that her son has secured supported accommodation, Carol now uses her time to advocate for other families that have not yet been so fortunate and to campaign for the rights of people with disabilities, a cause that Carol has championed for many years. In April 2003, this work was recognised and Carol received a Centenary medal for service to the local and State disabled community.
It is important that today we recognise the contributions made by people with disabilities and also the vital support provided by their families.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,"<title>Alston, Senator Richard</title>",Adjournment,37,1,speech
