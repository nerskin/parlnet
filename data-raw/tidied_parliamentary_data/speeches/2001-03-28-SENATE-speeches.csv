"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-03-28,"—At the close of play last night, I had almost completed my second reading address on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Excise Arrangements) Bill 2000, and I was speaking to the amendment that I had moved to the second reading. That amendment, which has been circulated in the chamber, goes to a legitimate criticism of the government because of its attitude on petrol pricing, among other things.
The first point I want to make is that we had put in this chamber and in the House of Representatives a private member's bill to cancel the 1 February excise increase on petrol. In the House of Representatives, the government used its numbers to prevent that bill being debated. Here, the government used its numbers to talk out the debate on the bill on the three successive Thursdays that we debated it. While it was using its numbers to thwart the ability of our bill to be put to a vote in either chamber, the government itself backflipped and announced that it was going to cancel the 1 February excise increase and—
—You should be rejoicing.
—I will take that interjection and return to it in half a tick; the government also announced that it was going to cancel further indexation increases. The interjection from Senator Boswell, through you, Madam President—and congratulations on your preselection, Senator Boswell—was that we should be rejoicing. We would have rejoiced even more had you done the right, honest and fair thing and supported our bill when we put it down, because now, as it seems according to the program, we will be debating the excise adjustments tomorrow. The advantage to Australia would have applied right back then, five weeks ago. There has been a needless delay because the government attempted to resist the overwhelming pressure of the electorate and then, when it caved in, it tried to pretend that it had listened to them and it took the honour for it, when of course it could have done the right thing earlier.
The second thing I want to say is that, if the private member's bill from the government member for La Trobe were to go ahead, it would tear up the intergovernmental agreement between the federal government and the states. I just wonder to what extent politics has overwhelmed here the real responsibility for proper economic management. We know that the government is a failed economic manager. Exhibit A to that statement is the last December quarter's figures of negative economic growth. So we know that the government is a failed economic manager. Does it want to tear up the intergovernmental agreement between the federal government and the states or not?
Another issue about the private member's bill is that, since the government is the beneficiary of the windfall in GST taxation that arises out of higher petrol prices, it is the government that should declare what the total windfall gain is so we know what level of extra tax revenue above the forward estimates it has gathered so we can then calculate properly whether all of that extra revenue has been handed back. You see, there is this big question mark: until the government says what the windfall gain is, we do not know whether the extra funding in its roads package—which it passed off initially as compensation for higher petrol prices and which amounts to $1.6 billion over four years, compared to the $1.5 billion per year that the Automobile Association estimates is the extra revenue from higher petrol prices, and now there is the backflip on petrol, calculated at $555 million for the balance of this year—amounts to handing back the full level of the windfall. Australian motorists are entitled to know how much extra tax they paid and whether or not the government has refunded that to them. The serial refusal of the government to open its books and enable taxpayers to know how much extra tax they paid does suggest, since this is a serial refusal militantly pursued by the government, that the government is hiding something and that it is somewhat contemptuous of the right of taxpayers to know how much extra tax they have paid. There are a number of other points I want to make, but I commend the amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (EXCISE ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-03-28,"—The Australian Democrats do not have any problems with the Taxation Laws Amendment (Excise Arrangements) Bill 2000. So I would just warn my Labor colleagues that the next speaker might be called on earlier than the 20-minute span of a speech, because I doubt whether I will take much longer than 10 or 15 minutes. So, not having many problems, I do not have that much to say, although I obviously need to comment on some of the points made by the opposition relative to their second reading amendment.
This bill regularises the transfer of the administration of excise from the Australian Customs Service to the Australian Taxation Office, and that change occurred administratively in the 1998-1999 financial year. We do not have any particular concerns about that transfer of functions. In fact, there is a strong case that revenue raising functions should, as far as possible, all be in the hands of one authority—and the tax office is the appropriate authority. We would not have objected to this bill being dealt with as non-contro-versial, because of those reasons. So what we are really doing today is considering the second reading amendment moved by Senator Cook. It is not an amendment that bears much real relationship to the subject matter of the bill. It is an exercise in bashing the government. Well, that is the job of the opposition, so it is legitimate in that respect. However, there are a few elements of the amendment that we should concentrate on.
Item (a) is that the Senate should condemn the government for failing to listen to the community concerning the GST impact on excise levels for fuels. That is a logical point; none of us should have a problem with that point. I think what has really emerged in the electorate is a sense that the government has not been quick enough to listen to its own backbench—never mind listening to the opposition—as to what it was hearing, particularly in rural and regional Australia.
The second issue, as we know, is that the government cut excise levels on petrol by 6.7c per litre when the community was expecting a cut of 8.2c per litre—and that decision has continued to rankle. The community simply did not accept that there would be flowthrough savings of 1½c from the oil industry to compensate, and they clearly thought that it was the obligation of the government to comply with that promise. So the government's failure to listen over a long period of time was a problem for them. I think that people, voters, respect strength and determination in governments of whatever colour; but, if the government had responded prior to the 1 February automatic indexation date rather than after, in political terms it would have done a lot better. However, it has finally kept its promise on that 1½c.
Item (b) of Labor's second reading amendment condemns the government for `opposing Labor's private member's bill' and yet `condoning a government backbencher's private member's bill that would tear up the intergovernmental agreement signed with the states'. But, while the government opposed the Customs Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001 (No. 2) and the Excise Tariff Amendment (Petrol Tax Cut) Bill 2001 (No. 2), both of which were Labor bills, it is the case that those bills were ultimately made redundant when the government announced its petrol excise reduction. It was certainly the view of the Democrats that the government's package superseded Labor's bills.
As for condoning the backbencher's private member's bill from a coalition member that would tear up the intergovernmental agreement signed with the states, I assume the opposition is talking about the suggestion that the member for La Trobe, Mr Bob Charles, might introduce a bill into the House of Representatives that would impose the cost of a reduction in excise on the states. As I understand it, such a bill was never introduced, and there was no official comment by either the caucus or the cabinet supporting such a bill. If Mr Charles decides that he wants to introduce such a bill into the House of Representatives, then I would hope that there would be no opposition from either the caucus or the cabinet to his doing so. I would not expect the government to support the passage of the bill, given its stance on other matters, but I would hope that it would always support the ability of members and senators in their individual capacity to introduce private members' and private senators' bills. That is an essential freedom of this parliament, it is an essential freedom that has to be expressed in our democracy, and it should never be resisted by any party. It obviously would then be up to the parliament to debate the merits of the bill as introduced.
I do think it is a bit rich for the opposition to complain at the fact that the bills were talked out by the government. The opposition themselves have participated countless times in private senators' bills being talked out in this place. The Australian Democrats have a long history of a number of their bills having never come to a vote because of that very process. Frankly, I think that at some time the managers of government business and the managers of opposition business should determine that private senators' bills should, in fact, come to a vote and be either agreed or defeated. We all know that in this place the record of private members' and private senators' bills succeeding is very sparse. I think—and the Clerk would have the exact record of this somewhere—it is less than 10; it might be as few as seven or nine bills. I think it is a great shame, frankly, that such bills can only ever advance if the government of the day determines that they should. This is, after all, the people's house, and the government and other political parties, including the opposition, should have the opportunity to have their bills debated to finality.
Item (c) condemns the government for belatedly reducing only a portion of its GST fuel excise windfall because it was `in a state of panic'. There is little doubt that the government decision to reduce the petrol excise by 1½c per litre was caused by a final realisation in the lead-up to the Ryan by-election, and with what has been going on in the polls and other events politically, that they ought to move on this issue. The decision was subsequent to a number of fairly bad polls and was in the light of increasingly aggravated public opinion and backbench unrest over petrol pricing. You cannot really disagree with much of (c). There is the suggestion that the government reduced only a portion of its GST fuel excise windfall. It was my understanding that the government promise was that it would reduce the excise on petrol to compensate for the price increase caused by the introduction of the GST. The GST price rise was calculated to be 8.2c per litre. With the belated 1.5c per litre reduction in excise, the government ultimately kept its promise on fuel prices. The real rates of increase in fuel prices apart from that must be laid at the door of international fuel prices and not at the door of the government. However mighty we think the government of the day might be, they are not mightier than OPEC and the people who determine international fuel prices.
The other issue in relation to fuel pricing was the higher than usual indexation of petrol excise caused by the GST spike. It may or may not have been fair for the government to reduce the excise increase to take account of that spike, but they did not. As far as I am aware a promise was never given in relation to that spike. The Democrats do not believe the government handled the petrol pricing issue well but we believe, as obviously does the opposition, that the electorate will judge them on that performance. Condemnation by the opposition in this chamber, even if they feel it is justified, is of little point in relation to the eventual outcome of how the electorate are going to regard the coalition with respect to this issue.
In item (d) the opposition asks the Senate to condemn the government for `its poor administration of the excise regime'. Without wanting to be unkind to Senator Cook, this strikes me as a general and pointless criticism. While the government made a mess of the excise rates on petrol this time and whilst there is a real problem with an unkept beer promise, there is nothing to suggest that the administration of excise has been any worse under this government than it was under the previous government. In fact, in certain respects, the administration, given that it is more efficient and producing more money, might in fact be seen to have been better. I am not at all convinced by item (d). 
From my comments you will note that there are elements of the second reading amendment which are unexceptionable and which we can agree with, but we think this is a political exercise. It is a legitimate opposition tactic. It is a useful means by which to bash the government, but it is not really an amendment which will achieve much at all. So we will not be supporting it, whilst we do respect the motives that lie behind it.
In closing my remarks, I want to deal with an issue which was raised yesterday, has been raised today and will be raised again, I am sure: the question of the Democrats' performance on the petrol and diesel excise issues. We have been lectured on what the opposition regard as broken promises on sales tax and petrol. We should not forget the then Prime Minister Paul Keating's betrayal of the true believers in 1993. He went to the 1993 election opposing John Hewson's GST, opposing increased sales taxes and promising income tax cuts which he knew the country could not afford. I would have thought those were core promises. After the election, the l-a-w law tax cuts were halved and then were funded by a $3 billion increase in sales taxes, half of that from petrol. That sentence represents three broken promises: halved the promised income tax cuts, introduced massive sales taxes without compensation, and half of those came from petrol. There were broken promises everywhere. Faced with a budget careering out of control because of the unfunded tax cuts, the Democrats, led by then Democrat Cheryl Kernot, now Labor's Cheryl Kernot, reluctantly agreed to support the Labor Party's increases. I think the coalition did at the time as well. But first the Democrats insisted that the compensation for the tax hikes needed to be increased, particularly for social security beneficiaries.
Let us fast-track through to 2001, when we are being criticised by the Labor Party. The net increases in taxes as a result of the GST package is computed through the budget figures to be about $5 billion in 2002. The net increase in social security payments is computed by those same budget figures to be around $5 billion. That $5 billion equals $5 billion. The basic logic of that implies that low income earners will be better off as the $5 billion in extra GST is collected off all income levels but the $5 billion compensation is paid only to low income earners. We must not confuse this GST issue and the compensation package with other events in the economy which have stressed low income earners, such as higher interest rates and higher fuel rates resulting from OPEC problems and higher import prices.
Let me return to petrol. At the 1998 election the Democrats proposed four key changes to petrol pricing. First, we said that we would support a rebate on fuel costs for regional transport, but only for regional transport. Second, we said we would oppose the deep cuts on diesel fuel taxes, particularly in the cities, on health and environmental grounds. Third, we said we believed that the GST should not only apply to petrol; instead, the existing excises should be kept. This would have meant that bowser prices would not change but also would have meant that business would not have been able to collect GST input tax credits on fuel, worth around $1.3 billion a year. We also suggested that part of this could then be used to reduce payroll taxes at a state level. Fourth, we said the petrol industry needed to be restructured to reduce the power of oil companies, especially over regional distribution.
Let us deal with those points. Firstly, we said that we would support the rebate on fuel costs for regional transport but only for regional transport. That is what we achieved in negotiation with government. Secondly, we said we would oppose deep cuts in diesel fuel taxes, particularly in the cities, on health and environmental grounds. That is what we achieved with the government: there was no cut in those diesel fuel taxes in the cities on health and environmental grounds. We won nearly $1 billion worth of cuts to diesel or proposed diesel rates, but we could not persuade the government to change its mind on petrol excise. If we had, then the problems with country price differentials with GST offsets and the unnecessary $1.3 billion in petrol tax deductions for business could have been avoided. 
However, let us go back to that. As our third promise we said that we believed the GST should not apply to petrol, instead the existing excises should be kept. We could not persuade the government to that. You cannot persuade in negotiations a government to do everything you want to achieve. This would have meant that the bowser prices would not change. What was achieved almost in compensation was that business—contrary to our original position—was able to access GST input tax credits on fuel worth about $1.3 billion a year. So if the Labor Party want to condemn us for allowing business to get GST input tax credits on fuel, they can be our guest, but there is nobody in small business, or business or the farming industry that will agree with them.
The last promise—if you can put it that way—was that we said the petrol industry needed to be restructured to reduce the power of oil companies, especially over regional distribution. We have had no opportunity to negotiate that outcome. The Labor Party have had discussions with us on that issue. My understanding of their position, as expressed by their spokesperson, is that they are far more sympathetic to our view than is the government. Perhaps we will be able to deal with that particular promise in due course with the opposition if they ever become the government. In the meantime we continue to urge the coalition to attend to a necessary restructuring of the petroleum industry.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (EXCISE ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-03-28,"—We are discussing the Taxation Laws Amendment (Excise Arrangements) Bill 2000. The purpose of the bill is primarily to codify the transfer of the excise function of Customs to the Australian Taxation Office. This followed the physical transfer of this function announced in the administrative orders on, I think, 21 October 1998. The bill will amend the Excise Act 1901, the Customs Act 1901 and will repeal redundant provisions of the Distillation Act 1901 and the Spirits Act 1906. It also makes minor consequential amendments to the Coal Excise Act, the Customs Administration Act, the Excise Act, the Fuel (Penalty Surcharges) Administration Act and the Taxation Administration Act 1953. 
Firstly, I make the point that we are dealing with a piece of legislation to transfer the administrative functions about 2½ years after it was actually implemented. That in itself is a legitimate concern which should be responded to by the minister either at the conclusion of this debate or at some time during the committee stage. Why has it taken 2½ years to carry out the legal ratification of the practical transfer that occurred 2½ years ago? I do not know what Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, has been doing—we often ask that question—but I think it is yet a further reflection on the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, that it has taken 2½ years to deal with legislation which is in itself not particularly controversial. 
The provisions of the bill, firstly, transfer the responsibility for the administration of excise legislation from the CEO of Customs to the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody, who has been acting in this role for at least a year and a half. Secondly, they formally extend the confidentiality that currently applies to taxation matters to excise matters. Thirdly, they incorporate in the Excise Act the powers of officers that are currently conferred by the Customs Act for excise purposes. Fourthly, they require the forfeit of goods seized by police officers to be dealt with in the same way as forfeited goods seized by officers exercising powers for excise purposes.
This bill does provide for some toughening up of provisions which are essential, particularly in the area of the dangerous practice of fuel substitution. In the initial package of seven bills in 1997, Labor supported the initiatives at that time, and I think the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, can justifiably be criticised for his failure to act a lot earlier in respect of the issue of fuel substitution. There have been a number of fuel substitution scandals, the most notable of which was the evasion of excise through the addition of toluene. This has led to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in excise revenue. The issue is not only the lost revenue in this area but also the practice of fuel substitution being a threat to safety in respect of fuel used by motor vehicles in this country. 
Following pressure from the Labor opposition and the Labor state fair trading ministers, the Liberal-National parties have finally taken belated action, including changing excise rates on toluene and introducing a bill to strengthen the ability of the ATO to prosecute those engaged in fuel substitution. Labor, having called for a crackdown in this area, certainly supports the measures. It is disappointing—though hardly surprising—that the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, took so long to act in this particular area.
Of course, the tax issues we are dealing with in this legislation relate to excise. I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to this government's massive increase in excise collection, as outlined in its own Budget Paper No. 1, `Budget strategy and outlook 2000-01'. If we go to table 6, `Indirect Tax', on page 5-13, we see the massive increase in excise tax being collected by this government in the current financial year. We find petroleum products and unleaded petrol on that list. In 1999-2000, $5,044 million was collected. In 2000-01, that increases to $5,993 million. That is almost $6 billion in excise from unleaded petrol. That is an 18.8 per cent increase. In 1999-2000, $1,445 million was collected from leaded petrol. That is estimated to go down in the year 2000-01 to $1,354 million. That is a decrease of minus 6.3 per cent. That is occurring because there is a switch from leaded petrol to unleaded petrol. Diesel excise increases from $4,614 million in 1999-2000 to $5,232 million in 2000-01. That is an increase of 13.4 per cent. There are other excises, including aviation gasoline, aviation turbine fuel, fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene. Excise collected from those increases from $100 million a year to $130 million a year—an increase of 29.9 per cent.
We look further down the list. In 1999-2000, $892 million was collected in beer excise. In the year 2000-01, it is estimated that $1,441 million will be collected—a staggering increase of 61 per cent. In 1999-2000, $152 million was collected in excise on spirits. That increases to $245 million—an increase of 61.7 per cent. In 1999-2000, $1,740 million was collected from excise on tobacco products. That increases in 2000-01 to $5,124 million—an increase of 194 per cent. Total excise collected in the areas that I have outlined in 1999-2000 was $2,783 million. That increases to $6,810 million in the year 2000-01—an increase of 144.7 per cent.
This is a staggering increase in excise collected from the range of products that I have outlined: unleaded petrol, diesel, beer, spirits and tobacco products. The only area where excise collection goes down is leaded petrol, and that is not because there is a reduction in the tax levels but because there is a reduction in the use of leaded fuels. So we have a staggering increase in the excise take by the Liberal-National Party government. It is a record level of excise collection. This is in part why the Liberal-National Party has become the highest taxing government in Australian history bar wartime.
If we look at page 8-42 of the same budget papers, the total tax collection as a percentage of gross domestic product is listed, and that is the traditional, accepted measure of tax levels. In the table on page 8-42, in 1999-2000 tax collections as a percentage of gross domestic product are listed at 26.1 per cent. The table then shows a decline in the year 2000-01 to 23 per cent, a further decline in the year 2001-02 to 26.2 per cent and, in the following two out years, a decline to 22.6 per cent. You have to ask yourself: why do we have this massive increase in excise tax collection when the budget papers show a decline in tax collected as a percentage of gross domestic product, particularly when I have just claimed—and claimed correctly—that this is the highest taxing government in Australian history bar the wartime period? The answer is quite simple. The government has excluded GST revenues from its own tax collection table. If you include GST revenue collection in the tax table and recalculate Commonwealth tax as a percentage of gross domestic product, tax as a percentage of gross domestic product rises to just over 24 per cent.
We get the constant assertion from representatives of the Liberal-National Party that they are a low tax government, when that is not correct. The only way they can achieve that claim is by excluding GST revenues. Of course, they argue it is a state tax. The GST is of course collected under a Commonwealth head of power. The government proudly boast about the implementation of their GST as part of their tax reform package. By any normal accounting standard, the revenue collected from GST, which is outlined on page 4-20 of the budget papers, should be included in Commonwealth tax revenue collection. Never mind that the states spend the money. We all know that at least so far the money is allocated to the states. The Commonwealth collect the GST, and the government proudly boast of the GST and its implementation as part of tax reform.
I referred earlier to the staggering increase in excise taxes under the Liberal and National parties. I also referred to the massive increase in beer excise in particular. I want to touch on this very briefly because we will be coming to specific legislation on beer excise later in the week. I do not know how many beer drinkers in the pubs and clubs around Australia had a copy of the ANTS package. I do not suspect it was very many. The ANTS package refers to a 1.9 per cent increase in beer prices as a result of the GST, and it refers to this 1.9 per cent increase relating to packaged beer. However, during the election campaign the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, fudged the issue. Frankly, I am being generous to the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. I could accuse him in far stronger language but I will not do that. It is interesting to look at the comments that Mr Howard made during the election campaign about the price of beer. He said on the John Laws program on 23 September 1998:
There'll be no more than a 1.9 per cent rise in ordinary beer. 
There is no explanation that his promise to the Australian electorate related only to packaged beer. I do not believe that anyone can possibly claim that the beer drinkers of Australia in the pubs and the clubs, listening to the Prime Minister, had on hand an ANTS package—all 500 pages of it—and looked in it to see whether in fact the Prime Minister was referring to packaged beer or a glass of beer. The Prime Minister said on 14 August 1998, on the Alan Jones program:
Across the board there is virtually no change in relation to alcohol. A tiny CPI equivalent rise in relation to ordinary beer.
Again, there was no mention by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, that the promise related only to packaged beer, unless you read the ANTS package—the 500-page document that the government put out. This is an example of the Prime Minister misleading the Australian electorate about the impact of excise and the GST in respect of its application to beer. 
To confirm the claim that I have just made, we need to look no further—and Senator Ian Campbell, who might respond, would be aware of this—than Mr Cameron, the former Liberal Party member for Stirling. On Perth radio 6PR this Liberal member of parliament, who was a member of Mr Howard's government, said:
I was a member of the government that went to the 1998 election with that policy and I can tell you I was led to believe, by the powers that be—
an obvious reference to either the Treasurer or the Prime Minister—
that beer would only go up by 1.9 per cent. There was no differentiation between stubbies, cans or middies. We were simply told a beer would go up by 1.9 per cent and it was a common question asked of me and asked of the government because many Australians love a cold beer, as we know. And it wouldn't be proper for me to reveal what goes on in the government party room back then when I was an MP, but I can tell you what was not said.
So this is clear evidence of the Prime Minister misleading the public of Australia in his references to the price of beer going up by only 1.9 per cent when in fact it was a commitment relating only to packaged beer—and it has come from none other than a member of Mr Howard's own Liberal government, Mr Cameron, the member for Stirling. We will deal with the breaking of that promise in legislation that we will deal with later in the week.
As I said earlier, this is a high taxing government as a percentage of gross domestic product. It is one of the highest taxing governments in Australian history bar the wartime period. I am pleased to note that finally some journalists have caught up with these budget figures and started to expose this government as a high taxing government. Why wouldn't it be a high taxing government, given the government's own budget figures that I have outlined in respect of excise and given that it has implemented a goods and services tax?
To conclude, the second reading amendment moved by the Labor Party, firstly, condemns the government for failing to listen to community concern over the GST impact on excise levels. The GST has clearly impacted significantly on excise, as I have mentioned, and I referred to the figures earlier. There is no better example of the Prime Minister blatantly misleading the Australian people than in respect of his commitment on beer prices. There is no better example of the Prime Minister misleading the Australian people than in respect of petrol prices—he said that the GST would not increase the price of petrol, when it did by between 1.5c and 2c a litre. 
Secondly, we condemn the government for condoning a Liberal backbencher's private bill, the effect of which is to force the states to reduce tax collections on petrol. Whatever we think of that proposal, it is in clear breach of the intergovernmental agreement signed by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the states. The states were assured that they would be able to spend GST revenues as they desired. The Commonwealth should not be interfering in that area.
Thirdly, our amendment makes the comment that the GST fuel excise reduction—which we will be dealing with later in the week—is a result of electoral panic by this government. I do not think anyone could seriously claim that this government is not in panic mode at the moment. Fourthly, we condemn the poor administration of the excise regime—and I have referred to that—in relation to the fuel substitute scandal, which the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, has finally and belatedly done something about.
This amendment should be supported. I note that the Democrats are not supporting our amendment. I am disappointed but I am, frankly, not surprised. The implementation of the GST saw the Democrats enter into a partnership with the government. Who can forget that photo of Senator Lees and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, shaking hands and smiling after they had done the deal to support the implementation of a GST?

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-03-28,"—I thank colleagues opposite for contributing to this second reading debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Excise Arrangements) Bill 2000, although people who have had the pleasure of listening to this debate on the radio or who will have the more doubtful pleasure of reading this debate in Hansard at some stage in the future will probably find it hard to link any of the sentences uttered by those opposite—with the exclusion and notable exception of Senator Andrew Murray of the Democrats—to the provisions of this bill. To Senator Sherry's credit, he did at least spend a few seconds of his first minute on his feet referring to these arrangements, and in fact asked a serious question about why this bill was not introduced earlier. 
To remind honourable senators, the bill—apart from a number of other what you would call machinery provisions or tidying up matters—ostensibly seeks to transfer the general administration of the excise legislation from the Chief Executive Officer of Customs to the Commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office. Senator Sherry raised what I regard as a serious point in relation to why it has taken until now to bring this measure before the parliament. I think he would agree that the arrangements that are in place are working quite effectively. The commissioner is in fact exercising these powers and has been doing so for some time now under an entirely normal practice, that of delegation. That is a quite normal administrative procedure that is entirely constitutional and legal. This bill seeks to put that into law because the law should reflect practice. There is certainly no serious criticism of it taking some time to be formalised.
As you would know better than most, Madam Acting Deputy President Crowley, this parliament deals with many pieces of legislation in any given sitting period. The government, in consultation with the opposition on many occasions, has to set priorities in terms of financial and other matters. In fact, when it has come to dealing with excise matters, this government and the parliament have been assiduous in ensuring that the excise regime has integrity. To that end we have brought forward pieces of legislation, including the Petroleum Excise Amendment (Measures to Address Evasion) Bill 2000, which was passed through this place, as I recall, last year, and the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000, both dealing with very important issues of excise evasion. 
I think there was absolute thunderous agreement across the aisle in relation to the need to ensure that the excise regime did have integrity and that those people who seek to avoid excise by fuel substitution, for example, or racketeering in tobacco and other products need to be brought to the attention of the authorities and need to be intercepted, and the government of course introduced a very strict regime. In fact, I noticed on the television news last night that this regime has been successful in uncovering a major racket in tobacco in the past 24 hours, and I commend the authorities for their success in doing that. What I am saying is that those very important legislative amendments that seek to improve the integrity of the excise regime have taken legislative priority over what we would regard as only a minor administrative rearrangement—which is, nonetheless, an important rearrangement.
The debate on the second reading has centred around what is known in the game as a pious amendment moved by Senator Peter Cook, an amendment on the second reading which seeks to score political points off the government. I will not deal with the gist of the amendment in too much detail because, quite seriously, I do not believe that it deserves that much attention. It seeks to make some statements about the government's decisions in relation to fuel excises. Senator Sherry sought to support Senator Cook's amendment by referring to the increase in excise collections in the budget papers. He destroyed his own argument when he referred to the figures in relation to the excise collections on leaded fuel. Most people in Australia who visit their petrol station regularly, as I certainly do, will have picked up the point that Senator Sherry has just figured out—that is, that leaded fuel has not actually been available at petrol stations for some time now. 
Those of us who drive older cars that used to run on leaded fuel have figured out there are all these different sorts of fuel you can buy that do not have lead in them. I am sure that is a very good thing for the environment and for all of our brains that have been attacked by the invisible forces of lead in the atmosphere for all these years. Senator Sherry has actually figured this out. And he has figured out why there has been a drop in excise collections on leaded fuel—that is, because of the fact that fuel companies do not sell it any more. He made the point that it was not due to some drop in the excise on leaded fuel, that it was because there is less fuel sold. 
By making that point he makes quite articulately the case for why the excise on other fuels has gone up. The indexation introduced by the Australian Labor Party in government in the 1980s, which introduced the automatic, inflation linked indexation of excise, will be abolished by this Liberal government that believes in lower taxes and smaller government through a bill which hopefully will be passed through this place at some stage in the next few days, which will ensure that the excise in real terms does not actually increase. So the only reason for increases in excise will be that people are buying more fuel. Senator Sherry, of course, refused to make that point. 
When you have had an economy that has been in a significant growth trend for all of the years of the Howard-Costello government, you would expect an expansion of economic activity, growth of the economy, more small businesses being created and more people in employment—something like 800,000 more people are in employment. In fact, while we are talking about employment, the point should be made that the Australian Labor Party seek to attack the new tax system and call it a `job destroying tax'. The reality is that, since the introduction of the new tax system, employment has continued to grow very strongly, and significantly more strongly than under the disastrous policies of the previous Hawke and Keating governments, when—as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy President Crowley—something like a million breadwinners were put out of work, creating devastating results for a million households around this nation, putting so many people into economic turmoil. We understand what the impacts were of those policies that put a million people out of work. They created in this nation—under the government that Senator Peter Cook was a part of—a recession that the Treasurer at the time, in his incredible arrogance, said was a recession we had to have. It was engineered: they actually made some decisions not to slow the economy but to stop it and send it backwards at high speed.
When people hear the rhetoric about roll-back coming out of this Australian Labor Party opposite that struggle to release policies, they should think back to what roll-back meant in the days of that recession we were told we had to have. They are very good at rolling back economies: creeping up a hill, then trying to pull on the handbrake and finding that the old car they are driving slides backwards at a rate of knots, wiping out millions of people as they go out of control.
Senator Cook in his speech said something about the latest national accounts figures that were released and that Senator Rod Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, has so eloquently referred to when asked about them in question time. The record shows, on those national accounts, that there was a minor contraction in the economy during the last quarter of last year. Senator Cook said that that is exhibit A and that means we are bad economic managers. But I will use Senator Cook's logic to make a point about that. As Senator Kemp has made quite clear, a minor contraction in one quarter was the result of an artificial contraction in one sector that makes up five per cent of the economy, and that is the housing sector. 
If you look at the housing sector over the last two or three years, you will see that in trend terms that sector has had one of the most successful periods of its operation in the history of Australia: more young people, more families, have been building more houses than ever before in the history of this most wonderful land we live in. But, because of the transitional provisions bringing in the new tax system, there was a huge bring forward of activity prior to 1 July last year and, quite naturally, a fall-off of activity. Of course, that was predicted and it has had an effect—a larger effect than any of us would have wanted—on the expansion. But if Senator Cook says that that small contraction proves we are bad economic managers then, on his own logic, the worst economic managers in the history of this nation were obviously those at the time of that massive recession, the worst since the war and almost since the 1930s, which drove a million people out of work and saw interest rates driven up to over 30 per cent for small businesses. That is the reality for the Australian people as they make decisions about who can manage the economy better. It is a crucial thing.
People look at economics and economic management and they hear politicians and economists talking about it, and it seems very dry and irrelevant. When you talk about the national debt or GDP or ratios of this and that, quite frankly, for the people in the suburbs of Australia, that makes their eyes glaze over—it does not affect them. But the importance of economic management of course does affect them—as you know, Madam Acting Deputy President, and as colleagues opposite know. If you run high debts, if you run high spending, if you run the economy badly—as we saw for so many of those 13 years under Labor—you drive the interest rates of home owners up to over 17 per cent, you drive the interest rates of small businesses up over 30 per cent, you destroy those people's disposable income, you destroy the value of their homes—in which often most people have most of their savings tied up—you destroy the small businesses that employ so many of our citizens and you destroy the economy. You actually destroy the social fabric of the nation. So economic management is intrinsically linked to the quality of life, the freedom that people enjoy to pursue their own dreams and hopes. If you have people who do not understand how to run an economy, who are not responsible economic managers, then you destroy the social fabric of the nation.
As we all know, it is a matter of history, a matter of record, that there are still people in Australia who are recovering from the devastation that was wrought upon them by the Labor Party's economic policies. And the same people who ran those economic policies—with the exception of only Mr Keating and Mr Willis, who have left the place—are on the front bench: Mr Crean, Mr Beazley, Senator Cook and others who were all part of the decision making processes that saw Australia drive at full speed into a brick wall and destroy the lives of so many people. Many of those people who were forced to sell their homes against their will, who were the subject of mortgagee auctions, who saw their small businesses go to the wall, who are still paying off those debts, who lost the equity in their homes, have never been able to buy homes again. They will never forget what the previous government did. I, for one, will not allow them to forget it.
The only other response I would make to comments made during the second reading debate is in relation to the furphy that has been put out by Senator Sherry and that has been picked up by a couple of journalists who have accepted at face value Senator Sherry's arguments about the taxing and spending history in Australia. The record will show—and this is where there is some duplicity and hypocrisy from some people opposite—that the government, at question time after question time and in press release after press release put out by populists from the other side, are criticised for their spending reductions. We are criticised for reducing Commonwealth spending. We are told we should spend more in all of these different areas.
When we came to power, we had revealed to us by Treasury that we had a $10 billion deficit, when Senator Cook opposite had been saying right up to Christmas in 1995 that the budget was in surplus and the economy was going along nicely. Talk about deficit denial! Senator Cook is saying we are not telling people the full facts about petrol excise, GST revenues and this windfall he hopes to find. This is the senator who stood up in this place and said that the budget was in surplus and just a few weeks later the truth was revealed, and that was that we were $10 billion in deficit—not a few hundred million or a few billion but $10 billion. Senator Cook has the audacity to come in here and say that we are not telling the full facts. We are the government that actually brought in the charter of budget honesty so no government can ever get away with the duplicity and cover-up of the fiscal affairs of the nation in the way that Senator Peter Cook, the then finance minister Mr Kim Beazley, Prime Minister Paul Keating and others did in their gross deception of the Australian people prior to the 1996 election.
The facts are that the Commonwealth tax burden has fallen substantially under this government and I know you in particular, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, would be very proud of that achievement. This government has seen the tax burden—which was around 23.4 per cent of GDP back in 1996-97 when this government came to power—drop to around 21 per cent of GDP by this year, making Australia one of the lower taxing countries on the globe. That is a proud boast from someone who believes quite earnestly—as you, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, and our other colleagues believe—that government should be as small as it can be. It needs to be an effective and efficient government that helps people but if it is too big, is too bloated and is ripping too many tax dollars out of the back pockets of hardworking taxpayers, it destroys their freedom, their incentive and their capability to spend their money how they choose to, rather than how politicians and bureaucrats in Canberra choose to spend it for them.
On the expenditure side of the budget, this government inherited from the Labor Party, when they were in government, spending which was averaging around 26 per cent of GDP. That was much higher, I might reinforce, than the spending patterns of the Whitlam government, which went down in history as one of the most spendthrift governments on the planet. Mr Keating and Mr Beazley, when he was finance minister, actually managed to out-Whitlam Mr Whitlam. They spent more money and raised taxes. This government quite proudly has reduced the incidence of tax on citizens and reduced government spending as a share of GDP from 26 per cent of GDP to about 24 per cent in the latest fiscal year.
If Senator Sherry wants to say that GST revenue—the entirety of which is collected and sent to the states to pay for schools, hospitals and roads—should somehow be incorporated, then he will have a big argument to put. Senator Sherry said something that scares me today and he is going to have to explain himself on it. While he admitted that the GST money was allocated entirely to the states without reduction and without exception—every last cent goes to the states: just as we were forced to collect the excise for the states after the High Court decision, we now collect the GST for them and return it—Senator Sherry said something that was quite alarming, and it needs to be addressed by his leader. 
We do not know the Labor Party's policy on what they are going to do to the GST. They have said they will take it off tampons. That is roll-back so far. If you listened to Senator Murphy's questions during question time yesterday, you would think that they may have a policy to take it off hats. But that is all we know so far. Senator Sherry has raised a very scary prospect for the Labor Party—in particular for Mr Bracks, Mr Carr and Dr Gallop. He said, `So far, the money is allocated to the states.' Does this give us an inkling of Labor's policy? This may well be the way they are going to pay for their promises—that is, to stop some of that GST going to the states. That is the question Senator Sherry will have to answer some other day.
Amendment not agreed to.
Original question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (EXCISE ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2001-03-28,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1999 deals with two unrelated tax issues. The first of those involves a sales tax exemption for what are called `exempt entities'. The bill will tighten the sales tax law to remove the current blanket exemption that applies to items for use in properties owned or leased to tax exempt bodies. Such bodies tend to be state governments, charities and/or foreign governments. This bill will only allow the exemption where the tax exempt entity actually uses the property. In addition, certain types of properties will completely lose the right to an exemption, including shops and shopping centres, hotels, casinos and apartment blocks. At present, a windfall sales tax exemption arises when business which is ordinarily subject to sales tax is conducted on property owned by a tax exempt entity. This in turn provides an unfair advantage to such businesses at the expense of the Commonwealth and to their competitors. This bill will therefore limit the exemption to the circumstances where the tax exempt entity itself, and not a private sector commercial interest, will benefit from the exemption. This move is supported in principle by the Labor Party.
However, the effect of the proposal applies to existing contracts where the developer may be hit with a new tax liability but will not apparently be able to pass it on. The bill proposes that the new sales tax liability will apply to any dealing on or after 2 April 1998, unless the goods are required on or before 2 April 1998, which is the date that the original legislation dealing with this matter was introduced into the House. The proposal as drafted may result in some unfair outcomes—and this was raised in evidence to the committee that inquired into the bill—in particular, low margin fixed price contracts. For example, contracts relating to some Olympic projects were highlighted where the developer would have to pay the tax but not be able to pass on the cost to the owner of the infrastructure.
Given the recognition of this problem, the Labor Party recommended in its minority report of October 1999 that the bill be amended to ensure that it does not apply retrospectively to contracts entered into before 2 April 1998 but which would not be completed until after 2 April 1998 and would therefore incur the sales tax, although this would be nonrecoverable as it was not written into the contract. Accordingly, in the absence of any government amendment to rectify this anomaly, the Labor opposition—and I now emphasise the word `was'—was proposing an amendment to give effect to our recommendation. I say `was' because a government amendment has now been circulated in the chamber and has just come to hand which incorporates all of the elements that I have just been speaking about and in fact opposes schedule 1. The impact document associated with the government amendment says:
Financial impact: The initial financial impact of this measure was costed at $10 million in 1998 and $50 million in subsequent years.
Because the costing seems to have been related to figures drawn in 1998 and, dare I say, this is 2001—some three years later—I will have a question in the committee stage to the government, and I foreshadow it now, about whether the original estimates of the cost of this measure remain true or whether they are adjusted because of inflation. The question of this backflip by the government and the revenue cost imposed is important in the general debate about the state of the surplus, given the other backflips that have had a significant revenue impact.
Let me proceed with the second part of this legislation. The other major item that this legislation deals with is arrangements treated as a sale and loan and limited recourse debt. The objective of the proposal is to prevent taxpayers obtaining deductions for capital expenditures in excess of their actual outlays. This situation can arise when the balance of a debt which has financed the expenditure is not paid and the financier can recover only a specific asset on the termination of the finance agreement. The types of financing arrangements covered are hire-purchase, instalment financing and nonrecourse debt. The provisions are, I have to say, highly complex and have been quite controversial with the accounting, legal and construction sectors. 
An earlier draft of the provisions was referred to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee and the new bill has indeed been modified to take some of those concerns into account. In principle, the legislation is supported by Labor as it is aimed at ensuring that taxpayers do not receive windfalls simply due to the type of financing undertaken. However, it is important that legitimate transactions do not suffer from overzealous drafting. For example, under the provisions as originally framed in the original bill, all refinancing of debt on a gas pipeline would have been effectively taxed at the company rate. This would have apparently made such projects uneconomic. So, as I have said, we intend to support the bill.
Having dealt with those substantive issues contained in this bill, I would like now to make some general comments. Perhaps the first general comment I should make is that, in the previous legislation that was before the chamber, the parliamentary secretary in his summing up gave me, in his mind, a terrible bath about some of the comments I had made in that debate. That is not relevant to this debate, but I just say for the record that I will reserve a time to comprehensively reply to and dismiss some of those arguments.
Let me turn to this legislation that is before us today and, again, out of fear of sounding repetitious, I must say: here we go again. Here we go again because, in this chamber, we are being asked, God knows, for the hundredth time to clean up the mess created that has been solely due to, I have to say, the bumbling incompetence of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. I do not know how many more times we have to go about doing this, and it does reflect on the capacity and competence of the minister in his job of administering the tax laws of this country.
We are being asked to give, for example, legislative effect to a government tax change that applies from April 1998. That is a proposal which is now three years old. What is more, it involves a change to the then 1998 sales tax legislation. To put it bluntly, this is a fairly incompetent and disgraceful approach in simply keeping up to date with and across the timely amendment of tax laws, and it is about time that the government learned to manage its legislative agenda. 
Tax is a controversial issue at the best of times, but to be legislating in March 2001 about sales tax laws that applied in April 1998 is a hell of a stretch when it comes to arguing that the government is managing its affairs on taxation anything like efficiently. We know that taxpayers who will be caught with this legislation are, in theory, supposed to know about all of these changes and be across them. Did you know in April 1998 that we would be legislating in this manner in March 2001? If you did, good luck to you, but I suspect that most taxpayers affected by these measures did not know about them then and did not know about them, for example, in March 1999 or March 2000. As a consequence, maybe retrospectively, they are caught in a situation which is not of their making, because they arranged their affairs without realising that they were going to be caught in March 2001 by the way this legislation, no matter how important it is, now applies.
What is worse is that the amendments in regard to limited recourse debt apply to debts that were terminated—and this is the second leg of the double—after 27 February 1998. That is what the government said in its second reading speech in the House of Representatives. Is it any wonder that the community is turning against this government and its ability to manage tax change in this country at a rate of knots? This highlights the incompetent management of the application of tax laws in this country, and notably by the minister responsible, Senator Kemp. This is, after all, the same minister who was responsible for the detailed implementation of the GST. 
The standout performance of poor management in relation to the GST has to be the business activity statement. Small business told the government almost from day one that this was an unmanageable document. We raised it time and time again, and the government's defence was that it was a simple, two-page document. A simple, two-page document that took 196 pages to explain how to fill out those two pages! But the government said it was a simple, two-page document, and in the face of real concern by the community, particularly by small business—the sector the government purports to defend—it defended the extra red tape it was ladling on the back of small business, the extra hours it was requiring small business to spend filling out these forms and the conversion of small business away from their core business interests into agents of the tax office. All of those things were resisted by the government and this minister until after a couple of state election results in which the Liberal Party was defeated in Western Australia and Queensland. Then, in the face of the impending political demise of the government, it suddenly found that what we had been saying and what small business had been saying for so long was true and backflipped. The trouble is that the government has not backflipped properly and there are still residual problems with the position it has taken, but that is a story for another day.
My point is that the legislation we are considering, particularly given the repeal amendment that has been circulated, once again indicates that the government is legislating these things on the run. The government proposes to repeal a major part of its bill in the Senate. The government passed the bill in the House, but now that the bill is in here, the amendment is to knock that part out. What sort of grasp has this administration got on what it wants to do about tax? What responsibility does the government take for managing the tax affairs of this nation in a responsible manner?
Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, not because you are in the chair—although I do acknowledge what I regard as a quite important and constructive role you as a senator have played in this—but because the second leg of the double in these tax amendments relates to nonrecourse loans in part, I go to the inquiry by the Senate Economics Committee on what is euphemistically called mass marketed tax effective schemes. The use of the English language here is always something that I find fascinating. `Mass marketed' means in this case promoting as widely as possible, and `tax effective' means minimising your tax or avoiding taxation. These are mass marketed schemes to do that, and that is what the Senate committee has been inquiring into.
Nonrecourse loans are part of the way some promoters are proposing to finance deductions claimed by taxpayers that it would seem temporarily advantage the taxpayer, massively advantage the promoters in most of the schemes I have witnessed, and ultimately lead to a tax liability being generated from the tax office. I have to say that is disputed by the advocates of these schemes and in some cases widely disputed by the taxpayers who in this case are the clients of these schemes. I think there is a significant problem emerging in the community about this.
It is not appropriate at this time to do anything other than simply draw attention to the matter, because the issue is being inquired into by the committee. I, like you, Mr Acting Deputy President, have sat on this committee and heard quite moving evidence from taxpayers about the impact of moves for recovery by the tax office on their personal wellbeing, financial health and so forth. One cannot help but be moved by the fact that these people are facing in some cases quite severe economic impost, if not ruin. That is not to say that the tax office is necessarily wrong, and the question of who is right and who is wrong here is a matter that will eventually be determined at law, as it must. 
But it does focus on a point which it is relevant to highlight, despite the fact that the inquiry is not complete and the committee has not formed its recommendations: that is, anyone listening to the evidence that has been generated could reasonably make the deduction that some of these schemes—I do not necessarily say all of them—are being promoted in such a way that ordinary taxpayers are being gulled or their ignorance of tax laws is taken advantage of and they are being put in a situation of risk. I take the opportunity now to draw to the government's attention the argument that exists here that the enforcement authorities do have access to the legal means to deal with `shonky promoters', but another argument which also seems to be emerging is that those agencies—ASIC being the prime one—are not necessarily properly resourced to do the job. At this stage of the inquiry I make no judgment about that; I merely draw attention to the fact that a clear strand of evidence of that nature has emerged, and I think it is a matter of some consideration.
As I have said in my address, we had an amendment to the first section which the government is proposing now to repeal. That would make our amendment unnecessary and, as a consequence, at the appropriate time I will withdraw it. But we do support the remainder of the bill.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-03-28,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1999 in its current form contains measures to ensure that the sales tax exemption for goods placed in properties owned or leased by always exempt persons or foreign governments is only available for the purchase of goods acquired for their own use. It also contains measures to treat certain hire-purchase agreements as sale and loan arrangements for income tax purposes to ensure that excessive tax benefits are not obtained. So in that respect, it is a tidying up bill.
I understand from communication between my office and the office of the Assistant Treasurer that the government plans to scrap the amendments dealing with sales tax set out in schedule 1 to this bill, and I understand that those amendments have now been circulated. The problem with those amendments is well set out in the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into this bill. The Democrats assisted in the initiation of this inquiry. Essentially the amendments would have disallowed certain sales tax exemptions in respect of dealings after 2 April 1998. The measures would not have applied to goods acquired on or before 2 April 1998 when the announcement was made.
The concern with the bill raised by the committee was that contracts may have been entered into prior to April 1998 with the knowledge that a sales tax exemption would be available and a price negotiated on that basis. But goods purchased subsequent to that date would have attracted sales tax, therefore affecting the contractual obligations and the return available to those carrying out the contracts. The result would have been that many subcontractors would have been liable to sales tax in respect of goods purchased where they priced their work based on being sales tax exempt. In many respects that could have proved quite disastrous to them.
The Democrats had planned to move an amendment to the bill in accordance with a suggestion by one of the submissions to the inquiry, and we had requested the Clerk to draft that amendment. I note that the ALP, the Labor Party, circulated an amendment this morning in the same form that we intended.
Earlier this morning we were informed that the government would not be proceeding with schedule 1. We are pleased with that decision from the perspective of subcontractors, who will no longer need to work out how they are going to fund a new sales tax liability which disadvantages them. I must confess, however, that our amendment would not have gone anywhere near as far as the government's complete abandonment of schedule 1. Our amendment and Labor's amendment would have simply excluded dealings or goods acquired for the purpose of performing a contract entered into on or before 2 April 1998. That would have meant, if you were a subcontractor who had bound himself to a fixed price prior to 2 April 1998, that any goods you purchased after that date to fulfil the contract would have continued to be sales tax exempt. In other words, it was a transitional arrangement to prevent people being disadvantaged who were mid-contract.
I will be interested to hear the government's rationale for completely abandoning schedule 1, particularly given that I believe it was known by them that the Labor Party and the Democrats were supportive of the schedule, if amended. The explanatory notes to the amendments state:
Given that sales tax ceased to apply from 1 July 2000 with the introduction of the GST, it is considered that the additional compliance burdens which taxpayers could face if the measure was passed outweigh the benefits that it could now provide.
The expected revenue loss as a result of the decision is $10 million in 1998 and $50 million in 1999. So what the government is saying is that $60 million of revenue benefits are outweighed by the additional compliance burdens which taxpayers could face. I struggle to believe that is the case, which can only mean that perhaps the expected revenue was overstated or else the government has taken a decision on principle grounds, not on revenue grounds. We are curious about the decision. We cannot but think that, had the government got itself in order and organised the House of Representatives and the Senate to deal with this bill more expediently, it may have been better placed to collect at least $50 million of that $60 million. The longer in terms of time we get from the now redundant sales tax regime the more ridiculous, legislatively speaking, it becomes to try to retrospectively collect tax avoided under that regime.
This bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 11 March 1999—that is, two years ago—but these amendments were originally contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1998, and that bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 2 April 1998. It is astonishing that we are only dealing with the amendments three years later on 28 March 2001—hence, I suppose, the opposition referring to the progress of this bill as indicative of bumbling incompetence.
The Democrats are always supportive of the full consideration of legislation through committees and through this chamber and, hopefully, through the House of Representatives chamber. But for it to take three years for amending legislation to reach this stage is nothing short of ridiculous. I am sure that members of the coalition caucus will feel concerned at that state of affairs—and perhaps some judicious kicking of some attitudes in that process should occur. I am a little suspicious that the abandonment of the schedule has arisen from a degree of embarrassment on the part of government that they are trying to collect sales tax from three years ago—especially since sales tax is a tax which no longer exists. In any event, we will not oppose the government's amendment to remove schedule 1 from the bill.
The other aspect of the bill deals with the treatment of hire-purchase or limited recourse finance arrangements as sale and loan agreements for income tax purposes, to ensure that excessive tax benefits are not obtained. I could give you my detailed summary of the case for that, but the case is pretty self-evident and the Democrats will support that. As the government says, the adjustment to taxable income will reflect the amounts that remain unpaid when the debt arrangement is terminated.
Senator Brown has suggested an amendment to the bill, which I now understand the Labor Party have issued as a similar amendment. The Australian Democrats have long favoured the use of taxation to achieve a favourable conservation outcome. I am reminded of former Democrats Senator Colin Mason, who successfully amended the income tax assessment bill in 1983, nearly two decades ago, to remove tax breaks for the removal of indigenous trees. I am also reminded of our move to reduce in 1991 the sales tax on recycled paper, which was taxed at 21 per cent—a ludicrous rate for an environmentally friendly product—and of our call in 1992 to remove barriers to investment in plantation forestry. Senator Brown will not be surprised to know that the Democrats will be pleased to support his amendment. We share common ground on this issue. So there you are: I am foreshadowing where we will be in the main debate.
The last issue is that which Senator Cook raised in his speech in the second reading debate. It does not directly relate to this bill but it is an issue on which we think the government needs to sit up and take notice, and that is the issue of the mass marketed schemes to which he referred. There are at least three members of that committee in the chamber at present, and we—and I can say `we', because I know their views—are extremely concerned at some of the evidence which has been put before us. We think that action to address inequities will need to be taken in short measure. I am not going to pre-empt the committee's considerations or views, merely to say that, if the government's antennae are now a little cleaner and more alert than they have been, this is an issue on which they really do need to take care and be prepared to respond rapidly to, as soon as the Senate committee is able to give some indication of some relief that they believe should be exercised. With those remarks, I close my second reading views.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2001-03-28,"—As Senator Murray has mentioned, I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1998 to bring some justice to Tasmanian landowners who want, in the public spirit, to protect their private forests because they have important environmental values and who want, in the process of doing that, to get government assistance for such things as fencing and management plans; but under the tax office ruling, if they get government assistance they will have capital gains tax placed on that assistance. This means that, of the $60 million or so set aside for the purpose of protecting high conservation value private forests in Tasmania, some tens of millions of dollars will go straight back to the tax office. That is in stark contrast to the taxing arrangements whereby, if the same landowners want to bulldoze down their forests or send them off to the woodchippers and put in foreign plantations, that is a tax free investment. So the taxation system as it stands is very clearly oriented as an incentive to destruction of high conservation value forests on private lands in Tasmania.
I will come back to the regional forest agreement itself in a moment. I want to point out to the chamber that I moved this same amendment in December last year because it was clear that Tasmanian farmers who are doing the right thing should not be penalised in this way. But the amendment did not pass, because the Labor Party opposed it and joined with the government to vote down that amendment. Although you will not find it in Hansard, my recollection is that Senator Sherry on that occasion indicated that he had been in communication with Tasmanian Deputy Premier Lennon, who had said, `Don't support the amendment.' If that is the case—and Senator Sherry can speak for himself on the matter—it is a very clear case of politicians who are uninformed, who are ignorant of an important piece of legislation, doing in the rights of constituents to try to make a petty political score: that is, Deputy Premier Lennon's anti-environmental and anti-green fixation getting in the way of looking at the substance of an important piece of legislation which he now agrees should have been passed.
Labor itself can explain why it did not support this amendment some months ago, why it has had to move now to fix this legislation up and why it has before the Senate today an almost identical amendment to mine. This should have been fixed in December. If, as a Greens senator who is concerned about the interests of Tasmanians, I was able to get my mind around it and move an amendment that was the right amendment, then it does not say much for the Labor Party, for its advisers in the Bacon government and, in particular, for the Deputy Premier of Tasmania that all of them put together got it so terribly wrong last December. It is an appalling piece of politics—and it is an appalling piece of politics as far as the Tasmanian constituency is concerned.
I did point out in the debate last December that landowners had approached me who certainly were talking with the people who were administering the regional forest agreement in Tasmania, and they were saying, in effect, that they were not going to protect their land, because they were not going to be penalised by a capital gains tax that would take away from government assistance being given to them for doing the right thing. You might get $10,000 to bring in a management plan, put up a fence or, for the next couple of decades, manage a piece of forest which has rare and endangered wildlife, forest species, plant species or orchids in it, but then find that the tax office reaches out and takes some thousands of dollars of that away. In other words, you would have to reach into your own pocket to implement that management plan, put up that fence or manage that piece of forest. It was very clear that that was unjust.
I had preceded my amendment in the parliament by flagging it publicly, and it had been reported in the Tasmanian media. Yet Deputy Premier Lennon and/or his colleagues in this place still did not have their minds around it when it was debated in here. I will not say any more on that except that, because of that failure to look at the issue itself, a great deal of inconvenience has occurred; there has been a great deal of confusion, and a great disservice has been done to Tasmanians who are interested in doing the right thing with their woodlands. Today, hopefully, we will move to rectify that.
However, that leads me to look at the government's position on this. The Howard government last time opposed this, and I have heard nothing to change that. So we now have the situation where Labor has seen that it should have supported the Greens amendment last December. But there are half-a-dozen coalition senators in here representing Tasmania who believe that Tasmanian farmers should be taxed for doing the right thing. I draw that—and I will continue to draw that—to the attention of Tasmanian landowners. Those Tasmanian senators are doing the wrong thing by their constituency. They now have a double opportunity to look at the amendment and see how logical it is. They will see that it is fair and it is fixing an anomaly—and they should be supporting this as well. The fact that they are not here engaging in this debate does not excuse them from their responsibility to know what this amendment is about and, in the interests of Tasmanian landowners, to be supporting it.
Just before I sit down, I want to make some comments about the regional forest agreement that this amendment refers to. Currently in Tasmania, the regional forest agreement which the Prime Minister signed in Tasmania in 1997—having never been to the Tasmanian forests—is creating the greatest rate of destruction in history. I was talking about this yesterday, and I am returning to it now on a different piece of legislation. There are, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics this year, some 5.6 million tonnes of logs out of Tasmania's grand forests going to the woodchip mills. If you are in downtown Launceston, Burnie or Hobart today, you cannot avoid the procession of log trucks coming out of our great forests and going to their doom through those Tasmanian cities. They are being exported to the paper mills of Japan. For those economic rationalists sitting opposite, let me point out that the destruction of these trees is being prodigiously supported by government handouts, under Mr Howard's signature: tens of millions of dollars for roading and for replacement plantations of foreign species of trees being put in where these wild forests stand. What do we get in return for it? The Tasmanian government gets a paltry $10 a tonne royalty for these centuries-old trees that are being sold to the woodchip companies.
What do the woodchip companies get? They get, as a rule of thumb, $100 a tonne. They get a 1,000 per cent mark-up. It is a little lower than that at the moment, but they get that simply for chainsawing down these trees and putting them through their woodchip mills. That is the freight on board mark-up for the destruction of these monumental, publicly owned forests of Tasmania. What do the paper millers in Japan get? They get $1,000-plus a tonne when the paper comes out of their mills—another 1,000 per cent mark-up. We get $10 a tonne for the trees which have been growing since before Abel Tasman was spotted floating down the west coast of Tasmania by the Tasmanian Aboriginals, and the Japanese millers get $1,000 a tonne for that product once it has been processed and put onto the markets, where later it will be dumped on the rubbish dumps and converted into greenhouse gases.
The public is funding this. Forestry Tasmania puts $20 million or so of its income revenue into the Tasmanian state government each year and has more than that given to it through state and federal funding. We are actually paying to have our trees cut down and destroyed, handed across to a very limited number of shareholders in the woodchip industry. I might add that the recent purchase of North by Gunns Ltd, headquartered in Launceston, makes that corporation the biggest hardwood woodchipper in the world. The board of Gunns is presided over by Mr Paisley, the former CEO of North. He is the man who poked me in the chest back in 1989 when the Greens had the balance of power. He was concerned about some areas of forest being protected. He said, in the lift at what was then the Sheraton Hotel, `Remember, Dr Brown, I am right.' I invited Mr Paisley to look back through the history books at other people who had made that statement and see how they were judged in history. Also on the board of Gunns is Mr McQuestin, a very wealthy man who was very much part of the history of Tasmania during those Green-ALP accord years.
—What about the bribery?
—I am not referring, Senator, to the Rouse affair, although I think his name occurred, as did many people's names at that time. Also on the board is former Premier Robin Gray, who left the state in massive debt, who mistakenly wanted to build the Franklin Dam—which would have left Tasmania quite needlessly in another billion dollars of debt—who even failed to get the half billion dollars then on offer from the Fraser government at the time of that furore because of his political ineptness and who went on to try to foist ancient technology on Tasmania in the Wesley Vale Pulp Mill, which would have put 13 tonnes a day of organochlorines into Bass Strait, when Christine Milne and others were saying, `You have to use state-of-the-art technology and relocate that mill away from farmlands, because you can recycle and you don't have to put chlorine into the environment where it is a potential poison.'
It was interesting to speak to some Swedish visitors a couple of weeks ago who pointed out that there is no pulp mill in Sweden any more that uses Kraft technology, which was the technology of the Wesley Vale Pulp Mill. It was outdated, it was dirty and it was environmentally second rate, but Robin Gray pursued it, backed by North Ltd which now is owned by Gunns, and they lost the 1989 election because of that. In the coming years Gunns is going to be under very intense scrutiny for its role in destroying Tasmania's forests through the woodchipping industry. It is charged with the responsibility of doing the right thing by Tasmania, and if it is doing that it has nothing to fear. Economically as well as environmentally, its progress in Tasmania is going to be very much scrutinised. 
A case in point is the current logging at Mount Arthur, near Lilydale, north of Launceston. A number of members here have been to see the site. It is on the slopes of Mount Arthur. It includes logging of some hundreds of hectares of what should have been the Mount Arthur forest reserve. When Prime Minister Howard flew to Tasmania he signed a regional forest agreement which included the indicative forest reserves, and the Mount Arthur forest reserve was then 1,866 hectares. It is now 866 hectares. Since he signed it, 1,000 hectares has been removed from that forest reserve without any reference to this parliament and without Prime Minister Howard even knowing about it. So much for quality control! And they are woodchipping it. 
Prime Minister Howard says in Tasmania, `We have reached a balanced result here, where we are going to balance the environment with the needs of the woodchip industry,' then goes away and leaves it to Forestry Tasmania and/or the Labor government in Tasmania to change the boundaries! I understand that some 10,000 hectares of what was promised by Prime Minister Howard to be forest reserve has now gone to the woodchippers. So much for Prime Minister Howard's commitment to the environment and his whole government's watching brief over the destruction of Tasmania's forests. Along with environment minister Senator Hill, he has simply washed his hands of it and walked away from it.
Moreover, the regional forest agreement was supposed to be predicated on the employment of the forest practices code in Tasmania. If you go to Mount Arthur you will see what is happening in the Tarkine, the Styx Valley, the Huon Valley and everywhere where logging is occurring in the wetter areas of Tasmania, and that is: comprehensive breaches by loggers and by the woodchip industry—under the management of Forestry Tasmania—of that forest practices code. You will see illegal logging. At Mount Arthur you will see permanent streams which should have buffer zones of 20 to 30 metres either side of forest left under that code which they have logged right through.
Senator O'Brien and the member for Bass, Michelle O'Byrne, were in the area on the same day that I was last week. They would have seen trees cut off and left in the stream bed amongst the erosion that has come down off the abraded hillsides on either side and is now in the beds of these creeks which feed into Launceston's water supply, despoiling that water supply and at the same time smothering the formerly clean rocky beds of those creeks which are the habitat of much of the aquatic fauna that gives those streams their naturalness.
Forestry Tasmania is acting reprehensively under the pressure of the woodchip organisations. I can tell you this: there are good people within that organisation, but if they move to implement the forestry practices code according to the letter of the law, they get squashed. A number have left because head office has told them to lay off. I do not know whether that comes from CEO Evan Rolley's office, from Deputy Premier Lennon's office or from Premier Bacon's office. Whatever, all three people are culpable for what is happening in the field as the forest practices code is comprehensively ignored.
Here we have the situation where I have brought in this amendment to ensure that those people who want to protect their forests in the private domain are not taxed for it. It has taken those three gentlemen I just mentioned some months to catch up with the fact that, through the Labor Party here, they were going to penalise these people through allowing the capital gains tax to apply to the small amount of money they get to help protect their lands. Good on those landowners; they are doing us all a service. They are in the minority, but they are doing the right thing. They should not be taxed for it. That is why this amendment should be supported.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,2001-03-28,"—In speaking about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1999 I will first go to our amendment which is what Senator Brown started talking about. The amendment he moved previously is slightly different. I would like to read a synopsis by Dr Steven Smith, who is the manager of the Private Forest Reserve Program. I think the synopsis explains very well the reason we need to have this amendment carried. It states:
The Tasmanian Private Forest Reserve Program is unique in Australia as it offers landowners cash ... as a consideration for placing a conservation covenant in perpetuity on their native forest. These forests have been targeted by a rigorous scientific process that identifies the highest priorities for forest conservation on private land in this State.
That is, in Tasmania. It continues:
The amount of money is relatively small (i.e. about one third of the market value of the land) compared to the potential earnings that have been foregone, for the public good. The landowners give up development rights, timber rights, gravel extraction rights etc., forever.
The Program has funds of $30 million set aside by the Commonwealth ($20 million in NHT funds, and $10 million transferred as a special grant to the State i.e. the Tasmanian Trust Fund). The $30 million was provided to secure adequate amounts of each targeted forest community in the Private Forest Reserve system - to underpin Tasmania's RFA, i.e. to demonstrate that the forest industry is ecologically sustainable.
That might be a question that I would debate with Dr Smith. The synopsis goes on:
During development of the RFA, a consultant for the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers' Association independently estimated the amount actually needed to do this job at about $250 million. However, negotiations resulted in $30 million being provided. It was never intended that about one third of this amount would be returned to the Commonwealth Government Treasury through CGT.
In terms of the revenue that the Commonwealth would forgo if properties purchased prior to September 1985 were exempted from capital gains tax, the synopsis says:
Roughly two thirds of the properties that the Program deals with have been owned by the same owners since prior to 1985. Most of these landowners are agriculturalists, who would be eligible for the recent `Small Business' taxation benefits, i.e. a reduction in CGT of 50% or more. Hence, assuming CGT at a standard rate of 50%, at present these landowners would pay back to the Commonwealth Government about 50% of 50% of $20 million or $5 million.
Hence, if these properties were exempted from CGT, the Commonwealth would have to forego about $5 million.
What revenue would the Commonwealth forego if all properties were exempted from CGT?
The one third of landowners, who have owned their land since since after 1985, include a mixture of agriculturalists and people who have purchased land as an investment (e.g. doctors ... etc.), who do not earn income from their land. Current small business taxation benefits would only ... apply to the agriculturalists. Assuming they are in about equal proportions (i.e. 50% farmers and 50% non-farmers) then the farmers would, at present, be required to pay to the Commonwealth Government 50% of 50% of $5 million, i.e. $1.75 million. The non-farmers would be required to pay an amount of CGT of about 50% of $5 million, i.e. $2.5 million.
Hence if these properties were exempted from CGT, the Commonwealth would forego about $4.25 million—
that is, the sum total of $1.75 million and $2.5 million—
in CGT from the landowners who have owned their land since 1985 and about $5 million from the landowners who have owned their land since prior to 1985 i.e. the Commonwealth Government would forego about $9.25 million in CGT revenue from the landowners who participate in the Private Forest Reserve Program - if they moved to exempt landowners involved—
that is, if this amendment is adopted—
in the Program from paying CGT on any financial considerations they receive.
The answer is really simple, and we have moved an amendment to that effect. It goes to the question of whether we are endeavouring to protect these lands. It was the intention of the Commonwealth from the outset that we protect these lands, and they provided some money, albeit nowhere near enough, to do that job. That is why the amendment ought to be adopted and supported by the government. Back when the RFA legislation was being debated, this issue was raised. Certainly it was my understanding that the Commonwealth were going to undertake to resolve the issue with the state government by one means or another so that the net effect would be that there would be $30 million for the intended purpose, not $30 million less capital gains tax or indeed any other tax. That is the reason this amendment should be carried. We should be doing what the national forest policy statement intended and what the RFA agreement put in place to achieve some protection of particular forest types and the ecosystems on private land. That is what the money ought to be there to do. It ought not to be there for the purposes of giving capital gains tax back to the Commonwealth.
Having said those things, I would now like to turn to the part of the bill that deals with sale, loan and limited recourse debt. In particular, I want to look at the aspect of limited recourse debt. It says in the second reading speech:
In those circumstances, an amount will be included in the debtor's assessable income to compensate for excessive deductions that were allowed to the taxpayer based on the initial cost of the relevant capital asset or specified capital expenditure. The adjustment to taxable income will reflect amounts that remain unpaid when the hire purchase or limited recourse debt arrangement is terminated. The amendment applies to debts that are terminated after 27 February 1998.
I know that relates to the purchase of equipment, et cetera, but I am particularly interested in the allowance for limited recourse debt, which brings me to an inquiry that I have been working on with the Senate Economics References Committee. Many taxpayers who have become involved in mass marketed investment schemes of one type or another have often used limited recourse debt. They have now found themselves confronted with a tax office determination, which took effect from June 1998, that has ruled limited recourse debt ineligible for the purposes of tax deductibility.
Of course, the unfortunate thing for most of these investors is that these mass marketed schemes and projects were promoted to them by way of either newspaper articles, the advice of their financial planner or accountant, or legal advice. The thing that you have to consider in the circumstances that these people find themselves in is that they responded to an ad—and the ads were often run in papers where there were people working in the mining sector, particularly in Western Australia—that said they would pay $150 and get a tax deduction of $4,500. What the ad in the paper did not tell the potential investor is that the deduction that would be claimed would often be $14,500. The project developer or manager would take $10,000 and would give back $4,500 to the taxpayer.
What interests me about this is that this bill appears to say that, if people change the nature of the debt that they have—that is, if they refinance it—they will not be subject to taxation on the amount that remains unpaid. I am not a tax expert and I find it very difficult to understand a lot in the taxation area, but I am intrigued. If that applies in the case of people in these circumstances, why might it not apply in other cases in respect of some of the people who find themselves in a bit of a confrontation with the tax office over their purchase of an investment that is in the nature of a mass marketed scheme?
One of the things that has happened in relation to the application of tax law is that, as of June 1998, the tax office implemented the product ruling system in the mass marketed or prospectus investment scheme industry. That still allows for a person to claim a deduction for the administrative costs and establishment costs of a particular project, whether it be in trees, viticulture, olives, aloe, tomatoes or mushrooms. But in many instances the scheme designers, promoters and managers have been factoring in to the investment for the investor—that is, the taxpayer—the cost of the purchase of land. As I understand the tax law, for an individual such as me or anyone else who wants to buy land and establish a plantation of anything, the cost of the land is not a deductible item. Yet these people, who are often paying way above the market price for land, seem to be backdooring the tax law of this country by factoring in to the administrative cost—that is, your entry cost to an investment—the cost of the purchase of the land. Frankly, I do not agree with that. I think that provides a distinct advantage over other people in the community who may well seek to purchase land and establish the same sort of project. That has to be very seriously looked at, because there has been evidence to the Senate Economics References Committee that that is happening.
The other problem with that is this: when you have such high establishment costs—that is, an entry cost into an investment—the potential return from that investment is quite often marginal. Many of these agribusiness mass marketed schemes have a history of failure. There are numerous reports out about that. Indeed, the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation recently put out a report talking about this exact thing, saying that many of these schemes are very poorly managed as well. So the more you front end load the costs of the investment to the investor—who claims this as a tax reduction, remember—that means that the taxpayers of the country—all of us—are contributing to this particular project.
It is done on the basis that that is a deferred tax deduction, with the tax office taking into consideration that at some point in time a project will return a profit that will become taxable. My concern with regard to some of the things that are currently happening goes to this question: if you front end load the cost of getting into an investment such that it includes the purchase cost of land, that can pose a threat to the long-term viability of the project. It is becoming clear in many cases that that will happen. As I said, I do not believe that to be a fair position: for a person or a company to set up a project and purchase land that other individual people or individual companies cannot and claim that land as a deduction through a backdoor method by factoring it into an investor's administrative costs or entry costs for an investment.
The other area of the matters here goes to whether or not there is sufficient protection for investors. Under the current law—be it the Corporations Law or the Managed Investments Act—it would seem that, despite those acts being clear in some respects, it is very difficult to actually bring about an action against somebody who has potentially misled you or deceived you with regard to information that they have provided to you. That is another area that has to be significantly tightened. It is very important, when people are supposedly giving professional advice to the general public, that the general public should be able to feel secure that that professional advice is sound.
I will go back to the case of some investors who have been dealt with by the Ombudsman. People entered into an investment scheme where they had limited recourse finance arrangements and/or non-recourse finance arrangements. The tax office have now determined that they are not eligible for deduction. The tax office have subsequently gone back up to four or six years, depending on whether they have applied part 4A or not. They have gone back a long period of time. At that time it would appear that the tax law was such that these deductions were okay and it was okay for a limited recourse finance arrangement to be in place.
I am interested as to how the limited recourse debt arrangements worked under the arrangements that we are dealing with today prior to this bill coming into this parliament, and whether or not these things—and it appears to be the case by all accounts from the second reading speech—were allowable tax deductions prior to this amendment being moved. I would be very interested in the government informing me as to whether or not that was the case. It seems to conflict to some degree. I might be wrong because, as I said before, I do not necessarily understand the context of the tax law. But I would be interested to hear whether or not limited recourse debt was eligible for deduction prior to and up to this amendment bill being passed for the purposes set out in the second reading speech and as set out in the bill. That would make for very interesting reading to some people who have been the target of the tax office in respect of the limited financing arrangements that they had. 
As I said, it is very interesting that people who sought legal professional advice back in, say, 1992, 1993 or 1994 and embarked upon investment programs now find themselves subject to the tax office saying, `Sorry, but what we said back then doesn't apply now.' Indeed, in some cases there are some schemes that fell out of the time limit under the statute of limitations and they cannot be attacked. Indeed, the tax office issued private binding rulings in some instances for exactly the same arrangements. This brings into question the treatment of the general public from an equitable point of view with the tax laws of this country.
It is a fundamental principle in the tax charter that all people must be treated equally. If that is not the case then there is a real problem. It appears not to be the case. Under the self-assessment tax system—which I think has been around since about 1985, although I cannot remember the exact date now—the taxpayers are required to themselves ensure that they can comply with the tax laws. How does a taxpayer do that? One assumes that they seek—as we all do if we are unsure—the advice of their accountant. In most cases, that is what people did.
If people cannot rely on that, there is either a problem with the tax law and the way it is written—and it should be changed or amended—or a problem with the tax office, if it is going to take a retrospective view. It is okay to take a retrospective view if the case is that there has already been an income tax ruling. But it is very difficult if the tax office is going to take a retrospective view where there has been no determination until much later. As I said, I would be very interested to hear from the government when we get into committee as to whether or not limited recourse debt under these circumstances was an allowable deduction.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-03-28,"—I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1999. I think, although it has ranged far and wide, it has been an interesting and constructive one, generally speaking. It seems to me that the key issues that have been raised, with the exception of one or two, are probably best dealt with at the committee stage. They have tended to focus on the amendment moved by Senator Brown and a very similar amendment to be moved by the opposition in relation to the treatment of capital proceeds regarding particularly the private forest reserve program in Tasmania. I will restrict my remarks on the amendments to the committee stage of the debate because some of the reasons why the Commonwealth remains opposed to the particular amendments go to some technical and constitutional aspects. 
I will reiterate what was said by Senator Kemp, as I believe it was, in the debate on the RFA bill in December. He said, `The government is carefully considering the complex policy issues of the capital gains consequences for landowners of adopting covenants upon RFA private forest reserve program land.' I reiterate that that remains the government's position. It is something that is under active consideration, and the Commonwealth will be concluding a policy position on that, we expect, fairly shortly. It is obviously fraught with danger to pre-empt what may go to cabinet, when cabinet may discuss these things and what cabinet will actually discuss, but I can certainly assure the Senate that this matter is under active consideration. I am sure it is frustrating for people such as Senator Brown to see a representative of the government come in here and give those sorts of assurances because he can say, `Why don't you just do this?' I will go into detail in the committee stage, as it is more appropriate to do so there. 
I do not want to sound too much like Sir Humphrey Appleby when I say this, but there are some technical and constitutional problems with both the Tasmanian Green amendment moved by Senator Brown and the amendment which I presume will be moved by Senator Cook which seeks to do the same thing. In relation to the opposition amendment in particular, and I think the Green amendment will fall into the same trap because it does relate quite specifically to Tasmania, and potentially one particular part of Tasmania, prima facie—I am not a constitutional lawyer, and I am certainly not a tax expert, Senator Murphy—it would be in breach of section 51(ii) of the Constitution, regarding the taxation power, which says, in part—and I paraphrase here—that the Commonwealth cannot levy a tax that would discriminate between states or parts of states. That is one of the problems with the amendments. Of course, it is open to the Senate to make any decisions but that is one of the problems. I will go into the other problems in the committee stage. 
Senator Murphy asked me for some advice in relation to non-recourse loans. I may respond to that in the committee stage as well. In fact, I think it was a pretty detailed question, so I am happy to do so there. I am having a detailed response prepared by the relevant officers.
Having said that, in concluding the second reading debate, it is important to respond to the issues raised by Senator Cook which relate specifically to the fact that the Commonwealth government is moving to oppose schedule 1, items 1 and 2. As all honourable senators who have been involved in this debate know, the Commonwealth was moving to ensure that the tax exempt status of bodies which were receiving benefits, particularly in construction contracts, were only to receive those benefits where the property was principally occupied by what is known as the AEP, the always exempt person, under the law—in other words, so that the sales tax exemption would go to benefit that person. As those of us who have been involved with this and have followed the progress of this policy measure through the processes of the government and the legislature would know, as Senator Cook said quite accurately, this was brought about in around April 1998. The legislation was introduced shortly after that. The parliament was of course prorogued just prior to the 1998 election. 
I think the measure prior to the 1998 election was called TLAB No. 4, or Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1998. After the 1998 election it re-emerged as Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1999, for some arcane reason. The Commonwealth negotiated through the committee process—as Senator Cook and others have indicated there was a committee reference on this matter—and concerns were raised by people who had entered into contracts prior to April. We had been seeking to convince other honourable senators of the wisdom of the Commonwealth's view. Things have changed further since those discussions took place. We could not get agreement from the opposition or the Democrats to proceed with the commencement date of April 1998. I am informed that the significant focus of this measure was in relation to a number of large building contracts that had in fact been signed prior to April. So, had the Labor amendment been successful, it would have significantly eroded the financial impact and anticipated revenue as a result of the measure. 
Senator Cook quite properly asked, `What is the impact of us now effectively walking away from this measure?' It is a very fair question. I have sought to give a very accurate answer. The fact—as we all know in this place better than just about anybody else in the world—is that wholesale sales tax was abolished on 1 July last year. It was a historic achievement for this government to get rid of that ramshackle tax system. So, quite clearly, there are no financial implications beyond 1 July 2000 because there is no wholesale sales tax. Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry, it is a bit like your reference to leaded fuel in a previous debate: it is hard to raise excise on a fuel that does not exist anymore.
To bring this to a slightly more concise point, because most of the revenue was expected to be received from pre-April contracts, and because the measure would not find its way through this place because the Democrats and the opposition have made it quite clear they would not support April as the start-up date, the government made the pragmatic decision that it is not worth proceeding with the measure. I am assured that the financial impact on the forward estimates will be zero and that overall it will be negligible, or we certainly have no measure of it. I cannot add much more to that.
I hope I have responded in detail to those matters that were raised in the second reading debate, apart from those issues that I have said I will refer to in the committee stage. I again thank honourable senators for their contributions and commend the bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
Bill read a second time. ",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 5) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2001-03-28,"—I come to the chamber to make some remarks from a very productive meeting today of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade held with the Human Rights Commission of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. I think I can speak reliably on behalf of those of our colleagues who were there and say that we were very impressed by the scope and responsibility of that Human Rights Commission. A lot of their work is very relevant to some of the remarks I wish to make today. 
In the Centenary of Federation year, Australia is in a position to celebrate its increasing prosperity as well as the tremendous social gains that we have achieved over the past 100 years. But as we take pride in the successes of our nation, we should not be blinded to the atrocities that are being committed across the globe as millions and millions of people continue to endure deprivation, violence and discrimination at the hands of dictatorial rulers.
I want to speak particularly about Afghanistan. International publicity recently about the activities of extremist factions in Afghanistan has drawn attention to threats to the fundamental rights of the people of that nation. Typically it is women who are the prime target of these groups, as they are forced to endure physical, social and emotional punishments inflicted upon them in the most extraordinarily tyrannical fashion. While media attention has recently been centred on the Taliban's shocking destruction of Buddhist icons, the militant body's deplorable human rights record, especially pertaining to women, cannot be overlooked and should be examined. 
Since the ultra-orthodox Taliban took control of parts of Afghanistan in 1996, it has been a country mired in poverty and destitution. Constant civil war combined with a recent three-year drought has left over a million people on the brink of starvation. Afghan children in particular have become the innocent victims of the Taliban's imposed terror. For example, the group continually refuses to fund much-needed childhood immunisation. A country which has suffered the deaths of fathers in war now says that women, in particular widows, are not allowed to work. The children of those people are continually being injured by landmines buried throughout Kabul and surrounding regions. 
More than two million people have sought escape from the country but unfortunately most still reside in refugee camps where conditions are comparable to or worse than the situations they were initially fleeing. The deplorable living standards in Afghanistan are just one physical consequence of Taliban rule. The fundamentalist regime's strict moralistic interpretation of Islam has resulted in the oppression of basic human rights. Freedom is nonexistent for women under Taliban rule. Independence and autonomy are continually struck down by the brutal hands of the governing body. The position of women has been most dramatically changed by the extremists. Life for women has come to a virtual halt in Afghanistan as the government has figuratively `imprisoned' women with its rules and with the application of sharia law. They are banned from the workplace. They are banned from most forms of education. They are essentially excluded from participation in all sectors of life. 
Although the main Islamic text, the Koran, grants property and economic rights to women, the Taliban has ignored that and continues to sanction severe forms of discrimination against women. Their freedom of mobility is limited. They are forbidden to leave the home unless accompanied by a male relative and fully dressed under the cover of a burqua, a garment concealing all but the eyes. There is no opportunity for dissent, as the Taliban government inflicts punishment with unabated severity. Public stonings, lashings and beatings for violations of the fundamentalist rules are not uncommon. In one well-accounted case, a woman who dared to defy restrictions on education by running a home school for girls was shot and killed in front of her family and her students. The legal rights of women have been severely limited, which perpetuates the cycle of abuse. You can take no recourse to end the gender bigotry. Victims of rape, for example, are required to provide the testimony of four witnesses and they ultimately face punishment if their case is not proven valid in the eyes of the court.
Under the Taliban's extremist rule, women have been reduced to invisibility, with no means of protest—no voice. Increased feelings of hopelessness and despair have resulted in extraordinarily high levels of depression and suicide throughout the country. In 1998, Physicians for Human Rights conducted a study that found that 97 per cent of the 160 Kabul and refugee women they examined exhibited signs of major depression, a highly disturbing statistic. More recently, there are problems with forced marriages and prostitution increasing, especially in conjunction with the Taliban's issuing of an edict, after UN pressure, purporting to ban the cultivation of opium poppies. Until the restriction of narcotic production, opium production was the main source of revenue for both many Afghan farmers and the Taliban government, given that the Taliban collected a 10 per cent tax on all agricultural crops, including opium. To indicate the importance of that production to the world drug trade, Afghanistan was estimated to have supplied over 70 per cent of the world's heroin in the year 2000. Now, with the restrictions, farmers are faced with increasing economic hardship so in some cases they are now selling their daughters, some as young as seven, to obtain dowries and loans to ameliorate their own financial situation. So, ironically, attempts at improving the state of life in Afghanistan have actually resulted in a further weakening of human rights.
The Taliban's recent destruction of Buddhist statues at Bamiyan is an extraordinarily bold manifestation of the extremist policies practised by the group since they first came to power. Over 1,500 years old, the statues were important to the development of both Buddhist theology and art. These immense figures represented a valuable part not only of Afghanistan's history but also of the world's. One of the statues was believed to be the tallest standing Buddha found throughout the globe. They had managed to survive attacks from Genghis Khan's cannon fire 800 years ago, but apparently not the 21st century version. The Taliban's refusal to listen to the pleas of the international community and halt demolition of the cultural artefacts is fundamentally a breach of respect towards humanity, history and religion. Their minister of information and culture even declared that the statues would be broken with profound ease for `it is easier to destroy than build'.
This is rhetoric which stands in sharp contrast with the generally more constructive goals of civilised nations. But, essentially, destruction is what the Taliban are doing on a daily basis in Afghanistan. They are implementing their own form of genocide, shattering the people and the culture of their nation. Women in particular have been attacked, excluded and left to linger in the shadows. I applaud the stand of the Australian government for supporting UN sanctions and refusing to recognise the Taliban as the legitimate governing body of the country.
While I have focused some attention on the appalling abuses taking place in Afghanistan, I think it is important—but disappointing—to note that similar atrocities are being carried out in several other areas of the world, in some cases almost routinely. Human rights violations which are committed during political strife continue to occur across the world but violence against women, particularly in the form of rape, is now more often used as a strategic tool or a weapon of war within the general framework of civil conflict. Women, and therefore their children, have become unwilling pawns in the power struggles erupting between divergent political and religious factions in many places. I, as President of the Parliamentary Association for UNICEF, am acutely aware of the position of children in many of these cases.
Figures taken from Rwanda, for example, are staggering. An Organisation of African Unity report has concluded that every female over the age of 12 who actually survived the 1994 genocide was raped. During the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, an estimated 20,000 Muslim women were victims of sexual assault as militant forces embarked upon their agenda of ethnic cleansing. It was gratifying to see, in February of this year, a ruling by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia recognise these assaults as crimes against humanity when it found three ethnic Serb soldiers guilty of using rape as an instrument of terror during that brutal conflict. I refer to my remarks previously on the International Criminal Court and what Australia's ratification of that treaty could do in lending a permanent body to assist in this process and to address these questions. Mosques and other religious symbols were also viciously destroyed by rebel insurgents during that Bosnian conflict, which bears a fateful similarity to the Taliban's most recent actions.
In our own backyard—and equally disturbingly—efforts at democratic independence in East Timor have been darkened by the systematic violence that was perpetrated on women by opponents of East Timorese independence. During the period before and after the vote in 1999, women were often raped as punishment for voicing their pro independent views and as a form of control of them and of their families. This violence was often compounded by the fact that the attackers committed the crimes in front of other family members, attempting to publicly humiliate those who disagreed with their policies.
Today, those women in East Timor are fighting an uphill battle to overcome the horrors and shame that they experienced. Groups such as ETWave—East Timorese Women Against Violence—and FOKUP-ERS, which I visited on my last visit to Dili, have established shelters for women and children who have been victims of incest and violence. FOKUPERS has in fact started a newsletter called Babadok which educates women on their rights and provides advice to survivors of rape and assault.
It is not merely in regions, though, that undergo civil war that gender violations are occurring. `Honour killings'—the murder of women who purportedly `shame' the family—are not rare in many Middle Eastern countries. In Kuwait, there is even penal law that validates these crimes, setting a maximum sentence of only three years for a man convicted of killing a female relative in the name of `honour'.
I think it is beyond a travesty that these violations continue to occur in this new millennium, especially the widespread use of violence against women as a tool for achieving political and religious objectives. Aggression, though, is often symptomatic of a wider range of social violations. According to a recent UN report—and in fact according to commonsense—for women to be truly free from violence they have to enjoy equal rights in the economic, political and social sectors. That being said, connections between gender and poverty in fact magnify the problem. Over 70 per cent of the world's impoverished are women.
We are an advantaged democratic society and Australia can play a vital role in acting to end inequalities and aggressions so that human rights—especially women's rights—can be upheld throughout the broader global community. As a country, I think that we should condemn the minority of extremists who commit atrocities in the name of politics and religion. We should support those countries who attempt to break forth from the chains of oppression and instil democratic values within the hearts of their citizens. In fact, with many of our good governance programs—supported by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade—we do just that.
I am reminded of a quote by the late theologian Reinhold Niebuhr who, post World War II, founded Americans for Democratic Action. He said:
Man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible, but man's inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary.
I think that Australia's support of East Timor has been a shining example of our efforts to foster notions of tolerance and equality in nations that are beset by repression. There is still much to be done in areas like East Timor: the challenges of continuing social ills and disparities, for example. With the alien presence of the UN and NGOs—which are of course integral to their future—there is an added complexity. 
Here, we can educate for tolerance and gender equality and we can encourage all citizens to fully participate in the development of the country. We should support humanitarian efforts internationally so that the vulnerable do not suffer both at the hands of extremist rulers and from the international community not supporting their plight. Australian programs like Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development and Australian Volunteers International further serve to benefit both the broader community and our own nation.
Closer to home, there are still discrepancies, though, between gender and race that exist here. It is said that violence and extremism often arise from unequal economic, social and political structures, so we as a nation can subdue incipient radicalism within our own community as we remove inequalities. Violence against women, for example, is not a crime committed solely outside our borders. According to the most recent statistics released from the Commonwealth Office of the Status of Women, 38 per cent of Australian women have experienced an incidence of violence since the age of 15.
It is really only through education and dialogue that social problems such as violence against women can be eradicated. Teaching young people the values of tolerance and compassion helps them to make a vital contribution to the development of our nation. Simple programs—like the Commonwealth department of education's Discovering Democracy, which instils the values of democracy in students across this country—are one very important means of transmitting this wisdom. We can make extraordinarily beneficial use of new technology and support local efforts at advancing public knowledge.
Australia is proud of its heritage and of the advances we have made over the past century. We will continue to move strongly into the future to encourage the growth of a diverse and multicultural society that values all of its members equally. I was proud, along with other members of the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, to hear the approbation of the Turkish visitors to our parliament today but, as we progress, we cannot afford to overlook human rights violations that are occurring in other areas of the world. As a nation, we should set a shining example that other countries can emulate and follow.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Human Rights Abuses: Women</title>,Matters of Public Interest,2,1
"PRESIDENT, The",N/A,2001-03-28,"—On 27 March, Senator Brown raised with me questions relating to greenhouse gas emissions from Parliament House. I have previously referred to the record of Parliament House relating to energy consumption. With the leave of the Senate, I will incorporate the answer to the question in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The answer read as follows—
QUESTION WITHOUT NOTICE TO PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE BY SENATOR BOB BROWN ON PARLIAMENT HOUSE GREENHOUSE ADVERTISING PROGRAM 
(Senate Hansard 27 March 2001 p.23028)
On 27 March 2001, Senator Brown raised with me questions concerning the recent Commonwealth Government Greenhouse Office advertising program promoting ways to reduce greenhouse emissions and its application to Parliament House.
As I have previously advised the Senate, Parliament House—through JHD—has a proud record in the field of minimising electricity and gas consumption, and consequently reducing greenhouse emissions.
During the 2000 calendar year, Parliament House won two major awards—one awarded by Greenhouse Office and one awarded by the Institute of Engineers Australia—to recognise major energy and greenhouse emission reductions.  Since 1988, energy consumption at Parliament House has been reduced by 52% and greenhouse emissions by 46.6%.
In order to build on the above achievements, JHD recently advertised for an Energy Manager for Parliament House, and that position will be filled from early April 2001.
Part of the role of the position will be to address the matters raised in the Greenhouse Office advertising program and consider their applicability to Parliament House.
In addition to the Energy Manager position, JHD has many other major initiatives being implemented to build on its proud record, such as:
·	progressive introduction of automated sleep mode by the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff for computers in Parliament to save some 80% of consumption if units are not turned off:
·	utilisation of waste heat from the main computer room to heat the swimming pool;
·	upgrading airconditioning controls in a further 400 suites to reduce energy consumption;
·	replacement of electric steam generators with natural gas-fired units leading to significant greenhouse gas emission reduction;
·	lighting control upgrades to reduce energy consumption;
·	progressive installation of control mechanisms on continuous hot water boiling units (some 400 in Parliament House).
I believe the information supplied is a more-than-adequate response by JHD on behalf of the Parliament to further improving the Parliament's record in reducing greenhouse emissions.
In relation to specific questions asked by Senator Brown, which will be further addressed by the Parliament House Energy Manager, I provide the following information.
Q.	Is it true that there are some 500 television sets which could be turned off at the wall each night in Parliament House but which may not be?
A.	There are approximately 1 000 television tuners in Parliament House.
The Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff advises that the parliamentary units consume 3-5 watts in stand-by mode compared to 60-80 watts when operating.  Utilisation of stand-by gives constant temperature and leads to a 200% increase in the life of units—which reduces the need for energy consumed in manufacturing replacement units.
Q.	Are there 300 shower heads in Parliament which are not AAA shower heads?
A.	There are approximately 300 full flow shower heads installed during construction of Parliament House which are not AAA.
The Joint House Department has an evaluation of replacement shower heads under way.
Q.	Are there 500 or more fridges in Parliament House which could be turned up one degree, which, according to the advertising, would save 50 kilograms of greenhouse gases for each fridge?  That is about 25 000 kilograms of greenhouse gases per annum?
A.	There are approximately 440 fridges in Parliament House.  The great majority are small office fridges with high energy efficiency ratings.  The Energy Manager will be further addressing this issue.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Parliament House: Greenhouse Advertising Program</title>,Questions Without Notice,10,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2001-03-28,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of Standing order 111 not apply to the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2001, allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 to provide that Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 has effect subject to the provisions of the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 and the Slot Management Scheme.
Reasons for Urgency
It is proposed to amend the Slot Management Scheme, established under the Demand Management Act, to cap peak hour regional service slots at current levels and to implement measures to encourage the airlines to introduce larger aircraft. Advice on co-ordination criteria for the Winter 2001 scheduling season will be sent to the airlines on 10 April.
An amendment to the Demand Management Act is required in order to enable the measures to be implemented in the Slot Management Scheme, but without triggering a right to use the access provisions of Part IIIA

The statements read as follows—
EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The bill will enact excise tariff duty rate changes resulting from tax reform and Budget measures relating to the taxation of aviation kerosene, alcoholic beverages and petroleum.
Reasons for Urgency
Once a tariff alteration is proposed in the Parliament, certain sections of the Excise Act 1901 operate to provide protection to officers to enable the collection of duty at the proposed rate. The protection lapses if a ratifying bill is not passed within 12 months of the date the proposal was tabled.
(Circulated by authority of the Treasurer)
CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2001
Purpose of the Bill
The bill will incorporate into the Principal Act, tariff alterations that have been introduced in the House of Representatives by Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 2 and 4 of 2000 as a consequence of the GST:
·	a new tariff structure and new customs rates of duty for beer and mixed alcoholic beverages;
·	new customs rates of duty for petroleum products; and
·	an amended tariff structure for the commencement of the wine equalisation tax.
The bill also incorporates those tariff alterations that were introduced into the House of Representatives by Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2000) which gives effect to a measure announced in the budget to increase the customs duty on aviation kerosene.
The bill also incorporates those tariff alterations that were introduced into the House of Representatives by Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (2001) which give effect to measures, announced by the Prime Minister on 1 March 2001, to reduce customs rates of duty for leaded and unleaded petrol and diesel fuel and to proportionally reduce rates of duty for aviation and burner fuels.
Reasons for Urgency
Once a tariff alteration is proposed in the Parliament, certain sections of the Customs Act 1901 operate to provide protection to officers to enable the collection of duty at the proposed rate. The protection lapses if a ratifying Bill is not passed within twelve months of the proposal being tabled. Royal Assent of this Bill is required by 5 June 2001 (ie twelve months after the tabling of the first of these Proposals—Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2000)).

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2001-03-28,"—I speak on this matter of public importance after tabling a petition in the Senate today signed by 43,603 people opposing the deregulation of postal services. The size of the petition, which I think is extremely substantial, indicates the level of concern in the community with regard to this government's proposal to deregulate Australia Post. Tens of thousands of petitioners recognise that deregulation, as the petition says:
... will drastically reduce the revenue of Australia Post resulting in adverse impacts for most Australians including increased postal charges, reduced frequency of services, a reduction in counter and other services currently provided and a loss of thousands of jobs.
The deregulation proposed by this government will hit remote, rural and regional Australia particularly hard. It can only lead to an increased focus by postal operators on profitable areas, with a corresponding decline of services or increase in the cost of non-reserve services in less profitable regional areas. Outer suburban areas will also suffer because they too lack the profitable business markets of the inner cities and, as is the case with outlying areas, they are less profitable to deliver services to.
Even the majority report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Committee inquiry into the bill last year—and this is the majority, including members of the coalition—found:
Concern about the maintenance and viability of the CSO—
community service obligation—
was strong among witnesses representing country people.
Amongst those witnesses we had the National Farmers Federation, the Country Women's Association and the Isolated Children's Parents Association—hardly hotbeds of Labor Party support normally. They indicated that they were very concerned about the implications of the bill and emphasised that delivery of mail as a basic service is of paramount importance to them.
Even the government itself is unable to deny the impact this legislation will have on Australia Post. The explanatory memorandum to the deregulation bill states:
It is not possible to quantify—
with certainty—
the costs and benefits ... from the reduction in the reserved services and the postal services access regime.
That is from the government's own explanatory memorandum. It does not require too much imagination to think of the cost to rural and regional Australia from this deregulation. The benefits will flow only to the big end of town, not to local communities deprived of postal services. Australia Post services are an important part of our national communications infrastructure and a necessary part of social and economic life. Australia Post is a robust local presence in regional areas for the provision of existing and emerging services that will help to bridge the growing communications divide between rural and regional and urban communities. The deregulation changes would significantly reduce the capacity for Australia Post to provide existing and potential communications services in the new economy. 
Australia Post operates through 4,500 outlets, and more than 2,500 of these are in rural and remote areas.
—This is a powerful network capable of delivering face-to-face and online services to communities—
—Order! Interjections are disorderly, and I would prefer none, thank you, Senator O'Brien and Senator Campbell. Cease interjecting.
—But the coalition's deregulation plans put that network in danger. Let us have a look, for the benefit of those opposite, at the financial implications of this on Australia Post. It has been estimated by Australia Post itself that the proposed deregulation will result in a loss of $200 million in revenue. Australia Post is saying this, not the Labor Party. This comes on top of the $90 million to $100 million that Australia Post has already lost through the government directing it to absorb the impact of the GST. The loss of another $200 million through deregulation would mean that Australia Post's profit would decline by over $200 million if this government proposal goes ahead.
When you look at the fact that Australia Post's record profit in the 1998-99 financial year was $370 million, this would leave less than $80 million for Australia Post to re-invest in infrastructure or to subsidise its community service obligations, which Australia Post told the Senate inquiry last year into this bill cost $70 million a year in 1998-99. This government has said that no postal outlet will close in regional Australia as a result of this deregulation. When you look at these facts, who is this government trying to kid? When you have a profit of $370 million, when the deregulation bill is in fact going to cost Australia Post $200 million and when Australia Post is already $100 million out of profit as a result of absorbing the GST, who is this government trying to kid?
I will tell you what, Madam Deputy President: nobody in regional Australia is convinced by this, particularly the 43,000-odd people who took the time and the effort to sign this petition which was tabled in the Senate today. Members of the government can continue to deny this, they can continue to say black is white, but they know that the deregulation of Australia Post is a vote killer for them out there in regional Australia. They know it, and we in the Labor Party will continue to pursue this until such time as the government makes its position in relation to this matter completely clear and takes the bill off the Senate's agenda.
—It is not on the Senate agenda, you dope.
—When you look at Australia Post's record profit in the 1998-99 financial year, what you see is $80 million left for the community service obligation and reinvestment in the infrastructure for regional and rural Australia. 
—It is not on the Senate agenda.
—I notice that government senators opposite are saying that it is off the Senate agenda. That is very interesting because in the House of Representatives the other day Minister Anderson denied that the government had any plans at all to deregulate Australia Post. However, what has happened to this legislation? I can recall—and I think Senator Bishop was one of the people who was there—this matter being considered by a Senate committee. If the government does not intend to proceed with this legislation, I would appreciate Senator Ian Campbell getting up here today and indicating that, because there are 43,000 people who want to know. So, Senator Campbell, please get up—
—Address the chair, please.
—Through you, Madam Deputy President, I would appreciate Senator Campbell—and also Senator McGauran—getting up here today and saying that the government has killed the proposal to deregulate Australia Post.
—It was never on.
—I would really appreciate that, and I am sure people in regional and rural Australia will as well. I look forward to the contribution from Senator Crane in respect of that as well. If the government says that no postal outlet will close as a result of the deregulation—
—I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy President. Quite clearly, if the bill that the senator opposite is referring to was in fact on the Senate Notice Paper—which it is not, although I understand it is on the Notice Paper in the other place—the senator would have been out of order under standing order 194. She should be informed that it is not on the Senate Notice Paper, and that is the only reason in fact why she is allowed to speak today.
—Order! Senator Campbell, that is a spurious point of order and you know it.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. I must say we seem to have touched a bit of a soft spot or a sore point over there in relation to regional Australia and the proposed deregulation of Australia Post. I say this to Senator Campbell: you get up here today and you—
—You should read the Notice Paper.
—Order! Senator Campbell, you should cease interjecting.
—You should clarify the situation with regard to this government's agenda on the deregulation of Australia Post.
—You should address the Notice Paper. You are out of order again.
—Order! I will have some order. Senator Campbell, you have been here long enough to know that interjections are disorderly. I ask you to cease interjecting. Senator Mackay, could you address the chair, please?
—Madam Deputy President, I apologise for that. This commitment that no postal outlet will close in rural and regional Australia—
—You closed 270 post offices.
—Order! Senator Campbell, if you wish to participate in this debate put your name on the speakers list. Otherwise I will have silence, please.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy President. Senator Campbell does not have the intestinal fortitude to contribute to this debate. That is why his name is not there. 
If the government is serious about the commitment that no postal outlet will close in rural and regional Australia, I suspect that this will go down in history, along with the `never ever GST' and `petrol prices will not increase as a result of the GST', and come back and haunt this government. There is no doubt that this deregulation which the government is intent on pursuing—as confirmed by Senator Alston in the Senate yesterday—is the first step in the privatisation of Australia Post. There is no doubt that is what this government intends to do. It can deny it until it is blue in the face but everybody in regional Australia knows it. 
At present, as part of Australia Post's reserved services that enable it to subsidise services in non-profitable areas of Australia, the minimum charge for these items is $1.80. Senator Alston's office has said that the government has no plans currently to introduce amendments, which are in fact secret, with regard to the deregulation of part of the business mail market as revealed by the shadow minister for communications, Stephen Smith, last week. This will allow document exchange services to collect and deliver mail with no minimum cost. So, all of a sudden, at the death knell, we have not only the proposed deregulation of Australia Post but also secret amendments that Minister Alston says just happen to be out there for discussion that will in fact facilitate it and make it worse. 
Let me make it clear in the time remaining to me: the situation is very obvious. Australia Post has been told to absorb the GST. That is costing it $100 million. They have said that the deregulation of Australia Post will cost it $200 million. Australia Post's profit is $370 million. Do the maths, I say to senators on the opposite side. And I say this: everybody in regional Australia knows that this is step one in the full privatisation of Australia Post and that this is the same agenda you have got in relation to the full privatisation of Telstra. Nobody is being fooled. I would appreciate it if somebody from the government—soon-to-be opposition, hopefully—would stand up and say that this government will not proceed with this legislation.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,2001-03-28,"—Through you, Madam Deputy President, I say to Senator Mackay that it is unfortunate that you so consistently come into this place and speak with a forked tongue. You know, I know and people on this side of the chamber know—I do not know whether all the others on the other side know—that what you have just presented to this chamber is a typical Labor Party scare campaign. You know, I know and the people sitting in this chamber know that Australia Post has long been run on the basis of public ownership and a partnership with contractors. I know that for the last 59 years of my life I have received my mail on a contract arrangement, delivered by a truck or a van run by private enterprise. So to talk about deregulation as being something new for the postal services in this country is absolutely and totally wrong. I am going to say a little bit more about this. We have made commitments and delivered postal services in Australia that you were never prepared to do.
—Would you address the chair, please, Senator Crane?
—You have not communicated to anybody that you are going to provide the types of services we are going to provide to the Australian outback. So much of our mail today, through Madam Deputy President—
—To Madam Deputy President, thank you.
—And you know this, Madam Deputy President—
—To Madam Deputy President, not through. Just address the chair.
—To Madam Deputy President—I apologise for a word. You know, as the others should know, that in places like Orange your mail comes on private aeroplanes. Yet you talk about deregulation. It is a component part of providing postal services to this nation.
Let me tell you a few things, Madam Deputy President. The government is committed to ensuring that all Australians continue to enjoy the widest range of postal and related services and that Australia Post and its competitors continue to provide efficient and affordable services. We will not be closing 277 post offices as the Labor Party did in its last term of government. In fact, we have increased the number of post offices in Australia, particularly in rural and remote areas. There are places today that have postal services, post offices and a means of getting parcels 24 hours a day that you people could not even dream about—and you did not dream about. You did not even try to dream about it. You delivered worse services to the people of Australia in your term in government. For you to run these types of scare campaigns is a disgrace. People deserve better.
The government has guaranteed to retain Australia Post in full public ownership—will you do that or will you do a Commonwealth Bank?—and to continue provision of the standard letter services at a uniform rate for all Australians. To you, Madam Deputy President, did the Labor Party have a community service obligation with Australia Post? The answer is no—absolutely no. Australia Post is required to deliver a letter across the nation for a set rate, currently frozen at 45c, including GST, until 2003. Will you give the same commitment? I have not heard it.
The government has already introduced, for the first time ever, a postal service charter to promote and protect consumer rights. The service charter is underpinned by a set of performance regulations that require Australia Post to meet the following performance standards: 94 per cent of letters to be delivered on time by ordinary post; 98 per cent of delivery points to receive a minimum of five deliveries a week and 99.7 per cent to receive no less than two deliveries a week; a minimum retail presence of 4,000 postal outlets, of which at least 2,500 must be in rural and remote areas and a minimum dispersion of street post boxing of 10,000. That is our position. You wanted to know? I challenge you to meet it. I do not believe you would even consider meeting it, let alone delivering it.
In addition, the government is ensuring that Australia Post continues to provide vital subsidies to 700 licensed post offices in regional and rural Australia and is maintaining current concessional rate arrangements for the delivery of distance education material to isolated children. GiroPost, which provides face-to-face banking and bill paying services through 2,800 postal outlets, has recently been upgraded, after negotiation with the coalition government, to provide for business banking transactions in 200 post offices throughout regional Australia. And the list goes on of our commitment to postal services in this country—a commitment and performance that are unparalleled anywhere else in the world. You want to think about that—
—Senator Crane, whenever you use the word `you' you are referring to the chair.
—I thought he was referring to sheep, actually.
—This time, it is referring to the chair, not sheep, Senator Calvert. Senator Crane, would you please use the third person—they, not you—when you are referring to the opposition?
—The business banking service will effectively be fully rolled out across regional Australia by June this year. In the remaining time I have I want to look at a few points from Labor's record, because the test of performance in postal services in this nation is our services against the previous government's services. Labor's record on postal services is that they closed 277 outlets in their last six years of government. We have opened 105. That is a stark comparison.
—Is that true?
—That is absolutely true.
—What a top record! I don't know how you can come in and debate the matter. What are we debating?
—They have consistently opposed the RTC program, even though it is providing for the roll-out of online banking services. They failed to introduce any form of service charter or performance regulation for postal services—we have. Labor's position on postal issues is clearly hypocritical, given that they were the last government to introduce further competition into the postal market, including legitimising the operations of document exchange providers. As we look at our performance in government on postal services in this country and compare it with the previous government's, we are so far in front it is not even funny. And it is actually tragic when you play scare games and frighten people that things are going to change dramatically.
—It is—you are going to deregulate Australia Post.
—Through you, Madam Deputy President, to the chirping parrot on the other side, I just want to say quite clearly—
—Order! Senator Mackay.
—Well, I sat here and listened and never bleated a word.
—Order! Senator O'Brien and Senator Mackay will come order. Senator Crane, continue you remarks.
—I am continuing my remarks, thank you, Madam Deputy President. While we remain in government, people in rural and remote Australia can rely absolutely and totally, as can their city cousins and those in regional areas, on the postal services we will provide.
—We are proud! I take that interjection, because you were the government who said you would never sell the Commonwealth Bank. I understand you said some similar things about Qantas and TAA and a number of others—I do not have the exact records in front of me. But, as I said at the beginning of this speech, you speak with a forked tongue. You continue to speak with a forked tongue.
I do not know why anybody would want to come out and scare people—they are absolute scare tactics—when the facts are dead opposite. I have put the facts here on the table. I cannot do it all in the time that I have but certainly my colleagues will continue to put more information. I can, however, say quite categorically to the people of Australia that whether they live in the centre, live on the coast or live in remote and regional areas, they will continue to enjoy—under this government—the best postal services in the world and the best postal services that a government can deliver. Their reliability is improving, the services provided are getting greater in number and the majority of those services are getting cheaper.
As you add the whole list up—and I can speak from experience because I have lived in rural, regional and remote areas most of my life—what we have today is significantly better than it was 50 years ago. What we have today, as against five or six years ago, is monumentally better—there are more services and they are more reliable. A letter just six or seven years ago was taking five days to get to where we live. Today, it takes a day. There is a direct service running through, believe it or not, in a private motor car. This is an integral part of providing the service required.
—So why change it?
—Why would Senator Mackay come into this place and scare ordinary Australians? (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Australia Post: Deregulation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2001-03-28,"—The Democrats oppose any proposal to deregulate, privatise or do anything like that to Australia Post.
—We are all in agreement.
—I am glad to hear we are all in agreement, Senator McGauran. I will keep you to that if a bill does happen to come up that would do it. The government, of course, will deny—let me see: I think they have denied—that it is seeking to deregulate Australia Post services. However, the government has failed to clearly demonstrate that this is not the case. Since the coalition have been in government, they have undertaken a review into the services Australia Post provides, in the form of the National Competition Council. We all remember that review. They have also had two separate legislative packages drafted to deregulate postal services, each designed to end what the government refers to as the `monopoly position' of Australia Post. 
The government wants to amend the Australia Postal Corporation Act to provide additional exemptions to the reserved service for document exchange organisations, as far as we understand. But the amendments go further. Those amendments to Australia Post's services, we think, would establish a new access regime, with more power given to the ACCC to set prices and conditions and to resolve disputes. They would establish a new provision for allowing other service providers to aggregate mail. That refers to the process of combining groups of mail into a large bulk and putting it through the postal system at a reduced rate.
While these amendments appear to target Australia Post's business mail, if they are passed in their current form, as we understand it, their effect will be much broader. Business mail is the most lucrative component of postal services and accounts for approximately 85 per cent of all Australia Post's letters. That is a massive part of the postal network. Naturally, it is also the most profitable sector of Australia Post's services. There is little wonder, therefore, that other postal service providers are seeking access to this lucrative network. 
As we said in our minority report to the Senate committee which inquired into the deregulation of Australia Post last year, we believe that wholesale deregulation is purely an ideological exercise. The government clearly has a dislike for agencies which deliver services in the public interest. Successive governments have sold, privatised or deregulated public sector agencies. The funds generated by these agencies are then diverted away from the things governments must fund and into the private sector. The more lucrative aspects of business mail provide Australia Post with the funds it requires to deliver services across all Australia, to and from both residential and business addresses. Residential mail services are unique in Australia. The customer service obligation requires that Australia Post delivers to all Australians at least once a week, no matter where they reside.
Unlike other postal service providers or other courier services, for example, Australia Post is subject to a wide-ranging customer service obligation. So, if you live on a remote cattle station in the middle of the Northern Territory or in the north-west of Western Australia, you still—as Senator Crane told us—receive a regular mail service. But if the business mail activities of Australia Post are undermined or deregulated to such a degree that their revenue stream is jeopardised, then those living in rural and regional centres and in remote areas of Australia will be the first to have their services disappear.
The Democrats believe all Australia Post's current services must remain in public hands. We do not believe any postal service can be substantially diverted to private ownership. Taxpayers fund Australia Post and they should continue to receive all the benefits to which they are entitled. Australia Post must continue to provide all its current postal, retail and financial services and be encouraged to provide emerging digital data services, particularly in rural and regional areas. These areas have been the hardest hit by the withdrawal of government and private sector services. Banks are probably the most noticeable service to have withdrawn significantly from rural centres over the last decade. In their place, Australia Post outlets have introduced banking and bill paying services and are often the centre of community exchange and community focus.
No matter where Australians live, Australia Post provides efficient postal, electronic, and bill paying services. In fact, international comparisons have shown that Australia Post services are in the top two or three in the world for speed, cost and reliability. Why any government would want to jeopardise any of that is beyond all comprehension. We hope the government is committed to supporting Australia Post's community service obligations rather than jeopardising the revenue stream which Australia Post uses to deliver these services.
But rather than provide funds—from the Natural Heritage Trust, for instance—for more expanded Australia Post services, the government proposed to duplicate services in the form of rural transaction centres. This is public money being put by a government into something which is not a public service. We cannot understand why they would want to duplicate existing services when Australia Post services could quite simply be expanded. The infrastructure is already there. A clever government would build on this infrastructure and not seek to duplicate it unnecessarily. We also fear that any deregulation of Australia Post's postal system would see competitors come in without any commitment to the community service obligation, because under current legislation the community service obligation applies only to Australia Post.
While some commentators and members of parliament marvel at the increased level of share ownership in this country, we must not forget that this has come at the expense of full public sector investment and full government service provision. That must not be allowed to happen to Australia Post. Australia Post is also a major contributor to government revenue, having provided over $2½ billion over the last decade. Australia Post is one of the few remaining sources of revenue essential for schools, hospitals and health care. These resources are scarce enough, but are absolutely essential in non-metropolitan centres and must never be jeopardised.
But we are not the only ones who think Australia Post's services are vital to the community. Just this week I tabled in the Senate a petition from 9,034 petitioners in New South Wales requesting that the Senate oppose the deregulation of Australia's postal services and support the expansion of the community service obligations of Australia Post. Senator Mackay told us about the 43,630 signatures from the rest of Australia that she tabled today. That is about 53,000 signatures all up. The Australian Democrats certainly do support Post's CSO, and we will be opposing any deregulation of postal services. Senator Crane said at the end of his speech—and Senator McGauran has been saying much the same all the way through mine—that Australia Post does have one of the best operations in the world, and we agree with that. It certainly does. The thing is that we have to stop that being degraded. We have to make sure that it stays one of the best in the world.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Australia Post: Deregulation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-03-28,"—The topic of today's MPI debate is one in which I have taken a keen interest over the last two years in this place. As the Howard-Anderson government has progressed with the implementation of its deregulation policies since it has come into government, regional and rural Australia has been affected and its lifestyle made worse.
The government now has its sights set on the further deregulation of Australia Post. As my colleague Senator Mackay indicated, our position on this is clear and simple: we oppose any further deregulation of the postal industry. We have good reasons behind our opposition to the further deregulation of Australia Post. Put simply, it will have two consequences: firstly, there will be a reduction in postal services to regional, rural and outer metropolitan areas of Australia; and, secondly, Australians living in those areas will pay more for existing or new postal services.
The opposition takes the view that Australia Post is a critical part of Australia's communications infrastructure and plays a unique role in ensuring that Australians everywhere have access—as other speakers have indicated—to a quality, reliable, improving over time postal service. Australians who live in rural and regional areas particularly revere Australia Post's role, often because alternative means of communication are inaccessible or prohibitively expensive. They rely on Australia Post, as my colleagues have indicated.
The opposition takes the view that Australia Post must be allowed to continue its unique role in the emerging digital age. The government's postal deregulation proposals may have potentially damaging consequences on Australia Post and so jeopardise its role in the delivery of emerging digital services in rural and regional communities right across this continent. A competitive market may have two main consequences resulting from the disproportionate cost of rural and remote services. At present, Australia Post cross-subsidises loss making services with profitable metropolitan services. If competitors are able to cherry pick profitable services, Australia Post's profit on those services, which it uses to subsidise unprofitable services, will be reduced. This could mean that service levels decline and costs increase substantially. There are no other alternatives, and both of these consequences are undesirable and inequitable.
Of particular concern is the possibility that, in the deregulated environment proposed by the government in the bill that has not yet been brought forward, Australia Post might have to consider charging non-reserve postal services on a differential basis. That would mean Australia Post would be charging more for services in rural, remote and even regional and outer metropolitan areas than for those in the profitable, high density urban areas. During last year's public hearings for the inquiry into the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2000, Australia Post advised the committee:
We would have to review the market impact—
that is, of deregulation—
of course, over time and see how our profitability was going to see whether some price differential in competitive non-reserve areas was warranted or not ... 
Clearly, differentiated pricing would put users of mail services outside metropolitan areas at considerable disadvantage compared with their urban colleagues.
The government has consistently claimed that services in rural and regional areas will not be affected by its proposed deregulation. It persists in making this claim, even though it concedes—and I quote from the explanatory memorandum to the bill:
It is not possible to quantify the costs and benefits to participants in the postal industry from the reduction in the reserved services and the postal services access regime.
The potential impact of the legislation on licensed postal office operators is another concern, especially in non-metropolitan areas where adverse impacts could result in bankruptcy of licensees and mail contractors to the detriment and harm of the communities in which they are located and which they serve.
The opposition believes that maintaining Australia Post as a robust local presence in regional areas for the delivery of both existing and emerging services will help to bridge the growing communications divide that exists between rural and urban communities. The government's proposals as put forward in their bill come at a time of economic uncertainty for Australia Post, as economic change is accelerated by rapidly developing information technology.
The introduction of the goods and services tax in July last year placed Australia Post under considerable pressure. Australia Post estimated that the adverse impact on the profitability of the organisation was approximately $90 million to $100 million this financial year, reducing profit on last year by approximately 25 per cent. Australia Post has estimated that the further decline in its profits that will result from the deregulatory regime proposed by the government is around a further $200 million. This figure represents over half of Australia Post's total profit for the last financial year. Combined with the estimated $90 million to $100 million impact of the introduction of the goods and services tax, Australia Post's profit would decline by over $290 million if the government's proposals for deregulation go ahead. Compared with Australia Post's record 1998-99 financial year profit of $370 million, Australia Post would be left with less than $80 million in this year or in subsequent years to reinvest in infrastructure or to subsidise service obligations outside metropolitan areas. Australia Post advised the committee during the inquiry into the postal bill that the erosion of profit will necessarily mean a reduction in investment in the postal network infrastructure, again placing services and, ultimately, prices at risk. Furthermore, Australia Post will obviously return less by way of dividend to the Commonwealth.
The government has not provided quantitative data about the potential risks and benefits of its proposals. The implications of this reform require greater consideration and analysis than the government has undertaken or at least than has been publicly released for review. We support this review on the basis that it will guarantee universal communications services now and in the future. We oppose the government's proposed deregulatory changes on the basis that these changes would significantly reduce the capacity for Australia Post to provide existing and potential future communications services. They would also curb development of Australia Post's national postal and communications infrastructure. Once again it seems that this government has chosen to ignore the legitimate fears of Australians living outside major concentrated urban centres.
In light of the recent Liberal-National Party electoral losses in Western Australia and Queensland and in the by-election up in Queensland a fortnight ago, it might be time for the government to acknowledge that the petition tabled by Senator Mackay, bearing over 43,000 signatures, represents the genuine sentiment of Australians. It is about time this government started to listen to what Australians want and to act upon what it hears. Australians do not want Australia Post to be deregulated, because they know that the services they currently enjoy will suffer and the costs that they bear will increase. The opposition calls upon the government to abandon its proposals for deregulation, because they are not in the national interest and would have a disastrous impact on rural and regional Australia.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Australia Post: Deregulation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2001-03-28,"—Here we go again! They are at it again—trying to scare the people of Australia. They have obviously scared them into signing a petition which has some 40,000 signatures. I guess that petition is a bit like some of the other shonky ones you see about the place. But just for the record, I will repeat what my colleague Senator Crane said: the government has guaranteed to retain Australia Post in full public ownership. Talk about scare tactics. I heard Senator Bishop say just a while ago that costs are going to go up; that people will pay more. For the record, the government has a community service obligation, and this obligation requires that Australia Post deliver a letter across the nation for a set rate, 45c, frozen until 2003. This government puts Australian consumers first—not their union mates, as do the opposition.
Senator Crane also mentioned the postal services charter initiative. We have got a postal services charter which is protecting consumers' rights in postal services right around Australia. It guarantees letters being delivered on time; the number of delivery points; a minimum retail presence of some 4,000 postal outlets—and at least 2,500 of those have to be in rural and remote areas—and some 10,000 post-boxes around Australia as a minimum number. We are requiring standards to be set in place to ensure that the Australian consumers are winners. On top of that, the government is ensuring that Australia Post continues to provide subsidies to the 700 licensed post offices that are in rural and regional Australia. It also is maintaining the concessional rates for distance education material for isolated children. Then, as Senator Crane mentioned, there is giroPost at some 2,800 postal outlets. Also, we are providing business banking in 200 post offices throughout regional Australia. I remind the Senate that in the last six years of the Labor government they closed down something like 277 postal outlets and each one of those had a banking service.
Do not come in here and lecture us about what we are proposing to do, because it is on the record: we are providing protection for rural and regional Australia and for consumers. The coalition has certainly done more to improve postal services for rural and regional Australia. I do not think we need to be reminded about the $70 million Rural Transaction Centres Program. That was opposed by the Labor Party. That program provides small communities with access banking, bill paying and postal services. You opposed that and yet your colleague Harry Quick is out there promoting it. We have made some other commitments. We re-polled the remote areas, which led to another 1,517 delivery services. We found there was a need there and we responded to that need. There has been an extension of concessional rates for holders of private and locked bags in rural and regional areas. Unlike Labor, this government has developed an integrated package of economic, environmental and social programs in response to the genuine needs of Australian people living in regional areas. Overall, the coalition has made a multibillion dollar investment in regional Australia, the scale and breadth of which far exceeds anything the Labor Party did in 13 years.
—What about the other services?
—We turn to Labor's record and ask: what is Labor's policy on postal services? What comfort can you, Senator Mackay, give rural and regional Australians, given your party's proud record in this area when you were in government? Mr Acting Deputy President—
—Don't deregulate Australia Post. We won't deregulate—and we won't sell Telstra, either.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, it is very difficult to address you when I am being harassed from the other side.
 (Senator Watson)—Just ignore the interjections.
—We all know that Labor is a policy-free zone. We know that they are policy lazy. So this afternoon I got my staff to check Labor's web site. There is nothing on it about postal services but a vague media statement. It has no detail and it does not promise anything, but it does conclude by saying:
Labor will release more detailed policies regarding the enhanced delivery of services in rural and regional Australia closer to the election.
We wait with bated breath. While the Labor Party is indulging itself in all this meaningless talk, the government is getting on with the job. Labor's position on postal services can be summed up in two words: do nothing. It is not going to change anything, it has no new ideas, it has a completely closed mind. We do not need to be reminded that their leader said just this week, `If you don't have any policies, the issue of how you can afford them does not come up.'
If that is what the people of Australia are going to get over the next nine or 12 months leading up to the next election, I just hope they remember what Labor's abysmal record is on postal services. Just for the record, 277 outlets were closed down in the last six years of their government. We have opened 105 since then, so we have a positive record. They have consistently criticised the Rural Transaction Centres Program even though it is providing the online banking services that the bush really wants. The Labor Party have not provided any guarantee of a service charter; we have. They are totally hypocritical about their position, because when they were last in government they introduced further competition in the postal market. This included the operation of document exchange providers.
Not only have they deceived the people of Australia, particularly in rural and regional areas but they are continuing to do so. The shadow minister for communications, Stephen Smith, misled the Australian public, including thousands of small businesses in rural and regional Australia: he claimed that document exchanges had no presence in rural and regional Australia. For the record, I remind the Senate that the Ausdoc/goMail document exchange administers over 290 exchanges providing services in rural Australian towns from Broken Hill to Broome. For Senator Mackay's benefit, in our own state of Tasmania, we have two: one at Huonville and one at Devonport, in case she did not know. So for Mr Smith to go out there and claim that document exchanges have no presence in rural and regional Australia is ignoring the truth.
I heard Senator Bishop saying that we are running down services in rural and regional Australia. I guess I am going to run out of time but I would remind the people of Australia, particularly in regional Australia, that coalition policies have committed over $3.5 billion in specific programs to meet the economic, environmental and social needs of regional Australia. They include the $1.5 billion Natural Heritage Trust, the $525 million Agriculture—Advancing Australia package, the $464 million regional telecommunications infrastructure fund, the $1 billion Federation Fund, the $70 million Rural Transaction Centres Program, the $120 million television fund to extend SBS to the country, the $45 million local government online fund and the $28 million to expand the mobile phone coverage. Labor was going to close down the analog system with no replacement: I remind the rural people about that.
 (Senator Watson)—Your time has expired, Senator Calvert.
—There is a whole heap here, Mr Chairman. I will pass them on to my colleague.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Australia Post: Deregulation</title>,Matters of Public Importance,15,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-03-28,"—I hope Senator Calvert does pass them on to his colleague: he might give him something to say. It does not seem to me that, in relation to this debate, the government senators have much to say at all, other than comments from Senator Crane. I really want to quote Senator Crane with approval. You would think that a prudent conservative government would live with the philosophy that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. That is the sort of line that you hear day in day out from the conservatives around the world when change is proposed: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. What does Senator Crane say about the current situation of Australia's postal service? He said, `It's the best postal service in the world.' What one would normally expect from a prudent conservative government is `if it ain't broke, don't fix it'.
I have heard a lot of suggestion that, because Labor insisted that Australia Post become efficient and required it to close postal outlets that were not, somehow we were attacking postal services around the country. Yet if you listen to what government senators are saying now about Australia Post you would have to come to the conclusion that Labor certainly did no damage. If it is the best postal service in the world, certainly if it ranks in the top five, we certainly did not debilitate—
—The top two.
—The top two, says Senator Bishop. Senator Crane says `the best'. We certainly did not debilitate the postal services to Australians and particularly to rural and regional Australians, when Senator Crane, who lives in a rather remote part of Western Australia, says he can get mail in a day. He says that there are contractors involved. Yes, there are contractors involved, contractors to Australia Post. So what is the problem? Why does the government need to put a bill through? It is currently before the House of Representatives, I understand; so to the extent that some of the interjectors earlier were suggesting that it was not before the Senate, that is being too cute by half. We all know that the government intends, if it can, to get the bill through and to take away from Australia Post part of its business and hand it over to its mates at the big end of town. That is what the government is about. That is why the government is not saying if it ain't broke, don't fix it. They do not mind if Australia Post is broke. What they really want to do is transfer about $300 million out of Australia Post revenues and put that in the hands of their mates.
You would expect that from a government which is, as everyone knows, a government for the big end of town. I want to digress for a second, because the ALP has released some important policies recently about banks—another policy area we have released. The government has criticised it, of course, because what we are trying to do in that area is ensure that community service obligations are imposed upon the banks in the private sector, and the government says we are irresponsible. What does Merrill Lynch say? Merrill Lynch estimates that it could wipe $14 billion from the sector's market value. In other words, we will be responsible for transferring $14 billion from the value of those banks back to the community in the form of community service obligations. What the government is trying to do in this area is transfer from the public purse about $300 million to its mates at the big end of town in a variety of ways, not so that they can improve the postal service to Australia and can guarantee benefits between now and 2003 but in the long term—because really that is what any government has to be about: benefits to the whole of Australia, including the more remote parts of Australia. How can you do that when you hand over a key part of the revenue of an important government business to the coalition's mates in the private sector? You make it very difficult. The only way you can do it is to take it out of the general revenues that the government has. You say, `Well, what are we going to do?' This government has been good at taking money out of government schools and giving it to private schools and taking it out of public hospitals and giving it to private health and private hospitals, and this is just another example of the government wanting to transfer moneys out of the public revenues and put them into private pockets. That is what this legislation is all about.
I go back to the point that the government itself admits—Senator Crane admits it, and I have not heard any of his colleagues deny it—that we have got one of the best postal services in the world. I have heard talk of change, and the change is supposed to be about competition, but I have not heard anyone say how it will actually make the service better. I have not heard anyone say how. And I have not heard them say—and you would not expect to hear them say—that the real benefit is putting money into the pockets of big business. But the reality is that, when you take away the business mail concession from Australia Post and you hand it over to the private sector, what you are about is taking money away from Australia Post and the people who pay for that post and putting it in the hands of new mail contractors. 
The fact of the matter is that in the postal area there is a transfer between the city and the country, and I would be very interested to hear what Senator McGauran says about why we should support a system which will stop that transfer of financial resources from Australian cities to the country, which is what happens now; a system which will prevent that from happening, which will aggregate the benefit in the cities and will require the public purse ultimately to guarantee the services for rural and regional Australia, the parts of Australia that his party purports to represent.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2001-03-28,"—In addressing this MPI on Australia Post, I would firstly like to pick up on Senator O'Brien's comments about the Labor Party bank policy. Senator O'Brien is the first member of the opposition in this Senate to raise the Labor Party's bank policy. He only said it in passing by the way, because they are a little ashamed about their recently released bank policy, which has absolutely sunk without a trace. You would not have thought Senator O'Brien would be the one to raise the Labor Party's newly released bank policy. Heavens above, just to get a policy from them is enough. But you would have thought the shadow minister in charge of that policy, Senator Conroy, would have come into this chamber and spoken about it, boasted about it and taken any opportunity to speak on the matter that he could. But Senator Conroy has literally gone missing this week in his moment of glory when he actually has a policy paper. The reason for that is simply that the Labor Party utterly plagiarised that policy; there was not an original thought in it. 
The opposition were caught out plagiarising the Australian Bankers Association's policy. How do we know this? Because the Australian Bankers Association told us off the record that they received a visit from the Labor Party shadow minister and, in all good faith and good trust, they said, `We're going to do this, this and this and we're going to announce it very soon.' So what did the Labor Party do? They thought, `That's a great idea. We agree with your policy'—I will not go into the details of the matter—and rushed out their own policy which was a mirror reflection of the Australian Bankers Association's policy. The only difference is that the Labor Party showed a bit of machismo by saying, `We'll legislate,' when we already know that the banks will voluntarily introduce a code of social practice and no-fee, specialist accounts.
If that was the point Senator O'Brien was trying to make, my point is this: that is just one indication of the lightweight issues that come from the other side, and this MPI is another one. I have seen many MPIs come before this parliament and I have spoken on many of them, and this would have to go down as one of the most lightweight MPIs—I will not say it is the most lightweight—to come before this parliament. We are debating how important, how efficient and how needed Australia Post is to rural and regional Australia in particular, and it just so happens that we are all in agreeance. Why have a matter of public importance debate on that? You extrapolate from our responses that we must be privatising Australia Post. We are not privatising Australia Post. In fact, it is a very good example of the national competition policy and the public interest test actually working. Against the National Competition Council's recommendation that Australia Post should be completely deregulated and face competition, this government has said that there are exceptions in the public interest. Australia Post is just one of those exceptions, along with the Wheat Board, the sugar industry, the rice industry, newsagencies and chemists. 
This is yet another good example of a 100 per cent government owned utility working. It is working because an element of competition has been introduced into Australia Post, and that was started by the Labor Party with our support. That competition has transformed that old, lumbering post office where you could pick up a stamp if you stood in the queue long enough and post your letters. They were about the only two things the post office was good for. But with the introduction of an element of competition, and while still in government hands, Australia Post has been transformed into a shopfront that does more than sell stamps and post letters; it is in fact a fine utility. Any Australian would agree that that has been an improvement for Australia Post. Consumers now are given a choice in regard to courier services and the size of parcels. They have lower costs because of that choice and that element of competition upon Australia Post. All round, Australia Post has smartened up and increased its profits.
Through all this competition that has been brought upon Australia Post, not one service has been reduced in the rural and regional areas; it is quite the opposite. Services have been increased in rural and regional areas. Some 105 post offices have been opened by this government. In fact, in the rural and regional areas, Australia Post is expanding. It is a different Australia Post to what it was 20 years ago that the Labor Party would probably want to turn the clock back to. It is a different government utility, but it is working very well.
We will give the guarantees here in this MPI that Senator Mackay is so anxious to get. We will give the guarantee that Australia Post will remain in government hands 100 per cent. Not one service to rural and regional Australia, let alone one post office, will be reduced. We will keep in place the 45c stamp, which is a cross-subsidisation, and we will keep in place the community service obligation. We have given you all the guarantees you have called for in this debate, Senator Mackay. So, as I said, I do not know what we are particularly debating. There must be a budget in the air, because this is your ritualistic scare campaign, run up the flag of privatisation of Australia Post. The Labor Party, like clockwork, can be counted on because it raises this every year in the run-up to a budget. We reject this MPI out of hand.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-03-28,"—The opposition opposes the motion that the Senate agree to the amendment to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 made by the House of Representatives. The amendment to be moved by the opposition today will replace the amendment moved in the House.
—Have you got an amendment?
—We have circulated the amendment.
—There is not one here at the table.
—We haven't seen it.
—I can hear Senator Bourne saying she does not have it. Senator Patterson does not have it.
—We requested that it be circulated earlier this morning, at about 9 o'clock.
—It should have gone to the minister's office. We are not going to debate an amendment we have not seen.
—At this stage, we are simply opposing the motion moved by Senator Patterson. I foreshadow that we will be amending the motion that the report of the committee be adopted. For the information of interested senators, the foreshadowed amendment reads:
(1)	At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate calls on the Government to:
	(a)	suspend the auction of datacasting spectrum until the Parliament has adopted a less restrictive datacasting regime, a process that could still allow the datacasting spectrum auction to be completed this financial year;
	(b)	extend the application of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the ABC Charter to the ABC's on-line and datacasting services;
	(c)	honour its commitment that the ABC and the SBS will not pay datacasting licensing fees; and
	(d)	rectify its failure to adequately resource the ABC to effect the national broadcaster's transition to the digital world”.
At this stage I am simply opposing the motion moved by Senator Patterson. At the outset, I would like to point out that Labor's grave concerns with the existing television and datacasting regime remain. This bill makes amendments to that regime. Labor believes that the consideration of this bill provides an ideal opportunity to correct what is blatantly a flawed policy.
On advice from the Clerk, the opposition were unable to revisit the full gamut of amendments that we moved at the beginning of this month when the bill was originally considered by the Senate. Had we been able to move those amendments again on this occasion, we would have done so. We believe that digital television and datacasting have a lot to offer Australians if appropriately implemented. That is the problem: the regime is fatally flawed. Consequently, consumers will be deprived of much of the potential of the digital world.
The dismal failure that is datacasting proves this point. Effectively there are only two major participants in the current datacasting spectrum auction: Telstra and NTL. This is problematic for the future of datacasting and reflects very badly on the government's policy. Only the spectrum sales from Melbourne, Sydney and Perth will be conducted on the basis of competitive auctions, and the two participants, Telstra and NTL, are not even content providers. Clearly the government's policy has been to the ultimate detriment of all Australians. The digital transition has so much potential, and the government has succeeded in stifling most of that.
There is one outstanding matter that we are able to consider today, and that is the opposition's attempt to permit national broadcasters to engage in unrestricted multichannelling. At the beginning of this month, when the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 came before the Senate, several amendments were made to the bill. The opposition moved many more, but the Democrats and the government colluded to defeat those amendments. One of our amendments that the Democrats did support related to the granting of unrestricted multichannelling to the national broadcasters. We managed to get the amendment in the bill, allowing the ABC and SBS to multichannel in an unrestricted fashion. The Senate subsequently split the bill, moving the provisions of the bill that permitted the national broadcasters unrestricted multichannelling into a second bill. The Democrats joined with the government to remove from the bill the provisions that they had helped us to put in there. The government and the Democrats botched their deal to get unrestricted multichannelling out of the bill and accidentally removed a provision of the bill that the government had originally put into it.
The provision that the government accidentally removed allowed the SBS to multichannel in respect of international news broadcasts. Only the ABC had been granted that capacity in the amendments to the BSA last year. The government amended the bill in the House of Representatives to reinsert that provision into the bill. The opposition will oppose the motion that the Senate agree to the government's amendment to the bill in the House of Representatives, because the amendment that we will move provides for unrestricted multichannelling for the ABC and SBS. The opposition's amendment eliminates the need for the inclusion of this single genre of broadcasting for the SBS because it removes all restrictions on what both national broadcasters can multichannel by removing the restricted list of possible genres. The provisions inserted by the Senate removed all of the content restrictions on multichannelling for national broadcasters. When the Democrats and the government got together and split the bill, the amendments passed by the Senate that allowed unrestricted multichannelling by the broadcasters were moved into another separate bill, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Multi-channelling) Bill 2001.
You may well ask why the opposition support multichannelling for the ABC and SBS. We first sought to achieve this purpose last year when we considered the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 1999. On that occasion the Democrats supported our amendments, enabling the ABC and SBS to engage in unrestricted multichannelling. However, the government was manifestly opposed to that amendment and clearly indicated that it would not contemplate unrestricted multichannelling by the ABC and SBS. On that basis, the government enumerated the genres in which the ABC and SBS would be permitted to engage in multichannelling. The opposition consulted the ABC and SBS on this matter, and we were advised that they did not object to the list of genres that the government proposed. It was their view at that time that those restrictions would not inhibit their multichannelling program.
The opposition expressed at that time our policy position that the national broadcasters should not be restricted when engaging in multichannelling and that we would pursue implementation of that position as soon as the opportunity arose. This bill afforded us that opportunity. Allowing the ABC to engage in unrestricted multichannelling was achieved by repealing provisions in section 5A of schedule 4 to the BSA that contained those restrictions. The opposition moved those amendments because we were concerned to see that the ABC and SBS were not restricted in the multichannelling services they chose to offer.
The failure of Australians to embrace digital television means that the removal of the restrictions on the national broadcasters' ability to engage in multichannel digital programming is critical as this could be a significant driver in the take-up of digital technology. Multichannelling by the national broadcasters is an important step, and it is not appropriate for this amendment permitting unrestricted multichannelling to be removed from the original bill. The rationale for the government's ongoing opposition to removing restrictions on multichannelling by the national broadcasters is not easily ascertained. The opposition wishes to note once again that the commercial stations do not oppose multichannelling by the ABC and SBS within their charters, which is not commercial. The opposition believes that multichannelling complements the charters of the national broadcasters and sees no valid justification for denying the national broadcasters the ability to multichannel in an unrestricted way within the constraints of their charters. This is particularly so when those arguments are balanced against the benefits.
The opposition made its policy clear during the debates on the digital television bill last year. I quote my remarks at that time:
... our policy position remains that the national broadcasters should be able to multichannel in an unencumbered way within their charters.
I stated during the debate that we would have preferred to have remained with the carte blanche approach in the original amendment to the bill. Bearing in mind the importance of the enactment of that legislation to the industry generally, the opposition supported the passage of the government's amendments. We did maintain our policy position that the national broadcasters should be able to multichannel in an unencumbered fashion, even though the national broadcasters indicated that those limited exceptions would not prevent either from engaging in the content and programming they planned.
It is appropriate, given this opportunity to reflect upon last year's legislation, that we seek to implement our continuing view that the national broadcasters should not be restricted in the content they are permitted to multichannel within the confines of their charters. Removing the amendment from this bill which allowed the national broadcasters to multichannel was a move by the government to further delay consideration of the amendment and its implications. The new bill that has been created by removal of that amendment is listed for consideration in the Senate on 6 August 2001. So the Democrats have effectively acquiesced to the government's desire to avoid this issue entirely by delaying it as long as possible. For that reason, and because we believe it is critical that the national broadcasters be able to engage in unrestricted multichannelling as soon as possible, the opposition is seeking to put that amendment, allowing unrestricted multichannelling by the national broadcasters, back into the act.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2001-03-28,"—It is actually cruel what the ALP does to Senator Bishop, making him give these speeches and then have to sit there and listen to me respond to them. I think it is quite mean. However, he is in that position and he is very brave about it. He is sitting there, and now I will respond to what he said. I will start by saying that Mr Smith gave a speech on this very matter last week, and much of it was pretty benign and other bits were some of the most offensive things I have ever read in my life. Those were the bits that applied to me. It would be unparliamentary of me to say that Mr Smith lied, so I will not do that. It is true to say, however, that when he represented my views and my actions, that was not an accurate representation; that was, in fact, an outrageous misrepresentation. While Senator Bishop has not gone as far as Mr Smith did, I believe that he has rather outrageously misrepresented my views as well, and probably will continue to do so because it is in the best interests of the Labor Party that he do that. However, I will put my own views.
I am coming to this with a little bit of difficulty because I have not seen the ALP's amendments. I know that is not something that was intended by Senator Bishop. I am just going through the amendments, and I am sure Senator Bishop will correct me if I am wrong about them. One amendment would add to the end of the motion from the House of Representatives, which is now being moved here, that the Senate calls on the government to—
—Senator, that amendment will be to the adoption of the committee report once we get out of committee. The amendment that will be dealt with while we are in committee is on sheet 2165.
—Thank you, Madam Chairman, I have that. In relation to the amendment we will deal with as we come out of committee, as far as I can see from having a quick look at it now, part (a) and part (d) are the two parts that were agreed to in the second reading amendment when the bill was before us last time. Part (b) is probably a reflection of the ALP's amendment about advertising on ABC Online and relates to the ABC charter. Senator Bishop can tell me about that later.
Part (c) is about honouring a commitment that the ABC and SBS will not pay datacasting licence fees. That is also a reflection, as far as I can see, of one of the amendments which Senator Bishop put up last time which was lost because absolutely nobody was of the opinion that the ABC and SBS did have to pay datacasting licence fees. In fact, we had moved an amendment, the minister acknowledged it, the department agreed with at and, when we contacted them, the commercial television stations all thought it was the case—and so did the ABC and SBS—that they would not pay datacasting licence fees anyway. If I have all that correctly, I cannot see why the Democrats would agree to it. We have already agreed to (a) and (d) and they have already gone through—they had been passed as part of the second reading amendment. We do not need to do it again.
I may not be correct about part (b)—I am sure Senator Bishop will correct me if I am not—but that is something I am going to move tomorrow in a private member's bill. We have already dealt with part (c), so I do not see any reason to go back to that. We have already dealt with it several times—we dealt with it in the original bill, we dealt with it again when we came up to the amendments—and I really do not see any reason to deal with it again. It does not really bother me very much, but there is no reason for any of that.
In relation to the amendment we will deal with while we are in committee—and I may have this incorrectly because I do not have the original bill in front of me; I did not realise this was coming up so I did not think to bring it with me—I think the effect of this amendment would be just to reinstate the multichannelling provisions for ABC and SBS into the bill while taking away from the SBS the ability to put international news on their multichannel or second channel. I am sure Senator Bishop will tell me if that is correct. If that is correct, there is a very significant problem with that, and it is exactly the same very significant problem that existed last time we dealt with this bill. Nothing has changed. The government's attitude has not changed, as far as I know. I am sure Senator Patterson will tell me if it has, but I cannot imagine that it has.
The first time we dealt with this bill the government's attitude was that they did not really care—sad to say—whether SBS got their international news broadcasting on their second channel. They were quite prepared for that piece of legislation to drop. It would never have gone anywhere if anything had been done to change it. In fact it is cruel to say that you are trying to advantage someone when you know for an absolute fact that you cannot do it this way—it cannot be done like this. If the opposition's amendment goes through and the government's opinion has not changed, and I cannot imagine that it has—I hope it has, that would be great, let's go for it—absolutely nothing will happen and SBS will not be allowed to put international news on their second channel. You are not giving them anything extra; you are taking something away. We will have another opportunity to address this and to address advertising, but it is absolutely cruel to tell people that you are trying to help them when you are not, when that is not what is going on. 
Just once more I will run through what happened last year with multichannelling because people may not understand—which is why this has come up again. Last year we had the bill before us, and it was a really important bill, and there was a great deal of power and influence and money at stake. If that bill had not gone through—and I think we were up to the second last day of sitting—a lot of very powerful and influential people would have been very upset. The government really wanted that bill to go through. Everybody knew that if there were small amendments to the bill that the government could live with then they would go through, and everybody knew that unrestricted multichannelling was one of those amendments. There is absolutely no question about that. If unrestricted multichannelling had been agreed to last year when that bill went through, when there was huge pressure on the government to put that bill through, the ABC and SBS would have had unrestricted multichannelling. It did not happen. 
That amendment did not go through because the Labor Party decided to agree with the government that it should not go through. Anybody who knows how this place works knows that it could have gone through then. It did not because the Labor Party did not allow it to. I can tell you now—and I see that the minister is here—that the government's attitude in relation to this bill was, in effect, to say, `If you try to make us do this now, the bill will just disappear and you will never see it again and, what is more, SBS will not get the international news on their second channel, which they desperately want.' That may or may not still be the government's attitude. If the government are now prepared to allow multichannelling on ABC and SBS—whacko!—I am right in it. You may recall that it was my amendment in the first place. It was exactly the same amendment as the one put up by Senator Bishop—and it was a bloody good amendment. It could have gone through. But, of course, it did not and we all know why. 
Now today we have another amendment that the government are prepared to agree to. It is a small amendment but it is very important to the SBS. It is important that SBS be given the right to include international news on their second channel. It would be fabulous if the government intend to allow multichannelling at this point, but we all know that if the government do not intend to allow multichannelling at this point then it is not going to happen because it has to go through the House of Representatives. So it is cruel to do that to the SBS. It is just not fair. If the government want to allow multichannelling now and are prepared to allow this through, I will be the first person to jump through hoops of fire and I will be really happy. But if the government are not prepared to do that, if they are only prepared to give SBS the international news on their second channel—which SBS desperately want and which they will not get if Senator Bishop's amendment goes through and the government are not prepared to agree to it because it has to go through the House of Representatives as well, sadly—that would be very cruel. 
It would be much better if there were one chamber in parliament and we were that chamber, but that is not the case; so we have to deal with that. If the government are not prepared to do that then I cannot see that we can agree with Senator Bishop's amendment—we just cannot. Multichannelling will come up again, as he says, on 6 August and I hope that advertising and online will come up at the same time. But to be fair to SBS, if the Democrats have a choice now between giving SBS international news on their second channel and giving nobody anything—and be very sure there is a choice—then we are going to give SBS international news on their second channel, which is what they want. 
I think it is incredibly rich of the opposition to keep saying that they really want unrestricted multichannelling. I am really pleased that they want it now, but I think it is an absolute tragedy for the ABC and SBS and for broadcasting in Australia that the opposition did not really want it last June. I think it is one of the biggest tragedies for broadcasting in Australia. The fact that they are now saying that they think it can happen is absolutely unbelievable. SBS are not stupid; they are not foolish. They know how the place works. They know that, unless the government have changed their mind, the simple choice is: either SBS get international news on their second channel or nobody gets anything. If that is the choice—and I still believe that it must be, and certainly I will take the minister's advice on this—then I think the SBS should get something rather than nobody getting anything. And that is what would happen because we have to go through the House of Representatives. It is a sad fact, but it is the case.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-03-28,"—I do not know whether Senator Bourne is a football fan or not but she reads the run of play pretty well. She is quite right, but I think she also needs to understand the extent of the treachery that has been perpetrated today. We all know that the Labor Party is on a stunt a day but this really does take the cake. It is something that needs to be brought to the attention of the widest possible audience.
Some two or three weeks back, my chief of staff was in contact with the office of Mr Stephen Smith, the shadow minister, and asked whether there were any matters of concern about this issue when it came back to the Senate. We were informed that there would be the usual noises made, but otherwise there were no particular issues and it would go through in the normal way. My broadcasting adviser spoke to Senator Bishop's office before question time today and was given a similar assurance. That is simply not good enough. No-one had any idea about this grubby little ambush. You know exactly what you are on about; Senator Bourne is absolutely correct. Your bona fides were tested a long time ago on this. You went into it with your eyes open—
—Would you address the chair, please.
—Madam Chairman, in defence of the Labor Party's position, they were entitled to proceed on the basis that the ABC itself said that it was content to work within that regime. I know Senator Bourne's ambit claim is a lot higher than that, but the fact of the matter is that all the parties knew what they were doing last time around. This sort of feigned indignation or pretence at wanting to go a bit further is something that Senator Bourne quite rightly identified as transparent dishonesty.
I for one am very disappointed. My dealings to date with Senator Bishop have always been on the basis that he is pretty reliable and I know where he is coming from. But, Senator Bishop, all the advice I have had is that there was absolutely no way that any amendments were foreshadowed. Quite to the contrary, we were led to believe that there might be a bit of a discussion and people might want to make a few points, but beyond that there was nothing. We are now seeing simply yet another grandstanding opportunity, which is highly consistent, I know, with your party's approach to life. You think that going out there and finding hooks on which to hang political points is going to stand you in good stead down the track.
—Minister, do not use the word `you' because it actually refers to the chair.
—I understand that. I should  not associate you with such a dishonourable approach.
—Excuse me, do not reflect on the chair, either. It is the chair you are addressing, not the incumbent.
—I think the Australian public will well and truly understand what the Labor Party is on about here. They think that these sorts of stunts are a substitute for policy. The public do not think that; the public will know exactly what you are on about. It will not get you anywhere and, as Senator Bourne quite rightly says, all you will achieve is to effectively deprive SBS of the opportunity to carry international news on its second channel. If that is not your intention, then you are even more disingenuous than I thought, because you have known from the outset what the fate of this legislation would be. You have known exactly what would happen when it came back here. In fact, you know that the only reason that this matter is under consideration is that it was accidentally taken out at an earlier stage and then put back in in the House of Representatives in order to tidy the issue up. You have allowed us to proceed at all times on the basis that this matter had been effectively resolved. It is not good enough. I hope that Senator Bourne will see this as yet further evidence that the Labor Party simply cannot be trusted.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-03-28,"—It is always fine to take umbrage and to take the high position, but when doing so it is always useful to make allegations that are correct. Let me go through what Senator Alston has just outlined. He alleges, firstly, that there was a deliberate ambush on the part of the opposition; secondly, that the information from me to his adviser was deliberately misleading; and, thirdly, that there was an ambush in these proceedings.
Let us go back to when the bill was in the House of Representatives. Mr Smith moved nearly the same set of amendments that had been moved in the Senate, where all bar one had been rejected, and they were defeated in the House. At the conclusion of Mr Smith's comments, as can be read in Hansard, Mr Smith said, `This issue is not concluded. We are not finished, and when the matter returns to the Senate, Senator Bishop, my representative in that place, will move a similar set of amendments or motions.' That was said in the House at the conclusion of the debate. No-one could have been under any illusion that the opposition was not going to pursue the matter when it came back into this chamber.
Secondly, in respect of the specific allegations made against me, Senator Alston's adviser did ring me earlier this afternoon to advise me that the bill was likely to come on after 5 p.m. and asked me how long I thought the matter would go. I responded to her, `Probably no longer than 30 minutes.' We did not have any other discussion at that time, or any other time, on amendments or motions or the progress of the bill. The only discussion I had with Senator Alston's communications person when she rang me was that I indicated that the likely passage was going to be in the order of 30 minutes.
In terms of what we are discussing now, all the opposition is doing is opposing the motion moved by Senator Patterson. I put on the record my reason for us opposing their motion that came back from the House—identical reasons as foreshadowed by Mr Smith in that place in his contribution. I foreshadowed a further amendment, which I read out, that I would speak to when the adoption of the bill was moved. In respect of that, I can only offer the advice that an email was sent from the office of Mr Smith, under the authority of his adviser, Mr Banks, to the opposition adviser on legislative measures, Ms Rosemary Laing, at 7.07 this morning, Wednesday, 28 March. It said:
Rosemary, first can you please distribute the committee stage amendments distributed in Senator Bishop's name at the time he rises to speak?
—Oh!
—If you don't mind! So notice was given some seven or eight hours ago. We expected that to be concluded. If a mistake has occurred, that is the fault neither of the opposition nor of anyone else; it is simply a mistake. But notice was given. The email goes on to say:
Secondly, can you please draft an amendment to the motion that the report of the committee be adopted along the following lines?
As I read out, it was distributed as I spoke. So there has been no deliberate ambush at all. There was contact. 
In summary, Mr Smith foreshadowed our position when the debate concluded in the House. Secondly, there was contact between Senator Alston's adviser and me. The only matter discussed with her was the likely time limit of the debate—nothing else. Thirdly, we had foreshadowed near and far that we were going to oppose the motion when it came here and foreshadowed further motions. There has been no ambush.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-03-28,"— I was not meant to be involved in this debate. I came down to assist, as a parliamentary secretary, on the understanding that there would not be controversy in this bill. I came down to take it through for Senator Alston. I am appalled, frankly, at what has happened. Senator Bishop has got up here and dug a deep hole for himself, implicating one of the staff of the Senate—which I find appalling—who has done exactly what she was asked to do: circulate the amendments at the time that Senator Bishop spoke. That is entirely inappropriate. The amendments that we have before us are not the ones that were foreshadowed in Mr Smith's speech in the House of Representatives; Senator Bourne has the speech there, and I suppose that she will speak on it. But the thing is that I came into this chamber on the understanding—
—They have been withdrawn on the advice of the Clerk.
—You have had your say, Senator Bishop.
—Order! Address the chair, everybody, and cease interjecting.
—I came down here, in good faith, on the understanding that this bill would be debated with no problems. Senator Bourne came into the chamber without the bill because she came in on the same understanding. We needed to check that the amendment being circulated was the one that had been circulated before—you cannot just assume that, especially with the Labor Party—and that is not the way business ought to be done here. The way business is done is that there is good faith. Amendments are shown to various members of the Senate—and I am sure there would be other people here who have an interest in this debate and who will not have seen the amendments—and we normally would give the clerks or the deputy clerks the amendments and ask for them to be circulated as soon as possible.
For you to get up here and say they were circulated far and wide because, in an email at 7.07 this morning, the deputy clerk was asked to circulate them when you were speaking, condemns you and supports Senator Alston's claim that it is a grubby little attempt to get a bit of a headline again today that you are trying to do something and the government again is opposing you. Senator Bishop, that might not necessarily be a reflection on you; it might be a reflection on your shadow minister. But I would ask you to ask him to lift his game to enable the work of this Senate to proceed in a more orderly manner—in the manner which we usually observe in this place: some courtesy in circulating amendments to people.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2001-03-28,"—And that is all that is before the chair: the government moving the motion as outlined, the opposition opposing it and speaking to it. There are no amendments. None have been circulated, none have been foreshadowed. A motion is foreshadowed later on. That is a different thing from an amendment.
—No, Senator Bishop. I am sitting here with a sheet.
—They have been withdrawn.
—You are not going to move those?",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2001-03-28,"—Is Senator Bishop saying that the amendments which were circulated—in accordance with the instructions to Rosemary Laing—at the time that he rose to speak have now been withdrawn?
—No, Minister. We cannot even contemplate them being moved unless the motion to agree with the amendment of the House of Representatives is defeated. They are replacements to that. If the motion moved by Senator Patterson is agreed to, then these do not get moved. So they are foreshadowed possible amendments. The question before the chair is that the Senate agree to the amendment made by the House of Representatives.
—I would like to try to tidy the matter up to some extent. From what Senator Bishop is saying—and I have not checked the Hansard record of the House of Representatives; I take what he says at face value—
—I've got it here.
—Perhaps Senator Bourne can tell me whether Mr Smith actually foreshadowed that these amendments would be moved in the Senate, at least in the form that now is being indicated—if this motion were lost, they would be moved. I can say that the advice from my chief of staff is that his discussions with Mr Smith's office were along the lines that the amendments would be moved in the House of Representatives and left there and there would be no attempt to similarly move them again in the Senate. If that is right, that is not what you were saying earlier. You said Mr Smith foreshadowed that they would be moved in the Senate.
—I took you to be saying the amendments. The reason we are complaining in the way that we are is that at no stage was it indicated to us that amendments would be on the table—right? Whether they are technically before the chair or whether they are merely foreshadowed in the event that the current motion is defeated, the fact is that the discussion you had with my broadcasting adviser again gave no indication that these amendments were in any shape or form going to come before the Senate. So, when we arrive here and find that they are, we are taken by surprise and we regard that as a further continuation of the little charade that is being played.
It is quite clear that what you are saying is that you did not expect this current motion to be defeated and therefore you are simply waving the proposed amendments around to somehow demonstrate what you would like to have done if you were able to do it—all of which, of course, is a game that Senator Bourne can see right through. I am simply saying to you that there was never any indication given to us until we arrived in the chamber that there was any intention on your part, in the event that this motion was defeated, to then move those further amendments. That is why Senator Patterson was deputed to come down here: all she thought she had to deal with was the current motion. She discovers that, if this motion is lost—and who knows? If you are foreshadowing some amendments, then you put Senator Bourne in a position where she might say, `Well, okay, I will defeat this motion because I want to consider your amendments,' in which case you have completely opened up a whole new debate, which is utterly contrary to the advice and indications provided to my office on two separate occasions.
—The question is that the Senate agrees to the amendment made by the House of Representatives.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Resolution reported.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2001</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,19,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-03-28,"—It is my honour to lead off debate on the range of appropriation bills before us in the chamber—Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2)—all of which contain a range of appropriations, not surprisingly, for a wholelot of important areas. I would like to address a couple of particular interest to the Democrats, not surprisingly focusing on environmental issues in particular, which is of course a longstanding and comprehensive concern of the Democrats from our party's inception over 23 years ago. I would imagine that there would barely be an appropriation speech made in this chamber by a Democrat that has not mentioned environmental issues.
It actually follows on a bit from a debate we were having in this chamber earlier today in relation to forestry issues and, to some extent, specifically Tasmanian forestry issues. That debate earlier today related to tax legislation, an area which can also link to appropriations. But it specifically talked about funding provided in particular circumstances under one of the regional forest agreements in force for preserving areas of forest under private ownership as part of a conservation covenant. As part of debating that issue, there were further things that were raised that I chose not to go into at the time, in the interests of time, but it is appropriate to expand a little further here this evening.
 There is a lot of concern in Tasmania at the moment in relation to forests, as there has been for quite a period of time, specifically relating to the establishment of eucalypt plantations. One issue concerns the clearing of native forests specifically for the purpose of then replanting plantations, and the other is the sale of agricultural land also for the establishment of plantations. The issue of conversion of agricultural land to plantation is the most politically sensitive at the moment because it is having a social impact, particularly in rural communities that have previously been built around agriculture and dairy farms. The issue of the environmental impact of converting native forest to plantation is probably more significant in an environmental sense, even if less immediately sensitive politically. It is an interesting dilemma, given that many in the conservation movement have advocated a shift away from native forest logging—quite sensibly—towards plantation timber. Certainly, putting plantations onto particularly degraded agricultural land or non-productive agricultural land is one way of meeting the demand for wood products whilst trying to minimise some of the environmental impacts that occur.
Forest companies have spent more than $70 million in the past three years on buying up Tasmanian farms, bushland and infrastructure, with 30,000 hectares of plantations being established. Forest Enterprises of Australia and Gunns are the two largest companies involved, with Forestry Tasmania also contributing up to $13 million. That does not include the plantation establishment program of North Forest Products on its large existing private landholdings.
There are several issues relating to the buy-up of agricultural land for plantation establishment: the potential loss of high quality agricultural land; the loss of population in small communities where properties are sold, making communities non-viable; the concerns of milk processors if too many dairy farms go under plantations; the loss of visual amenity with the change from agricultural pastoral vistas to forest vistas; and also concerns about pesticide pollution of water supplies—all of which have potential environmental, social and economic implications. In the north-west in particular, there are communities where most of the farms have been bought up, leaving the few remaining farms isolated, and that has led to the disappearance of a few traditional communities.
There are quite genuine concerns in relation to the impact of herbicides such as atrazine and insecticides used in the establishment of plantations getting into streams and water supplies. There was a report in December last year in the Hobart Mercury regarding concerns of local groups about the impact on water supplies of a Forestry Tasmania plantation establishment in Diddledum Plains in the north-east. That concern is not just in terms of the impact it has on drinking water but also on organic farmers in the vicinity. If their water becomes contaminated, then their organic certificates are also put at risk. That is obviously of great concern to those individual farmers. It is also a concern in terms of the harm it may do to what is potentially an extremely high value added, beneficial industry not just for Tasmania but for many other parts of the country as well. There is also concern about genetically modified crops and fears of contamination by GM crops of areas that are trying to ensure they are seen as organic. The `clean green' term and label is used a lot, but for it to have meaning and value it needs to be very preciously and jealously guarded. Contamination, whether from GM crops or from pesticides or other activities, needs to be prevented at all costs. It is a matter not just of environmental consequences or human health consequences but of straightforward dollar value—and a high dollar value from the value added aspect of organic crops is becoming more and more apparent.
The impact of the spread of plantations on former agricultural land, particularly such large numbers in a small space of time, is clearly a significant issue in parts of Tasmania and presents some special challenges. It shows again that what seem to be straightforward solutions—getting out of native forests and into plantations—are not always as straightforward as it would seem. Nonetheless, the impact on biodiversity of continuing widespread logging in native forests should not be underestimated or dismissed and the Democrats, as we have for many, many years, will continue to oppose ongoing logging in native forests and encourage constructive, environmentally appropriate and socially beneficial alternatives. 
I noted towards the end of last year reports that one of the remaining Tasmanian Green MPs, Peg Putt, was putting forward as an alternative selective logging of specialty timbers in special zones that had already been disturbed by logging. It sounded like proposals put forward by former Tasmanian Democrat senator Robert Bell which, whilst not necessarily 100 per cent ideal, were the best option in the circumstances, given some of the other alternatives that were being put forward. The alternative of a major woodchip and veneer project proposed for the Huon Valley has caused a lot of concern, and many people are looking for alternatives to that. Selective logging is one approach, and is certainly different from the present practices of clear-felling and burning which should continue to be opposed. Selective logging for specialty, high value added timber has been put forward by the Tasmanian Green state MP, as it had been previously by Tasmanian Democrats, as one way forward in relation to that issue.
I would also like to mention concerns in relation to major breaches of the forest practices code by Forestry Tasmania on the slopes of Mount Arthur in north-eastern Tasmania. This issue has been raised by Senator Lees in this chamber recently. She called for all forestry operations in a particular logging coupe on the slopes of Mount Arthur to be halted immediately because of concerns in relation to breaches of the forest practices code. Those sorts of breaches cause lots of concerns for the general community. Even those who are more supportive of continued logging than parties such as the Democrats recognise that logging has to be done to strict standards, that there has to be clear, scientifically backed evidence to ensure that minimal environmental damage is done, and that when codes are breached action should be taken. For many people, even those who are more comfortable with logging than many environmentalists are, it is as much part of the problem that the immediate short-term economic pressures tend to come first and scientific evidence of environmental impact, scientific evidence of long-term consequences and detrimental impacts on sustainability all tend to get ignored. Indeed, even immediate environmental impacts tend to get ignored. The breaches of codes tend to get ignored because of short-term interests.
The specific breaches that have been raised as potentially occurring in this case include: an inadequate hydrological survey, with streams in the coupe remaining unidentified and therefore being significantly damaged by the logging operations; insufficient buffer zones in the side stream reserves where waterways have been identified; inadequate construction of the Mount Arthur Road, leading to an increased likelihood of siltation problems in waterways; extensive logging being undertaken without sufficient data and study, despite the fact that species such as the threatened crayfish are present in the coupe; contamination of the water table with chemicals and fertilisers; the fact that there are no machinery exclusion zones in the variation area in the logging coupe; and general concerns that, given the steep slopes and the difficult nature of the terrain, the whole area should never have been initially approved for logging by Forestry Tasmania. In addition—as I have already touched on in my contribution—plantations reduce the amount of water released in the catchment. What impact will this have on the water supply for people downstream? These are very serious concerns about potentially very serious impacts.
This is relevant because there are significant amounts of taxpayers' money going into subsidising these operations and enabling them to continue. Yet here we have an instance of circumstances where it turns out that taxpayers' money is being provided to enable environmental destruction to occur. Indeed, there is a risk not just of environmental destruction but of the degradation of the water supply for many thousands of people downstream, and there is a potential impact on the viability of other surrounding communities and farms as a consequence.
They are very serious issues that show the continued inappropriate nature of much of the forestry industry in Tasmania. It is of concern to the Democrats how regional forest agreements in many other parts of the country are managed and what other impacts there may well be, particularly issues such as water consequences. That is certainly a concern for the Democrats in some of the Victorian forestry operations, for example.
It highlights again why it is a particular disgrace that the federal government has not signed off on and provided support and recognition for the Queensland forest agreement, probably one of the few environmentally positive achievements of the Queensland Labor government. This is a forestry agreement that was recognised as positive by loggers and conservationists alike; in fact, it was recognised as positive by virtually everybody except the federal government. This is a real disgrace. The government is giving continued taxpayer funded support for poor regional forest agreements but no assistance for the one that is recognised as probably the best agreement yet in Australia.
The other concern the Democrats have in relation to the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement is that there is nothing there that prevents native forests being cleared specifically to put hardwood plantations back on top of that land. The conversion of native forest to plantation has been an issue for many years and North Forest Products has converted significant areas of rainforest and mixed forest on its private land in the north-west—thousands of hectares of eucalyptus plantations south of Burnie and 126,000 hectares of freehold land in 1999. They are establishing over 5,500 hectares of eucalyptus species annually. They are not the only company to clear native forest to establish plantations, which is a ridiculous practice. It has a significant environmental impact that is not prevented by the very poor forest agreement that was agreed to by the Labor Party in Tasmania and the federal coalition government.
Briefly, I would also like to mention a couple of other issues. Firstly, I note the achievements of not just Russell Crowe, who got significant media attention—he seemed happy to declare himself an Australian rather than a New Zealander on that occasion, so we may as well do the same—but also those other Australians involved in the film and arts area more generally, whose contributions, some of which were recognised with nominations, have contributed to the success of the film and arts industry over the last 12 months.
The single triumphs of people like Russell Crowe can disguise the immense contribution that other people make in the artistic and film areas in general, and indeed the contribution they have made to the success of people such as Russell Crowe, who acted in a number of Australian movies over many years prior to his recent crowning achievement. All of that would not have been possible without the contribution of people to the movie and arts industries not just in Australia but globally—and without a proper recognition of the value of that. The Democrats certainly acknowledge the valuable role of the cinematic, film and arts communities more generally in Australia's economy—as well as in our society—and the development and ongoing enhancement of the community by the cultural contributions of those people. I would also like to encourage, as part of that, a greater recognition through government assistance and support, recognising the valuable cultural and economic contribution that such people make.
Having mentioned the Oscars—which got all the attention the other night—I should also mention the slightly less renowned so-called science versions of the Oscars and the reports that a number of Australian scientists were recognised with citations for excellence in scientific research.
It is important to note the contributions that scientists make not just to the Australian economy but to the world economy and world research and knowledge in a whole range of areas. This is an issue that my colleague Senator Stott Despoja has spoken about many times on behalf of the Democrats as needing greater recognition and greater support economically from government assistance, tax incentives and structurally as part as our business, industry and education operations in Australia. We can and must do much more. These results in the so-called science Oscars show that the talent, the will and the ability are there, but it is quite clear from many in the scientific community that more needs to be done to foster that contribution to knowledge, to human advancement, to human health, to our economy and—to bring it back to where I started from—particularly to environmental issues.
The role of science in identifying, addressing and preventing environmental problems is incalculable, and we really need greater support from government of organisations such as the CSIRO because of the contribution they make to a more informed environmental debate, better solutions and better ways forward for minimising the environmental impacts of human and other activity on the planet. A lot more still needs to be done, and the Democrats very much encourage this. Whilst we congratulate those involved in scientific endeavour, particularly those who have had their work recognised, we urge much greater action from government and from other parts of the community to increase support for scientific endeavour, particularly as it relates to environmental issues, to ensure that we can better address some of these crucial matters in the current situation and for future generations.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2001-03-28,"—by leave—On 26 February this year, the Senate passed a return to order motion seeking the tabling, by no later than 4 p.m. on 27 March 2001, of documents relating to:
·	The listing of the drugs celecoxib (Celebrex) and rofecoxib (Vioxx) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; and
·	The appointment of the new Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.
Yesterday in the chamber a letter was tabled from the Minister for Health and Aged Care advising that, because of the need to consult with the third parties who originated a large number of these documents, a final response to the motion was not available at that time.
I have now been advised that the processes of consultation in respect of the pharmaceuticals were completed today, and I am pleased to table the documents requested by the motion in relation to Celebrex and Vioxx. The remaining documents relating to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will be tabled tomorrow, as the material is still being collated. Honourable senators should note that the only documents that are not being released in part or in full are: those that are cabinet-in-confidence; those that are genuinely commercially sensitive; personal information such as the private addresses and contact details of individuals; and information forming part of the deliberative processes of the government, the release of which would be contrary to the public interest. If I could make a comment about this material, which comprises two volumes and scores of documents, I would say that it shows, above all, one important thing: the rigour and the independence with which the PBAC conducted the processes around the listing of Vioxx and Celebrex on the PBS.",SENATE,<title>PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS ADVISORY COMMITTEE</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-03-28,"—I rise this evening to speak on these three bills, the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2000-2001 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2000-2001. I want to particularly refer to the $223 million that has been set aside in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2000-2001 for the Health and Aged Care portfolio.
According to recently made portfolio estimates statements, only $31 million of this amount is actually being set aside for aged care. This shows that the government is once again ignoring the needs of elderly Australians. Although I welcome many of the funding measures in this bill, I feel that the government should be paying more attention to Australia's ageing population. The amount the bill sets aside for the Health and Aged Care portfolio is roughly equal to the amount set aside to provide extra funding to the Australian Taxation Office. According to Senator Ian Campbell's second reading speech, $183 million of the extra $202 million set aside in the bill to go to the Australian Taxation Office is `to cover the increased cost of administering the GST'.
After all the millions of dollars the government has already spent on the goods and services tax administration and advertising, we are now being told that they will require an extra $183 million. I wonder if any of this extra $183 million is going towards implementing the BAS backflips recently announced by the government. Is this $183 million of taxpayers' money going to be spent on fixing a mistake that should not have happened in the first place?
We have all heard repeatedly in this chamber how the coalition turned its back on one of its key groups of traditional supporters: the small business sector. We have all heard horror stories—here and in the media—of how this government left honest, hard-working small business operators and owners out in the cold. We all know how they brought in this tax and then expected small business owners and operators around the country to collect it for them—these people who came out at every election and loyally voted for the conservatives every time. And how were they repaid by their party? Their leader, their Prime Minister, John Howard, repaid them by making them unpaid tax collectors. They were made to spend their summer holidays, their evenings and their weekends doing endless pages of bookwork as part of the government's business activity statement. And then finally, after months of businesses going bust and belly up, lives being destroyed and families suffering lost time together, the government decide to backflip and make the BAS simpler—after they repeatedly told us that it could not be done. 
What convinced them to listen to what Labor and small business had been saying and to help them ease the burden? Was it the government listening to the calls from small business to lighten the load? Or was it them hearing the sound of the economy starting to groan under the pressure of all these businesses going bust? No, it was the tremendous defeats the coalition suffered in Western Australia and Queensland and as a result of the government seeing the writing on the wall as to what was going to happen to them after what happened in Ryan. Perhaps if the government had listened to our concerns about the effects of the GST compliance on small business early on, and not waited to suffer the humiliation and defeat at the ballot box that they have suffered at every contest lately, then they would not need to spend all this extra money on goods and services tax administration.
The government seem willing to throw around this sort of money to fix their GST mistakes. But, as I mentioned earlier, when it comes to fixing the damage they have inflicted on older Australians all they can come up with is a measley $31 million. And they have inflicted a tremendous amount of damage on this group of people, particularly with regard to the way they have treated old age pensioners and the way they have handled their aged care responsibilities.
Just look at the way the government have clawed back two per cent of the four per cent GST compensation they gave to pensioners last July. After breaking their promise last year of a $1,000 savings bonus to compensate for the introduction of the GST, last week the government broke another promise on the four per cent pension increase. When pensions were automatically indexed on 20 March last week, the government took back two per cent of the four per cent compensation that was paid last July. The four per cent indexation increase that should have flowed on from inflation over the last six months had an amount of two per cent subtracted before it was paid.
Perhaps the government were hoping that, by clawing back part of the GST compensation at the time of the scheduled increase, old age pensioners would not notice. For a single pensioner the government now will claw back $7.90 per fortnight and for a couple on a combined pension they will claw back $13.20 a fortnight. You could imagine some of the government ministers spilling more at the bar than what they have just deprived old age pensioners of in this country.
In the federal electorate of Lindsay, which is held by the Minister for Sport and Tourism, Jackie Kelly, there are about 7,000 old age pensioners who have just had their pensions clawed back by this mean government. Last week, these 7,000 pensioners would have received a letter from the government explaining they were going to claw back two per cent of the pensioners' indexed increases due that week. Considering this deceitful act impacted on so many people in her electorate, I was surprised to see that the member for Lindsay, Miss Jackie Kelly, had very little to say about the clawback. 
I was surprised to find that a local member such as the member for Lindsay, who is known to boast a great deal in the local media about how well she represents her electorate here in Canberra, was nowhere to be seen—the scarlet pimpernel of Lindsay. I would have thought that the member for Lindsay would either be trying to defend the government on this issue and advancing to the people of Lindsay why the government acted in the mean spirited way it did or be making sure that those 7,000 pensioners in her electorate, being robbed, had their voices heard in the public arena. But no, she disappeared again.
Instead, it was left to the Labor Mayor of Penrith, David Bradbury, to raise this issue on the same day he was officially endorsed as Labor's candidate for the seat of Lindsay at the next federal election. I was delighted to see that Mr Bradbury's first statement as Labor's candidate for Lindsay was to speak out against the government on its ill treatment of elderly Australians. I would like to quote what Mayor Bradbury said last week outside the Kingswood Senior Citizens Centre, where he held a press conference in recognition of it being Seniors Week. He said:
This is a further reminder of the mean-spiritedness of this government, to inflict the injustice of clawback during Senior's Week, which should be a week celebrating the contribution made by seniors in our community. What this Government has done is send a clear message that it doesn't care. 
How diplomatic was the government in doing it in Seniors Week? What genius in the government dreamed that up? If anything could have been done to make sure there was maximum electoral impact on the mean-spiritedness of this government, to do it in that week certainly takes the cake. 
The government has sent a clear message to the people in the seat of Robertson that it doesn't care. Around 15,000 old age pensioners living in the electorate of Robertson had two per cent of their pension increase clawed back by the government last week. Once again we found that the Liberal member for Robertson, Mr Jim Lloyd, another local member who boasts of his supposed commitment to his electorate, was missing in action. He was not prepared to justify to those 15,000 old age pensioners in the electorate of Robertson the mean-spiritedness and tight-fistedness of this government. He was missing in action and has been missing in action a great deal of late. 
I noticed that when these bills were read for the second time in the House of Representatives a few weeks ago around 70 different members from both sides of the House rose to speak, many of them outlining areas of expenditure in which they would like to see the government spending more money. I find it surprising that the member for Robertson, silent Jim Lloyd, who is so vocal in the central coast area about pressuring his government to spend money on things that are important to his constituents, did not say a word in that debate. Once again, he was missing in action. 
One of the issues that the member for Robertson has been very vocal about locally has been the need to widen the F3 freeway. He even organised a petition on this last year. When these bills came before the House, the member for Robertson was presented with an opportunity to stand up in parliament and argue his electorate's case. He had a chance to get up and argue to the government that they should be spending taxpayers' money on widening the F3 freeway instead of whittling it away in the administration of the GST, but he remained silent. He again failed to speak up and represent his electorate. As I said, he is known locally as the silent member for Robertson and, after the next election, he will be the former member for Robertson. 
I turn to another seat on the north coast of New South Wales represented by another member who has remained silent in this debate—the Hon. Mark Vaile, the member for Lyne. In Lyne, there are 18,000 old age pensioners. All of these 18,000 pensioners would have received their letter last week telling them that the government, of which their local member is a senior cabinet minister, was about to claw back two per cent of their pension. The federal electorate of Lyne on the New South Wales mid-north coast is home to more old age pensioners than any other electorate in Australia. Many of these people have worked hard all their lives and have chosen to spend their retirement away from the city in what is one of the most beautiful and pristine areas in Australia. But, like many retirees around the country, they are finding that this government is not making it easy for them to enjoy the restful retirement they deserve after a lifetime of working and struggling. Not only are they having their pensions clawed back, but many of them are living in fear of what will happen to them or their spouses when they get to the stage in their lives when they require full-time care and assistance. At the moment the shortage of nursing home beds in the Lyne electorate—an electorate held by a senior cabinet minister—is such a problem that elderly bedridden patients who require full-time care in a nursing home are instead being kept in Manning Base Hospital in Taree.

That the Senate take note of the document.
This is a report by Mr Chris Sidoti when he was still Human Rights Commissioner.
—Ooh!
—I note that people are oohing him over there. I think that he was an outstanding human rights commissioner and he should be remembered well by this chamber. For him to be booed is not appropriate, I would have thought. 
—I didn't boo him; I oohed him.
—Mr Sidoti reported on a case of discrimination on the grounds of age. That was against the Japan Travel Bureau, Australia. The complaint was made by Ms Akiko Ishikuni. It was determined by Mr Sidoti that there was discrimination on the grounds of age. She was 64 at the time of the relevant facts. There is a tendency still in this society to see 64 as being old. That is not right. I take it that both you, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, and I will take up another career when we leave this place, because that is the appropriate thing to do these days. 
Mr Sidoti said that, yes, there was a discrimination by Japan Travel Bureau against Ms Ishikuni and it was on the grounds of her age, and therefore it would be appropriate for the respondent, the Japan Travel Bureau Australia, to pay her a sum of money in recompense. To be fair to Japan Travel Bureau, they did that. I think it is appropriate for me to read out what Mr Sidoti said about that. He said:
JTB—
that is the Japan Travel Bureau—
is to be congratulated on this. It is a model for other respondents, including the Commonwealth, that are often far less willing to accept the Commission's recommendations. I regret only that the complainant and the respondent were unable to settle this matter through conciliation.
I hope that when Senator Ludwig speaks on the next government document to be debated he will tell you how appropriate that comment is that the Commonwealth is often far less willing to accept the commission's recommendation than the Japan Travel Bureau was on this occasion.
What Mr Sidoti said on this occasion—and he had said it on other occasions when the issue of age was involved—was that if people are unable to do a job because of health or other reasons that are pertinent to their ability to work, then it is fair enough that they should not be able to continue to work; but to be dismissed simply on the grounds of age is wrong. I think it is absolutely essential that the community understand that and that they understand that people these days not only live longer—for a variety of reasons to do with health style and the excellent work of doctors—but also continue to have the ability to work. I suggest, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, that people such as you and me have a great deal of wisdom. I know Senator Ludwig, for example, may have some legal brilliance and some great capacity to argue the law, but he lacks the full wisdom of people such as you and me. That is a factor to take into account in this debate.
—What about Senator Forshaw?
—Senator Forshaw is in the central position: he hasn't fully got the wisdom yet, though he is getting close, but he has the great brilliance. The point I want to make is that age on its own should not be a bar to people working, that people should be able to start careers and exhibit their wisdom and ability in spite of their age. If, for other reasons, they are not able to work, then it is all right but not because of age only.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2001-03-28,"—I rise tonight to speak about a coal dispute between BHP and the CFMEU that has disturbing implications for Australia's trade and its balance of payments. The Australian public should be concerned by the continuing industrial action by the CFMEU at coalmines operated by BHP in Queensland and the adverse impact this is having on the economy and on Australia's reputation as a reliable supplier of coal. I am disappointed to have to advise the Senate that the company's five Queensland mines and its port at Hay Point continue to be disrupted by industrial action. The week-long stoppage at all mines and in the port from 28 February to 6 March was followed by a 24-hour stoppage at the port on 9 March. There was then a 24-hour stoppage at all mines and at the port on 19 March, with several mines continuing with industrial action through to 21 March. Indeed, industrial action is continuing as I speak.
I am also disturbed that the company expects to have seven vessels awaiting loading by the end of the week commencing 26 April and, if the disruption continues, 22 vessels by the end of April. With demurrage fees running at $35 million, an armada of vessels are waiting to be loaded for the international market and are being disrupted by industrial action. I am also concerned by the prospect that industrial action could be broadened to include other categories of work in the company, such as engineers on the company's tugs. The company has previously estimated that a five-day stoppage alone at its coalmines in February had cost some $30 million in lost production.
These developments reflect very poorly on Australia's international trading reputation as a supplier of coal. Coal is one of our most vital exports. Strikes compromise jobs and job security. No doubt there are companies to which BHP supplies coal which are facing unstable supplies and stock shortages. It is in the public interest that this industrial action cease and that it cease at the earliest possible opportunity.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Coal Dispute: Effect on Trade</title>,Adjournment,24,1
