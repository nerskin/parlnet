Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (09:31):  I rise this morning to speak on behalf of the opposition on both of these bills before the Senate—one, the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012, a government bill and one, the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2012, a private senator's bill introduced by the President of the Senate. The two bills are in response to the report Ahead of the game: blueprint for reform of Australian government administration, which was released in March 2010. There was a committee of inquiry underway into this particular report by the Senate's Finance and Public Administration Committee, which was, sadly, put off by the election and the committee did not have a chance to renew that inquiry. I would also note that it was announced that many of the recommendations from that inquiry were in fact not going to be implemented by the new government after the 2010 election.


First I would like to mention some important context to this bill. Today there are around 160,000 people employed by the Australian Public Service spread throughout government departments based all around the country but naturally focused here in Canberra. They have different backgrounds, experiences and come from all kinds and walks of life—indeed, I have some in my own family. Whether it is issuing a passport, solving a Centrelink inquiry or costing tax policies, they all play a crucial role in developing and administering public policy of this country. Everyday decisions they make and the work that they do impact Australians in every walk of life, so it is important for the wellbeing of our country that these tasks are carried out professionally and with integrity.


I would first like to deal with the government's Public Service Amendment Bill, which is being taken this morning with the other bill. This bill makes a number of amendments to the Public Service Act 1999, most of which are minor in nature, relating to the code of conduct of public servants and changing the values and employment principles for APS employees. So it is an important bill. It is an important bill because we need to make sure we have an impartial Public Service that operates with excellence and integrity. In the explanatory memorandum of this bill it states its purpose is to:


… strengthen the management and leadership of the Public Service and to help embed new practices and behaviours into its culture.


This is a good purpose and the opposition on the whole believes the amendment bill achieves this. 


But first let me correct a myth that has been put about by some on the other side of this change—both the Labor Party and their coalition colleagues the Greens. The coalition supports the Australian Public Service. It supports a strong Australian Public Service. We believe in an efficient and good Public Service, because that makes for good and efficient administration of this country. I would suggest that over the course of this nation, since the employment of the first public servant, who I believe was Robert Garran in 1901, our country has been relatively well served and particularly so when we look at comparable nations. So we support this amendment bill because we believe the Public Service is an integral part of good government in this country. 


We also note that the government has accepted a proposed amendment by the opposition in the other place and we believe that strengthens this bill as well. The concerns that we had, and which are reflected in the amendment the government accepted, were not with the Public Service itself but with the government's treatment of the Public Service. What concerned us most was that the initial draft of the bill gave the Prime Minister greater power to extend the employment of departmental secretaries, allowing the Prime Minister to give new positions to secretaries who have resigned or whose contracts have ended. This allowance essentially undid a lot of good work the bill achieved about process and merit within the Public Service and, in our view, violated the five consolidated principles that the bill outlines for the Public Service. 


The most notable example of this, of course, was the appointment of Dr Ken Henry under section 67 of the Constitution by the Prime Minister upon his departure as Secretary of the Treasury. The opposition had previously in estimates hearings in this place expressed concerns about this appointment, given that it had previously been rarely used and only, shall we say, for the most sensitive of appointments that a government can make with respect to security agencies. So this bill does limit the ability of the Prime Minister to make unilateral decisions with respect to the Public Service and appointments of secretaries, and we support that.


I would now like to turn to the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill. This is a bill that naturally reflects the same report undertaken by the government—Ahead of the game: blueprint for reform of Australian government administration, the blueprint that I mentioned earlier. This bill amends the Parliamentary Service Act and runs in parallel to, but naturally is distinct from, the Public Service. It is important that there be an independent Parliamentary Service. It is important that this parliament can draw upon what I think everyone in this chamber would agree is the extraordinary ethical contribution and the long hours that people who work in the Parliamentary Service do to facilitate us in doing our job. We support the separate Parliamentary Service, but running it along the same lines as the Public Service, with merit protection and other processes, is also very important because the Parliamentary Service and the Public Service do benefit from cross-fertilisation—people moving between the two occasionally—and we do need to have a system that gives employees confidence in their employment arrangements and their careers and that also gives the confidence that I think we hold in the Parliamentary Service. So the opposition supports the principles in this bill and the amendments to the bill that are moved. Where there are slight differences from the Public Service Amendment Bill, that of course reflects the different nature of the Parliamentary Service. I would also like to note that there have been some amendments to this bill circulated by the President of the Senate, and the opposition will be supporting those amendments as they bring the bill into line with the amendments made as appropriate to the Public Service Amendment Bill. So the opposition will be supporting both these bills and the amendments to the Parliamentary Service Bill moved by the President of the Senate.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2013-02-07,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (09:37):  I rise to support this very important bill, the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2012 [2013]. It seeks to amend the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to reflect, where relevant to the Parliamentary Service, the changes that are proposed to be made to the Public Service Act 1999 by the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012. Although many of the provisions of the Public Service Amendment Bill are reflected in this bill, there are a range of provisions in the bill which are not reflected in the Public Service Amendment Bill and vice versa. Therefore, whilst it is fair to say that the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill runs closely in conjunction with the Public Service Amendment Bill, it is a distinct bill that contains key differences.


This bill, along with the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012, responds to the recommendations of the March 2010 report Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration. The blueprint outlined a reform agenda to strengthen Australian Public Service performance so that it meets the needs of all citizens, provides strong leadership and strategic direction, contains a highly capable workforce and operates efficiently at a high standard. It was developed jointly by the Parliamentary Service departments in consultation with the Parliamentary Service Commissioner and introduced into the Senate in November last year. Following introduction, it was referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee for inquiry and report so that it could be compared with the provisions contained in the Public Service Amendment Bill. These amendments are an important part of modernising the Parliamentary Service. They are part of the continuous process of improvement that it must undergo to face the challenges of the future.


It is important to make a comparison of this bill and the Public Service Amendment Bill because, as alluded to earlier, the two contain some differences. Various items in the bill do not reflect provisions contained in the Public Service Amendment Bill, including amendments relating to acting arrangements that have already been made to the Public Service Act and miscellaneous amendments that achieve consistency with the relevant sections of the Public Service Act. In addition to this, the bill does not contain numerous changes being made in the Public Service Amendment Bill. This bill will not, for example, provide for an annual review of the performance of secretaries in the Parliamentary Service.


The main features of the bill make notable changes to the roles and responsibilities of secretaries in the Parliamentary Service, the functions of the Parliamentary Service Commissioner and the relevant code of conduct. The bill clarifies and revises the description of the roles and responsibilities of secretaries, as well as of the Senior Executive Service, to ensure that the Parliamentary Service has the organisational and workforce capacities to meet the needs of the future. The existing responsibilities of the secretaries, including managing their departments and providing information about the operation and administration of their departments, will remain. However, the secretaries would also be tasked with a host of new responsibilities such as providing stewardship in the departments and across the Parliamentary Service with other secretaries; engaging with stakeholders; and providing strategic direction and leadership. The amendments are designed to expand on the role of the secretaries so that departmental affairs are managed as efficiently, effectively, economically and ethically as possible and in keeping with the overall interests of the Parliamentary Service.


The functions of Senior Executive Service employees, or SES employees, will also be further defined and expanded. The amendments will fundamentally recast the chief functions of the SES group and focus on these employees providing superior strategic leadership. Individual SES employees will be expected to provide one or more of the following at a high level: professional or specialist expertise; policy advice; program or service delivery; and regulatory administration.


One of the most notable aspects of this bill is that it will also substantially redesign the functions of the Parliamentary Service Commissioner. The commissioner will be charged with new responsibilities, including inquiring into Parliamentary Service employees' reports of breaches of the Parliamentary Service Code of Conduct. The amendments will also provide that when the commissioner is examining these whistleblower reports, such as a conflict of interest or the contravention of an Australian law, the commissioner will have information-gathering powers equivalent to those of the Auditor-General. This is, of course, necessary to adequately probe whistleblower reports and uncover information which has the potential to expose widespread conduct breaches. The bill will also introduce new amendments to protect the information given to the commissioner under the new inquiry functions, as well as existing responsibilities such as inquiring into matters relating to the commissioner at the request of the Presiding Officers. Although the commissioner will be allowed to disclose this protected information in certain situations, such as in reports prepared for purposes connected with these inquiry functions, they will otherwise be prohibited from making a record, disclosing, or otherwise using this information. This is a vital amendment, as it adds an additional layer of protection to potentially sensitive information held by the commissioners to ensure that it remains confidential.


The amendments will also make the provision of information and documents to the commissioner inadmissible as evidence against a person in proceedings, other than for certain criminal offences. This will be the case where the person reasonably believed that the information or document was relevant for purposes connected with the performance or exercise of the commissioner's functions. This amendment is vital, as it protects those Parliamentary Service employees who have provided information to the commissioner that assists the commissioner in performing his or her duties. This bill makes key changes to the existing framework governing the Office of the Parliamentary Service Merit Protection Commissioner. The Merit Protection Commissioner will also be able to undertake whistleblowing inquiries into possible breaches of the code of conduct, where requested to do so by the relevant secretary and agreed to by the Parliamentary Service employee. The Merit Protection Commissioner will have information-gathering powers equivalent to the Auditor-General when undertaking such inquiries and will be charged with establishing written procedures for code of conduct breach inquiries. Like the Public Service Commissioner, the Merit Protection Commissioner will be subject to confidentiality of information requirements in connection with the information received during the performance or exercise of the commissioner's functions. The amendments will also make the provision of information and documents to the Merit Protection Commissioner inadmissible as evidence against a person in proceedings, other than for certain criminal offences.


The bill proposes significant changes to the provisions of the Parliamentary Service Act that deal with whistleblowing and whistleblower reports. Departmental secretaries will be required to establish procedures for handling whistleblower reports, including a clear pathway for the making of reports, so that all employees are encouraged to blow the whistle on possible breaches of the code of conduct. This will ensure that those employees who are considering blowing the whistle on possible breaches of the code of conduct will have greater guidance on how they can achieve this. 


The amendments will also seek to implement the blueprint recommendations to repeal the existing Parliamentary Service values and insert five new values together with seven new Parliamentary Service Employment Principles relating to employment decisions and workplace standards. This creates a smaller set of core values that are more meaningful, memorable and effective in driving change as well as reinforcing the positive cultural environment for a high-performing Parliamentary Service. Every Parliamentary Service employee can look at this new set of streamlined principles and remind themselves of the importance of being committed to service as well as remaining ethical, respectful, accountable and impartial.


The introduction of a set of Parliamentary Service Employment Principles in the bill replicates the Australian Public Service Employment Principles contained in the Public Service Amendment Bill. These new principles will state that the Parliamentary Service is a career based service that makes fair employment decisions with a fair system of review, requires effective performance from each employee and provides workplaces that are free from discrimination, patronage and favouritism. The principles will also recognise the diversity of the Australian community and foster diversity in the workplace, and provide flexible, safe and rewarding workplaces where communication, consultation, cooperation and input from employees on matters that affect their workplace are valued.


The new Parliamentary Service values and employment principles together define the character of the Parliamentary Service as an institution and guide the way in which it conducts its activities and serves the Australian community and the government. They provide robust guidance on the culture and operating ethos of the Parliamentary Service and underscore its professionalism. This ensures that the Parliamentary Service will continue to provide professional support of the highest calibre to all parliamentarians, independent of the executive government of the day.


This government strongly believes in modernising the Parliamentary Service, and these amendments are an important aspect of that. Improving the operations of the Parliamentary Service is an ongoing process that requires immense commitment to ensure that government is equipped to confront the challenges of the future. All parliamentarians depend on a professional, nonpartisan Parliamentary Service. After more than a decade since the Parliamentary Service was created, this bill will ensure that the service can continue to provide a high level of support and advice, which will ultimately benefit the wider Australian community. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2013-02-07,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (09:48):  The Public Service Amendment Bill 2012 seeks to simplify and refine the values that guide the Australian Public Service down to five key principles: the APS is to be committed to service, be ethical, respectful, accountable and, of course, impartial. To that effect, the bill contains numerous provisions of a technical and administrative nature which seek, among other things, to delineate the roles and responsibilities of departmental secretaries and provide for annual reviews of secretaries' performance and further define the functions and roles of the Senior Executive Service of the APS.


The bill is long and detailed, but I want to focus this morning on one particular provision, namely, the one that establishes the Secretaries Board as the lead forum of the Australian Public Service. The board will replace the Management Advisory Committee, which has played that lead role since 1999. In many ways, the bill merely codifies the status quo, as the Secretaries Board has already been in existence for the past two years. The board is to be the principal APS senior leadership group, composed of the secretaries of all the departments, the Commissioner of the Australian Public Service and such others as may be nominated by the secretary of the Prime Minister's department.


The bill enumerates the board's functions. It will have responsibility for the stewardship of the APS and for developing and implementing strategies to improve the APS. It will identify strategic priorities for the APS and consider issues that affect the Public Service. It will set an annual work program, direct subcommittees to develop strategies to address Public Service-wide issues and make recommendations back to the Secretaries Board. It will draw together advice from senior leaders in government, business and the community. All these roles and responsibilities, as all senators would agree, are very important. I hope that the board will provide the APS with the necessary leadership to tackle issues and problems that affect the Public Service as a whole—the entire Australian Public Service. 


One such issue, which I have raised many times over the years, is Public Service absenteeism. It is one that I have pursued for the past eight years through Senate estimates, in government and out of government, as well as in this chamber, most recently about three months ago. The facts are simple: the rates of unscheduled absence in the Public Service have been increasing steadily over the past 10 or so years. In 2001-02, the median unscheduled absence rate was 8.9 days per year per employee, of which sick leave accounted for seven days and other types of leave for the remaining 1.9 days. In 2010-11, the rate of unscheduled absence climbed to 11.1 days per year per employee, of which sick leave accounted for 8.4 days. This means that in nine years, unscheduled absences in the Australian Public Service increased by 25 per cent, or 2.2 days per year per employee. The median figure hides a great divergence across government departments and agencies, with the levels of workplace absence varying widely from 3.9 days per employee all the way up to 23½ days per year per employee. There is a huge disparity between unscheduled absences across Public Service agencies. And 23.5 days median absence is a lot—that is almost five working weeks and, combined with four weeks of annual leave, this means that some employees are not at work for almost nine weeks, or two months, a year.


This is not generally the experience of those working in the private sector. While reliable data is hard to come by—and I will come back to that in a minute—Direct Health Solutions in their 2011 absence management survey reported that while absence levels across Australia fell for the first time in three years, public sector employees took 22½ per cent more time off than those in the private sector. Why this great divergence between the Public Service and the private sector, and why have the rates of absenteeism in the Public Service increased by 25 per cent over the last decade? Why? I wish I had the answer—indeed, I wish anyone had the answer.


Over the years I have received various suggestions from the Australian Public Service Commission as to why. One year, the absences were blamed on a particularly bad flu season. Another year I was told that the Public Service has an older age profile than the private sector, the implication being that the older you are the sicker you get. The APS is certainly more middle-aged that the rest of the Australian workforce, but it actually has fewer older workers than the private sector. In any case, the Public Service Commission does not actually collect data on absences per various age groups so the proposition that the age profile accounts for increasing absenteeism is merely guesswork and a hypothesis not supported by any collected data. The bottom line is that the commission does not know what is really causing this problem.


This might explain why over the past eight years I have been disappointed by the efforts that the commission has been putting in to tackle this issue. After all, if you do not know what is causing the problem, it is unlikely that you will be able to find a solution. When earlier this year I questioned the commissioner, Mr Stephen Sedgwick, as to whether he has a responsibility to act to reduce absenteeism, he answered:


I do not actually manage a hundred agencies across the Australian Public Service; I manage my own.


…   …   …


But we are quite keen—and we have—to share good practice and that is what we tend to do. In these circumstances we encourage good practice and we promulgate good practice.


As far as I have been able to discover, all this encouragement and promulgation of good practice seems to have been contained to the publication in 2006—two years after I first raised the issue of absenteeism with the commission—of a document called Fostering an attendance culture: a guide for APS agencies. It was a good document but, as I recently discovered, it has not been updated or reissued since 2006.


Apart from that, I also discovered that absenteeism has not been placed even once on the agenda of the Management Advisory Committee or that of its successor, the Secretaries Board, for the past five years. I have been told, though, that absenteeism has been taken up at internal human resources management forums. That might be the case, but numbers speak for themselves—a 25 per cent increase in unscheduled absences by Australian public servants in the past 10 years. One might think that this issue deserves deep consideration by the APS's lead forums.


At the Senate estimates in October last year the committee finally received a commitment from the commissioner that the issue of Public Service absenteeism will now be put on the agenda of the Secretaries Board, where it belongs. As I look at the board's functions, as enumerated in the bill before the Senate, it is clear that tackling the problem of high and constantly-increasing absenteeism is a clear instance of where the board needs to be—and I quote from the bill—'developing and implementing strategies to improve the APS'. As the board identifies 'strategic priorities for the APS' and considers 'issues that affect the APS', I hope that reducing absenteeism will be one such issue. I hope that the board will finally provide the much-needed focus and leadership to address this problem.


The new APS principles state that the Public Service is to be committed to service and to being ethical, respectful, accountable and impartial. A Public Service that is committed to service and that is accountable to the parliament and to the taxpayers is one that needs to put the issue of absenteeism high on its agenda and, more importantly, to act to finally address the problem, because it does not seem to be going away. I will certainly continue to watch this issue with considerable interest.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (09:59):  I thank all senators for their contributions to the debate on the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012, and also on the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2012 [2013]. This bill makes landmark changes to the Public Service Act 1999. The bill will help to modernise the governance of the Australian Public Service, and in many ways will enable world's best practice in public service management. The bill will improve the quality of workforce management in the Australian Public Service, and this will translate into better service provision for the Australian public.


The amendments implement the recommendations of Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration. In particular there are: improved governance arrangements for APS leadership, including reforms that will strengthen the independence of secretaries and provide a clear statement of their role; a clearer, shorter statement of APS values, blending contemporary ethical approaches with enduring principles of public administration that go to the heart of the Westminster model; reforms that set out more clearly the role of the Australian Public Service Commissioner as a central authority for the development and stewardship of the Australian Public Service; and practical improvements to the Public Service Act that address a number of operational matters that have arisen since the last major changes in 1999. The reforms proposed in the report Ahead of the game and implemented through this bill will provide Australia with a modern employment framework for its public service. It will bring greater agility and responsiveness to the government, and this will pay dividends to the Australian community.


The bill strengthens governance arrangements for Australian Public Service leadership, including provisions concerning the appointment and termination of departmental secretaries. The bill will restore the 'gold standard' arrangement that supported the integrity and consistency of our public sector for generations. As was the case before 1999, the Governor-General will have the responsibility of appointing departmental secretaries, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister. Having the Governor-General make these appointments will underscore the impartiality of the Australian Public Service, and will promote public confidence in its leadership.


Following the introduction of the bill into the House of Representatives, the government has moved two largely technical amendments which, with the support of the opposition, were passed by the House. The amendments concern the engagement of non-ongoing employees, and the protection of information and immunity from suit provisions applying to the Public Service Commissioner, the Merit Protection Commissioner and other 'entrusted persons' in the course of the commissioners' review and inquiry functions. The government amendments have ensured that these provisions will operate effectively.


The government has also supported amendments moved by the opposition during debate in the House in the interests of achieving meaningful reform supported across the parliament. These amendments relate to arrangements for the engagement of former secretaries. In response to matters raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the government has tabled an addendum to the revised explanatory memorandum for the bill. The addendum provides additional information on handling suspected misconduct by Australian Public Service employees, including those who provide false or misleading information when applying for employment in the Public Service.


I understand Senator Milne has proposed amendments concerning protection for whistleblowers who make reports under the Public Service Act. I thank Senator Milne for her interest in this matter. Some of the amendments proposed deal with matters that are already included within the bill.  For example, proposed sections 72C and 72D of the amendment bill make clear that people who provide information related to a whistleblowing report to the Public Service Commissioner or the Merit Protection Commissioner are protected against civil and criminal penalties.


I also thank Senator Mason for raising the matter of unscheduled absences in the APS. This has clearly been an area of interest for Senator Mason for some time. As Senator Mason acknowledged, agencies have prime responsibility for managing workplace absences and it is a matter that they and the government take very seriously. But I can advise Senator Mason that the Secretaries Board has discussed this matter and that the Australian Public Service Commission is monitoring developments to inform further reports to the board.


The government takes seriously the protection of public officials who report in good faith serious misconduct or maladministration. Indeed, the government is developing a comprehensive public interest disclosure scheme which includes including strengthened protection for whistleblowers. The government does not, therefore, support the Greens amendments to this bill.


The debate this morning has concerned both the Public Service Amendment Bill and the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill. The decision in 1999 to have a distinct, separate Parliamentary Service, albeit with generally similar terms and conditions to the Public Service, has served the Australian community well for the last decade. The proposed amendments to the Parliamentary Service Act closely reflect the amendments to the Public Service Act. I am informed that the bill is intended to ensure that the Parliamentary Service will continue to be able to serve the federal legislature and through it the Australian people professionally and in a nonpartisan manner. On behalf of our President, I commend the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill to the Senate.


In summary, the Public Service Amendment Bill responds to the reform agenda of the Advisory Group on Reform of Australian Government Administration, whose recommendations were accepted by government. The Australian Public Service is fundamental to the success of our country and our society. The commitment and expertise of our Public Service directly affects the lives of all Australians. A healthy Public Service is a vital part of Australia's democratic system of government. Australians have high expectations. They quite rightly expect quality service, honesty and integrity, and value for their taxpayer dollar from the Public Service. The bill will support a Public Service that is agile and responsive to a rapidly changing world, meeting the legitimate needs of the Australian community and the government of the day both now and into the future.


I thank senators for their support for this bill and commend both bills to the Senate.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:08):  The amendments I will be moving relate to the protection of whistleblowers. I propose them in the context that the government has indicated that it is going to bring in comprehensive legislation on whistleblowers. The parliament has not seen it yet. On 22 November last year the coalition and the Greens moved in here to have that bill tabled by the end of the first sitting week and as yet we have not seen that legislation. I hope we are going to see it by the end of the sitting week, by the end of today. I make that comment in relation to these amendments because the amendments clearly do not go far enough in terms of protecting whistleblowers. The Greens have been campaigning for strong and comprehensive support for whistleblowers. We want to see that legislation that the government says it is bringing in. We do not want to hear the excuse for not supporting these amendments that there is going to be more comprehensive legislation later.


These amendments essentially go to the administration and coverage of the code of conduct. They are trying to make the current inadequate scheme better. We would like to see it cover the whole government sector and not simply be confined to those employed under the Public Service Act 1999. The first amendment says that, if an employee reports a breach of the code of conduct and they are then bullied in the workplace or their employment is terminated as a result of the disclosure, they would be entitled to compensation to be paid by the relevant employer. This is an important amendment because we are constantly told anecdotally of pressure being brought to bear on people who make disclosures and often hear of bullying in the workplace and then people losing their employment as a result of that disclosure. We would like to see compensation paid in an appropriate way. So I move:


(1) Schedule 1, item 52, page 28 (before line 15), before subsection 16(2), insert:


   (1A) If:


      (a) an APS employee reports a breach (or alleged breach) of the Code of Conduct; and


      (b) as a result of reporting the breach (or alleged breach), the APS employee is victimised, or discriminated against, by a person performing functions in or for an Agency;


   the APS employee is entitled to be paid reasonable compensation by the Commonwealth.


      Note: Payments under this subsection must be made from money appropriated by the Parliament. Generally, a payment can be debited against an Agency's annual appropriation, providing that it relates to some matter that has arisen in the course of its administration.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (10:11):  On behalf of the opposition, I say that whistleblower protection is important and it is not appropriate to malign those who oppose these amendments as not believing that it is important. I have said previously that the opposition will not be supporting this amendment moved by the Leader of the Australian Greens, Senator Milne.


I have a couple of comments. I do not know that payment of compensation is actually the best way to address a culture in a workplace. Senator Mason in his contribution earlier and on a number of occasions in Senate estimates talked about absenteeism and said some people have said it is a reflection of a cultural issue. I do not necessarily agree that it is a reflection of a cultural issue of bullying in the workplace. I do not think one could say that there is a culture of that problem in the APS. Whether or not there are specific instances, I do not think necessarily exposing the taxpayer to compensation for those purposes is the best way to go about it.


Not all so-called whistleblowing is legitimate, Senator Milne. Not all leaks of information are legitimate. There are some aspects of information that are rightly kept confidential in government processes. Some of those might be cabinet deliberations. It is not necessarily appropriate that we talk about all disclosure of information in the same way. I am not trying to say that you did, Senator Milne, but sometimes I think the two do get caught up in debates about whistleblowing. I have seen protections like this debated at length in the state parliament of Victoria. Again I think the two things could get conflated. So, Senator Milne, the opposition will not be supporting your amendment.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (10:13):  Introducing strengthened protections for whistleblowers in the Public Service is something the government takes very seriously. While the amendments are noteworthy in their intention, we believe they are insufficient for the intended purpose. Section 16 of the Public Service Act 1999 currently provides protections for APS whistleblowers. In addition, proposed sections 72C and 72D within the amendment bill will provide extensive protections against civil and criminal penalties to people who make whistleblowing reports to the Public Service Commissioner or the Merit Protection Commissioner.


The government is in principle in favour of improving these protections and extending protection to all Commonwealth public officials who report in good faith serious misconduct or maladministration. Indeed, the government is developing a comprehensive Commonwealth public interest disclosure scheme including strengthened protections for whistleblowers. The government has been taking a careful and considered approach to implementation of the whistleblower policy that it took to the 2007 election. This started with the government's referral of the matter to a parliamentary committee for public consultations, resulting in the 2009 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs chaired by Mr Dreyfus. The Commonwealth report noted that most whistleblowers are not looking for compensation and that instead focus should be put on prevention of detrimental action and restitution. As the government is developing a comprehensive Commonwealth public interest disclosures scheme, including strengthened protections for whistleblowers, the government considers the rest of the proposed amendments unnecessary and therefore does not support these amendments.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:15):  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers to tell us when we will see this government legislation to which she refers. As I indicated before, there was a successful motion in the Senate to introduce that legislation at the first sitting week. You talk about that legislation, in my view, as an excuse on this matter, so I think it is important that the parliament hears from you in relation to a date for when we are going to get that legislation in the parliament.


My second point is in relation to Senator Ryan's comment. The proposal for compensation to be paid by the relevant employer relates to reporting a breach of the code of conduct. It is not just any breach of any information or whatever; it relates particularly to that. I am particularly interested in the date for the legislation. I also make the point that protecting Public Service workplace rights ought to be a central component of the parliament, and yet we see continuing uncertainty in people's workplace rights with announcements of the coalition's plans to make redundant thousands of public servants, and the Labor Party's delaying of this legislation around protection of public servants' rights.

Having used the case of Mr Kessing throughout the 2007 election, I regard it as disgraceful that he has now been hung out to dry. Having said at the time that Mr Kessing was subject to wrongful intimidation, if you like, and that the Labor Party stood up for the fact that it was his leak that led to better security at Sydney airport, yet the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Clare, has refused to grant him a pardon in that context.


On the issue of the date, I ask the parliamentary secretary whether she will guarantee that that legislation will not only be introduced but dealt with before the election.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:18):  I move my next amendment, Greens amendment (2) on sheet 7299:



(2) Schedule 1, item 52, page 28 (line 16), omit 
""
establish
""
, substitute 
""
regularly publish
""
.



This amendment requires every agency head to regularly publish procedures to encourage disclosures in the workplace. That will mean that there is a constant reminder for and dialogue between management and staff about their rights and appropriate ways to come forward and make a disclosure. One of the big issues we hear from talking to people in the Public Service is that there are no up-to-date and clear procedures in place that give them a clear idea of the proper process in the agency if they have something that they want to raise in this context as a breach and they want to bring it forward. There are no procedures in most departments, and as a result when people come forward ultimately and make a disclosure they are attacked. The messenger is overwhelmingly attacked, when departments should have an obligation to have clear procedures in place; the agency head ought to develop such a culture.


As Senator Ryan rightly indicated a while ago, it is about culture in these agencies. They should be developing a culture of disclosure and support for people who use the procedures, so that they can be assessed appropriately and have the matter dealt with, rather than feel like they have no option in the end but to go public with the disclosure. It is really important that we get these procedures in place. That is what this amendment does: it asks every agency head to regularly publish procedures that encourage disclosures in the workplace.


My example is in relation to immigration. I am sure everybody in the community would have been horrified by a trained counsellor and a nurse with more than 40 years experience who was on Nauru quitting after having been there a few weeks. At the time that she resigned two mental health workers also resigned. She made very clear what was going on in Nauru. The response from DIAC was basically to come out and attack her credibility, saying that she was employed on contract for a short period and that she had a moral obligation to report a serious allegation to the relevant authority but had not done so, instead going on TV and so on and so forth.


What are DIAC's procedures and are they in place? Does the department inform people when they take on a contract or are employed of the proper process to go through? Are they encouraged to make disclosures, or is it a situation where ultimately their only option is to resign and go public, rather than try and have the matter taken seriously within the organisation or the agency?


I think, apart from anything else, in that case I would be interested to know whether DIAC has procedures in place, and when the last time was that employees were informed what those procedures are and encouraged to use them. On the broader point, I seek the Senate's support for the notion of regularly publishing procedures from an agency head to people working in the agencies so that they have a clear view of what the proper process is, and that it will be dealt with in an appropriate way.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (10:22):  I can advise Senator Milne that agencies must have the procedures in place. It is a requirement of agencies to have a set of procedures to inform their employees about their whistleblower protection, and they are essentially available all the time. They are generally always available on the agency's intranet to employees. I will not engage in a discussion on the specific case that you mentioned. I do not have a briefing to that affect.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:23):  I thank the parliamentary secretary. I appreciate she may not have a brief on that but I ask if she could follow that up to see whether there is a procedure in place and whether the employee concerned actually had that explained to her or anything in relation to it. The issue here is not whether it is a procedure but whether that procedure is published and discussed and updated, and whether the agency has a dialogue with its employees. There is a tonne of stuff on websites, but do you go out there and encourage a culture of openness and disclosure?

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:24):  I move Greens amendment (3) on sheet 7299:


Schedule 1, item 52, page 28 (line 17), after ""employee"", insert "", or a former APS employee,"".


The next amendment that I have is that the coverage of protection for whistleblowers should extend to former employees of the Australian Public Service as well as to current employees. They should all be able to make disclosures under the act. That is the purpose of this amendment. Whatever the parliamentary secretary might say about existing procedures, they are not strong enough and they are not supported. There is clearly a culture that it is not a good idea to blow the whistle in your organisation because that will kill your promotion prospects or, indeed, your job. So I do not accept that these procedures are regularly discussed between the agency heads or that there is a culture of encouraging disclosure.


A number of employees will have left the Public Service, and there are a number of questions that have never been answered. I can name a few of those. For example, there were a number of serious allegations around the management of in the Green loans portfolio area within the Public Service. The community was never brought up to date in the end as to what happened in the resolution of those allegations.


In the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, particularly in relation to the forestry grants to Tasmania, there was a situation where grant money left the department without ever being signed off by anyone. How is it possible that could have occurred? It was identified by the Auditor-General as being a breach of the Financial Management Act. When I asked the secretary of the department why the department had not prosecuted accordingly, the response was: 'We have lost the paperwork, Senator.' So I think there has to be something better than that. There has to be an active culture of disclosure so that poor processes in departments and failure to deal with things properly can be brought to the attention of the secretary, and so these matters can be dealt with.


Then, of course, there is the infamous children overboard. I have no doubt that there are many people in many government departments who actually know what happened with that appalling idea put out there that people were throwing their children overboard, and the cover-ups that were consequent on that. For many years I have wanted to know why it is that people have not come forward to say what happened after leaving the Navy or the Public Service, because the community really has a right to know.


There are many other examples. Another is in relation to MSAC, the Medical Services Advisory Committee. And what went on about PET scans, in particular? There are public servants who know what went on and who may now have left the Public Service. I think it entirely appropriate that we get to the bottom of a number of issues which have been covered up over the years. Giving whistleblower protection to former employees to enable them to make disclosures through appropriate processes with supporting evidence would be an incredible contribution to an improved democracy and more transparency.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (10:29):  I do stand corrected. I appreciate the sensitivity. It was before my time. I am getting my numbers mixed up. But if we go to the children overboard incident that Senator Milne referred to, it as if, because nothing is found, that is proof of a conspiracy. This is part of the problem I have with the philosophy underlying some of the things that Senator Milne has said. Because we do not find something, that does not mean that there is a conspiracy suppressing it. It may mean that there is actually nothing to find. One of the concerns I have is with the constant referral to how, if the Greens have not found the alleged conspiracy or repression of information, somehow we can keep talking about it as if it is a conspiracy. I do not think that in this country, given the openness of the media, we typically have a great deal of problems getting access to information. The media regularly uncovers scandals in this country at state and federal levels. Sometimes it might take a bit of time. But the truth is that there have been several occasions where the Greens have sided with the government to have information not released that the opposition has sought, or not to have people the opposition has sought come before estimates hearings. So I am not going to be preached to about the importance of transparency.


I will also say something about former public servants. I do not necessarily know if it is a good idea that we drag them into this net. I have not thought about this issue in depth—this is not my particular portfolio—and I note that legislation is still under consideration by the government, but I also do not want to give an opportunity for people who are former public servants potentially to be harassed or pursued by those who are constantly seeking information or may be alleging a conspiracy, saying: 'You know something. I want to know what happened with this 10, 12 or five years ago.' I do not know if we necessarily want to have an environment where someone who leaves the Public Service cannot simply leave the Public Service as they wish and not talk about what they did while they were there. I do not put it past certain people to be pursuing those who might leave and constantly asking them for information they think they might have. So the opposition will be opposing this amendment.


I also want to say about the broader amendments, because I appreciate that there is a lot of legislation to deal with today, that I understand the government is formulating a longer-considered bill. I understand there have been commitments about that. The opposition has taken those commitments. For that reason I think these issues should be dealt with in a specific fashion, in specific legislation and also in a more comprehensive fashion rather than piecemeal, trying to open up what you, Senator Milne, would like to see in a whistleblower environment that I do not know that all of us have had the time to consider in the same way.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:32):  I made the remark at the beginning of the contribution in the amendments debate that I do want to see comprehensive legislation and that this in no way substitutes for what is required, and that is why I am pursuing the substantive bill, which the government has said it will bring in and in which the coalition supported the Greens in moving a motion last year to get it in by this week. So I absolutely want to see comprehensive legislation. As to the suggestion that there be some sort of dragnet for former employees: that is ridiculous. All it is doing is saying that the protection of disclosure under the act would be extended to them should they decide that they had something they wanted to disclose. It is not about going and pursuing them; it is about giving them protection under the act. As to the notion that it is up to the media instead of the Public Service to enable the making of these disclosures: Senator Ryan, you would know as well as I do that the media are excluded from, for example, Nauru and Manus Island. If they are allowed in at all, it is under very strict rules. So let's not assume the media necessarily gets access.


The media is one thing. The proper procedures in the Public Service are quite another. It is about actually having proper procedures in the Public Service protect public servants and the national interest. The point of whistleblower legislation is to get this in a way that is fair to people who are in the Public Service and enables them to act in the public interest in a democracy. That is where I am coming from. In terms of assuming that, just because nothing is found, there is no conspiracy: has the video ever been released that was taken on the HMAS Adelaide on the day that the children overboard incident occurred, or have we only ever seen the cut version that the Howard government released?

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (10:34):  To briefly respond: the point I was making to Senator Milne was that Senator Milne referred to a number of instances—PET scanners, children overboard—and the point I was making was that a lack of evidence years later can actually mean that nothing that is alleged necessarily occurred. 'Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence' is an old statement I was once taught.


I think we do have a healthy culture with regard to public servant whistleblowers. Some of the things that have become publicly known in the last few years, whether that be the green loans that Senator Milne mentioned, whether that be pink batts or school halls, had much of the information coming from officials. You are right to say the media is not the only safeguard. I mentioned that because I believe it is one of the most important safeguards, but I note that the spokespeople for all parties on immigration matters have been to Manus Island quite recently. On the issues of border protection and how we deal with unlawful arrivals, I think never the twain shall meet on that, so I do not know if that is the best example to deal with for this, because I think we are actually speaking at profoundly cross-purposes.

 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (10:36):  I indicate again that the government takes the whole issue of a comprehensive and considered response in a legislative sense to whistleblower protection very seriously. These issues—in fact, all the issues in the list of amendments from the Greens—will be considered as part of the development of that legislation currently being considered. I am not trying to say in any way at all that we do not believe that a comprehensive response to the need for protection of public servants who are whistleblowers is required. We will do that in a considered way shortly.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:37):  I move Greens amendment (4) on sheet 7299:


(4) Schedule 1, item 52, page 28 (lines 25 to 27), omit subsection 16(3), substitute:


(3) Procedures published under subsection (2) must:


   (a) comply with basic procedural requirements (if any) prescribed by the regulations; and


   (b) provide for an APS employee, or former APS employee, who makes a whistleblower report to be involved in, and receive regular updates about, any inquiry into the report.


This amendment is quite self-explanatory. It is basically saying that, if a Public Service employee or a former employee makes a disclosure, they be entitled to be regularly updated and involved as to the progress of the investigation of their allegations.


One of the issues here is that if people are put in this invidious position where they end up in this situation and then they are not told how the investigation is going, where it is up to and what action is being taken, they are left wondering what is going to happen to them and what is going to be the outcome. So this amendment is basically just to say that, if a person has been courageous enough, in my view, to make a disclosure, they will be regularly updated as to the progress of that investigation.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (10:38):  I move Greens amendment (7) on sheet 7299:


(7) Schedule 1, item 52, page 29 (after line 21), after subsection 16(6), insert:




Protection from criminal and civil proceedings



(7) No action or proceeding, whether criminal or civil, lies against an APS employee for or in relation to a whistleblower report made by the APS employee in accordance with this section (including regulations made for the purposes of this section).


This amendment is very important. It prohibits legal action being taken against someone who complies with the section of the act. The main intention of this is to recognise that sometimes the punishment is extremely harsh because of the wide provisions of section 70 of the Crimes Act, which provides for a two-year imprisonment for communicating a fact or document that comes to their knowledge through their employment.


I think it is important that we actually look at this amendment, because it is saying that we should not be taking legal action against someone who complies with this particular section of the act. If this amendment were taken up, it would, for example, protect someone like Allan Kessing, the person I referred to earlier, who was charged under the Criminal Code for releasing information about security processes at airports. He spent four years in court. He lost $70,000 out of his own pocket and now has a conviction against his name—all of that in spite of the fact that, in the 2007 election, we had the situation where many people who were in opposition then and are now in the Labor government went out saying what a great job he had done and what a contribution he had made to Australia.


This also reinforces a point I made earlier that, when in refusing to grant him a pardon, Mr Clare wrote that he had been advised that Mr Kessing 'chose not to utilise the whistleblower policy in place' in the Australian Customs Service in 2005 to raise concerns that he might have had about the report in question. But Mr Kessing said 'the assertion that Customs had a whistleblower policy in 2005 needed to be explained'. He said: 'As far as I know there was none—which is why they said they were going to do something about it'; that is, referring to Labor's pre-election policy in 2007. But, clearly, that did not actually happen.


I think it is incumbent on Mr Clare to review Mr Kessing's case. In particular, what is really interesting is that Mr Kessing has said that he provided the material to a staff member working for Minister Anthony Albanese, who was Labor's transport spokesman when in opposition. So it was to a staffer in his office that Mr Kessing made that information available—and he has always denied leaking it to the Australian newspaper. I think that Minister Albanese perhaps ought to make a statement to the parliament as to what he knew about the leaking of that document to the Australian and whether his staffer drew it to his attention or whether that staffer gave it to the Australian, because Mr Kessing says that he made it available to that shadow minister's office and never went to the media himself. Furthermore, Mr Kessing says that there was no process in 2005 in Customs, and that goes to the point that I was making earlier where, as an employee, he did not know that there was one and that, if there was one, it had certainly had not been brought to his attention, nor had it ever been discussed with people in that Customs department.


So I really think that we need to get serious about this. I recognise that the government and the coalition are not going to support this amendment prohibiting legal action being taken against someone who was already complying with the act but ended up with a severe punishment. Look at the case of Mr Kessing and where he has ended up. He was made the poster child on whistleblowing in the Labor Party's 2007 election campaign and has been hung out to dry, refused a pardon and has ended up $70,000 out of pocket and with a conviction against his name. It is hardly a situation which would encourage people in the Australian Public Service today to come forward and blow the whistle on breaches of process in the Public Service.


I recommend this amendment to the Senate and urge that, if you are not going to support this amendment now, the parliamentary secretary take this back to the legislation—I am assuming it is almost ready to be introduced—and make sure that this is covered, because when it is introduced we will be coming back with amendments to address this matter and to address Minister Albanese's need to make some sort of statement to the parliament.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (09:31):  I rise this morning to speak on behalf of the opposition on both of these bills before the Senate—one, the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012, a government bill and one, the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2012, a private senator's bill introduced by the President of the Senate. The two bills are in response to the report Ahead of the game: blueprint for reform of Australian government administration, which was released in March 2010. There was a committee of inquiry underway into this particular report by the Senate's Finance and Public Administration Committee, which was, sadly, put off by the election and the committee did not have a chance to renew that inquiry. I would also note that it was announced that many of the recommendations from that inquiry were in fact not going to be implemented by the new government after the 2010 election.


First I would like to mention some important context to this bill. Today there are around 160,000 people employed by the Australian Public Service spread throughout government departments based all around the country but naturally focused here in Canberra. They have different backgrounds, experiences and come from all kinds and walks of life—indeed, I have some in my own family. Whether it is issuing a passport, solving a Centrelink inquiry or costing tax policies, they all play a crucial role in developing and administering public policy of this country. Everyday decisions they make and the work that they do impact Australians in every walk of life, so it is important for the wellbeing of our country that these tasks are carried out professionally and with integrity.


I would first like to deal with the government's Public Service Amendment Bill, which is being taken this morning with the other bill. This bill makes a number of amendments to the Public Service Act 1999, most of which are minor in nature, relating to the code of conduct of public servants and changing the values and employment principles for APS employees. So it is an important bill. It is an important bill because we need to make sure we have an impartial Public Service that operates with excellence and integrity. In the explanatory memorandum of this bill it states its purpose is to:


… strengthen the management and leadership of the Public Service and to help embed new practices and behaviours into its culture.


This is a good purpose and the opposition on the whole believes the amendment bill achieves this. 


But first let me correct a myth that has been put about by some on the other side of this change—both the Labor Party and their coalition colleagues the Greens. The coalition supports the Australian Public Service. It supports a strong Australian Public Service. We believe in an efficient and good Public Service, because that makes for good and efficient administration of this country. I would suggest that over the course of this nation, since the employment of the first public servant, who I believe was Robert Garran in 1901, our country has been relatively well served and particularly so when we look at comparable nations. So we support this amendment bill because we believe the Public Service is an integral part of good government in this country. 


We also note that the government has accepted a proposed amendment by the opposition in the other place and we believe that strengthens this bill as well. The concerns that we had, and which are reflected in the amendment the government accepted, were not with the Public Service itself but with the government's treatment of the Public Service. What concerned us most was that the initial draft of the bill gave the Prime Minister greater power to extend the employment of departmental secretaries, allowing the Prime Minister to give new positions to secretaries who have resigned or whose contracts have ended. This allowance essentially undid a lot of good work the bill achieved about process and merit within the Public Service and, in our view, violated the five consolidated principles that the bill outlines for the Public Service. 


The most notable example of this, of course, was the appointment of Dr Ken Henry under section 67 of the Constitution by the Prime Minister upon his departure as Secretary of the Treasury. The opposition had previously in estimates hearings in this place expressed concerns about this appointment, given that it had previously been rarely used and only, shall we say, for the most sensitive of appointments that a government can make with respect to security agencies. So this bill does limit the ability of the Prime Minister to make unilateral decisions with respect to the Public Service and appointments of secretaries, and we support that.


I would now like to turn to the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill. This is a bill that naturally reflects the same report undertaken by the government—Ahead of the game: blueprint for reform of Australian government administration, the blueprint that I mentioned earlier. This bill amends the Parliamentary Service Act and runs in parallel to, but naturally is distinct from, the Public Service. It is important that there be an independent Parliamentary Service. It is important that this parliament can draw upon what I think everyone in this chamber would agree is the extraordinary ethical contribution and the long hours that people who work in the Parliamentary Service do to facilitate us in doing our job. We support the separate Parliamentary Service, but running it along the same lines as the Public Service, with merit protection and other processes, is also very important because the Parliamentary Service and the Public Service do benefit from cross-fertilisation—people moving between the two occasionally—and we do need to have a system that gives employees confidence in their employment arrangements and their careers and that also gives the confidence that I think we hold in the Parliamentary Service. So the opposition supports the principles in this bill and the amendments to the bill that are moved. Where there are slight differences from the Public Service Amendment Bill, that of course reflects the different nature of the Parliamentary Service. I would also like to note that there have been some amendments to this bill circulated by the President of the Senate, and the opposition will be supporting those amendments as they bring the bill into line with the amendments made as appropriate to the Public Service Amendment Bill. So the opposition will be supporting both these bills and the amendments to the Parliamentary Service Bill moved by the President of the Senate.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (09:37):  I rise to support this very important bill, the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2012 [2013]. It seeks to amend the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to reflect, where relevant to the Parliamentary Service, the changes that are proposed to be made to the Public Service Act 1999 by the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012. Although many of the provisions of the Public Service Amendment Bill are reflected in this bill, there are a range of provisions in the bill which are not reflected in the Public Service Amendment Bill and vice versa. Therefore, whilst it is fair to say that the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill runs closely in conjunction with the Public Service Amendment Bill, it is a distinct bill that contains key differences.


This bill, along with the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012, responds to the recommendations of the March 2010 report Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration. The blueprint outlined a reform agenda to strengthen Australian Public Service performance so that it meets the needs of all citizens, provides strong leadership and strategic direction, contains a highly capable workforce and operates efficiently at a high standard. It was developed jointly by the Parliamentary Service departments in consultation with the Parliamentary Service Commissioner and introduced into the Senate in November last year. Following introduction, it was referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee for inquiry and report so that it could be compared with the provisions contained in the Public Service Amendment Bill. These amendments are an important part of modernising the Parliamentary Service. They are part of the continuous process of improvement that it must undergo to face the challenges of the future.


It is important to make a comparison of this bill and the Public Service Amendment Bill because, as alluded to earlier, the two contain some differences. Various items in the bill do not reflect provisions contained in the Public Service Amendment Bill, including amendments relating to acting arrangements that have already been made to the Public Service Act and miscellaneous amendments that achieve consistency with the relevant sections of the Public Service Act. In addition to this, the bill does not contain numerous changes being made in the Public Service Amendment Bill. This bill will not, for example, provide for an annual review of the performance of secretaries in the Parliamentary Service.


The main features of the bill make notable changes to the roles and responsibilities of secretaries in the Parliamentary Service, the functions of the Parliamentary Service Commissioner and the relevant code of conduct. The bill clarifies and revises the description of the roles and responsibilities of secretaries, as well as of the Senior Executive Service, to ensure that the Parliamentary Service has the organisational and workforce capacities to meet the needs of the future. The existing responsibilities of the secretaries, including managing their departments and providing information about the operation and administration of their departments, will remain. However, the secretaries would also be tasked with a host of new responsibilities such as providing stewardship in the departments and across the Parliamentary Service with other secretaries; engaging with stakeholders; and providing strategic direction and leadership. The amendments are designed to expand on the role of the secretaries so that departmental affairs are managed as efficiently, effectively, economically and ethically as possible and in keeping with the overall interests of the Parliamentary Service.


The functions of Senior Executive Service employees, or SES employees, will also be further defined and expanded. The amendments will fundamentally recast the chief functions of the SES group and focus on these employees providing superior strategic leadership. Individual SES employees will be expected to provide one or more of the following at a high level: professional or specialist expertise; policy advice; program or service delivery; and regulatory administration.


One of the most notable aspects of this bill is that it will also substantially redesign the functions of the Parliamentary Service Commissioner. The commissioner will be charged with new responsibilities, including inquiring into Parliamentary Service employees' reports of breaches of the Parliamentary Service Code of Conduct. The amendments will also provide that when the commissioner is examining these whistleblower reports, such as a conflict of interest or the contravention of an Australian law, the commissioner will have information-gathering powers equivalent to those of the Auditor-General. This is, of course, necessary to adequately probe whistleblower reports and uncover information which has the potential to expose widespread conduct breaches. The bill will also introduce new amendments to protect the information given to the commissioner under the new inquiry functions, as well as existing responsibilities such as inquiring into matters relating to the commissioner at the request of the Presiding Officers. Although the commissioner will be allowed to disclose this protected information in certain situations, such as in reports prepared for purposes connected with these inquiry functions, they will otherwise be prohibited from making a record, disclosing, or otherwise using this information. This is a vital amendment, as it adds an additional layer of protection to potentially sensitive information held by the commissioners to ensure that it remains confidential.


The amendments will also make the provision of information and documents to the commissioner inadmissible as evidence against a person in proceedings, other than for certain criminal offences. This will be the case where the person reasonably believed that the information or document was relevant for purposes connected with the performance or exercise of the commissioner's functions. This amendment is vital, as it protects those Parliamentary Service employees who have provided information to the commissioner that assists the commissioner in performing his or her duties. This bill makes key changes to the existing framework governing the Office of the Parliamentary Service Merit Protection Commissioner. The Merit Protection Commissioner will also be able to undertake whistleblowing inquiries into possible breaches of the code of conduct, where requested to do so by the relevant secretary and agreed to by the Parliamentary Service employee. The Merit Protection Commissioner will have information-gathering powers equivalent to the Auditor-General when undertaking such inquiries and will be charged with establishing written procedures for code of conduct breach inquiries. Like the Public Service Commissioner, the Merit Protection Commissioner will be subject to confidentiality of information requirements in connection with the information received during the performance or exercise of the commissioner's functions. The amendments will also make the provision of information and documents to the Merit Protection Commissioner inadmissible as evidence against a person in proceedings, other than for certain criminal offences.


The bill proposes significant changes to the provisions of the Parliamentary Service Act that deal with whistleblowing and whistleblower reports. Departmental secretaries will be required to establish procedures for handling whistleblower reports, including a clear pathway for the making of reports, so that all employees are encouraged to blow the whistle on possible breaches of the code of conduct. This will ensure that those employees who are considering blowing the whistle on possible breaches of the code of conduct will have greater guidance on how they can achieve this. 


The amendments will also seek to implement the blueprint recommendations to repeal the existing Parliamentary Service values and insert five new values together with seven new Parliamentary Service Employment Principles relating to employment decisions and workplace standards. This creates a smaller set of core values that are more meaningful, memorable and effective in driving change as well as reinforcing the positive cultural environment for a high-performing Parliamentary Service. Every Parliamentary Service employee can look at this new set of streamlined principles and remind themselves of the importance of being committed to service as well as remaining ethical, respectful, accountable and impartial.


The introduction of a set of Parliamentary Service Employment Principles in the bill replicates the Australian Public Service Employment Principles contained in the Public Service Amendment Bill. These new principles will state that the Parliamentary Service is a career based service that makes fair employment decisions with a fair system of review, requires effective performance from each employee and provides workplaces that are free from discrimination, patronage and favouritism. The principles will also recognise the diversity of the Australian community and foster diversity in the workplace, and provide flexible, safe and rewarding workplaces where communication, consultation, cooperation and input from employees on matters that affect their workplace are valued.


The new Parliamentary Service values and employment principles together define the character of the Parliamentary Service as an institution and guide the way in which it conducts its activities and serves the Australian community and the government. They provide robust guidance on the culture and operating ethos of the Parliamentary Service and underscore its professionalism. This ensures that the Parliamentary Service will continue to provide professional support of the highest calibre to all parliamentarians, independent of the executive government of the day.


This government strongly believes in modernising the Parliamentary Service, and these amendments are an important aspect of that. Improving the operations of the Parliamentary Service is an ongoing process that requires immense commitment to ensure that government is equipped to confront the challenges of the future. All parliamentarians depend on a professional, nonpartisan Parliamentary Service. After more than a decade since the Parliamentary Service was created, this bill will ensure that the service can continue to provide a high level of support and advice, which will ultimately benefit the wider Australian community. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2013-02-07,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (09:48):  The Public Service Amendment Bill 2012 seeks to simplify and refine the values that guide the Australian Public Service down to five key principles: the APS is to be committed to service, be ethical, respectful, accountable and, of course, impartial. To that effect, the bill contains numerous provisions of a technical and administrative nature which seek, among other things, to delineate the roles and responsibilities of departmental secretaries and provide for annual reviews of secretaries' performance and further define the functions and roles of the Senior Executive Service of the APS.


The bill is long and detailed, but I want to focus this morning on one particular provision, namely, the one that establishes the Secretaries Board as the lead forum of the Australian Public Service. The board will replace the Management Advisory Committee, which has played that lead role since 1999. In many ways, the bill merely codifies the status quo, as the Secretaries Board has already been in existence for the past two years. The board is to be the principal APS senior leadership group, composed of the secretaries of all the departments, the Commissioner of the Australian Public Service and such others as may be nominated by the secretary of the Prime Minister's department.


The bill enumerates the board's functions. It will have responsibility for the stewardship of the APS and for developing and implementing strategies to improve the APS. It will identify strategic priorities for the APS and consider issues that affect the Public Service. It will set an annual work program, direct subcommittees to develop strategies to address Public Service-wide issues and make recommendations back to the Secretaries Board. It will draw together advice from senior leaders in government, business and the community. All these roles and responsibilities, as all senators would agree, are very important. I hope that the board will provide the APS with the necessary leadership to tackle issues and problems that affect the Public Service as a whole—the entire Australian Public Service. 


One such issue, which I have raised many times over the years, is Public Service absenteeism. It is one that I have pursued for the past eight years through Senate estimates, in government and out of government, as well as in this chamber, most recently about three months ago. The facts are simple: the rates of unscheduled absence in the Public Service have been increasing steadily over the past 10 or so years. In 2001-02, the median unscheduled absence rate was 8.9 days per year per employee, of which sick leave accounted for seven days and other types of leave for the remaining 1.9 days. In 2010-11, the rate of unscheduled absence climbed to 11.1 days per year per employee, of which sick leave accounted for 8.4 days. This means that in nine years, unscheduled absences in the Australian Public Service increased by 25 per cent, or 2.2 days per year per employee. The median figure hides a great divergence across government departments and agencies, with the levels of workplace absence varying widely from 3.9 days per employee all the way up to 23½ days per year per employee. There is a huge disparity between unscheduled absences across Public Service agencies. And 23.5 days median absence is a lot—that is almost five working weeks and, combined with four weeks of annual leave, this means that some employees are not at work for almost nine weeks, or two months, a year.


This is not generally the experience of those working in the private sector. While reliable data is hard to come by—and I will come back to that in a minute—Direct Health Solutions in their 2011 absence management survey reported that while absence levels across Australia fell for the first time in three years, public sector employees took 22½ per cent more time off than those in the private sector. Why this great divergence between the Public Service and the private sector, and why have the rates of absenteeism in the Public Service increased by 25 per cent over the last decade? Why? I wish I had the answer—indeed, I wish anyone had the answer.


Over the years I have received various suggestions from the Australian Public Service Commission as to why. One year, the absences were blamed on a particularly bad flu season. Another year I was told that the Public Service has an older age profile than the private sector, the implication being that the older you are the sicker you get. The APS is certainly more middle-aged that the rest of the Australian workforce, but it actually has fewer older workers than the private sector. In any case, the Public Service Commission does not actually collect data on absences per various age groups so the proposition that the age profile accounts for increasing absenteeism is merely guesswork and a hypothesis not supported by any collected data. The bottom line is that the commission does not know what is really causing this problem.


This might explain why over the past eight years I have been disappointed by the efforts that the commission has been putting in to tackle this issue. After all, if you do not know what is causing the problem, it is unlikely that you will be able to find a solution. When earlier this year I questioned the commissioner, Mr Stephen Sedgwick, as to whether he has a responsibility to act to reduce absenteeism, he answered:


I do not actually manage a hundred agencies across the Australian Public Service; I manage my own.


…   …   …


But we are quite keen—and we have—to share good practice and that is what we tend to do. In these circumstances we encourage good practice and we promulgate good practice.


As far as I have been able to discover, all this encouragement and promulgation of good practice seems to have been contained to the publication in 2006—two years after I first raised the issue of absenteeism with the commission—of a document called Fostering an attendance culture: a guide for APS agencies. It was a good document but, as I recently discovered, it has not been updated or reissued since 2006.


Apart from that, I also discovered that absenteeism has not been placed even once on the agenda of the Management Advisory Committee or that of its successor, the Secretaries Board, for the past five years. I have been told, though, that absenteeism has been taken up at internal human resources management forums. That might be the case, but numbers speak for themselves—a 25 per cent increase in unscheduled absences by Australian public servants in the past 10 years. One might think that this issue deserves deep consideration by the APS's lead forums.


At the Senate estimates in October last year the committee finally received a commitment from the commissioner that the issue of Public Service absenteeism will now be put on the agenda of the Secretaries Board, where it belongs. As I look at the board's functions, as enumerated in the bill before the Senate, it is clear that tackling the problem of high and constantly-increasing absenteeism is a clear instance of where the board needs to be—and I quote from the bill—'developing and implementing strategies to improve the APS'. As the board identifies 'strategic priorities for the APS' and considers 'issues that affect the APS', I hope that reducing absenteeism will be one such issue. I hope that the board will finally provide the much-needed focus and leadership to address this problem.


The new APS principles state that the Public Service is to be committed to service and to being ethical, respectful, accountable and impartial. A Public Service that is committed to service and that is accountable to the parliament and to the taxpayers is one that needs to put the issue of absenteeism high on its agenda and, more importantly, to act to finally address the problem, because it does not seem to be going away. I will certainly continue to watch this issue with considerable interest.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2013-02-07,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (09:59):  I thank all senators for their contributions to the debate on the Public Service Amendment Bill 2012, and also on the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill 2012 [2013]. This bill makes landmark changes to the Public Service Act 1999. The bill will help to modernise the governance of the Australian Public Service, and in many ways will enable world's best practice in public service management. The bill will improve the quality of workforce management in the Australian Public Service, and this will translate into better service provision for the Australian public.


The amendments implement the recommendations of Ahead of the game: blueprint for the reform of Australian government administration. In particular there are: improved governance arrangements for APS leadership, including reforms that will strengthen the independence of secretaries and provide a clear statement of their role; a clearer, shorter statement of APS values, blending contemporary ethical approaches with enduring principles of public administration that go to the heart of the Westminster model; reforms that set out more clearly the role of the Australian Public Service Commissioner as a central authority for the development and stewardship of the Australian Public Service; and practical improvements to the Public Service Act that address a number of operational matters that have arisen since the last major changes in 1999. The reforms proposed in the report Ahead of the game and implemented through this bill will provide Australia with a modern employment framework for its public service. It will bring greater agility and responsiveness to the government, and this will pay dividends to the Australian community.


The bill strengthens governance arrangements for Australian Public Service leadership, including provisions concerning the appointment and termination of departmental secretaries. The bill will restore the 'gold standard' arrangement that supported the integrity and consistency of our public sector for generations. As was the case before 1999, the Governor-General will have the responsibility of appointing departmental secretaries, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister. Having the Governor-General make these appointments will underscore the impartiality of the Australian Public Service, and will promote public confidence in its leadership.


Following the introduction of the bill into the House of Representatives, the government has moved two largely technical amendments which, with the support of the opposition, were passed by the House. The amendments concern the engagement of non-ongoing employees, and the protection of information and immunity from suit provisions applying to the Public Service Commissioner, the Merit Protection Commissioner and other 'entrusted persons' in the course of the commissioners' review and inquiry functions. The government amendments have ensured that these provisions will operate effectively.


The government has also supported amendments moved by the opposition during debate in the House in the interests of achieving meaningful reform supported across the parliament. These amendments relate to arrangements for the engagement of former secretaries. In response to matters raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the government has tabled an addendum to the revised explanatory memorandum for the bill. The addendum provides additional information on handling suspected misconduct by Australian Public Service employees, including those who provide false or misleading information when applying for employment in the Public Service.


I understand Senator Milne has proposed amendments concerning protection for whistleblowers who make reports under the Public Service Act. I thank Senator Milne for her interest in this matter. Some of the amendments proposed deal with matters that are already included within the bill.  For example, proposed sections 72C and 72D of the amendment bill make clear that people who provide information related to a whistleblowing report to the Public Service Commissioner or the Merit Protection Commissioner are protected against civil and criminal penalties.


I also thank Senator Mason for raising the matter of unscheduled absences in the APS. This has clearly been an area of interest for Senator Mason for some time. As Senator Mason acknowledged, agencies have prime responsibility for managing workplace absences and it is a matter that they and the government take very seriously. But I can advise Senator Mason that the Secretaries Board has discussed this matter and that the Australian Public Service Commission is monitoring developments to inform further reports to the board.


The government takes seriously the protection of public officials who report in good faith serious misconduct or maladministration. Indeed, the government is developing a comprehensive public interest disclosure scheme which includes including strengthened protection for whistleblowers. The government does not, therefore, support the Greens amendments to this bill.


The debate this morning has concerned both the Public Service Amendment Bill and the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill. The decision in 1999 to have a distinct, separate Parliamentary Service, albeit with generally similar terms and conditions to the Public Service, has served the Australian community well for the last decade. The proposed amendments to the Parliamentary Service Act closely reflect the amendments to the Public Service Act. I am informed that the bill is intended to ensure that the Parliamentary Service will continue to be able to serve the federal legislature and through it the Australian people professionally and in a nonpartisan manner. On behalf of our President, I commend the Parliamentary Service Amendment Bill to the Senate.


In summary, the Public Service Amendment Bill responds to the reform agenda of the Advisory Group on Reform of Australian Government Administration, whose recommendations were accepted by government. The Australian Public Service is fundamental to the success of our country and our society. The commitment and expertise of our Public Service directly affects the lives of all Australians. A healthy Public Service is a vital part of Australia's democratic system of government. Australians have high expectations. They quite rightly expect quality service, honesty and integrity, and value for their taxpayer dollar from the Public Service. The bill will support a Public Service that is agile and responsive to a rapidly changing world, meeting the legitimate needs of the Australian community and the government of the day both now and into the future.


I thank senators for their support for this bill and commend both bills to the Senate.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill. I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard and to continue my remarks.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



In a world that is getting harsher, it is government's role to make things easier for all Australians. Punishing job seekers by condemning them to poverty is not contributing to the caring society that the majority of Australian want for themselves or for their children.


The Australian Greens recognise that single people living on Newstart and Youth Allowance are the ones who are the most disadvantaged by Australia's current income support system. The maximum single rate for Newstart was $246.30 in September 2012; $140 less per week than the rate of payment for singles (including the fortnightly pension supplement) on the age and disability pensions. The maximum rate of payment for Youth Allowance (living away from home) was $203.75 in September 2012; $42.55 less per week than the single rate of Newstart.


The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Caring for People on Newstart and Other Measures) Bill 2013 will give effect to the Australian Greens commitment to increase the base payment rate by $50 per week for single people living on Newstart and Youth Allowance (living away from home). The bill will also index other social security allowance payments and pensions to the higher of CPI, MTAWE or the pensioner and beneficiary living cost index. This will ensure that the gap between pensions and allowance payments does not continue to widen.


Raising the single rate of Newstart by $50 per week, will bring relief to almost a million households on the very lowest rates of income support, including single parent families, by increasing the amount of financial support they receive on a fortnightly basis. The bill will also ensure that the single rate of Newstart is finally increased to two-thirds of the combined couple rate, as recommended by the Henry Tax Review and 2009 Harmer Pension Review.


The focus on singles is based on evidence that these households are the most at risk of poverty. The ACOSS Poverty Report 2012, which drew on 2010 census data, found that single people generally faced a significantly higher risk of poverty than couples (25% to 9%) while 25.3% of single parent families with children are living in poverty compared with 8.4% of couples with children. This reflects in part the economies of scale available to people living with partners.


As well as assisting people out of poverty, the key reasons for increasing the base rate of Newstart and Youth Allowance include:


(a) the extended length of time that many recipients spend on the payment;


(b) the cost of living pressures faced by those in receipt of the single rate of the allowance; and


(c) the growing gap between the pension and allowance payment types due to different methods of indexation.


A recent inquiry by the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee examined cost of living pressures for allowance recipients including housing, food and the costs of searching for work and concluded its section on the adequacy of allowance payments by stating:


""On the weight of evidence, the committee questions whether Newstart Allowance provides recipients with a standard of living that is acceptable in the Australian context for anything but the shortest period of time.""


The inquiry was also presented with evidence from Centrelink that 42% of new recipients of Newstart each year do not transition quickly back into the workforce.


Similarly, many Youth Allowance recipients are expected to be in receipt of the payment for an extended period of time while they complete their studies or look for work. Recipients on Youth Allowance have access to better employment income arrangements, which allow Youth Allowance recipients to build up their income bank or gain working credits and earn more per week before their payments are reduced. However, a single person on Youth Allowance is still on a significantly lower payment than any other allowance recipient and highly likely to be in receipt of the payment for an extended period of time.


The call for an increase in the base rate of allowance payments has received widespread support from not only welfare and social service groups but also from business groups, unions, various economists and members of parliament. The Business Council of Australia argued in its submission to the Inquiry into the adequacy of allowances payments that there is a need for an increase in the Newstart Allowance on an 'adequacy and fairness basis' and that 'there is concern that the low rate of Newstart itself now presents a barrier to employment and risks entrenching poverty


The government has acknowledged on a number of occasions that it is not easy for a person to live on the current rate of Newstart allowance. However, the suite of measures that have been introduced by the current Government so far have been inadequate to address the level of need that those on the lowest rates of payment experience while they study or look for work. 


For example, the new Income Support Bonus will offer eligible singles the equivalent of around $4 extra a week as a lump sum twice annually. Those who receive it will still be in receipt of payments that are $130 below the poverty line.


Other supplements have been made available to some allowance recipients, but those supplements reflect the higher costs incurred by the recipients, such as illness, high private rental costs, or the costs of raising children and do not resolve the inadequacy of the base payment.


This bill will directly assist single people living on Newstart and Youth Allowance for an extended period of time by providing them with a more stable, adequate base income.


The gap between the allowance and pension payments is increasing. Between March and September of 2012, the gap between Newstart and the pension (including pensioner supplement) rose by $7, because of the use of different indexation methods. Newstart Allowance is indexed to movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in March and September each year and Youth Allowance is indexed to the CPI once a year in January. Pensions are indexed twice a year (in March and September) by the greater of the movement in the CPI or the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index (PBLCI)—an index designed to better reflect the price changes affecting pensioners - and the rise is also benchmarked to Male Total Average Weekly Earnings.


The effect of differences in indexation is that pensions have, since 1997, been increasing in line with wage rises or the CPI while allowances have increased only in line with the CPI—and over this period, wages have generally increased at a greater rate than prices.


The Henry Taxation Review examined the long term impact of this difference in indexation methods and found that:


""… some difference in the level of payments can be justified on the basis of differing needs and presenting different incentives to different groups … Harder to justify is the fact that rates of pension and allowances are not merely different, but the gap between them is widening … If the current indexation arrangements remain in place, it is likely that by 2040, a single pensioner would be paid more than twice as much as a single unemployed person. A continuous decline in Newstart Allowance against community standards would have major implications for payment adequacy and the coherence—in terms of horizontal equity—of the income support system.""


This bill will address the widening gap, by ensuring that these classes of payment are all indexed by the same methodology and that they are in line with changes to both prices and wages.


A $50 increase to the base rate of eligible payments will ensure a fairer, and more straightforward social security system and immediately reduce the extent to which Australian people are living in poverty. Better indexation will help maintain the value of an increase into the future.


I commend the bill to the Senate.

The speeches read as follows—



CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS MEASURES) BILL 2012


The Customs Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2012 is an omnibus bill, which makes a number of amendments to the Customs Act as part of the Government's program of regulatory improvement.


Firstly, the Bill will amend the Customs Act to make it an offence to bring into Australia without a permit, certain prescribed prohibited imports to be known as restricted goods. This is different to the current offence, which requires the goods to be imported in order for an offence to be committed.  Initially, the new category of restricted goods will be limited to child pornography and child abuse material.  In future, this could be extended to give effect to international agreements or to address matters of international concern and could be applied to any purpose related to external affairs.


Reflecting the serious nature of the offence, the Bill proposes that it carries a maximum penalty of 1000 penalty units, which is similar to the penalties for the unlawful importation or exportation of goods.


Customs controlled areas form an important part of Customs and Border Protection's control mechanisms at airports and ports. They give officers the ability to question non-travellers, to restrict access for non-travellers, or to remove them from certain areas when Customs and Border Protection is performing its function. The Bill makes minor changes to ensure Customs and Border Protection is able to set up permanent and temporary Customs controlled areas in the maritime and air environments when dealing with aircraft and ships carrying only crew and when processing cruise ships.


This Bill implements a number of measures that clarify intent, remove redundant regulation and reduce the compliance burden for industry. This includes making it clear that self-powered ships and aircraft that are imported or intended to be imported are subject to the control of Customs and should be entered for home consumption.  The Bill will also allow the CEO to request additional information from an applicant for a warehouse licence which will enable issues to be clarified without the need for industry to submit a further application.


The Bill makes minor changes to the valuation provisions, ensuring consistency with the World Trade Organization Customs Valuation Agreement.


Finally, the Bill will repeal expired moratorium periods for electronic cargo reporting and repeal the legislation that refers to the accredited client program. Technology improvements and changes in the policy, procedural and cost environment meant that the program was not implemented operationally.


Customs and Border Protection consulted industry through the release of an exposure draft of the Bill in September 2012.


Key stakeholders such as Shipping Australia, QANTAS, and CAPEC have all responded positively to these changes. Operationally, they make little changes in the way these organisations and their stakeholders do business, but clarify their obligations under the Customs Act.


 


FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 2012


The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 2012 would, if enacted, amend 5 Acts across 3 portfolios.


It is the twelfth Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill since 2004. It forms part of an ongoing program to address financial framework issues as they are identified and assists in ensuring that specific provisions in existing legislation remain clear and up-to-date.


Keeping the existing financial framework legislation up-to-date is also consistent with the reforms foreshadowed in the Government's proposed Commonwealth Financial Accountability Review.


First, the Bill would amend the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to substitute references to ""Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines"" with ""guidelines in relation to procurement"", given the recent change in name of the guidelines to the Commonwealth Procurement Rules.


Second, the Bill would amend the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 to provide the Director of National Parks with greater autonomy to enter into contracts with an increased threshold of $1 million from the current $250,000.


Third, the Bill would amend the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989 to establish a special appropriation for the purpose of making remissions or refunds of import levies and manufacture levies, including those related to synthetic greenhouse gas management equipment.


Fourth, the Bill would establish a framework for dealing with overpayments, within the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973, and to address instances where payments are made from an annual appropriation to recipients, that are not, in practice, consistent with the requirements or preconditions imposed by this Act and risk breaching section 83 of the Constitution. This amendment flows from the amendments delivered by the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 2012.


Finally, the Bill would amend the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 to update labels of defined terms ""the Chairman"" and ""the Vice-Chairman"" with the gender neutral terms ""Chair"" and ""Deputy Chair"".


This short Bill is, accordingly, another step to help ensure that specific areas of the Commonwealth's financial framework remain effective and up-to-date.


 


INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 2012


Today I introduce this Bill, which will amend the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 and give the force of law in Australia to new bilateral taxation agreements with India, the Marshall Islands and Mauritius.


The agreement with India is a Protocol that will amend the current Australia–India tax treaty signed in 1991. The Protocol will promote closer economic cooperation between Australia and India by aligning the taxation of business profits and cross border services with international taxation norms and by including rules to prevent tax discrimination.


The Protocol will also improve the integrity of the Australian tax system through enhanced exchange of information provisions and new provisions providing for mutual assistance in the collection of tax debts.


The bilateral agreements with the Marshall Islands and Mauritius eliminate double taxation on certain income derived by individuals, in particular government workers, students and business apprentices, and pensioners and retirees.


The Marshall Islands and Mauritius are required to provide reciprocal taxation treatment in relation to Australian government employees, students and business apprentices, retirees and pensioners.


These two agreements will also provide a mutual agreement procedure for the resolution of taxpayer disputes involving transfer pricing adjustments.


These agreements follow Australia concluding tax information exchange agreements with the Marshall Islands and Mauritius, which establish a legal basis for the exchange of taxpayer information between two countries and are an important tool in Australia's efforts to combat tax avoidance and evasion.


The agreements with India, the Marshall Islands and Mauritius will enter into force after Australia exchanges diplomatic notes with each of the other countries advising of the completion of their respective domestic law requirements.


 


OFFSHORE PETROLEUM AND GREENHOUSE GAS STORAGE AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE MEASURES) BILL 2012


The recent tragic accident on the Stena Clyde rig in the Otway Basin, located in the Bass Strait, which resulted in the deaths of two employees during drilling operations, represents an unfortunate example of the serious and inherent risks associated with the offshore industry.


This incident follows the uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons from the Montara Wellhead platform in August 2009, off the northern coast of Western Australia, and the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon on 20 April 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico.


Collectively, these events demonstrate and emphasise the need for a strong, effective and properly resourced offshore petroleum regulatory regime, to safeguard both human health and safety as well as the Australian marine environment.


The amendments contained in this bill largely continue the work of the Australian government to implement the lessons learnt and agreed in response to the report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry. I have more amendments I intend to introduce in the parliament in 2013 to further implement agreed recommendations coming out of the Montara report.


This bill amends the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to strengthen the offshore petroleum regulatory regime with respect to compliance, safety integrity and environmental management objectives.


The amendments seek to clarify and strength the compliance monitoring, investigation and enforcement powers of the National Offshore Petroleum Regulator and ensure that enforcement measures for contraventions of the act are appropriate in application and severity in the context of a high-hazard industry.


The bill also makes important amendments to provide parties responsible for administration of the act and associated regulations the ability to share information with each other and with other relevant Commonwealth and state and territory bodies. Information will be shared in circumstances where it is appropriate in order to enable those bodies to adequately discharge their legislative functions and powers.


To provide some further context to the amendments, the June 2010 report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry made several recommendations proposing amendments to the offshore petroleum regulatory regime. To give effect to these recommendations the Australian government undertook a comprehensive review of legislation applicable to offshore petroleum activities and the marine environment.


The legislative review


The bill amends the act to implement a number of the findings of the legislative review which aim to strengthen the operating practices of the offshore petroleum industry and provide additional enforcement powers to regulators.


The legislative review proposed, and the Australian government agreed, that due consideration be given to effecting several changes to the act including: the introduction of a civil penalty regime; increases to the current criminal penalty levels under the act to achieve consistency with compliance offences in other major hazard industry legislation; ensuring that penalties, including custodial penalties, for occupational health and safety offences under the act be harmonised with the Work Health and Safety Act 2011, or made greater as appropriate to reflect the serious consequences potentially resulting from regulatory breaches in a major hazard industry; and redrafting the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) inspectorate powers to provide greater clarity and consistency between the various powers of each category of inspector and remove unnecessary procedural requirements that are likely to impede NOPSEMA's ability to effectively perform its enforcement functions.


The introduction of civil penalties represents a significant first step in providing alternative enforcement tools, which will enable the regulator to select and apply an appropriate and proportionate regulatory response, depending upon the nature and relative seriousness of the breach that has occurred, and the regulatory response or action which is considered appropriate given the overall set of circumstances.


In addition, the application of civil penalties in the form of financial sanctions as a supplement or alternative to the existing criminal penalties and set at an appropriate level to reflect the nature of the offshore petroleum industry as a high-hazard industry is intended to encourage improved compliance with the act.


This will further enhance the existing objective based regime by supporting continuous improvement by industry, which is responsible under the regime to demonstrate to the regulator that the risk of operations are reduced as low as reasonably practicable.


Another critical measure contained in this bill is that which enables the parties responsible for the administration of the act to share regulatory information in appropriate circumstances. Currently, the act does not include the express provision to enable information obtained during the exercise of powers and functions under the act and regulations to be appropriately shared with other parties.


This legal issue in the offshore regulatory regime was highlighted during federal court proceedings initiated by a company against investigators in 2009 where an injunction was successfully obtained to prevent the sharing of regulatory information during an investigation into the death of a worker.


In the absence of an express provision, it has become evident that there is such potential detrimental legal impediments to regulators being able to share information—where it may be appropriate to do so—for such purposes of a joint investigation to comprehensively investigate an incident and pursue a successful prosecution of companies at fault or to educate other regulators about potential operational risks that have been discovered during the course of compliance monitoring or investigations.


In addition to this proposed amendment to the act, the Commonwealth is working together with the states and the Northern Territory to ensure that similar provisions are incorporated into relevant state and territory legislation to facilitate mutual information sharing, which will ensure that a comprehensive and effective approach to multijurisdictional compliance activities and investigations is possible.


Finally, the bill also implements a decision to remove the responsible state minister for Tasmania, as is his state's preference, from the joint authority arrangements in the offshore regulatory regime.


The current set of amendments will go some way towards addressing issues identified as arising from the Montara incident in August 2009.


However, I also remain committed to the continuing improvement of the offshore regulatory regime and, in line with this commitment, I have a number of further measures currently under consideration developed for progression in 2013, including consideration of a range of further alternative compliance and enforcement tools recommended in the legislative review to strengthen the ability of the regulator to enforce critical safety and environmental management requirements to help protect the Australian offshore workforce and marine environment.


In summary, through a range of measures, including: the introduction of a civil penalty regime; increases to criminal penalty levels contained in the act for offshore health and safety and environmental management; offences to achieve consistency with penalties for comparable offences in Australian legislation, including other major hazard industry legislation; redrafting the inspectorate powers to provide greater clarity and consistency between the various powers of each category of inspector; and remove unnecessary procedural requirements that are likely to impede the regulator's ability to effectively enforce the functions.


This bill underscores the government's commitment to the maintenance and continuing improvement of a strong effective framework for the regulation of offshore petroleum activities.


I commend the bill to the Senate.


 


PROTECTION OF CULTURAL OBJECTS ON LOAN BILL 2012


The introduction of the Protection of Cultural Objects on Loan Bill 2012 comes at an exciting time for arts and culture in Australia.


In line with the Government's Australia in the Asian Century White Paper, we are deepening our arts and cultural ties with Asia.


And the Government is finalising the first National Cultural Policy in 20 years, which will bring the vast array of stakeholders, art forms, opportunities and investment needs together in a comprehensive policy.


This bill will further develop our cultural wealth by encouraging loans of significant cultural objects from overseas for temporary public exhibition in Australia.


Every year millions of Australians visit our major national, state and territory cultural institutions. These audiences expect to see the best Australia and the world can offer.


This year alone has seen works of old Spanish masters at the Queensland Art Gallery, ten centuries of manuscripts at the National Library of Australia and the genius of Picasso at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Soon we will see Toulouse-Lautrec's view of Parisian life at the National Gallery of Australia and ancient treasures from Afghanistan at four museums around the country, including Museum Victoria and the Western Australian Museum.


The ability to borrow these objects enriches the cultural experience for Australian audiences, draws visitors from far and wide, and delivers significant economic benefits.


The resounding success of the Renaissance exhibition, held at the National Gallery of Australia last summer, shows the scale of this economic dividend. It attracted almost 213,000 visitors and brought an estimated $75 million to the local economy.


But despite the popularity of these exhibitions, in the past ten years it has become increasingly difficult for Australia's major galleries, libraries and museums to secure overseas loans.


Australia, unlike numerous other countries, does not have comprehensive legislation providing protection for cultural objects on loan from overseas.


Under existing Commonwealth legislation, protection for cultural objects on loan only applies in specific and limited circumstances under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986.


Although the risk of legal claims being made on cultural objects while they are on loan in Australia is low, foreign lenders are increasingly reluctant to loan to Australia's major cultural institutions in the absence of national legislation. As a result, loan negotiations between Australian cultural institutions and foreign lenders have become protracted and in some cases loans have been denied.


This legislation will address those concerns.


It will protect cultural objects on loan by limiting the circumstances in which ownership or physical possession, custody or control of the objects can be affected while they are in Australia.


Objects will be protected if they are imported into Australia for temporary public exhibition under arrangements involving an institution approved by the Minister.


This scheme does not abrogate cultural institutions from the need to undertake rigorous due diligence and provenance research.


On the contrary, in order to be approved, institutions will be required to demonstrate that they have the necessary expertise, rigour, capacity and resources to meet the demands established by the scheme, including exercising appropriate due diligence.


The inclusion of these requirements supports Australia's continued ability to meet its international obligations under the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property.


The Bill only limits the legal action that can be taken while objects are in Australia on loan. It does not affect the ability of a potential claimant to take legal action in the jurisdiction where the object is usually held.


To encourage the loan of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander objects to Australia, the Bill will apply to most of those objects held in foreign collections.


This will provide opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to re-connect with their culture and facilitate further engagement and relationships between overseas institutions and Indigenous communities. It will also enable all Australians to engage with and be invigorated by our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage.


However, in recognition that some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander material is particularly sensitive and culturally important, the Bill will not apply to significant Australian heritage objects that are identified as Class A objects under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander material in that category includes human remains, bark and log coffins, secret sacred ritual material, rock art and dendroglyphs (carved trees).


This legislation is also consistent with the Australian Government's commitment to facilitating the unconditional repatriation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ancestral remains and secret sacred objects to their communities of origin.


Consultation is an important element of the scheme and requirements will be included in the regulations. There will be specific consultation requirements for proposed loans of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander material to enable Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and groups to be actively involved in discussions about proposed loans before objects come to Australia.


Further transparency will be built into the scheme through regulations requiring the publication of information on objects proposed for loan prior to their importation. This is an important mechanism to assist persons who may be seeking to locate objects they believe were unlawfully taken.


The introduction of this legislation will align Australia with an emerging international standard of providing protection for cultural objects on loan from overseas.


It will reassure foreign lenders that Australia is a secure destination for loans and enable our great cultural institutions to successfully compete for world class exhibitions.


Broad consultation, including many submissions in response to a 2011 discussion paper, demonstrate strong support for Commonwealth legislation on this issue.


This support extends from the collections sector to state and territory cultural ministers and to the tourism and hospitality sectors. It reflects an acknowledgment of the direct benefits that major international exhibitions deliver to the Australian economy.


I would like to acknowledge the role of former Director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales Ed Capon in bringing the issue to the attention of state, territory and Federal governments at the August meeting of Cultural Ministers last year. I also acknowledge the effective collaboration of museums and galleries and state governments with Federal agencies which has led to a solution.


Many of Australia's leading museums and galleries are planning ambitious future exhibition programs. This bill will provide vital support to those activities.


Governments must invest in the arts. A vibrant arts sector delivers a social dividend of creativity, communication, respect, inclusion and teamwork – values this nation cherishes.


There is also an economic dividend. The evidence shows that creative nations are productive and resilient nations.


This bill directly supports the future of international cultural exhibitions. It will benefit our cultural institutions, our economy and ensure Australians continue to have access to the world's riches of art and culture.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-02-07,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:31):  I move Nationals amendment (3) on sheet 7336:


Schedule 1, item 2, page 7 (line 26), at the end of paragraph 86AD(2)(b), add "", but only if such purchases achieve neutral or beneficial socio‑economic outcomes"".


This is about reinforcing the coalition's strong belief in the buyback cap. The buyback cap, as we have always stated, should be at 1,500 gigalitres. Buyback is distinctly different to the gains made from infrastructure or environmental works and measures. There is currently only about 250 gigalitres to purchase to get to that 1,500-gigalitre cap. Most of it has already been purchased. 


We note that the real economic problems that happen always happen by reason of people buying the water licences out of areas. We have walked down the path of being good citizens in trying to bring about an environmental outcome but we are not going to do it at the expense of the communities of people who live in the area. You can see today with the discussions of the development of the north, trying to make sure we get a northern development area, we do not want to do that and then all of a sudden forget about the south. We have a widely developed irrigation area in the Murray-Darling Basin. The actual purchase of raw water licences, general buyback, causes immense economic hardship. We want to make sure that we limit that and that the efficiencies, the delivery back to the system, come from environmental works and measures in such things as deeper ring tanks, use of laterals, use of trickle, more efficient delivery of water. That is where the gains are made—from weirs that give us the capacity to make water more of an environmental asset with less water because we do not have to wait for a spill event; we can actually create a weir that allows a spill event with the use of far less water. These are the things that we believe are important. I think it is absolutely prescient that the public clearly understand that the coalition's policy is the cap at 1,500 gigs. Most of that has already been purchased. We only have about 249 gigs to go.

Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (12:42):  I would like to move item (5) on sheet 7336. I move:


(5) Schedule 1, item 2, page 10 (after line 35), after paragraph 86AI(2)(c), insert:


   (ca) for all water recovery for which an amount was debited from the Water for the Environment Special Account during the report year for the purposes of paragraph 86AD(2)(b)—how that recovery achieved a neutral or beneficial socio‑economic outcome;


We do not intend to divide on this. We want to make sure that the amount is recovered—an environment special account during the report year for the purposes of paragraph 8682—and that they report back to us as to how this recovery was neutral. We have talked about socioeconomic and environmental neutrality. We need to know and the Australian people need to know how the government is doing this. At this point in time it is case of taking them on trust, and taking people on trust is a very dangerous proposition.


The purpose of this amendment is to make sure that the Water for the Environment Special Account is achieved in the form that has been promised by the government—and by us—that there will be a socioeconomic neutrality for environmental outcomes. If we do not have this oversight, we have a strong belief that we are not going to get it and there will not be the delivery of the outcome back to the towns in such a way that does not decimate the towns. 


We have got bureaucrats running round the joint cooling the planet. We have over 1,000 people in the climate change department. Let's see if we can give people a job that really matters: making sure that we do not destroy the economic base of places like Shepparton, Mildura, St George, Bourke—the places where we live.

 (Victoria) (12:59):  Senator Farrell, I apologise; I am seriously not trying to pin you down. When I read the bill I saw clause 86AG, which gave a schedule of yearly payments of varying amounts over time from 2014 to 2024. When I look at that I assume—maybe naively—that some work has been done to come up with those figures. I am not trying to pin you down; it was my assumption that we have put some money there and done some thinking behind how we are going to spend that. But I understand what you are saying; there are parties—little ps and big Ps, going back to our discussion yesterday—to this discussion which have to have input into the process, the basin states being a key group. So when I ask for a time frame it is because we want to know and our communities want to know so that the uncertainty that both the government and the coalition are keen to see ending in Murray-Darling Basin communities will not be strengthened. I do not want an actual date; just a month, a quarter or even a semester would be good.


How long, roughly, is the constraint study going to take? I do not want a start date. I do not want an end date. Is it six months, is it a year, is it 18 months? How much have we allowed to gather the information we need in order to start the constraint-removal work that we want to do so we can start getting some environmental to those assets, as the plan sets out?


When do we think that the on-farm efficiency grants might happen? I do not think I am out of line in thinking that if we have allocated money along a timeline we might have thought about the next level down in the budget process. I would like you, Senator Farrell, if you can, to give me a loose time frame around that. I would be very appreciative, as would the constituents who have come to see me on a regular basis on this issue. I was at the Mildura public meeting years ago for the first draft. This has been a long process, and there are a lot of people who would like some rough guidelines.


My understanding is the way in which these programs are going to be rolled out will be different to the way in which past programs have been rolled out. Do you have any commentary around the likelihood of producers and irrigators in taking up these programs? Are they going to be as fully subscribed in the same manner as previous programs have been?

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (13:03):  I thank Senator McKenzie for her question. You talk about wanting some certainty for these communities; the best way to get some certainty for these communities is to finish the debate on this legislation and vote in favour of it. Then we can get on with the job of restoring the health of the Murray-Darling River.


In terms of the constraints management strategies and the time lines, they are specifically referred to in the Basin Plan. If you like I can read those out for you:


(1) Within 12 months after the commencement of the Basin Plan, the Authority must prepare a constraints management strategy that:


(a) identifies and describes the physical, operational and management constraints that are affecting, or have the potential to affect, environmental water delivery; and


(b) assists all jurisdictions to participate in constraint measures in order to allow environmental water to be used to maximum effect and to maximise the benefits of any increase in held environmental water; and


(c) evaluates options, opportunities and risks to water users, communities and the environment, associated with addressing key constraints, including through constraint measures that are relevant to measures that might be notified under section 7.12; and


(d) assesses the impacts of modifications of constraints on environmental water delivery and third parties, as well as downstream impacts, and assesses options to address those impacts; and


(e) identifies mechanisms by which impacts on third parties can be addressed.


Of course, this is all in the current Murray-Darling Basin Plan.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (13:06):  It is a competitive process, and I am not sure that we can say whether the price will be higher or lower. I do not know that we can necessarily predict that at the moment. Just from the knowledge I have of the process, there are so many other factors that come into the price you might get for the sale of water that I think it would be difficult to make a prediction as to what the price will be in future by comparison to what has occurred in the past. Obviously, at the height of the drought, the prices were very high and they have certainly come down. But I am not sure we can predict at this stage exactly what will happen in the future.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (13:07):  Are you able to inform the Senate of moneys allocated, whether the $50 million mentioned or any other moneys, for communities in northern Victoria which have had land or water buybacks by the government? We currently have some farmers who have sold their land and water to the government and others have chosen to retain their land and water and now find themselves in a position where their adjacent neighbours have sold their properties and water rights, and properties across the road from them have been sold. These farmers have now been told that the channel that feeds the properties where they want to stay will be shut down. Has any money been allocated so that these people will still be able to access water, or will they be left high and dry, so to speak?

It is an issue that potentially affects all of the basin communities. The particular program—again, I am not particularly familiar with the circumstances in Victoria—in South Australia is probably a state-based program, as are many such programs. It may very well be that the program you are referring to is a state-based one, but I will get some more information for you and try and respond to you.

One of the farmers I mentioned has been told, 'If you want to access your water, you're going to have to pay $800,000 to have it piped down the road from the main channel.' What do you say to people like that who wish to remain on their land and wish to retain their water? These people have been left high and dry to date. I acknowledge what you said about certainty, but these people have no certainty even though they have made a decision to remain on their properties. Their families currently are in limbo and have been for some time.

Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (13:10):  The answer to Senator Madigan's question is that undoubtedly there have been lots of problems in Murray-Darling Basin communities. The one you have identified is one that probably replicates itself in many other parts of the Murray-Darling Basin. It is not simply a northern Victorian problem, it is a problem in the Riverland and other parts of the Murray-Darling Basin. 


The whole point of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is to restore certainty to these communities, to provide some support for these communities and to restore the environmental health of the Murray-Darling. It is the government's intention that by passing this legislation we will achieve that. That is what we want to do: we want to bring prosperity back to these Murray-Darling Basin communities, we want to restore the health of the river, and the way we see that being done is by the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which we have done. By adding to that this piece of legislation, which has been agreed by the affected federal and state governments, we will bring about those achievements. That is our aim: to sort out these sorts of problems. I cannot say it will solve every single problem of every single community in the Murray-Darling Basin, but I can say that this is absolutely the best plan that we can come up with to set about the task of restoring the prosperity and the health of the river. That is what we are aiming to do with this legislation.

Senator MADIGAN
 (Victoria) (13:12):  We all know what the objective supposedly is, but the problem for these people is the devil is in the detail. I acknowledge what you said about the state governments buying land and water rights, but the people just want to know what the physical plan is and how you are going to go about achieving it. I had many calls yesterday and last night about our discussions in the chamber, but people are none the wiser and are even more confused than they were. They are becoming more and more confused by the day. They just want to know: what is the actual plan? What is the actual coordination? And how are we going to achieve these things in a tangible way?

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (13:14):  by leave—I move amendments on sheet 7314, Nos (8), (9) and (25) together:


(8) Schedule 1, item 2, page 8 (after line 5), after subsection 86AD(2), insert:


   (2A) In debiting amounts for the purposes of making payments in relation to projects mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) or (c), priority is to be given to:


      (a) projects that will produce the maximum guaranteed increase in the volume of Basin water resources that are available for environmental use within the shortest time; and


      (b) projects that demonstrably take into account the most recent scientific knowledge in relation to ground water and climate change; and


      (c) projects that demonstrably enhance the environmental outcomes referred to in the objects to this Part.


(9) Schedule 1, item 2, page 9 (after line 9), at the end of section 86AF, add:


(3) The terms and conditions must include a requirement that the financial assistance granted will be used for a purpose that:


      (a) is consistent with achieving, by 31 December 2019, an increase of at least 450 gigalitres in the volume of the Basin water resources available for environmental use; and


      (b) will enhance the environmental outcomes referred to in the objects to this Part.


(25) Schedule 1, item 6, page 13 (line 4), omit ""subsection 86AF(2)"", substitute ""subsections 86AF(2) and (3)"".


This group of amendments goes directly to how the money can be spent and for what purpose. The Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 contains a long list of purposes for which the $1.7 billion in the special account may be spent. There are also various conditions on the spending included in the bill. These amendments as circulated add requirements to guarantee that any expenditure from this account will be spent in the best possible way to give the best value for money. This means that expenditure on the project is buying the most water with the greatest certainty for the least money—getting the best bang for our buck, so to speak.


The amendments take into account recent scientific knowledge in relation to groundwater and climate change. We do not know, as I have said many times in this chamber before, what the future will bring and what new science might soon have to tell us about how we can be using our water resources more wisely. These amendments prioritise and reward new projects that reflect the most up-to-date knowledge and science on these important issues. We know that overallocation and falling into bad habits caused this entire environmental crisis in the first place. We need to make sure we are acting more wisely and smarter and that we are saving taxpayers' money along the way.


We cannot afford to see an amount such as this, almost $2 billion, simply frittered away because we are not using it in the smartest and most efficient manner. It does make sense at a time when we know all sides of the chamber are continuing to talk about the amount of money that is in the budget to pay for services. We do not want to see money unnecessarily spent on things just because we did not specify in the legislation that we are trying to get the best value for money for the environment and for the taxpayer.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2013-02-07,"



Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (13:18):  I understand, from speaking to the officials, that this money will not be used to, shall I say, subsidise estate purchases. But, in the Nimmie-Caira instance, which is a complete fraud on the public purse, there is a proposition, which was agreed to before the licences were issued—and they were issued with no environmental plan—to pay for the licences before they were issued 2¼ times the value of the water in those licences, which will enable them to acquire the land. How do we know that value? Given that this is in this agreement in this bill, how do we know that this money will not be just blown buying land? That is acquiring a flood plain and, because there is a constriction from the Maude weir to Balranald, when there is just above a supplementary flow the water must go down that flood plain. It has been agreed with the minister's office that they are going to buy this flood plain. This is a complete fraud because when the river is constricted between Balranald and Maude the water is going to go down that flood plain and the only way to get it down there without going over the flood plain will be to shepherd it somehow through the flood plain. And if you then shepherd it through the flood plain, you will turn that flood plain into a desert of blow away grass and poverty bush. Given that this actually authorises the acquisition of that sort, which is to buy the land, which in this case has been covered by the bureaucrats and the filling of the water-buyback book of 370 gigalitres gross and 175 gigalitres net average annual calculated flow, calculated without any measurement, how do we know that under this agreement to which this parliament is about to agree that this money will be spent in the best way possible? That is the vaguest proposition I have ever seen in water management. I agree with you, Minister, that the management of the water, under all governments and for all time, has been buggered up. It started with allowing the trading of supplementary licences in the Murray-Darling Basin. How do we know that this will be used? It says here:


… entering agreements to acquire an interest in, or in relation to, land (including easements)—


In the case of the Nimmie-Caira thing, they are actually going to acquire the fences, the gates, the windmills—and there is no likely proposition that that water will get back into the Murrumbidgee. How vague do you have to be to get political cover to get you past the next election? This is an agreement to buy land.

That is currently a proposal under consideration, so I am not sure that it is relevant to these proceedings.

One of the greatest criticisms of the Australian National Audit Office was the acquisition from Twynam Pastoral Company without a tender process—which my good friend Mary Harwood and I had a disagreement over, but I won—and they acquired $230 million worth of water. Part of the deal with Twynam, because they were trying to fill the buyback bill, was, 'You buy this water, but you can't have that water unless you take this water.' In other words, it was some sort of political blackmail. What I want you to agree to is that under this—

 (Victoria) (13:25):  My question to the mover of this amendment went to my understanding of the amendments before us right now. Clause 9 goes to the timing and clause 8 goes to the making of payments, so I was simply seeking clarification from the Greens around that. I do have some questions on constraint removal, which I understand could be projects under this bill, and I will put all of my questions on the table and hope that somebody answers them: will South Australia's and New South Wales's decreases in funding for the shared Murray-Darling Basin programs have any effect on the programs—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  Senator McKenzie, sorry to interrupt you: I am just seeking clarification that these questions are in relation to the amendments currently put forward.




Senator McKENZIE:
  They are. They go to constraint removal, which could be a project identified to get more water down the river. Do you see flooding liability issues as being a non-physical constraint in increasing river flows? Rivers' operators or state authorities hold the ultimate responsibility and liability for adverse flooding impacts—and it is a particular issue for the upper catchment in Victoria, which is why I am asking these questions—on private property. The state authorities and river operators might act in an ultraconservative way in releasing the environmental water because they are liable. I am seeking solutions or for someone to categorically state who is responsible—because I have asked these questions in estimates and I have asked them during the inquiry and I am still not clear—for the unintended flooding of private property as a result of environmental flow releases from dams. Would the Commonwealth consider indemnifying the states from flooding liability caused by the delivery of the environmental watering plans? I would really appreciate some clarity around that. I am not trying to be difficult; I have asked these questions before and I would seek a response, please.


I do apologise. I note that the government will not be responding to those questions, which could equally apply to the bill itself—and my understanding is that the overall question before us today is actually that the bill be agreed to—but I would seek that the Greens, given that they are talking about how the money in the special account will be spent, actually give the upper catchment landholders in Victoria an understanding of who they think is legally responsible for any flooding events that may be caused on their properties as a result of releasing water for environmental flows.

86AK


Audit of Water Special Account



(1) Pursuant to the powers under Part 3, the National Water Commission must audit the Water for the Environment Special Account as soon as practicable after 30 June in each financial year from the date of establishment of the account.


(2) The audit must report on:


   (a) the quantity of environmental water that was delivered to each project that receives payments under this Act; and


   (b) the value to the community of any payments made under paragraph 86AD(2)(c)(ii).


These amendments are the last of the Australian Greens amendments to this legislation. They go specifically to auditing of the account. They are to make sure, of course, that the Australian community gets value for money within this special account. It is almost $2 billion and we need to make sure we spend it in the best possible way. It cannot just simply be left to chance as to whether or not, as the years progress, this money is actually delivering the water that we are setting out to achieve.


We do not want to find ourselves in 2019 or, God forbid, 2024 suddenly realising that the well is dry and the water has not been returned but that it is all too late because we have spent the money from the special account. It needs to be carefully audited every year so that everybody, from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to the scientists to members in this chamber and our local communities and constituents, knows exactly how much water has been purchased or returned so far and how much money remains in the account. Every time the Commonwealth Water Holder buys water at an inflated price through expensive means, such as some of the more expensive on-farm infrastructure grants, we know less money is available to buy the water that is outstanding.


We are seeking to amend the bill to ensure that the National Water Commission will properly, rigorously, audit the special account after every financial year to make sure that the $1.77 billion is being spent wisely and productively. This is an appropriate role for the National Water Commission. It enhances its current oversight role and the list of tasks it has to achieve. It is true that this bill as it stands has some inbuilt review mechanisms including a requirement for annual reporting to parliament and two ad hoc reviews. These reviews have their place, but they are very limited in their scope and timing. They will work in parallel with the audits under the Water Commission, as proposed by these amendments, so that the community can be confident of knowing exactly where this money is going and what they are getting for every dollar.


The Greens amendments will make sure that whenever the department is required to table the annual report before parliament it has to state clearly whether the volume of water secured, project by project, was bought in the most cost-effective way. We know that we have examples of porkbarrelling in this area already—Senator Heffernan has spoken about this many times during this debate over the last three days. We need to make sure we put as many safeguards as possible in this legislation to ensure that Australian taxpayer money is not simply frittered away because this chamber cannot be bothered ensuring that we put some proper rules and regulations in place.

  Could you give us the detail of how many extra gigalitres of groundwater extraction we allocated in the last plan? Was it 1,700 or 2,700? I think it was 2,700 gigs. If we spend some of this $450 million between Narrandera and Leeton where the main channel to the MIA goes through some sandy country, and we actually fix that up, and given that we have allocated an extra 2,700 gigs of groundwater extraction in various aquifers around the state, what calculations have been made on improving the infrastructure against the increasing allocation of groundwater when a lot of the infrastructure you improve will actually take water away from the aquifers which you have allocated extra water to because of the connection between the two?

Senator Heffernan has raised a couple of questions. One was in relation to the link between groundwater and other parts of the water system and he has now raised a further question. I think it is fair to say those questions are not directly relevant to this particular bill.




Senator Heffernan:
  It's in the bill.




Senator FARRELL:
  We do not view it as being directly relevant to this particular bill, but I will ask the department to get a response to you on the issues you have raised.

Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (13:36):  Thank you, Minister. Just to make sure you understand that it is relevant, in part (v) it says, 'entering agreements to acquire an interest in, or in relation to, land (including easements)' et cetera. These issues are very relevant to the way this money is spent. I am sure—I will bet you £1,000 to one peanut—that is the answer to the question I have asked, and that is: have we studied the likely implications against three things? They are: the minimum decline by 2050 of 3,500 gigs in run-off in the lower Murray-Darling Basin, the fact that the interconnectivity studies between the rivers and the aquifers are not complete, and that we have increased the allocation from the aquifers by 2,700 gigs and are increasing money to make more efficient some of the works to save waters for the environment but some of the water that we save would have ended up in the aquifer and been allocated to those extra licences. So there is a serious flaw in the thinking of this bill.

  I rise on a point of order. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his comment and let him know that the best way to be informed is to be told.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (13:46):  The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Procedure) Bill 2012 is the result of the recommendations and work of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It deals with a number of issues upon which I can say there is agreement between the opposition and the government arising from that committee and I believe there are issues which are agreed across the parliament.


Firstly, the bill deals with postal vote applications. The bill codifies the current practice in the Australian Electoral Commission by centralising the authority to deal with postal vote applications with the Electoral Commissioner. It makes the Electoral Commissioner responsible rather than the DROs. This, as we understand it, codifies current practice which is based on some legal advice that the commission received in the late 1990s. This did cause some concern for members of the coalition because, although the bill does give the commissioner the power to delegate, there is no obligation in the legislation for that delegation to be given to the DROs, which is what happens at the moment. The coalition firmly believes that the DROs should retain this particular role. The involvement of the DROs at the moment allows people to deal with postal vote applications in the way that we have become accustomed to. I should say that, while the bill does change the legal authority to the Australian Electoral Commissioner, he did give an undertaking, while appearing before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, that he would delegate his authority to the DROs so that at the coming election postal vote applications would be dealt with in precisely the same manner as they are now. So the coalition is accepting that undertaking of the Electoral Commissioner.


This bill also deals with increasing the amount of money to be paid as a deposit for nomination to the House of Representatives and the Senate. I understand that there will be some amendments to this particular proposal so I would like to explain the coalition's position. This is the first change in that amount in six years and it raises the amount for the House of Representatives from $500 to $1,000 and the amount for the Senate from $1,000 to $2,000. Of course any nomination fees from someone who receives more than four per cent of first-preference votes are returned, so that does actually protect the franchise and the ability of people to nominate.


One of the issues that has caused some concern for many members is the size of the Senate ballot paper. Under our law we cannot have multiple above-the-lines on a ballot paper. There must be a single black line with ticket votes above it and the candidates listed below it. This may sound a little bit odd but we have been informed that the New South Wales Senate ballot paper is now at the largest size that it is possible to print for the election and there is no capacity to print a larger ballot paper. That on its own is no reason to play with the rules about who can be candidates but it does indicate, when we look at the increasing number of groups that get a very, very small percentage of the vote, that there is an impact if we are running into a limit on how large the ballot paper can be. This in particular applies in New South Wales, the largest of the states, and their ballot paper because the size of the font on the ballot paper is now decreasing to the point where with any more candidates it could fall below eight point. To those listening, that would be smaller than newsprint in some cases. So there is in my view a legitimate interest in protecting the right of those who wish to nominate to nominate while gradually, and not by a significant amount, increasing the fee for the Senate to $2,000—given the importance of our elections for the Senate—and for the House of Representatives to $1,000 because of the much smaller electorate and the smaller costs involved. We do not believe that is unreasonable.


Similarly, the bill also deals with an increase in the number of people required for someone to be nominated who is not a grouped candidate individual. This number has increased from 50 to 100. There was agreement across the joint standing committee on this particular matter.


One issue that did take up some time of the joint standing committee was a proposal by the government in the draft bill to remove the term 'of unsound mind' as a form of disqualification for a voter. The committee—I believe unanimously at the time—agreed that, while there was some concern from some stakeholders about the term 'unsound mind' maybe not being as politically correct as it might have seemed 20 years ago, it did have a very firm foundation in legal meaning and there was no alternative that could be put in the act that would not potentially expand those disenfranchised from voting. So the coalition has strongly taken the view that the term 'of unsound mind' should stay because it has a definite meaning, it is a very narrow one and by keeping it there we would not inadvertently expose senior citizens, particularly those in care, to being removed from the electoral roll when perhaps they should not, particularly considering the law as it has stood. I am pleased to say that the government accepted that recommendation and the bill has been amended to reflect that, so the term 'of unsound mind' and the requirement for a certificate from a medical practitioner are retained and it makes that definition stay as narrow as I think we would all like it.


So that particular amendment has been incorporated and the coalition is pleased to support the other aspects of this bill as relatively noncontroversial, reflecting several years of work of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, so we strike a legitimate balance between participation, nomination, the burden placed on those who wish to nominate and also the practicalities of an election. I know there is some concern in the chamber over the increase in nomination fees and I know discussions have been had as to that. I am sure we will have more discussions on that when we move to the committee stage of this bill.

Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (13:52):  The Greens do have a number of concerns with the Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Procedure) Bill 2012. While from the title and at a first glance this legislation may appear to be just of a technical nature, we all need to be aware that it really goes to the heart of the democratic process. If you look at the history of democracy, you will see that democracy has been expanded to help ensure that everybody who is able to vote is also able to participate fully, and that clearly means also being able to stand for election.


The changes we have before us that increase the nomination fee and change the number of nominators for an unendorsed candidate do put in place severe limits. I realise that we need to ensure that we have manageable ballot papers. I come from New South Wales and I clearly understand that. The first election I ran in in 1999 was the giant tablecloth ballot paper election. That was when more than 80 parties ran for the upper house. In New South Wales we put a lot of effort into the standards to be put in place so that front parties, as some of them were, could not be just set up. When working on changes that raise the bar and put limits on how candidates participate, one needs to always be careful that they are not making it much harder for smaller parties and Independents to participate in our electoral process.


We have serious concerns that the proposed nomination fees and the number of nominators required to nominate as a candidate are undemocratic. Doubling the nomination fee to $1,000 for a House of Representatives candidate and $2,000 for a Senate candidate and increasing the number of nominators for an unendorsed candidate from 50 to 100 does create an additional barrier. People sitting here may think this is fair enough in that we will have a more manageable ballot paper and avoid having to reduce the font size, which is what the AEC said it would have to do if it became bigger. Reducing the font size would bring in a whole set of problems if people have difficulty reading the ballot paper.


If this chamber decides to push ahead with these changes it will create an equity issue. It makes the cost of running a full ticket in the Senate close to prohibitive for small players. That could be hard to imagine for many senators sitting here, but that is quite real. I can remember how tough it was for the Greens in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These are issues we need to consider very closely.


While we do need to get the appropriate balance, the Greens do not think we have struck that appropriate balance here. We will be moving that we retain the current levels with regard to payments and the number of nominators. We will certainly give serious consideration to the other amendments I understand others on the crossbench will be moving.


I again want to emphasise that this is not just a technical matter; it is about us getting it right and not just making it easy for established parties to be able to continue to run their group of candidates in every seat because they are able to afford it and can quickly get the number of nominators required. We need to ensure that in every election people who have a legitimate right to participate in our electoral process are readily able to do so.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (13:56):  The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Improving Electoral Procedure) Bill 2012 does contain practical measures to enhance Australia's electoral laws. The bill implements three recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the conduct of the 2010 election. The bill also makes a number of amendments related to recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and, as we have heard, includes some technical amendments to electoral laws.


The government routinely looks to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for comments, advice and scrutiny on electoral law reform. The provisions of this bill are consistent with that longstanding practice. The particular recommendations of the joint committee that are picked up in this bill are its recommendation 12 to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act to specifically allow for the automated issuing of postal votes by the AEC, recommendation 31 to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act to increase the sum to be deposited for nominating for election as a senator from $1,000 to $2,000, and recommendation 32 to amend the act to increase the sum to be deposited for nominating for election as a member of the House of Representatives from $500 to $1,000. The bill also makes amendments to increase the number of electors required to nominate a candidate for federal parliament as either a member of the House of Representatives or a senator. The bill will also result in some important machinery reforms to electoral law.


The amendments in schedule 1 of the bill will certainly simplify and improve administration of postal voting. The framework of our electoral system is built around Australians voting in person at their local polling booth on election day, with any other form of voting being the exception.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (15:02):  Mr President, I have further information in answer to a question asked by Senator Siewert earlier this week. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The answer read as follows—



RESPONSE: TRANSITIONS FROM PARENTING PAYMENT


I undertook to follow up some matters in response to a question from Senator Siewert on Tuesday in regard to parents moving from the parenting payment to Newstart and other payments.




Advice given to parents



Last year the Department created a team of 300 staff across the country to make contact with parents coming off Parenting Payment. This team has been provided with comprehensive training.


The Department has informed me that officers have not been advised to tell parents that their Schoolkids bonus could be used to compensate for a loss in income support payment.


Staff talked to each individual parent about their circumstances and entitlements. In doing this, parents would have been advised of all upcoming payments they were eligible for, such as the School Kids Bonus, and how this could assist parents with essential education expenditure.


The Department is still giving priority to engaging and supporting these parents progressively transitioning to Newstart under the new arrangements. This includes giving priority to setting the appointments for people to discuss their circumstances.




Use of Centrepay



500,000 customers use Centrepay every week across Australia.


When talking with parents coming off Parenting Payment, departmental staff discussed their Centrepay arrangements and made sure all existing Centrepay deductions continued or were amended as they transferred onto Newstart.


This included advice to parents that, if necessary, they should engage with those organisations receiving their deductions.


The Department also engaged directly with the third party organisations, such as housing authorities and utility providers, to ensure they were aware of the changes for this group.


If for any reason individuals have not had Centrepay settings continued, they should contact Centrelink immediately.


If the Senator has any specific cases that she would like my Department to follow up, I will arrange for them to do so.




Eligibility for Concession Cards



There are various rules relating to customer eligibility for concession cards.


There is no transition period for retaining concession card entitlements when a recipient moves from one payment to another.


Retention of card eligibility is primarily linked to people moving into employment from income support.


However, for Parenting Payment recipients, the Department has a new process that ensures that parents transitioning to Newstart can continue to use their card pending confirmation of their commencement on a new payment.

The department did not meet the deadline for receipt of answers to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee as many of the questions sought detailed information on a number of complex and sensitive issues.


Over the past seven hearings, since the supplementary estimates hearing in October 2010, there has been a significant increase in the number of questions on notice. For example, there were 647 questions taken on notice at the supplementary estimates hearing in October 2012; 510 questions on notice at the budget estimates hearing in May 2012; 509 questions at the additional estimates hearing in February 2012; 423 questions on notice at the supplementary estimates hearing in October 2011; 794 questions on notice at the budget estimates hearing in May 2011; 357 questions on notice at the additional budget estimates hearing in February 2011; and, finally, 445 questions on notice at the supplementary estimates hearing in October 2010. This compares with only 136 questions on notice being asked at the budget estimates hearing back in May 2010. Our best efforts are being sustained to respond to these questions.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (15:05):   I move:


That the Senate take note of the minister's explanation.


The explanation that the minister just gave is clearly one that the minister's office has on hand. This is not the first time I have had to stand in this place and ask the relevant representative minister why, yet again, both the minister and the department have failed to comply with an order of the Senate—that order being to provide answers to questions on notice asked at Senate estimates, by a relevant date. When Minister Ludwig was the representative minister, the exact same situation occurred: the minister and the department failed to provide answers to questions on notice within the stated timeframe and a very similar explanation was read out by Minister Ludwig. When Minister Kim Carr was the relevant representative minister, the same situation arose: the department and the minister failed to provide answers to questions on notice taken at Senate estimates hearings to the Senate within the required timeframe and, again, almost the identical answer was given in response to my seeking an explanation.


Lo and behold, today we again have the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship providing nothing more and nothing less than a series of excuses for what are either blatant policy failures by the government or, worse still, a complete failure by the department to discharge its responsibilities. I note that, in the minister's explanation, the minister outlined for the Senate the number of questions that had been placed on notice during the relevant Senate estimates period. The minister was making the point that there had been several hundred questions placed on notice at each Senate estimates hearing. I invite you to have a look at the portfolio that we are seeking the explanation from—the immigration and citizenship portfolio—and ask yourself, why? Why have the opposition and the Greens—a number of those questions were from the Greens—had to put questions on notice to the minister and to the department? There are two answers to that: the first is, the department at Senate estimates cannot or will not provide answers to the genuine questions that the opposition asks. They either do not know the answer or, quite frankly, they are too embarrassed to give the answers. The second answer is: as Senator Bernardi rightly pointed out, when you have such a gross failure in relation to a particular portfolio; when you have in excess of 30,000 people arriving by boat in less than five years under the current Labor government and the former Labor government, when you have a blowout in costs—not actual costs—tipping in excess of $6 billion, when under the former Howard government on a per annum basis this particular portfolio was costing the Australian taxpayer less than $85 million—not billion but million—it is little wonder that blind Freddy himself can work out why there has been an increase in the number of questions asked.


As of today, which I note is the final parliamentary sitting day before this particular portfolio's additional estimates hearing on Monday, there are currently 331 answers that have not been provided by the department. That is an indictment on either the minister or the department or both. We are expected to go into Senate estimates on Monday without the answers to those questions. The answers were due to be provided by 7 December 2012 and, as senators would be aware, that is not a date that is set by the opposition. It is not a date that the coalition plucks out of the air. That is the date that is set by the relevant Senate estimates committee, the numbers of which are controlled by the current government. Were any answers provided by this minister and his department by the relevant due date? Not even one. Not even one answer was provided by the department by the due date. In fact, the first answer was not received by senators until some four weeks later on 10 January 2013. The due date was 7 December 2012. The first answers were not received until 10 January 2013. 


Unfortunately for the Australian taxpayer, this is not the first time that I have had to stand here and ask the relevant minister for an explanation. Almost two years ago exactly, on 9 February 2011, I had to again stand in this place and ask the representative minister at that time why answers had not been provided to all 445 questions that had been placed on notice by senators of the immigration and citizenship portfolio following the Senate estimates hearing in October 2010.


There is a pattern of behaviour which is nothing more and nothing less than a pattern of failure under successive ministers—under the former minister, Minister Evans, under Minister Bowen and now under Minister O'Connor—not only for this portfolio but in the provision of answers to questions on notice that have been genuinely put on notice at Senate estimates hearings. I remind all senators, in particular Minister Bowen and now Minister O'Connor, that senators have a fundamental, constitutional right which they are entitled to exercise, and that is to ask questions at Senate estimates and to be given those answers in a timely fashion. Unfortunately, in relation to this portfolio, quite frankly, nothing surprises me anymore. I suppose we should be grateful that I have got but one answer from this particular minister.


The failure yet again to provide answers to questions on notice in a timely fashion or at all is an indictment on former minister Bowen. It is an indictment on the current minister, Minister O'Connor, who if he wanted to could today signal to his department that they, this afternoon, should provide the opposition and the Greens Party with the answers that they require so that we can go into Senate estimates on Monday properly informed.


Question agreed to.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:13):  I move:


That the Senate take note of answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.


On 13 November 1991 Mr Eddie Obeid gave his maiden speech in the New South Wales parliament and in that speech Mr Obeid thanked his many friends in the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party. Among the many friends that Mr Obeid thanked in the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party were one John Della Bosca, one Graham Richardson and one Bob Carr—now Senator Bob Carr, Australia's very disappointing foreign minister. As we have learned though in recent days, Mr Obeid's network of friendships extends far wider than the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. It extends down the generations because, as we have learned in recent days, so friendly is Mr Tony Burke, a senior member of the cabinet of Julia Gillard, with Mr Obeid that Mr Burke was afforded the hospitality of Mr Obeid's ski lodge by Mr Obeid. Lo and behold, we also learned that Senator Stephen Conroy, now the third most senior minister in the Commonwealth of Australia—chilling, isn't it, Senator Wong, to think that Senator Conroy is the third most senior minister in the Commonwealth of Australia—was also the beneficiary of Mr Obeid's hospitality.


We in the opposition do not assert any particular wrongdoing against Senator Conroy but there is a deeper question here and the deeper question goes to the networks of influence and patronage and mateship and favours which define the culture of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party and in particular the right faction of the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party, of which Mr Burke is a member, and its sister faction in Victoria, the Victorian Right, of which Senator Conroy is the leader and which faction holds in office this discredited Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard. That network of undue influence, favours, friendships and protection defines the culture of the Labor Party.


On occasions I have been known for some flights of rhetorical fantasy when it comes to the inequity of the Australian Labor Party, its culture of criminality and corruption but I could not do better than what its own federal vice-president Mr Tony Sheldon had to say in a speech which Mr Sheldon gave last weekend. Mr Sheldon said:


Our crisis—


speaking of the Labor Party—


is more than just a crisis of trust brought on by the corrupt behaviour of property scammers and lobbyists. It's a crisis of belief brought on by a lack of moral and political purpose.


Mr Sheldon went on to say that 'there must be no underestimating of the gravity of the crisis here and in New South Wales, no blame shifting and no dodging of the responsibility to set things right'. Very significantly, Mr Sheldon went on to say that what he had to say about the New South Wales Labor Right had 'strong relevance to every state branch and every faction in the country'. So this is not just a problem for New South Wales and it is not just a problem for the right wing of the Australian Labor Party. It is, according to their own federal vice-president, part of a culture endemic in every faction in every state across the Australian Labor Party. No wonder that people in each of the states have got wise and successively tossed the Labor Party from office in four states and no doubt will do the same in the Commonwealth this year.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:19):  I am delighted to be able to take note of answers given in a wide-ranging question time today by Minister Conroy. I note in doing so, that we know from what is going on in New South Wales at the moment that we would expect accountability to flow. We do not yet know what the outcomes will be from that but I am concerned and worried like anybody else. But what was contained in one question to Senator Conroy was in fact whether Senator Conroy and Mr Burke should have disclosed that they spent the weekend together. To be honest, I would like to ask if that is actually what the opposition is asking. Are we actually asking for disclosure as to when any in this chamber or in the other chamber go on holiday together, or perhaps should I say spend the night together under any other circumstance?




Senator Wong:
  I don't want to go there! I really don't want to go there!




Senator PRATT:
  I don't want to know either. So when they ask the question whether Senator Conroy and Mr Burke should have made a disclosure about the social time they spent together that weekend, I would challenge whether that is actually the standard that the opposition is looking for or one that they would like to uphold themselves.




Senator Bernardi:
  So disclosure on my spousal interest form!




Senator PRATT:
  Exactly. I know the appropriate accountability should be there in terms of disclosing what accommodation you use and where that has come from, and that has been done in this case. But as for the question to be asked whether Senator Conroy and Mr Burke should have disclosed that they were there together, please know I do not want that to be a new standard for parliament. Heavens above that we should have to all make such disclosures. I would be happy to myself, but I do not want to ask that of all my colleagues.


One of the other topics that was debated in this question time was the question of superannuation. Senator Cormann asked if the Labor government does think that those who can afford to put $25,000 a year into their superannuation are rich. Personally, I would not necessarily say that such people are rich but under some circumstances they may be and under other circumstances they may not be. Whether you have got $25,000 that you have the capacity to invest says nothing about the rest of your overall wealth and whether you are rich or not. But I do know that we in the Labor government have been focused on making sure we have good, progressive superannuation policies, which means we have been right to be focused on helping people on lower incomes make savings and contributions to their superannuation. That is exactly what we have been getting on and doing.


We also debated in question time electricity prices and how the carbon price has been passed through in increased electricity prices. You see in both of these questions the absolute shallowness of the opposition on this. If you remove the carbon price and if you remove the tax on mining, then things like the increase in superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent and the compensation that has been passed on to households for increased electricity prices will not exist anymore. They will be simply gone. There is a complete policy vacuum from the opposition on these questions.


Our ministers were asked by senators opposite about the impact of electricity price increases on the dairy industry. We have compensated households, in particular needy households, for any price increases that are passed on. It is expected that some sectors of the economy will have to pass on electricity price increases, but that is in very stark contrast to states like Western Australia where we have seen a 60 per cent increase in electricity prices.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:24):  I note Senator Pratt in her far-ranging contribution touched on what Senator Brandis suggested was endemic, systematic corruption in segments of the Labor Party in New South Wales. Senator Pratt said she was concerned and worried about what was going on in ICAC. Well, she should be worried and concerned. Senator Pratt has good knowledge of it because she hails from the great state that is the home of WA Inc., Brian Burke and Carmen Lawrence—all those luminaries she is so proud they have put into the political system. Well may Senator Pratt be worried about what other skeletons will turn up as this festering boil has been lanced in New South Wales and will spread across the country, as we are seeing with our declaration of interests.


I rise today in response to Senator Conroy's response and cavalier lack of concern about the diminishing confidence of business in my state of South Australia. The telltale sign that Senator Conroy gave not a jot nor a tittle about South Australia was the ponderous delivery of his response. It was so slow and static. It was difficult for him to talk about it because he has not got a clue. It is easy for those on this side to talk about small business because, unlike the one, two or maybe three on the other side who have actually employed someone from their own purse, members on this side of the chamber have employed people and depended on their successful businesses to pay their bills and their mortgages.


I myself struggled in small business under a Labor government. But never under the awful detrimental time of Paul Keating and the recession we had to have did I have to struggle quite as severely as businesses are doing under this government. It is the lack of certainty that is causing them distress and concern. It is the green tape, the red tape, the increased bureaucracy and the workplace employment laws that really provide a disincentive for business people to employ people. It is too hard. I can speak of dozens of business people who have said, 'I can't afford to put anyone else on because if it doesn't work this government is going to hunt me down.' They complain about the union coercion and the standover tactics. I could tell you about small business operators who have reduced their workforce because of the impact of unions on their workforce. These are innovative, technologically advanced industries that have been impeded because of the actions and the encouragement of this government.


The frustration for many of them is that they are expected to pay all their bills on time, make their budgets balance and provide secure employment for dozens, hundreds or in some cases families, yet this government does not expect to hold itself to the same account. If you cannot manage your budget, you cannot manage your business. If you cannot manage your budget, you cannot manage the economy. This government is incapable of managing the economy. It is incapable of empathising or understanding the genuine concerns of small business because it has no affinity for small business. Small business or business in general is simply an obstacle to be overcome, something to be raided to prop up the coffers and something to blame when things go wrong. Yet the small business men and women of this country are the engine room, the driving force, behind the growth here. Unfortunately, that engine has only two cylinders firing.


Every day that this government stays in power and every day the Treasurer, the finance minister and the Prime Minister mismanage the Australian budget, deceive businesses about what to expect and tinker with all of the things where businesses need certainty, is adding to the lack of force that is going to propel this economy forward. We should all be concerned about it because if we remove the government from the employment sector then small business is the thing that is driving this country. It is keeping families employed. It is the one thing that we need to do well because it is innovation, technology, the enthusiasm and the spirit of entrepreneurialism that will provide us with that springboard to future growth. It is not government borrowing; it is not government debt; it is not government spending—they are all mortgages on the future. We do not want to rob from the future. We want to live for today and build upon our great strengths.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2013-02-07,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (15:29):  I also rise today to contribute to answers provided by Senator Conroy in today's question time. What surprises me a little bit is where the opposition are going. They started the week claiming that they were going to be the alternative government, and they were going to step out of the dark as the opposition and all of a sudden become this alternative government. But not once have we heard anything from them during question time on policy. What we have heard today, and consistently throughout this week, is attacks on scurrilous claims against Senator Conroy about some involvement of a previous minister through the New South Wales government about some chalet he owned. There is nothing in it, yet they come along here with these scurrilous gutter-raking claims that there was something involved in that. 


I put it to the opposition to start acting like an alternative government. Do not come in here and produce this nonsense. Let us get over this fact about the carbon price. The carbon price does not even get a mention out there in voter land. Go out there and talk to people about it, like I do, and you will find that people do not even mention it, because it has no impact. It has not had any impact whatsoever. People are still buying their legs of lamb, and they are not having to pay $100 like the coalition indicated. A $100 leg of lamb—where do you really come from when you come up with those scare campaigns about the effects of the carbon price? No wonder people do not believe your leader when they are coming up with this sort of nonsense. Once again, come up with some policy. Today, have you heard the grandstand policy? The 'Tony troppo tax' and we are going to shift all the people out from South Australia, Victoria, Brisbane and New South Wales, and put them up in northern Australia: Karratha, Cairns, Townsville, up in Darwin. The 'Tony troppo tax'. This is your policy. When challenged today in question time by Senator Carr, you stepped back from it and said: 'No, that has got nothing to do with us. We never suggested that'. Unbelievable.


One of the other questions provided today was on superannuation. I stand proud, as a previous union official and a union secretary, of course, that we were part of a government—




Senator Boyce:
  You wouldn't be here if you hadn't been in the union.




Senator FURNER:
  That is irrelevant, Senator Boyce.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Ignore the interjections.




Senator FURNER:
  We know where you are going after this Senate, anyhow. As a union official, I was very proud to see the introduction of compulsory superannuation contributions, to see workers have an entitlement starting at three per cent, and now those low-income workers—and everyone in the workforce—are receiving nine per cent. Our program to lift that to 12 per cent is an excellent sign of where we as a Labor government see the need for investment, the need for creation of wealth and the need for people to be sustainable with some dignity when they retire. I think people should take note of the fact that the Labor government is the only government that has been the backbone of workers in this country to assist them through the life of their retirement. 


We know where the member for Warringah, Mr Tony Abbott, stands on this. He should really explain to the Australian people that he wants to increase taxes on superannuation for low-income earners by nearly $1 billion a year to fill that $70 billion black hole that has been created. It has certainly been announced by Mr Abbott on breakfast radio as well. Unfortunately, it is just another example of what we will be up for if we end up in a situation where we have a coalition government in this place. We see examples of that in Queensland—and I know Senator Boyce will support me here—where we are seeing over 14,000 public servants and ancillary staff sacked by a Liberal National Party government in Queensland.




Senator Boyce:
  How much did you cut out of the Queensland Health budget?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order on my left!




Senator FURNER:
  This is just another example of how they will treat public servants, trying to get them up in northern Australia. They do not take any consideration when it comes to workers in our country. They do not take into consideration any matters of importance like superannuation. We know where we stand for entitlements, we know where we stand for obligations and the rights of genuine working people in this country.

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2013-02-07,"



Senator BOYCE
 (Queensland) (15:34):  I also seek to take note of the remarks made by Senator Conroy following questions from the opposition. I must say that it is always a pleasure to follow Senator Furner in this chamber in terms of taking note. Firstly, I would like to point out to him that question time is actually not for the opposition to detail their policy to the government, it is for the government to be held accountable. I would also like to follow up briefly on his comment in relation to superannuation and about how he was a union secretary, of course. I think in that one brief little comment he has nailed one of the biggest problems we have with this government: of course he was a union secretary. Most of the government were union secretaries or presidents in their past life. Most of them have never worked in a business where their assets were on the line in their lives. They have not got a clue. And this goes on and on. 


I quite deliberately referred to Senator Conroy 's remarks rather than Senator Conroy's answers to questions put by opposition senators around superannuation and the small business situation, because they were not answers. Asked about the effect of the carbon tax on business, all Senator Conroy could do was rabbit on about household costs and what Treasury modelling about household costs had said. I would suggest that it is not the opposition that needs to get out and talk to people—we are already doing that. What we bring to this place is based on what they tell us. It is the government that is so bound up in its own little philosophies and ideologies that it is not getting out to talk to people.


As the shadow minister for small business, Mr Bruce Billson, has pointed out in a media release, small business does not need the current financial situation which has been set up by this government and its actions, or should I say, lack of actions. Business conditions were considerably weaker in the December quarter as the NAB survey points out, deteriorating to their lowest level since the June quarter 2009—the lowest they have been in three years. There has been a deterioration in mining conditions and yet all this government can do is try to pitch its survival on a mining tax which is apparently not raising anything.


In my home state of Queensland—and the home state of Senator Furner, where would you think he would have some idea of what was going on—conditions were very poor according to this NAB survey. Business confidence edged lower and remained lacklustre. The poor old Reserve Bank is trying to do what it can. Recent interest rate reductions have done little to alleviate business worries about the currently soft state of our economy. We have Senator Furner claiming that people are out there spending on legs of lamb and the like and yet the NAB quarterly survey points out that sales were the most constraining factor on output in the quarter. I quote:


… with almost two-thirds of firms reporting lack of sales and orders as their biggest constraint.


Their biggest constraint was the lack of orders and the lack of sales. Yet this government tries to find yet another way to attack small business.


We already have them needing to do their own administration on maternity leave. We have the BAS payments being required monthly, not quarterly. We have example after example of this government attacking and putting on small imposts that are incremental in their own right but come on top of the carbon tax. The price of diesel has gone up 2.5c per litre in the recent 12 months. The costs for business and the labour relations that this union dominated government has developed are all adding up to a disaster, including the superannuation cuts that they are now proposing.


Question agreed to.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:45):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the ministerial statement on Closing the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.


Leave granted. 




Senator SIEWERT:
  In beginning to address this particular issue, I would like to table the Shadow Report 2013: On Australian governments' progress towardsclosing the gap in life expectancy between Indigenousand non-Indigenous Australians. It has been circulated to all members of the reps.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted.




Senator SIEWERT:
  I have also tabled the shadow report in responding to this statement for the last number of years, so I appreciate the opportunity to table it again It is very important that we see the opinions of organisations that are working outside of the government on whether we are closing the gap or not. I would first like to comment on the Prime Minister's Closing the Gap statement, some of the issues that were addressed in it and what was left off. It was very disappointing that the Closing the Gap statement did not address the very significant issues and the very high rates of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders in this country. It was completely fascinating that that issue was not addressed—I will come back to this issue particularly—nor was the issue of the National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes. The funding for this program runs out in 2013. While I acknowledge that there is currently work being done on the Indigenous health plan, I know that it is one of the issues that comes up in the shadow report,whose most prominent recommendation is that that issue needs to be addressed. But that was not addressed in the Closing the Gap statement. I would have thought that, given the importance of closing the gap, given the importance of this statement, that issue would have been addressed in the Prime Minister's statement.


One of the other issues that is touched on in the statement but does not lead to a sense of security in terms of the impact that this particular program is having is addressing the enrolment of children in preschool and in school. While the numbers of kids that go through the door and then enrol are counted, we are still not getting a measure of what impact that is having. What are the genuine progress indicators, and what are the genuine outcomes that are coming out of that program while the government fails to address issues such as hearing loss and the impact of otitis media on the these children? You can get the children into the classroom; but, unless they are addressing those issues and enabling those children to catch up because of the impact of the hearing loss, we are not going to get the significant benefits from that program.


The other things that the Prime Minister conveniently did not address were the issues around income management. Since this place rose at the end of last year, we have had two reports that are very significant when we are talking about the impacts of income management. Of course, income management was continued under the Stronger Futures program and it has also been continued under separate legislation. The evaluation of the new income management, which was released at the end of last year, said:


The report shows that there is no measureable and clear evidence of any positive impact of income management. Those who do support the scheme tend to do so because of benefits such as fee-free banking, similar benefits they receive through voluntary income management or Centrepay arrangements.


A small number perceived that it increased their ability to purchase food, but there was no reduction in the extent to which they report running out of food. Furthermore, the evaluation says, 'Although there have been some strong perceptions of wellbeing of children in the community, such perceptions do not necessarily line up with objective data.' It says, 'There is little evidence to date that income management is resulting in widespread behavioural change either with respect to building an ability to effectively manage money or to building socially responsible behaviour.' It says, 'Indigenous people in NTER areas felt significantly more discriminated against than those in the contrast group; for many there is a strong sense of having been treated unfairly and being disempowered.' So here is a report, after five years of income management in various guises, saying, 'Sorry, there is no effective evidence.' Then a report came out just last week from the ANAO on the administration of income management in the Northern Territory. Firstly, it says the cost per person per year in remote areas is $6,600-$7,900. I tell you what: there are many people that have said to me that they can think of better ways of spending that money to the better advantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That is a lot of money for a program that there is no evidence works. Is it any surprise that the Prime Minister does not address those issues in the Closing the Gap report? Here is one massively expensive program—over $410.5 million over the next six years is budgeted for this program. Is it any wonder that the Prime Minister does not mention in her Closing the Gap speech when it does not work and that nearly half a billion dollars could be spent on much better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders?


I would like to come to the shadow report, which looks at the progress of these indicators. The key highlighted recommendation that Close the Gap campaign steering committee calls for is that the National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous health outcomes be renewed to ensure policy and program continuity past 2013 with funding maintained at least the same as allocated in 2012-13 when adjusted for inflation. That is absolutely critical. They also call for a systemic national approach to social determinations and, very importantly, Closing the Gap and related programs to be quarantined from budget cuts across all federal, state and territory jurisdictions. And they are very concerned about the reported recent cuts. Of course, the federal government did cut funding to Aboriginal programs in order to pay for Stronger Futures. So we are seeing Aboriginal programs—some of the leadership programs and other programs—that have been cut because of Stronger Futures.


In the shadow report under 'Progress against the COAG Closing the Gap Targets' there are comments about meeting the early childhood targets. They say:


While in absolute terms the overall trend is to increasing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander longevity, the capacity of these gains to close the gap remains an issue.


If current trends continue, under-five Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mortality rates may fall within the range of the COAG Target to halve the gap in under-five mortality by 2018. However the relative lack of progress in recent years and the widening differential on the critical factor of low birth weight cause concern.


Other areas that remain a concern include the level of investment in ongoing health programs. Again, that is why they are calling so much for a commitment by government now to funding the ongoing health program. They say:


When the significantly greater need for health services resulting from poorer health status is factored in (the Campaign Steering Committee estimates this is at least double as a general rule) the relative lack of total funding available for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health is evident.


Of course, this issue was not addressed in the government's Closing the Gap statement.


The government need to be looking at what they are investing in and what programs they are currently taking up to address closing the gap, because their current programs are misguided. The government refuse to really deal with the significant policy measures that are needed. And today we had the government coming out and saying that they were going to get tough on the licensees in Alice Springs. That is great; they have needed to do that for a very long time. They have had the Stronger Futures legislation for eight months, and they are only now starting to look at whether they can use it—when, clearly, they could use that program. That was put in place, supposedly, to do that.


The government still refuse to look at some of the key issues that communities are calling for—that is, a minimum floor price; looking at takeaway-free days in the Northern Territory and Alice Springs; and looking at reducing the number of licences that exist. These policy measures have been consistently called for by the community and this government have refused to do anything about them. Rather, they continue with flawed programs for which there is absolutely no evidence base. How many more reports do they need to show that income management does not work?

Senator SCULLION
 (Northern Territory—Deputy Leader of The Nationals) (15:55):  I also rise to take note of the ministerial statement on closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and the Prime Minister's report of 2013. I would like to commend the Prime Minister and the government. I think this is a very important document, and every year that goes past it is a more important document because it provides us with trend lines so that we can, with some confidence, know whether or not we are actually going to meet the targets in 2030. That obviously allows us to provide some priorities in where we put our resources in this area.


I would like to go through some of the indicators—though not in the order provided in the Closing the gap report. The first is life expectancy and the second is infant mortality. The reason that I mention those two first is that I think there has been quite a deal of success in those areas. I do not think anyone has any doubt that life expectancy—certainly in the Northern Territory jurisdiction—is going up, and there are no issues that are going turn it to trend down again. So, in effect, we are above trend line. There are no issues around that that I think are going to stop us meeting that benchmark. The second is infant mortality. That is a little bit more problematic in the return on the data. Whilst that is on track, it is not quite above trend. From the experts I speak to, I think we could all reasonably say that they are two indicators that we are not going to have to worry about, though that does not mean that we should take our eye off the ball. We are actually going to meet those targets. They are the only two that are really on track.


One of the other indicators is access to preschool. We have, as is declared in this report, met that target. It is a target that is probably one of the easiest ones, because it is not a social target. It is normally a bricks-and-mortar target. We know it is about putting resources aside for staffing, buildings and processes. Australia has a right to be very pleased that the vast majority of Indigenous people now have access to a preschool. But, of course, access is not the only thing. It is very important but, as the Prime Minister mentioned in her ministerial statement, we need to go from access to attendance.


Given that the target regarding access to preschool has in effect been met, I think it would be quite reasonable—given that this is a guiding document that informs Australians and will both inform and guide future parliaments about where we place our resources—in future documents to deal with the issues around attendance in these preschools. Instead of just ticking off, 'Yes, we have got a line item and we have built them and we are happy now,' we should think about having an additional one to deal with how those preschools are going. I will leave it to the experts to find benchmarks that would give us an indication of the success or otherwise around attendance.


The next indicator is the 16- to 24-year-olds with year 12 or equivalent. This is a sad reality, and it really irks me, because without attaining year 12 or equivalent, it really makes it hard to take up what we normally say are opportunities—for example, the opportunity to see the world and travel. For that you need to have funds and to have funds you need to get a good job and you need to be very competitive. We have had a two per cent increase in five years. We are not on track. We are not going to make it. We really need to put a lot of thought—not more resources but a lot of thought—into that. It is not only about a two per cent increase in five years. Just over 50 per cent of the Aboriginal population actually gets a year 12 leaving certificate—against 86 per cent for everyone else. It is hard to see the other side. Eighty-six per cent of mainstream people expect to receive the Higher School Certificate and go on to have a whole range of choices. They expect to get automatic entry to vocational education, entry matriculation and a choice of professional life. But only 50 per cent of Aboriginal people are going to get that.


The last of the indicators is the employment indicator. There have been minor improvements, but I think everybody would acknowledge that this is not even close to being on track. We are not going to make the target. There is no question about that, and there has to be significant change. These things interact. If we do not get an increase in the number of Aboriginal people completing year 12, we are certainly not going to get an increase in the employment area. These things are all interlinked, and it is very important that we work on those two areas.


We have come out with a book, and I commend the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. We all talk glowingly about this and we all need to feel good about ourselves. To be frank, there are two indicators that are generally going to look after themselves. One is a building program; we finished that. That leaves only two indicators, but we are not going anywhere on them. We are not going to hit the target. We are not going to close the gap. I think that a lot of intellectual horsepower is going to have to go into it. It is not just about more money; we need to start thinking of innovative ways in which we can make changes in these very, very important areas.


Of course, there are some complementary reports that can give us an idea about how well our first Australians are progressing in these areas. Certainly from the perspective of Northern Australia, the NAPLAN results are downright depressing. There are many areas that just say, 'We have done school and we can't read and write.' I am even more saddened by the fact that a child can manage to get to the end of primary school before someone says, 'No, you can't read and write.' There is a systemic failure through the education system in some areas, and that has to be rectified as soon as possible.


It is very good to have this data, and it becomes more valuable and more practical over time. It does help us manage what we do. But I have a concern that the headline figures may well obscure something that is happening on the ground. For example, in year 12 acceleration. Yes, we crept forward two per cent; I suspect it is probably more than that in metropolitan areas, and I suspect it is going back rapidly in very remote areas. I think, in terms of a suggested improvement in how we may look at these matters, we need to disaggregate the data so that we are better able to target our resources where they need to be deployed and where the effort really needs to be targeted.


If you look closely at this data and you take away those things that we are going to achieve, those last two indicators where we are simply not closing the gap, where we are not going to get there, are just fundamental to closing the gap on opportunity, and it is a real shame that that is not the case. I certainly look forward to seeing the 2014 data and I hope it is a substantive improvement.


I have to say that I was a little disappointed in the Prime Minister's attempt—in the middle of all of this, and it is all quite a respectable process—to take a cheap shot at Queensland and the Northern Territory about alcohol. We have those debates; they are robust debates, and they should be. But I saw it as a pretty cheap shot in order to impress people in some of the more populated areas around our south-east, in a political sense, rather than trying to provide this as something that has some gravitas and some independence and to try to keep the politics out of it. I was a little sad that the Prime Minister was not a little bit better informed with respect to her references to the banned drinkers register and the Northern Territory. There is quite a large body of data that I have seen and validated, that indicates that issues such as one person who was on the banned drinkers register has been arrested 117 times—each one of them when they were drunk—and the fact that 60 people on the register have been arrested over 2,000 times. At the end of the day, the motivation of the register was to stop people getting access to alcohol. Clearly it did not work at all. Everybody accepts that. So there has to be a better way.


Those people who are trapped in the system—they are sick. You cannot treat them in the justice system. You have to take them from the justice system and you have to rehabilitate them in the health system. That is what is happening in the Northern Territory. I commend the Closing the gap: Prime Minister's report 2013 to the House.


Question agreed to.

 (Victoria—Minister for Human Services) (16:13):  I present four government responses to committee reports as listed on today's Order of Business. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The documents read as follows—





Australian Government response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report:





Statutory Oversight of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission—August 2011





February 2013





Recommendation 1



The committee recommends that ASIC amend its website to include an explanation of the meaning and significance of holding an Australian financial services licence. The information could also be usefully included on the MoneySmart website.




Government response



The Government supportsthis recommendation.


An Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence is an important safeguard in ensuring consumers and investors are afforded due protections under the Corporations Act 2001. The Government broadly supports any measures that would increase consumer or investor understanding of the meaning and significance in holding an AFS license.


The Government notes that ASIC has updated its MoneySmart website to include additional information on the meaning and significance of holding an AFS licence. This material, available at www.moneysmart.gov.au, states that an AFS Licence is:



– A licence given by ASIC that allows people or companies to legally carry on a financial services business, including selling, advising or dealing in financial products. You should only deal with licensed businesses as you are better protected if things go wrong and you will have access to free dispute resolution services. ASIC grants a licence if a business shows it can meet basic standards such as training, compliance, insurance and dispute resolution. The business is responsible for maintaining these standards. A licence does not mean that ASIC endorses the company, financial product or advice or that you cannot incur a loss from the investment.


This information is also supported by additional information and tools regarding AFS licenses, available at www.moneysmart.gov.au. ASIC has also updated its primary website to contain similar information: http://www.asic.gov.au/afslicensing.


The Government commends ASIC's decision to adopt the Committee's recommendation, and also its continued approach to consumer and investor education.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Government Response to Report</title>,COMMITTEES,26,2
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2013-02-07,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (16:17):  I move the motion standing in Senator Fifield's name:


That the Senate notes the failure of the Gillard Government to live within its means or to develop a coherent fiscal strategy.


The Labor Party in government does not know how to manage money. They manifestly do not know how to live within their means. In their first four budgets they spent $172 billion more than they raised in revenue, and of course this year was supposed to be the year—the first time since 1989 that a Labor government was going to deliver a surplus budget. But sure enough, in the shadow of Christmas, while the Treasurer was hoping that Australians were distracted and starting to focus on some Christmas cheer and end-of-year celebrations, he snuck out there and gave a press conference, and finally fessed up to what everyone across Australia already knew: that this government would not be delivering a surplus in 2012-13 either.


This Labor government does not know how to manage money. This Labor government does not know how to live within its means. This is a government that spends too much, which is why they are always casting around for more cash, which is why they are always looking for more new Labor Party taxes, which is why we are, yet again, talking about increased taxes on people's superannuation savings.


The government will say, 'Well, we've got very difficult circumstances.' And, yes, there was a global financial crisis. However, you have to look at our circumstances here in Australia. Firstly, the Labor government in 2007 inherited a very strong budget position: no government net debt; $70 billion worth of Commonwealth net assets; a $20 billion surplus. And of course we are here, in the Asia-Pacific—a very strongly growing part of the world. Australia, in the first four years of this Labor government benefited from the best terms of trade in 140 years, and if you look at other resource based economies around the world, they have all been delivering surplus budgets, and they are all in a much stronger fiscal position than Australia under the administration of both the Rudd and Gillard governments.


Not only did they inherit a strong budget position, with no government debt, a $20 billion surplus and $70 billion worth of Commonwealth net assets; not only did they benefit from the best terms of trade in 140 years, because we are a resource based economy and because we are in the Asia-Pacific right at the heart of the rapidly-growing part of the world; they also imposed 27 new or increased Labor Party taxes—27 new or increased Labor Party taxes, so far.


You would remember, Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, that last week the Prime Minister gave a speech to the National Press Club and in her speech there was no coherent economic strategy on how to grow Australia's economy more strongly—nothing! There were only two things in the Prime Minister's speech: an election date of 14 September, and an assertion that somehow the Australian people are not paying enough tax. It was a clear threat, because of course the problem that the Prime Minister has, and the problem that the Treasurer has, is that not only has Labor spent $172 billion more than they have raised in revenue in their first four years, they have already made $120 billion in unfunded election commitments.


So here we have it: we have a government that has spent too much. We have a government that is always desperate for more cash—always casting around for another tax grab. Yet it is still not enough. They still have not been able to balance the books, and they have made so many additional promises that they need more cash. So here we have the Prime Minister letting the cat out of the bag at the same time as she is announcing the election date. In the next budget, the Prime Minister says, there will be some tough decisions—some tough decisions, the Prime Minister says! We, of course, know that 'tough decisions' from a Labor Prime Minister like Ms Gillard is code for more Labor taxes.


Over the last two or three weeks, spin doctors out of the Treasurer's office and out of Mr Shorten's office have been busily backgrounding the press gallery trying to make the case that somehow there ought to be increased taxes on people's superannuation savings. That is not quite the way they put it. The way the Labor Party put it when they want come up with a new tax is that they essentially go out there and try to demonise a group of Australians that they are about to hit with a new tax. Usually the words they use are, 'There are some rich people out there that are taking advantage of some perks that they do not deserve.' That is their modus operandi. Remember we had the luxury car tax in their first budget, and the Treasurer went out and said: 'This is a tax on the rich. This is a tax on Australia's Maserati drivers. This is a tax on Australia's Ferrari drivers. Don't you worry, aspirational middle class; this will not be a tax that you will have to pay.' But guess what! Over the last four years, who has paid most of the revenue that came from those increased luxury car taxes?




Senator Fifield:
  Who?




Senator CORMANN:
  It is families across Australia buying a new family station wagon or the like, because this government might have a political strategy to demonise the supposedly rich—because that is what they want to do for their political purposes—but, when it comes down to it, their tax increases invariably hurt low- and middle-income earners. And so it is now with superannuation. People out of Mr Shorten's office and the Treasurer's office have been out there busily trying to make the case that there are all these rich Australians who are taking advantage—quasi-avoiding tax, quasi-dodging tax—of tax concessions that are available to those Australians who are doing the right thing by saving to achieve a self-funded retirement.


That is what we have had. Of course, the first thing the government were looking at—and spin doctors out at Mr Shorten's office and the Treasurer's office were quite up-front about it as they were backgrounding off the record—was taxing super payment for over-60s if those payments were taken as a lump sum in the range of $800,000 to $1 million. The Prime Minister was shamed into ruling that out, because she could see that the outcry across Australia from people who have been doing the right thing was so significant. Even Labor people—even people like former Senator Nick Sherry, a highly reputable contributor to the superannuation policy debate over a very long time—started to attack this government for the tax grabs that they were considering, and the Prime Minister was shamed into ruling that particular tax grab out. But that will not stop them from going down the list of all of their other increased tax options that they are currently considering. They are looking at taking more money away from super savers by fiddling with the transition to retirement arrangements. They are looking at lowering concessional contribution caps even further. 


A Labor government that looks at doing these sorts of things to Australians doing the right thing by saving for their own retirement should at least be across the facts. Today I asked the leader of the Labor Party in the Senate—the Prime Minister's representative in the Senate, the Leader of the Government in the Senate—whether he was aware how much tax people saving for their retirement pay on any contribution to superannuation above $25,000 a year—and you know what? The minister did not know; Senator Conroy did not know. You would think that a government that was considering whacking on another tax would at least know the facts, because when we talk about concessional contribution caps—when we talk about the 15 per cent tax rate that applies to those Australians who make contributions of up to $25,000 a year—that is not a perk. People that are saving $25,000 are not rich people. That 15 per cent tax rate is an incentive to encourage people to save more now, to lock their money away for 20, 30 or 40 years until they retire so that it is available for them in retirement, along with the earnings on those funds invested.


The government has already reduced those concessional contribution caps from $50,000 and $100,000 down to $25,000 because it is desperate for more cash. It wanted people who were saving more voluntarily to superannuation to pay more tax. That is what this is all about. It wants Australians saving for their retirement to pay the price for its wasteful spending because it cannot balance the books, because it cannot live within its means, because it has had $172 billion of accumulated deficits and because it has already got $120 billion in additional unfunded spending commitments—it has to go after savers across Australia and put its hands into their pockets and try to get some more out of it. There is this $1.34 trillion pot of money. There are $1.34 trillion worth of super savings invested in superannuation and the Labor Party thinks, 'We want a bigger share of it.' Why? Because this Labor Party in government does not know how to manage money, because it does not know how to live within its means and because it has failed to develop a coherent fiscal strategy.


But there is more. Not only has this Labor government considered imposing a tax on super payments for the over-60s, not only is it looking at taking more money away from super savers by fiddling with the transition to retirement arrangements, not only is it looking at lowering the concessional contribution caps even further; I put it to you that the government right now is looking at scrapping the government superannuation co-contribution for low-income earners completely. Even though the Labor Party promised before the 2007 election that they would make no change to superannuation, over the last five years the Treasurer, Mr Swan, has cut government super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners by more than $3.3 billion—and if anyone is interested in the detail, I have a printout here listing all the measures in budget after budget, in Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook after Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. I repeat, this Labor government has cut government super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners by more than $3.3 billion—so far. And I have absolutely no doubt that people in Mr Shorten's office and people in the Treasurer's office are looking at this yet again to make further cuts.


The other thing that I am led to believe Mr Shorten and the Treasurer are looking at is to lower the threshold from which the increased 30 per cent contributions tax would apply. That is the measure that was in the last budget, when the government said they would impose a 30 per cent tax on contributions for anyone earning more than $300,000. By the way, that was supposed to come into effect on 1 July 2012. We have not seen any legislation yet because the government is too incompetent even to process their tax grabs through this parliament. Do you know why? Because they have not found a way yet to sort out the implications for politicians and public servants. They are embarrassed that they are imposing one rule on Australians out there while living with another rule for themselves. They are quite quick at imposing additional taxes and cutting benefits for low-income earners, for the middle class. They are not quite as quick when it comes to imposing additional hardship on themselves.


The other thing I am absolutely convinced about is that, whatever Labor say before the election, after the next election a re-elected Labor government would scrap the low-income super tax offset because Labor cannot afford it. Whatever their rhetoric before an election, they do the opposite, every time, after the election. Remember this promise in 2007: 'We won't make any change to superannuation'? In successive budgets the Treasurer cut concessional contribution caps, pushing up the tax that people who save more have to pay. They cut the super co-contribution benefits for low-income earners by more than $3 billion. In total, they have imposed more than $8 billion in additional taxes on those Australians doing the right thing by saving for their retirement—Australians doing the right thing by trying to get themselves into a position where they can look after their own retirement needs rather than being a burden on the public purse. We know that there is more to come because all of those tax grabs in the past were not enough.


The reason Labor will have to scrap the low-income super tax offset if re-elected is because they have attached it to the minerals resource rent tax—and what a fiasco that was. Only a Labor Treasurer can come up with a complex new tax targeting an important industry for our nation which hardly raises any revenue at all. In fact, only the Labor Party can come up with a complex new tax targeting an important industry for Australia which leaves the budget worse off. Right now, the government has spent more on administering the minerals resource rent tax than what the tax has raised in revenue. It is just a complete joke, a complete fiasco. Yes Minister gave us the hospital without patients. Slim Dusty gave us the pub with no beer. And Mr Swan gave us the shrinking, secret, mining tax with no revenue. How incompetent do you have to be? No wonder this government cannot live within its means. No wonder this government is all over the place when it comes to its fiscal and economic strategy.


The mining tax is a complex, distorting, highly inefficient, costly to administer, costly to comply with tax which hardly raises any revenue at all. The government have already spent all of the money they thought it would raise, and more. And guess what? Everyone in the Labor Party is so embarrassed about what a mess Mr Swan has made of the mining tax that they are scrambling around wanting to cover up the costly consequences of his incompetence. He came up with a complex new tax, the ATO is spending more than $50 million to administer it so far and the smaller miners are spending more than $20 million complying with it so far to prove that they actually do not have to pay it. It has raised hardly any revenue at all, certainly no meaningful revenue, and the three biggest miners who signed the deal with the government have not paid any mining tax at all. 


Clearly, everyone from the Prime Minister down in the Labor Party is severely embarrassed. So what do they do when people ask: how much revenue have you raised? They duck for cover. Do you know what they tell us? They say: 'We're not allowed to know how much it is because it is secret. If we told you how much revenue this tax had raised, somebody would have to go to jail.' That is the advice that was tabled by the government earlier today. If somebody from the ATO told the Treasurer how much his failed mining tax had raised, that tax officer would have to go to jail. How ridiculous is that? A government that comes up with a new tax, makes predictions on how much it is going to raise and spends all the money they think it is going to raise should be accountable for whether or not it has raised what they predicted it would at budget time. That is basic common sense. That is basic accountability of the executive government to the parliament—but not for this government. They say, 'You're not entitled to this, this is secret.'


I say again: this is a government that has made a complete mess of things from the Prime Minister down, but I would say the weak link in particular is the Treasurer. It was the Treasurer that stuffed up the initial mining tax. It was the Treasurer that stuffed up the second version of the mining tax. I have to say if I was Mr Rudd I would be rather upset because it was Mr Swan who made a mess of the mining tax and it was Mr Rudd who got the sack. It was Mr Swan who stuffed up the mining tax and, while Mr Rudd got the sack, he got a promotion. This government has made a complete mess of things. This Treasurer has made a complete mess of our budget, he has made a complete mess of the mining tax, and if he had any decency he would resign.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2013-02-07,"



Senator MARK BISHOP
 (Western Australia) (16:37):  What a great pleasure. What a joy to be asked to participate in this debate. What a great pleasure it is to stand here and reflect upon the record of this government in terms of economic management and fiscal rectitude over the last five years. I cannot believe I was so fortunate as to be contacted by the Whip's office and asked to make a contribution. It is almost delight on a stick to be able to reflect upon the solid work and the great set of achievements seriatim, which I will refer to in due course, of this government and by this government for the last five years.


Before I go to my remarks, speaking in the context of delight upon a stick, let us refer to the motion at the outset before the chair, which says: 'The failure of the Gillard government to live within its means or to develop a coherent fiscal strategy.' For those in the public gallery, this is not a new motion. Senator Fifield, sitting over there on the front benches of the opposition, brings this motion to the chamber about every 18 months and, indeed, Senator Fifield brought it last September. So we have had five quarters of economic statistics since the last time Senator Fifield brought an almost identical motion to the chair. Do you know what, Madam Acting Deputy President? On every set of economic statistics, every indicator in the last five quarters, whether it be inflation, interest rates, employment growth, unemployment levels or overall growth, the set of statistics for last five quarters are better, and better than they were when Senator Fifield brought the motion before us last September. We are happy to have a re-run of this debate. We are very happy—in fact, we are delighted to run up the attack flag and, one by one, rebut the assertions outlined by Senator Cormann and the other assertions undoubtedly to be put forward by other contributors from the opposition.


At the outset, the government says, 'We are proud of our economic record, proud of our economic achievements and proud of all the key economic indicators that are published every quarter or every six months in this country.' I do not say that with any sense or sentiment of arrogance or hubris. I simply say it with quiet, contemplative pride. We say that a whole set of economic indicators and standard reflections are a reflection themselves of the government's sound fiscal strategy, restrained government spending and discipline in achieving taxation aggregates measuring no more than 23½ per cent of GDP over the life of this government. We say in terms of those sound economic indicators that we are proud.


Madam Acting Deputy President, I hear you think out loud, 'What are those key economic indicators that Senator Bishop is referring to?' Let me go through them one by one, and I will do it slowly for all the slow learners in the opposition. One by one we will go through each of those indicators. Let us look at the growth rate, the unemployment figures and the inflation outcomes. Let us look in detail at current interest rates for homes, families and business, and, more importantly, let us look at the investment figures, actual and proposed, of a capital nature into businesses in this country. Let us say, right at the outset, that that set of indicators can lead to only one conclusion, and that is an impressive record of outperformance in economic management by this government, by this Treasurer and by this fiscal team.


What are the indicators? What do the figures independently show? What are the objective figures released by Treasury and the Reserve Bank? What are the figures referred to every week and every fortnight in the press? Firstly, it is growth. Our economy grew solidly in the September quarter—half a per cent—with growth around trend for the last 12 months of 3.1 per cent. No mean achievement. Three per cent growth every year means rising living standards. Compare that with the United States, Western Europe and most of the rest of the world. 3.1 per cent growth.


The second key economic indicator statistic to look at are levels of inflation. It is simple to say inflation remains well contained at 2.2 per cent for the calendar year to December 2012—minuscule, in the scheme of things, with the trend line down, continuum down, no suggestion of an upbeat and no suggestion of an increase. A remarkable achievement, and something we are proud to have achieved, proud to reflect upon and proud to yell out from the rooftops


What is the third indicator that has some bearing in this debate by which you can make an objective assessment of the performance of the economy and how well or otherwise it has been administered by this government? It is the most important thing to every working Australian, to every person who has employment, to every member of every family who has a job and to businesses that employ hundreds of thousands and millions of Australians. What is the unemployment rate in this country? It remains low at 5.4 per cent. It must be said it is one of the lowest in the industrialised world at 5.4 per cent. It is the lowest in all of the OECD countries, better than all of Western Europe's, better than all of Central Europe's, better than that for all parts of the United States—5.4 per cent and going down, a remarkable achievement that so many Australians have been in work, continue in work and will continue in work going forward. So 5.4 per cent is a wonderful outcome and a great statistic.


So a 5.4 per cent unemployment rate is good now but it can be improved as we go forward. So what do we think is going to happen as we go forward? We know the answer to that. If we look at the capital investment figures, actual and projected, we see there is a direct link between growth in capital investment into new enterprise and infrastructure with consequent growth in employment across the board.


So what do we have in terms of committed, actual and projected investment going into this country over the forward 12 months? What we have again is another stunning figure, another wonderful outcome. We have a huge pipeline of investment of $270 billion in resources which will provide a huge boost to export income and to earnings for years and years and years. I could not remember a more upbeat report on the consequences of that huge pipeline of investment than was given to us at the last two rounds of Senate economics estimates when the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Secretary of the Treasury in turn were asked to reflect upon the level of investment, the changing nature of that investment and the consequences. They were asked those questions not by me as chair or by government senators; they were asked those questions by a series of opposition senators, including, I think from memory, Senator Cormann. What those two highly respected officials said was this: that the nature of investment is changing, that it has gone from being finance led with the building of plants and mines and roads and ports and the like, and that we are now going to the most important stage as to all those ports, roads, mines, dams and all of the other stuff—all throughout Western Australia, Queensland, parts of New South Wales, South Australia and the NT—as we are shifting from the preparatory stage to the production stage. So heaps of mines are built, heaps of roads are built, heaps of railways are built, heaps of ships are there waiting to be loaded and we go into production—and when you go into production you increase your labour, you increase your output, you increase your income and companies increase their earnings. They said, believe it or not, that growth in production is going to continue for the next eight to 15 years—in evidence. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank said it. It is almost a perfect circle: massive investment, useful infrastructure, mines and the like coming into production, massive exports, a huge increase in earnings to companies, a huge increase in income to government. It is all coming about on the watch of this government and under sound fiscal administration and under the implementation of sound economic policy by this government.


That is fine for business and for those people who are employed, and that is fine for those who might be greatly benefiting from receiving high wages in those sorts of areas. But because we have been so disciplined in our spending and because we have borrowed so little and because we are achieving surplus budgets over time, what has occurred with that? The cost of money has gone down. Interest rates are going down. Interest rates are currently around three per cent, the lowest they have been in this country since 1996. Over the last two years they have come down and down and down and some reputable forecasters suggest they might even go down by another half a per cent this year, down to 2½ per cent. Now there ain't too many parts of the world where you can borrow money over time—five, 10 or 15 years—at 2½ or 2¾ or three per cent.


What does that mean to business? It means they know that there is a sound economy properly administered and well run with disciplined spending by government. But for individuals and families it means that for every one per cent reduction in the interest rate—from six to five to four to three—on a $300,000 loan there is a $150 a month saving in outgoings. So over the last four or five years interest rates have come down from a little bit over six per cent to a little bit over three per cent. Three per cent turns into something like $150 to $200 a month in savings.


Now $600 or $800 cash in a worker's pocket every month, month in and month out, is a consequence of low interest rates, and those interest rates are a direct reflection of careful levels of spending by this government. So business has profited and done well and is investing, workers are getting lots and lots of work and more employment and high wages, and families have much more disposable income—hundreds and hundreds of dollars every month—to do with as they wish, because the interest rates on their home loans and their car loans and the like have gone down, keep going down and remain down. As I said, it is a wonderful set of statistics to argue, a wonderful set of statistics to put forward and something everyone—every person—on this side is proud of in a quite contemplative manner because we have set out to do our job and we have done our job.


So what is the net of that stunning list of statistics? What does the rest of the world say about those matters I have just referred to and put on the public record? Let me provide a very brief quote from the OECD. It says:


With 21 years of uninterrupted growth Australia stands out amongst OECD countries.


So there we have the results. Unlike most of the rest of the developed world, we have solid growth, we have low unemployment, we have contained inflation, we have low interest rates and, most importantly, we have record investment, actual and committed, going forward. That it is a pretty solid quintet of achievements. Let me repeat the quintet of achievements again: solid growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, low interest rates and record investment. That builds upon this government's impressive record of our performance during the worst global conditions since the Great Depression. Not since the 1930s, which is now 80 to 90 years ago, has the world faced such dire economic circumstances. When you speak to the myriad officials from the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and parts of Asia you meet when you are overseas or when they come to this country from time to time you hear how impressed they are about the administration of the economy in this country.


That quintet of achievements—solid growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, low interest rates and record investment—builds upon our impressive performance record during the worst global conditions since the Great Depression. What does 'building upon our impressive performance record' mean? Let us look briefly at the United States, Western Europe, the United Kingdom, a range of Mediterranean countries and others in Europe. The facts are pretty well known. Debt is at levels that are barely manageable, and they are having great difficulty in servicing that debt. It is up around 150 per cent or 200 per cent of annualised GDP. Budgets still have not been brought into balance. Countries are still borrowing, not as heavily as they were, long term at unacceptable levels. Average unemployment across Europe is 11.7 per cent. The last figure I saw for unemployment in the United States was 8.7 per cent. So in Europe it is over 11 per cent and in the United States it is over eight per cent. Compare that to the results in Australia. For the last few years unemployment has been around five per cent. That is a remarkable achievement.


The final indicator is the forward investment figures into business in Europe, which without exception across the board are trending down. Business does not have the confidence to borrow. Business does not have the confidence to invest. Government demands are too great. As a consequence, the 11 per cent unemployment figure for Europe and the eight per cent figure for the United States are unlikely to shift in a meaningful way for at least the next three to five years. Compare that to the administration of the economy in this country. The government's budget papers published in May this year will show unemployment contained at around five per cent to 5½ per cent. There may be a little bit of drift either way, but it will not be six, eight, 10 or 11 per cent—it will not be going the wrong way, as is the case in Europe and perhaps in the United States.


Let me go through the consequences of that sound administration of the economy. What does it mean when you put it all together? It means that, unlike the rest of the developed world, we have avoided recession and we have saved hundreds of thousands of jobs in this country. Our economy has grown by 13 per cent since the Labor Party came to power back in 2007. It is 13 per cent larger than it was. There has been 13 per cent growth over a period of four or five years. Other developed economies are still clawing back lost output. We did not lose any output. We have not lost any output. Our economy keeps growing and we keep employing people. Thirteen per cent growth, with an average of a little over three per cent each year, is a wonderful achievement. More than 800,000 jobs have been created since Labor came to power whilst in the United States, Europe and parts of Asia something like 28 million people have been displaced and thrown on the scrap heap of unemployment. We did not do that. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2013-02-07,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (16:57):  One of the great joys of serving in this chamber is to be present for a contribution by Senator Mark Bishop. I must confess to being a little fond of Senator Bishop. His contributions are always marked by a degree of charm. I particularly enjoyed today because Senator Bishop was very much in character. He was very much role-playing a senator who is a supporter of Prime Minister Gillard. He was very much role-playing someone who accepts and believes Treasurer Swan's economic narrative. I have difficulty believing that Senator Bishop does accept the Treasurer's economic narrative because Senator Bishop is a very intelligent person. He is nobody's fool. Given my fondness for him, I have to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was merely in character here today.


I did mention in a preface to a question to Senator Wong yesterday that I did work as a senior adviser to the former Australian Treasurer, the last one to deliver a surplus. The sole point of me mentioning that was that Mr Costello was the last Treasurer to deliver a budget surplus. I do not say that to claim to have a significant role in the creation of those surpluses. I was a mere adviser. But the point is that I was in the very fortunate and privileged position to be a witness to history and to the hard work of Treasurer Costello as he sought to pay down Labor's $96 billion debt, as he worked hard to bring the budget back into balance. One of the things about Mr Costello is that it looks to those outside as though it was a fairly effortless exercise to repay that amount of debt, to bring the budget back into balance. So effortless did people think that it was that the Labor Party came to assume that budgets just automatically and necessarily would find themselves in surplus. They thought that managing the economy was something that was straightforward and easy to do, that did not require tough decisions. I think we have seen—and the nation has learnt the hard way—that running an economy is actually difficult. It requires sound judgement and it requires tough decisions. 


Like you, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, I recall seeing Mr Rudd in those television ads before the 2007 election say, 'I am often accused of being a fiscal conservative, but it is a badge that I wear with pride.' We laughed and we smiled at this. Essentially, what Mr Rudd was trying to do was to say to the nation, 'I am a slightly younger and funkier version of John Howard.' These are relative concepts, I grant you. Mr Rudd went further—I think we recall it was a campaign style launch speech— and, of the then Howard government, he said, 'this reckless spending must end'. I will leave you to draw the conclusion or the comparison between the spending of the Howard and Costello government, and that of the Rudd, Gillard, Swan government. There is a dramatic difference.


I will come directly to the motion that I have put here, and that is that the Senate notes the failure of the Gillard government to live within its means, or to develop a coherent fiscal strategy. Senator Bishop said that this is a motion that I frequently put forward, and he is exactly right—it is, because it is no less true today than it was last year, the year before, the year before that, and the year before that. It is proving to be fairly timeless under this particular administration. The problem is that this government has never had a fiscal strategy, let alone an economic strategy. All it has ever had is a political strategy. We first saw that come into stark relief in the wake of the global financial crisis. You will recall before that, Mr Swan's first budget in which—this is one of my favourite budget speeches, Treasurer Swan's first one—he declared, 'We are budgeting for a surplus of $21.7 billion in 2008-09, 1.8 per cent of GDP, the largest budget surplus as a share of GDP in nearly a decade.' Mr Swan was saying in this budget speech that basically Peter Costello was one of the easy beats: 'You thought what you delivered were surpluses, wait till you get a look at my surplus: $21.7 billion and 1.8 per cent of GDP.' Well, it did not happen, because the global financial crisis came along, and that has been the excuse that the Labor Party has used for each and every one of their budgets: 08-09, 09-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13 and no doubt for 13-14 as well.


The Australian Labor Party would want us to believe is that what saved Australia from recession, what saved the nation from suffering a similar fate to that of other developed advanced economies, was their $10 billion fiscal stimulus, and then their $42 billion fiscal stimulus—which had a few well-known elements like school halls and pink batts. That is a contention I completely reject. The reason why the Australian economy continued to grow, the reason why we did not suffer the fate of the US, the UK and other European nations, was because we had a different starting point—we were completely debt free. But the other reasons why we came through that period well was that we had a floating exchange rate, we had the demand from China, monetary policy—the Reserve Bank cutting interest rates—and Australia had the world's best credential arrangements courtesy of Mr Costello. That is why we came through that period well.


I think the Australian Labor Party—certainly at least some of them and possibly Senator Bishop himself—actually understand that. Of course, they cannot admit it as they have got to be in character and play their role in this place. But a number of Labor senators and Labor colleagues in the other place actually do understand that. We only need to look at the Asian financial crisis to prove the point. The Asian financial crisis happened under the watch of Mr Howard and Mr Costello, and Australia continued to perform well in the absence of economic stimulus, in the absence of fiscal stimulus. You would have thought that if there was an economic challenge that would have seen Australia go into recession, it would be one that affected our region, where our trading partners were in recession. Despite that, we continued to grow. The global financial crisis—yes, it was dramatic; yes, it was severe; yes, it was profound—was fundamentally based in the United States and Europe, not our key trading partners. So if you can survive a significant external economic challenge in your own region, when your own trading partners are in recession, without economic stimulus, you should be able to survive a profound economic challenge that comes from the United States and from the Europe. We know that the policy settings were appropriate to ensure that happened. I will go through them again because I think it is worth doing. Australia had no net government debt. We had the floating exchange rate. We had the demand from China. Monetary policy was doing its job and we had the world's best prudential arrangements. Comparing those two scenarios bears out the point.


I think the reason the Australian Labor Party put in place the $42 billion stimulus package and the $10 billion stimulus package was because they wanted to be seen to be doing something. Being seen to be doing something was far more important than actually doing the right thing. Under that cover of being seen to do something, the Labor Party had the opportunity to indulge a number of pet projects but also to indulge themselves in spending that they thought would be of political benefit. That was a huge indulgence which the nation will be paying for over a long, long time.


There are a few fiscal myths that the Labor Party have sought to perpetrate in an effort to convince the nation that they do indeed have a fiscal strategy rather than a political strategy. The first of those myths was that they had a plan to get the budget back into surplus in the 2012-13 financial year that we are in. That represents the second budget speech that Mr Swan presented where he forecast a surplus. There were promises on 500 occasions that there would be a budget surplus in 2012-13. The Prime Minister herself accounts for 150 of those occasions. She went so far as to say on 4 July last year:


We saved jobs, we stayed out of recession and got back to surplus.


That did not happen, it was not true. It is not going to be true.


Mr Swan, the Treasurer, said on 18 August last year:


Well, we're getting back to surplus in three years. Come hell or high water.


There was no qualification there. There was no fine print. It was, come hell or high water, he would get the budget back into surplus. He is not going to. Having former Prime Minister Bob Hawke in the other place this week prompted a number of people to recall that the last time there was a Labor surplus was when Mr Hawke was the Prime Minister, which is a little while ago now. That was in the 1989-90 financial year. We  are not going to have a budget surplus.


The second fiscal myth which is put forward as the cover for that is revenue write-downs. We have heard a lot about revenue write-downs since the Labor Party have been in office. When the government say there have been revenue write-downs, the impression that they want to leave with the public is the year-on-year revenues have declined as a result of circumstances beyond our control: falling company tax and turmoil in the global economy, which is affecting the profitability of companies who pay tax. That is the impression that the government seek to leave, that there has been a reduction in revenue year-on-year. That is simply not the case. Just look at the period from when the current government came into office. This government is estimated to be collecting $70 billion more this financial year than in the last year of the Howard-Costello government. This year alone Labor forecast a jump in revenue of $37 billion from 2011-12.


Although the prediction of the revenue to come in has been reduced, the fact is that year-on-year revenues are still increasing and have been increasing. In that situation, the only explanation as to why the budget will not come into surplus as forecast is because spending has gone up at a greater rate than revenue. This government is spending more than it is bringing in. That is not the fault of declining revenue forecasts because, as I said, revenue is still increasing. That is the second great fiscal myth of this government.


Another great fiscal myth is that Labor have a lower tax-to-GDP ratio than the Howard government. That is true if you take a very narrow view of the total call on the taxpayer by the government. If you add non-tax revenue and debt that is borrowings, there is a very different picture. That ratio goes up to 25 per cent of GDP, rather than the 22.5 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 that the government are so fond of claiming.


The fourth fiscal myth is that Labor is a lower-spending government compared to the coalition. That is wrong. Labour is spending over $90 billion a year more now than the last budget of the Howard government. Myth five is something that I touched on a little earlier: Labor say that their record debt is low in comparison to other OECD countries, but the government do not compare the situation to that of like countries. They are very fond of comparing our situation to that of Japan, the US, the UK and Europe, who all had massive debts going into the global financial crisis. A much better comparison is with a number of developed commodity-exporting countries like Chile, Sweden, Finland and Norway, all of whom are in the black. The sixth fiscal myth is that Labor has identified over $250 billion worth of savings since coming to office. Close to 80 per cent of the $16.4 billion identified as 'saves' in the government's 2012 MYEFO were revenue measures.


The plain, simple truth is this government has never had a fiscal strategy; it has had a political strategy. Every spending decision and every so-called 'savings' decision, most of which are in the form of tax increases, has been taken and viewed through a political prism. Managing a budget is difficult; we all accept that. Running an economy is hard. You have to prioritise. You have to work out the difference between that which is necessary as opposed to that which is merely desirable. This government has not done that at any point in the last five years. It is going to take more than 10 years to pay off all of Labor's debt. I often use the rule of thumb that, for every year of bad government, you need three years of good government to undo the damage. I will let you do the maths as to how long that means the coalition would need to be in office.




Senator Mason:
  I think it is at least 15.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I think Senator Mason is right.


I cannot imagine what it would be like to be Mr Swan. The result of the next election is in the hands of the Australian people, but for the sake of argument let's say that there is a change of government. Imagine being Mr Swan going to job interviews where they ask him, 'What was your role?' and he responds, 'Well, I was responsible for running the finances of Australia.' Then they ask, 'How did you fare?' and he responds, 'Well, I actually didn't get the show into black in a single year that I was the Treasurer.' That is not a proud record; that is a disappointing record—being the Treasurer who never delivered a single budget surplus.


There does need to be a change of government. Only this side of the chamber has the discipline and the character to bring the budget back into balance and to pay down Labor's debt so that we do not squander future opportunities for the nation.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2013-02-07,"



Senator STEPHENS
 (New South Wales) (17:17):  I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate this afternoon, because Senator Fifield is actually quite right in what he has just said. Running an economy is very hard. Making budgetary decisions is very difficult. They do require responsible decision making; they do require discipline; they do require prioritising; they do require a sense of understanding the whole. When we think about how well our economy has fared over the life of the Labor governments and compare that to the wonderful announcement today of a draft economic policy outlining a plan to provide tax incentives and direct payments to turn the tropical north into an economic powerhouse, it seems peculiar to say that the least you could accuse the Gillard government of is not having a coherent fiscal strategy, because I do not think that anyone could claim a coherent fiscal strategy is one to split Australians into different personal tax zones and forcibly shift hundreds of thousands of public servants to cities north of the Tropic of Capricorn, out to Karratha or to Perth or to Darwin or to Cairns or to Broome. Crazy-brave maybe, but certainly not a coherent strategy. The fact that the proposition actually clearly breaches the Constitution is besides the fact. I do have to think that the headlines today that Mr Abbott has gone troppo are probably the best expression I can think of. It is hardly a surprise that the opposition is in retreat about this leaked document. If the number of emails and calls that our offices have been receiving is any indication, I am sure that the opposition has been receiving many more. Hardly a coherent fiscal strategy coming from the opposition today. But I have to say that not everyone actually thinks it is a dud. One Daily Telegraph reader, Alastair of Newrybar, posted online this morning:


Been saying for years that this should happen to diversify our work force and increase our productivity as mooted by Lang Hancock and Joe Bjelke-P. Logical development in the top end could see Australia becoming the food bowl to the world, with plenty of Asians only too happy to migrate and develop market gardens and farms. With an adequate water supply, anything will grow and having worked on the mine developments in the 60s, the weather is not too oppressive. Just when I was doubtfully wondering if you have the cojones to do something radically productive rather than drift along playing politics, you show you may have a spine after all Tony. Try raising the voting and drinking ages back to 21, re-establishing National Service and see the votes roll in.


Yes, that is exactly right: that proposal came straight out of the Bjelke-Petersen era with support from not only Lang Hancock but also, of course, his daughter, Gina Rinehart.


By contrast, the Gillard government's fiscal strategy has not only been coherent; it has been fair and it has been equitable, certainly not slugging the ordinary folk so that the rich can become richer or kowtowing to the Gina Rineharts of the world; not tearing the heart out of communities; not playing with people's lives but putting in place a well-thought-out package of measures to help people make ends meet, to spread the benefits of the mining boom and to be responsible economic managers. Senator Bishop spoke very passionately about Australia's economic record, where Australia's economy really stands as a beacon of resilience in the world. Unlike other countries, we have avoided recession, we saved hundreds of thousands of jobs in the face of the worst global financial conditions since the Great Depression and we bullet-proofed the Australian economy. We kept it out of recession. That is something that is very difficult for the opposition to acknowledge. It did not happen by accident; it was a result of shrewd, strategic thinking about what decisions needed to be made, about what investments needed to be made and about what stimulus had to be injected into the economy—and it required courage to act on those decisions.


I will remind listeners and those who are interested in this debate today that since December 2007, when Labor came to power, the Euro area economy has shrunk by 1.7 per cent, the Japanese economy has shrunk by 1.7 per cent and the US economy has grown by just 1.2 per cent. But here in Australia our Australian economy has actually grown by almost 13 per cent since that time. That is the significant message that we all need to understand—and that only came about from a very coherent fiscal and economic strategy.


Let us get back to the matter of jobs. Worldwide, unemployment is on the increase. It is a tragic situation. We know that the cornerstone of good economic management is to keep people in work or to get people into work. Around 800,000 jobs have been created since we were first elected. That is jobs created, not axed and not packed up and spirited away to Karratha or other points north where there is not even the infrastructure to support them. And it is not the 12,000 public servant jobs that Mr Abbott is determined to get rid of—12,000 public servants and their families to be cast on the scrapheap of unemployment.


Our fiscal policy is designed to support families and individuals and to help industry grow and help the economy to grow. We have put in place a fairer tax system, with cuts to the income tax rate for most Australians so that they have more money to spend every fortnight, and we have tripled the tax-free threshold, which means that more than a million people not only do not need to a tax return but also do not pay any tax out of their take-home pay. They are able to spend that meeting cost-of-living expenses. And we have made many, many other economically responsible and coherent changes that have improved the lives of Australians and have underpinned strong economic growth.


The fact that we have invested so much in paid parental leave is very important in building some productivity into our economy. Now that it is in place we are actually going to see the benefits of that investment, with more than 160,000 new parents across Australia benefitting from up to 18 weeks leave under the paid parental leave scheme. The support that we have provided to families through family payments is really very significant. Those issues are part of a coherent strategy.


For more evidence, let us look at the way we have means tested the private health insurance rebate, meaning that low- and middle-income earners are no longer being forced to subsidise the health insurance of higher-income earners. And why should they have to do that? We have invested $4.6 billion in dental care. That means that more than three million kids are going to be able to get to see the dentist, and it will significantly boost public dental services for Australians on lower incomes. That of course boosts the overall health of the nation.


This morning here in Parliament House we had the very important launch of a new campaign, a new alliance, called the Social Determinants of Health Alliance—a very significant piece of work that links together productivity, economic development, economic costs and the social benefits of improved health and wellbeing of Australians. We need to think about that. The overall health of the nation is not just about economic health; it is about the social and mental health of our families as well. It saves wasting money on unnecessary and available health interventions. Senator Fifield, in his motion, talked about living within one's means. Well, living within one's means means strategically, thoughtfully and responsibly allocating resources so that they provide the best outcomes for the economic and social wellbeing of the country.


Our coherent approach in managing the economy has a big-picture focus. There is the household assistance for the carbon price, which I talked about in the chamber yesterday. Australian families and pensioners are getting payments to help with their utility bills now and over the coming months. And we are investing wisely in the future, because of our recognition that the science of climate change is a reality that we cannot ignore. It is responsible and critically important to make $3.2 billion available to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to support stable research and development, and $200 million for clean technologies. These are all part of a coherent fiscal strategy that is about investing for our future.


And what about the National Disability Insurance Scheme, a coherent policy—coherent with Labor values; coherent with Australian values? It is a responsible, thoughtful approach to a problem that has been ignored for far too long. That is what the Gillard government talk about when we talk about vision. That is in very serious contrast to the opposition's so-called 'Vision 2030', which people are laughing about today—laughing, if they were not actually scratching their heads trying to make some sense of what is going on with an opposition that proposes to carve $800 million out of a foreign aid budget to be diverted to this incoherent megaproject in Northern Australia. It really does not bear much more consideration.


As I said, under the Gillard government, the Australian economy grew by 3.1 per cent last year—faster than any other advanced economy. We are now the 12th-largest economy in the world. Since Labor came into office we have moved up three places. IMF Article IV from 16 November last year says, 'five years on, both the economy and the financial sector continue to outperform most of their peers'. That is the IMF's judgement on Australia's performance.


Our investment outlook is strong—we have an incredible investment pipeline—as is our credit rating, with 'AAA with a stable outlook' from all three rating agencies for the first time in our history. Our net debt as a percentage of GDP is a mere fraction of our peers'. Our interest rates are low. When the Liberals left office, interest rates were 6.76 per cent. The Reserve Bank's official cash rate now is three per cent. Our interest rates are the lowest since 1996. There is a benefit to mortgage holders. On a $300,000 mortgage—a pretty average family mortgage—families are now paying $5,000 a year less compared to when the coalition left office. So there is nothing to be gained by Senator Fifield bleating about the way the government has managed the economy.


We are held up as an example in the developed world. If it is coherence Senator Fifield wants to see, then Labor has it in spades. Think about what Senator Fifield's own leader, Mr Abbott, said in his speech to the National Press Club, he gave some early insights into what is in store for Australia under a coalition government. There would be massive cuts to the Public Service: 12,000 jobs—12,000 families—and massive cuts to front-line services. I think about the public servants who are doing so much at the moment, out there on the front line, like the people at Centrelink. Those people are doing amazing jobs and they are the ones who are going to be hit by Mr Abbott's policies.


Mr Hockey has promised to deliver a surplus in the first year and in every other year. Already we know that he has a huge credibility problem in how to do that, because he still has to explain to the Australian people how he is going to fund his multibillion dollar black hole and where his razor gang is going to start slashing and burning. The irony of it all is that the policy paper released by Mr Abbott, which is called Real solutions for all Australians, is actually going to have a devastating impact on many Australians. It will certainly cause anxiety for people as they come into the election campaign, waiting to hear just what it is that Mr Abbott has in mind for them.


Let me remind senators again: we have a hugely strong investment outlook. We have a record $268 billion in infrastructure projects at an advanced stage. Senator Bishop talked before about the investment pipeline, where things had started to be identified; planning is in place and now we are starting to see the implementation and the construction of those major infrastructure projects and the delivery of outcomes, which will mean improved exports and opportunities. We have low debt and strong public finances. We have the 12th largest economy in the world. Many of us here in this chamber have had the opportunity in the past 12 months to travel overseas and to understand very clearly how Australia is held up as a beacon around the world. People ask us how it is that we have an unemployment rate of five or 5½ per cent. Last year, in November, I was in Ireland, and there were desperate questions from the Irish government about the situation there, where the unemployment rate now is over 15 per cent generally but the youth unemployment rate is now over 40 per cent. There is a desperation in countries like Ireland, Argentina, Greece, Italy and Portugal about almost a lost generation of young people who will never actually be able to recover.


What did we do during the global financial crisis? We put in place a massive effort to ensure that we did not lose our skills base, so we are not in the situation of countries like Ireland, who sent more than six per cent of their population overseas last year—many of them here to Australia—repatriating money home. Thank God we are not in that situation and never will be. And we will not be, because we have a strong fiscal strategy. We have a strong economy and we have a government that is responsible and strategic about the way in which these things will be considered and managed. We have a government that is governing for all Australians and seeking to make sure that the economy supports us all, that the economy does not pick winners and losers and that we can be a good society as well as a strong economy. That is the government that I am proud of, and I think it is a very coherent strategy and one that I will be delighted to be propagating during the next six months.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-02-07,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (17:34):  I would like to make a few comments on Senator Stephens's presentation to the Senate, referring to Ireland. The last thing I would ever do would be to attack Senator Stephens—because of my respect for the lady. Being a lady from out of Cessnock, it is a pity she never joined the National Party when she became political! But seriously, I do respect Senator Stephens and I am not going to go into any sort of personal attack on what she said, but she mentioned Ireland.


I was with Senator Stephens a few months ago when we met with some of the Irish politicians. Ireland has a population of 4½ million, and they owe $120 billion. They took it out of the debts of their bank. But I want to take you to Queensland. Queensland also has 4½ million people, and they have a debt of $72 billion—and going up, heading towards Ireland's level of debt. How did Queensland get that debt? They got that debt from years of Labor government.


People have been critical of the Campbell Newman Liberal-National Party government in Queensland for tightening the belt and reining in the spending. The other option is: go down the road of Ireland. As I said, they have the same population. Queensland has 4½ million people; Ireland has 4½ million people. Ireland has $120 billion of debt and Queensland is on $72 billion and has been forecast, under the previous government, to go to $85 billion by 2015, and some $100 billion by around 2020. It is getting to the same parallel financial mess as Ireland. Luckily there is a new government there that realises that managing money is important, but that is a tough job they are facing. Just like in New South Wales, when the O'Farrell-Stoner coalition government was elected on 26 March 2011. Guess what? In the year's budget: a $5 billion black hole. What's new?


Let us look at Senator Fifield's motion—'the Gillard government's fiscal strategy'—which is a very important motion of general business here today. Yesterday, Senator Cormann and I moved a motion in the Senate calling on the final budget outcome to be released before election day, 14 September. The ALP government and the Greens voted it down. Why did they vote it down? Why do they not want to let the Australian people know how much money they will borrow this financial year, which of course concludes on 30 June like any other financial year? Over the last five years, the final budget outcome has been released between 24 and 30 September. This year will be no different. The budget outcome of this financial year will be released after the election. I wonder why they chose the date of 14 September? So that the election can be held before the final budget outcome is known—the facts, the truths of this year's budget from which we were going to have a surplus. On more than 400 occasions the Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, and the Treasurer, Mr Swan, have said, 'There will be a budget surplus'. But hang on, the Christmas break comes along, 'Sorry, the budget surplus has been dumped. There will be no budget surplus; there will be another debt.'


I wonder how much debt? We will get a bit of an indication in the May budget this year when Treasurer Swan delivers it. He might say this year that there is not going to be a $1½ billion surplus like he said in the MYEFO back in November. It will be about a $4 billion deficit; that is what he will say. He will make his forecast for the next financial year and that will be another figure probably in the red. He might tone it down a bit—$1 billion or $2 billion in the red—but borrowing more money. However, you wait until we get that final budget outcome towards the end of September. It will be greater than the $4 billion or whatever Mr Swan says. There is nothing surer than that because the government will go on a borrowing and spending spree. We will only be able to monitor the Australian Office of Financial Management's website to see where the gross debt is going.


The government will borrow money to buy votes—that is exactly what they will do. As sure as I stand here, the figure forecast for this year's budget deficit in May will be higher come September when we get the real figures. They will borrow money to buy votes. That is all the Labor Party knows—debt, debt and more debt. Remember when Ms Gillard was made Prime Minister, and the new transparent government she would lead? Where is the transparency when you are hiding the budget figures? Why did you not support Senator Cormann's and my motion yesterday? What have you got to hide?


We know the Greens will back you up in hiding the budget figures, because the Greens never, ever look at budgets. They are a closed shop. They will not let the media in to their conferences. When it comes to managing money, the Greens are probably worse than the Australian Labor Party. Spend, spend, borrow, borrow, penalise success and reward failure—that is the attitude of the socialists in this place. That is what will happen and that is what we will see more of. Penalise success, penalise effort, penalise hard work and reward failure—that is what socialism is about, and this nation was built on what? Hard work, hard sweat and effort. Go back to the first export of our nation, wool.



Senator Fifield interjecting—



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senators on both sides of the chamber will respect the right of the senator on his feet who has the call to be heard in silence.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I could not agree with you more. Let us go back to the early days of European settlement when a worker went into the scrub, cleared the country, cut the trees down, split them with wedges, dug the holes with crowbars and shovels and built the fences over some pretty rough country. Along came the sheep and the shearers bent their backs—those very same shearers who started the Australian Labor Party under the Tree of Knowledge at Barcaldine in Western Queensland—and were the workers. We do not have any here today. We do not even have a shearer amongst the Labor politicians. I think they must be quite ashamed about that, for the shearers are on our side of the parliament. Amazing, isn't it? That is where they came from and that is where they have gone to. 'Let us penalise hard work!'


We will see more of it in superannuation. Superannuation was one of the good schemes the Hawke-Keating government brought in, so that people would save for their retirement and not have to rely on the taxpayers to pay for their retirement. Now, if you are going to get to $1 million we will cop into that because the $1.34 trillion—an enormous amount of superannuation savings—is the nest egg that the Labor government says, 'We can get some of this to help us fill our black hole of budgets.' As of last Friday gross debt was $262 billion. Those people listening on the radio should go to the website of the Australian Office of Financial Management—AOFM. Bring up the website www.aofm.gov.au, and every Friday afternoon, right in the middle of the home page, you will see the gross debt of this government.


I will be honest: it started off at around $50 billion. I discussed this with former senator Nick Minchin and asked: 'Did we really have a $50 billion debt when Labor was elected in 2007?' and he said, 'Yes, there was'. He said we kept it there to keep the government bond market open. Then we put $50 billion in the bank to neutralise it, so that it was zero. So, it started with $50 billion in 2007 and last Friday it was $262 billion—an increase of $212 billion in just five years of this government. Of course, some of that is through residential mortgage-backed securities, buying loans off small institutions to give them liquidity to lend money during the global financial crisis. And a fair bit of it went on the National Broadband Network, which is not even in the budget. But it is, 'Just draw off the government's AOFM. Draw out the money and we will pay it back later when the scheme gets profitable.' Well, do not hold your breath for that. So we have this debt. It is going to cost about $12 billion a year in interest alone. We must refer to the gross debt, the $262 billion, because what we have on the good side in the bank we cannot touch. There is $82 billion in the Future Fund we need for public servants' retirements. There is $22 billion of HECS fees. We cannot charge the students interest on their debt. Once they get a job and start earning $30,000 a year or more, they start paying it back. We have about $16½ billion of residential mortgage backed securities—those loan packages the government bought. We make a whisker of profit on them.


Let me explain it another way. If you owed the bank a million dollars and you were being charged, say, seven per cent interest, you would have to find $70,000 a year. But if you had half a million dollars in the bank, you would have a gross debt of a million dollars but a net debt of half a million. The half a million you had in the bank would be earning interest at, say, 4½ per cent, so you could use that money to help pay your debt. But you cannot use any on the government's good side of the ledger to help pay the debt, so we have to pay the interest on the gross amount of debt. Forget the net amount; the net amount does not earn us any money. We have to pay off the gross debt this government has built. 


In November 2011, the Reserve Bank lowered interest rates from 4.75 per cent to 4.5 per cent. They said the economy is slowing, it is not going well. A few months before that I was talking to Mr Martin Parkinson at Sydney airport. I said to him that the interest rate movement will be down and he laughed at me. I suppose he is a bit embarrassed when a broken down old cocky got it right and the boss of Treasury got it wrong. The fact is I live in the real world. I see what is happening to small business and I see what retail sales are doing, and they are terrible. So I picked it right. He might be embarrassed that a broken down shearer picked the economy right and the boss of Treasury did not. For once in my life, I was right. I have been wrong many, many times.


What was the government doing then? Why was the Reserve Bank stimulating the economy? Prior to that, the Reserve Bank put up interest rates. They were raising interest rates while the government was borrowing money and stimulating the economy. Economists will say this is the right thing to do. 'The Reserve Bank is raising interest rates, so we are going to keep borrowing and spending money to stimulate the economy.' It is like driving your car with your foot on the accelerator and pulling on the handbrake at the same time. The Reserve Bank was pulling on the handbrake while the government was borrowing money and spending it. That is crazy and now we this huge debt. That is what we are left with.


Where did they spend it? If you run a business and you borrow money, you borrow money to improve your business, to grow your business—better machinery to make you more productive. They did not build any train lines to make our freight system more efficient. No Melbourne to Brisbane train line was built. They gave $900 to people to spend on whatever they wanted to spend it on. They could buy a TV or go to the club and put it in a poker machine. No infrastructure was built except for what the states are responsible for: the Building the Education Revolution. In my hometown of Inverell one of the schools had four perfectly good classrooms. What did the government do? They pulled down those four perfectly good classrooms and replaced them with four new classrooms. That is supposed to be spending money wisely. That is stupidity.


I remember the Nationals campaign launch for the last election in 2010 down at Wagga Wagga. I was not there but the team was there. It was not a windy day that day, but a big covered outdoor learning area that had been built in Wagga Wagga fell over. It just collapsed. They said, 'Stand back, it's going down.' What a good investment that was! They built a new covered outdoor learning area and it just collapses on the day of the Nationals election campaign launch. 


We could go to pink batts also. Sadly, four lives were lost and houses were burnt down. If people want insulation in the roofs of their homes, they should put it in themselves. They will save electricity and they will insulate their houses better. It is not something for governments to do. If you are going to borrow money, build some infrastructure to make your business more efficient. But, no, they never went near that.


The decision of August 2008 to roll out the red carpet for asylum seekers has now seen Australia $6.6 billion out of pocket for their costs. We are a generous country. My hometown of Inverell is a proud country town. We have 12,000 people. We have Sudanese refugees. A lovely lady at home went and basically freed them. One lady came here with her four children. Her husband had been murdered and her brother had been murdered, and she got a new opportunity in life in a beautiful country town like where I live at Inverell. These are the genuine refugees we need to help whose lives are under threat. But we have an industry where people pay to get on a dangerous leaky boat and run the risk of losing their life. That is the industry we have and one that is also costing the taxpayers an enormous amount of money.


During the 2007 election campaign, we heard that there were not going to be any new taxes. But we saw the alcopops tax and the luxury car tax. If someone has been successful and worked hard, and can afford a more expensive car, that is wrong so tax that car. Penalise success, reward failure—that is what socialist governments are about. Then came the cigarette tax and the flood tax, and now the carbon tax. 


And there was the minerals resource rent tax. How embarrassing it must be because those three big mining companies just sucked the Prime Minister in. I have seen the signed paper where all the royalties must be credited. If you want to get a better share from the royalties, simply let the states raise their royalties. Those resources in the ground belonged to the Crown. The Crown is the state. All you have to do is tell the states to raise their royalties then Canberra pays less to the states. Money saved is money made. That is how you run business, instead of this minerals resource rent tax mess—budgeted to spend so much yet not raise a red cent. 


Then there is the liquified petroleum gas tax. It was introduced by the coalition—brought in as a clean fuel. Run your car on gas and you have 30 per cent less emissions, so less pollution. If you want to lose an election, upset the taxi drivers because they talk to a lot of people. I do not know how many millions of taxi fares a year there are, but the tax on clean fuel is going to go up to 12½ cents a litre. Where is all this clean energy in the environmental programs? You are taxing the very clean energy that we have a big supply of in this country. It is not imported. It is our very own Australian fuel that you are taxing to try get your bottom line up to this budget surplus that is 'not negotiable; we will deliver; hang on, we'll go back on our word again'. The point is that so many Australian people do not trust this government to manage money, to spend it properly. They are spending $100 billion a year more in their annual budget than was spent in the last year of the Howard government. Just 5½ years later and they are spending $100 billion.


That is incredible. The people do not trust the government on carbon taxes, promises or caring for our aged. It is amazing that in the stimulus package our aged-care facilities, a federal responsibility, never got a red cent. Wherever I go around Australia, in many of the country towns I visit I see that the aged-care facilities are doing it so tough. No, we went and put in all these school buildings in state schools, which are a state responsibility—pulled down perfectly good buildings and replaced them with new buildings. You could go to Kingstown, where a little building about 10 metres long by six metres wide cost $330,000. That would build you a huge four-bedroom brick home but they got this little hut. You could go out to Tottenham, literally in the centre of New South Wales, where it cost $600,000 for a tuckshop and they could not fit the microwave in it.


That is why people do not trust you to spend the money properly. You take the money off the taxpayers and off business and you waste it like that. These are the people I speak to all the time when I travel around regional New South Wales, and have they got a set on this government. Even in New England, the electorate in which I live, many of them have been scathing about their local member, Mr Windsor, for giving us this government. Likewise in Lyne, in Port Macquarie and those areas they are scathing about Mr Oakeshott for giving us this government. Those traditionally conservative seats that have been held for many, many years show and the Senate vote in those seats shows—those people in New England and Lyne will get their day on 14 September to have their say. As I often say: 'Seats don't belong to politicians; they belong to the people.' You betray your people and they will let you know at the next election.


All my life, whether it be state or federal Labor governments, they have sent us broke. They have mortgaged up. They have filled up the bankcard, filled up the mastercard and mortgaged our children's futures away. If they did some good with it and built some decent infrastructure you would say, 'That's not a bad investment.' But the amount of waste has been unbelievable. Hence, that is why I support this motion of Senator Fifield's. The fiscal strategy of this government has been an absolute disgrace. We have $262 billion of debt. I do not know how we are going to pay it off. It will be hard work and economic management that will achieve that in time.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2013-02-07,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (17:55):  While Mr Abbott and those opposite would like to pretend that it never happened, the global financial crisis was the most difficult global economic period since the Great Depression, and its effects are still being felt. There continues to be uncertainty in the global economy and, recently, the unusual combination of a persistently high dollar in the face of lower commodity prices has hit Australian company profits, which means the government is receiving less in taxation revenue than expected. In fact, over the last five years, government revenues have been written down by $160 billion. Revenue for 2012-13 alone has been written down by a staggering $20 billion. These dramatic falls in revenue put significant pressure on the federal budget. However, the government has a strong track record of making savings to reprioritise spending and maintain our budget position. In the mid-year review, we made $16.4 billion in savings, on top of over $130 billion in savings made over our last five budgets. We also have a strong record when it comes to making structural saves that have contributed to the long-term health of the budget position.


Indeed, if you look at the mid-year review we released last year, it took stock of these and other changes and reported that, without these savings, net debt would be $250 billion worse in 2020-21. Unlike the opposition's claim in this motion, we are spending less and making responsible savings. One of the most effective ways to assess government spending is to look at it as a proportion of GDP. Spending is at or below 24 per cent of GDP over the budget period, which is the longest sustained period of spending at this low level in over 30 years. In contrast, the Howard government was the highest taxing and most wasteful government in Australia's history. Research by the IMF shows that this government has made responsible spending decisions, while the Howard government clearly missed opportunities to effectively use the mining boom and strong global economic conditions to invest in Australia's future. The report again debunks the myth frequently repeated by Mr Abbott, Mr Hockey and those opposite that the Howard government exercised spending restraint.


This government's tough decisions have led to positive results for the Australian economy. Unlike the rest of the developed world, we avoided recession and saved hundreds of thousands of jobs. Our economy is now 13 per cent larger than it was when Labor came to office, while other advanced economies are still clawing back lost output. More than 800,000 jobs have been created since Labor came to office, while 28 million have been lost worldwide. The only jobs strategy the Liberal Party has is the slashing of jobs, straight out of the Campbell Newman and Barry O'Farrell playbook. We have strong public finances and low debt, with net debt expected to peak at one-tenth of that across major advanced economies. We are one of only seven countries that have a AAA credit rating, with a stable outlook, from all three ratings agencies. This was never, ever, achieved under the coalition.


The opposition talk about 'living within your means', and it is fine for the opposition to talk about fiscal responsibility. We welcome discussions like the one we are having today about fiscal responsibility. That is why we have given those opposite full and complete access to the Parliamentary Budget Office. Because the Australian people know that, while the braggart down the pub will tell you they climbed Everest, hit a century for Australia and knocked out Muhammed Ali, unless they show you the photos you know that they are, to put it politely, full of hollow boasts. Those opposite are full of hollow boasts. We have repeatedly called upon them to cost their policies using the expertise of the Parliamentary Budget Office. They have refused.


Those opposite have said they will release their costings before the election. Unlike those opposite who appear not to trust anyone or anything, I do trust that they will release their costings before the election, although I suspect it will be on 13 September. It is irresponsible for those opposite to make promises of more spending, lower taxes and higher surpluses without detailing how they are going to pay for it. It is meaningless to announce policies without providing credible costings. Costings are only credible if they have been verified by Finance and Treasury or the independent Parliamentary Budget Office and released publicly. Costings are not credible when they have been prepared by a private firm acting in the interests of their client rather than in the public interest.


It is imperative that those opposite release their costings and release all their policies, because there is great fear in Tasmania, my home state, about what will happen were those opposite to get into government. There is growing outrage at Mr Abbott's plans to strip $700 million in GST revenue from Tassie's budget to boost the coffers of his Western Australian state Liberal mates, and there is growing fear about Mr Abbott's leaked 'Vision 2030'—

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (18:01):  It is not with great pleasure, regrettably, that I rise to speak in relation to item No.9 which is the NBN Co. Ltd. I want to briefly mention some matters that are raised by the shadow minister in relation to the NBN rollout. And then I want to talk about some matters in relation to Corangamite, which of course has suffered badly from the rollout. Just out of interest, the target—of course the revised NBN target, because as we all know they have been revised down and revised down—which is the 'pass by' has 286,000 houses by June 2013 but in December 2012 there were 46,000. So, the revised-down target of 286,000 for June next year has only 46,000 as at December 2012. The activate target was meant to be 44,000 premises by June 2013, but only 6,600 as of December 2012—again, downgraded. As the shadow minister said, the coalition is totally committed to high-speed broadband at affordable prices. But the NBN is not, and will not, do that.


The interesting part is that the member for Corangamite, Darren Cheeseman—the inactive member for Corangamite, Darren Cheeseman—of course, has been making many promises about the NBN network and telling his constituents that they will be on it soon. But that actually does not stack up when you look at the facts of it. In fact, if you look in Corangamite itself, the Colac and the Otways are not even included in the to-do list—the constantly revised down to-do list. Suburbs such as Highton, Grovedale, Waurn Ponds and Belmont are not in the revised-down to-do list.


Just out of interest, Waurn Ponds is where Deakin University is placed—a fantastic education institution—and the planned teaching hospital there. Interestingly, Mr Cheeseman very recently stated that the NBN is about getting families online and access to health and aged care, and kids getting access to world-class education services. Well, in Waurn Ponds—not even on the revised to-do list—the Deakin University, which indeed is providing world-class education services, is actually not on the NBN list. Is not on it! And those people in Ocean Grove and Torquay—which are planned for 2015, and they are part of the three-year plan—what confidence can they possibly have that they will soon have an NBN connection, let alone an activation of that connection? The fact is, Mr Cheeseman should stop talking about his constituents having access to the NBN when he knows the truth is they will not have it. For many, they are not even part of the planned three-year rollout. For those who are ostensibly part of the planned three-year rollout, they will see those figures quoted by the shadow minister about the revised-down figures for the NBN Co.


This is a complete and utter farce, and Labor members in the other place, and Labor senators, have to stop talking about the virtues of a program that is extraordinarily expensive, and that the government even keeps offline on the budget. And when you look at what has been rolled out, it is simply not happening.


Mr Cheeseman has to be honest with his constituents. How can it be that people in Colac and the Otways are not even included in the rollout? How is it that those in Torquay and Ocean Grove will have no confidence at all that they are going to be part of it. How is it that Highton, Grovedale and Waurn Ponds and Belmont, again like Colac and the Otways, are not even on the revised-down list? This is a farce. This government has got to stop talking about this NBN rollout and start telling the truth about what is happening.



What is happening of course, is nothing! Nothing is happening! These figures have been revised down, they are unachievable targets and it is about time there was a bit of honesty from the minister and the member for Corangamite.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

 (South Australia—Government Whip in the Senate) (18:23):  I am very proud to be a part of the federal Labor government. We have introduced and achieved so many good and important Labor initiatives that will improve the lives of all Australians now and in the future.


In stark contrast to the aggressive, retrograde, negative and policy-free crusade that the coalition indulges in, the Gillard Labor government is working hard, looking to the future and implementing Labor policy.


During 2012, I spent a lot of time travelling throughout metropolitan and regional South Australia, meeting with people who have directly benefited from the federal government's investments and reforms. I look forward to continuing to do so this year.


The Australian Labor Party have always been about striving to create and to share opportunity. We seek to protect and assist people who do need government support. That is why in our proud history Labor introduced Medicare; introduced compulsory superannuation; abolished Work Choices; investing in education and reforming schools funding through Gonski; supported jobs during the global financial crisis through our stimulus packages; introduced a carbon price and compensated Australians for the impact of it; introduced the nation's first paid parental leave scheme; managed to keep interest rates low and unemployment low; supported unions to run the first ever pay equity case that delivered wage increases for low-paid community services workers; given tax cuts to those who need it most; and given tax breaks to small businesses that are the engine room of our economy.


Labor's record is an enviable record of achievement and I want to highlight some of those achievements. In education the Labor government has invested record amounts in all areas. From early learning right through to tertiary education the government has ensured that children and young people have access to high-quality education, no matter where they are located, no matter what their level of learning or socioeconomic background is. 


One of the most successful programs, I believe, has been the Building the Education Revolution. In my travels throughout the state of South Australia, I have met so many principals, teachers, students and parents who are all so positive about the BER and so confident of Labor's investment in education. 


Across my duty electorates of Sturt and Barker in South Australia, the single biggest investment in education infrastructure ever undertaken has seen more than $259 million shared amongst a total of 170 schools.


 I have attended many openings at schools across both electorates and, at each and every one, I was met by the entire school community with enthusiasm and optimism about the regeneration of their schools.


Towards the end of 2012, I was fortunate enough to revisit one of South Australia's great public high schools, Glenunga International High School. I have visited Glenunga a number of times and was more than pleased to be invited back to see the completion of all the BER facilities, as well as the new and exciting initiatives that have been put in place as a result of the federal government's earlier investments in the Digital Education Revolution program.


Principal Wendy Johnson and her team of talented educators have embraced their new facilities and have used the DER as an impetus to adopt the enormous opportunities for learning and teaching that new technologies can provide. Glenunga has shown leadership by identifying how these new tools can be used by teachers to deliver the curriculum, manage the school's administrative systems and communicate with its students and their parents and caregivers.


While I am sure it was initially a leap of faith for the Glenunga school community to introduce the digital technology programs for both the teachers and students there, there is no doubt it has been beneficial to the whole community. Students at that school will be well and truly ready for the challenges of further education, for work and for participation in the digital economy. That is exactly what the government intended with the Digital Education Revolution.


But it is not only schools that have benefited from the government's investments. As I said earlier, the Labor government has invested in all levels of education. Since 2007, the Labor government has provided more than $2 billion across Australia for preschool and kindergarten places. We have given 250,000 more children every year access to quality early childhood education. That is in stark contrast to the former Howard Liberal government that did not once invest in early childhood education.


Nationally, the government has made a $2.5 billion investment towards trade training centres, with more than $135 million benefiting 139 schools in South Australia alone. In the electorate of Barker, the Tenison Trade Training Centre, situated at Tenison Woods College in Mount Gambier, received more than $588,000 to provide pathways for students interested in cabinetry and cooking careers. The new Lower Murray Trade Training Centre at Murray Bridge High School is a $1.8 million investment, providing skills training to help young people find jobs in the automotive and construction industries.


In addition, since coming to office in 2007, Labor has opened the door to a university education to more Australians than ever before, many of them the first in their family to go to university. Thanks to Labor's investments and reforms, this year 190,000 more Australians will be studying at our universities than were enrolled in 2007 when we came to government. While I am on the subject of tertiary education, I would like to acknowledge the excellent work of former Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations Senator Chris Evans for his hard work and dedication to the education portfolio. He worked tirelessly to transform Australia's higher education landscape and to provide life-changing opportunities for all Australians. He will be greatly missed.


The Gillard Labor government has always believed that supporting families and giving every child the best possible start in life is the most important thing we can do. We understand the cost-of-living pressures on working families, and to ease those pressures the government has increased tax cuts, increased family payments, increased child-care assistance, introduced the new schoolkids bonus and introduced Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme. One of our more recent Labor initiatives that commenced on 1 January 2013, Dad and Partner Pay, gives eligible new dads and same-sex partners the chance to receive two weeks pay at the national minimum wage so they can stay at home for those very important first weeks of their new baby's life. The delivery of the schoolkids bonus has commenced to all eligible families, providing up to $410 for primary students and up to $820 per high-school student per year. The government is assisting families with the additional pressures of school costs and helping parents give their children the best start in life. We know that the opposition if elected will strip those cash bonuses away from the family budget.


One of the most crucial reforms that the Gillard government is currently implementing is the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Gillard Labor government understands that Australians with disability miss out on the opportunities and fairness that should be a given in a wealthy nations like ours. For that reason we are investing $1 billion for the first stage of the NDIS from the middle of 2013, one year ahead of the timetable set out by the Productivity Commission. South Australia will be one of the nation's first launch sites for the scheme. From this July about 4,600 South Australian children aged up to 14 with significant and profound disability will start to have their needs assessed to receive individualised care and support packages to have decision-making power about their care and support including choice of service provider, and be assisted by local coordinators to help manage and deliver their support. The government is investing almost $33 million to make the NDIS a reality in South Australia, working in partnership with the South Australian Labor government to deliver this life-changing reform.


Lastly, I want to touch briefly on one of the most crucial projects currently being rolled out, and that is the National Broadband Network. With that, the government will deliver high-speed fibre to every Australian by the end of this decade. It will make businesses more productive and deliver better government services such as health and education. It will change the face of Australia's communications. It is a big and bold step, and the Australian Labor government is very proud of it. 


When out and about on my travels, people ask me: what does Labor stand for? I tell them about the things we have done and I tell them we stand for opportunity and for fairness and that Labor's vision for the future is the best possible future for all Australians. We look after those who need it, we share the world we are so fortunate to have and we are not afraid to take the hard decisions. In the tradition of great Labor governments, the Gillard government has, despite continued obstruction from the coalition, been able to deliver great things for all Australians.
