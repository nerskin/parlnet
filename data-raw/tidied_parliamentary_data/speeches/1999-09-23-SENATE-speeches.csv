[Acts Interpretation Act 1901  provisions apply: must be resolved within 15 sitting days after today or the Determinations, Exemption, Orders, Regulations and Rules will be deemed to have been disallowed.]
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Australian Sports Drug Agency Drug Testing (Scheme A) Orders 1999
The Orders establish the administrative framework for the collection and sampling of drug tests performed on competitors in sport.
Compliance 
Section 8 of the Orders provides that substantial, rather than strict, compliance with the provisions of these Orders will generally be sufficient but does not indicate who is to decide what constitutes substantial compliance.
Collection of Samples
Subsection 10(2) of the Orders obliges a competitor to comply with `any instructions given by a chaperone during the sample collection process' but does not limit those instructions to such as may be reasonably required in the circumstances.
Section 11 of the Orders gives to the drug control officer in charge of the collection of a urine sample a discretion as to the information which he or she may record on the drug testing form. No reason is given for this discretion or why the officer is not required to record certain information, and no other.
Subsection 28(2) to (6) of the Orders list a number of matters which a competitor and a drug control officer must carry out, but then, in subsection 28(7), the drug control officer is given the discretion as to the instructions which may be given to the competitor.
Subsections 29(3) and 43(3) provide that the respective subsections (4) apply if, for example, the pH of a sample is lower than 5 or higher than 7. 
 But the relevant subsections (4) then require the drug control officer to deny the evidence that he or she has received, and treat the sample as if the pH were not  lower than 5 or higher than 7.
Subsection 49(2) of the Orders deems `a courier in the normal course of business' to be a secure means of transporting a sample to an accredited laboratory. However, neither the Act, the Regulations, nor the Orders provide a definition of such a courier. Also, if a drug control officer decides not to use such a courier, he or she is required to see to the transport of samples `by means which will ensure [their] safe arrival'. The section, however, does not provide for the means by which the officer is to fulfil this requirement.
Subsection 51(2) of the Orders obliges a drug control officer to store samples overnight in `a secure place', but neither the Act, the Regulations nor the Orders apparently defines such a place.
Testing of Samples
Section 57 of the Orders deals with the testing of part B of a sample, if the result of testing part A of the sample is positive. The section does not indicate what an accredited laboratory is to do with part B of a sample if, either the test of part A is negative, or the Agency does not instruct the laboratory to test part B.
Scheme A Register
Subsection 60(2) of the Orders requires the Agency to remove details of a person's name, etc from the Scheme A register if it turns out that the person was not a competitor. It might be thought that the Agency should satisfy itself before  carrying out the testing program on a person whether they were a competitor or not.
The Committee is concerned that the discretions about what is being recorded in the Register may infringe on the privacy of the athletes.
Prohibited Drugs and Doping Methods
Subsection 61(1) of the Orders appears to incorporate into the Orders various lists of prohibited drugs and doping methods kept by sporting administration bodies `as in force from time to time'. This provision may be contrary to subsection 49A(1) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 .
Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations 1999 Statutory Rules 1999 No.159
These Statutory Rules create a single drug testing scheme for competitors in sport.
Drug control officials and chaperones
Regulations 8 and 9 allow for the appointment of, respectively, `drug control officials' and `chaperones'. Since, by virtue of subregulation 9(2), 
 a drug control official is also a chaperone, and since neither need have any special qualifications or attributes, as they need only be a `person', it is difficult to see the reason for the two types of officials.
Personal interest
Subregulations 12(1) and 13(2) seek to ensure that a person taking a sample from a competitor will report to the Australian Sports Drug Agency any personal interest in the collection of the sample. Subregulations 12(2) and 13(3) nevertheless permit the Agency to allow the person taking the sample to continue with that task.
Conditions of service—persons appointed by a sporting administrative body
Subregulation 13(2) requires the Agency to make sure that the conditions of service of persons appointed by a sporting administrative body contain particular terms. However, it is suggested that this provision may not fulfil its apparent purpose. There is no requirement, for instance, that the conditions of service must be immutable, and it is difficult to see how the Agency could monitor the conditions of service, at any particular time, of those appointed by other, outside, bodies.
Discretion to use an interpreter
Subregulations 18(2) and (3) give the Agency a discretion as to whether to communicate with a competitor through an interpreter. It might be thought that if a competitor is `unable to receive or understand [a] request' (see subregulation 18(2)), or is `unable to understand English' (see subregulation 18(3)), the Agency should be required  to make all reasonable efforts to ensure, by whatever means, that its request is understood.
Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee
By virtue of paragraph 65(2)(b) read with subregulation 65(3), the Chairman of the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee must convene a meeting of the Committee if he or she receives, among other things, an oral request therefor from the Agency. The Committee suggests that it would conduce to better administration if such requests were required to be in writing.
Delegation of powers
Regulation 80 permits the Agency to delegate `all or any of its powers  except [this] power to delegate' to, among others, a drug control official or a chaperone, and regulation 82 gives a drug control official a similar power to delegate to a chaperone. However, it is apparent that, by virtue of the definitions of drug control official and chaperone in regulation 3, there is no limit by reason of office or attribute on the persons who may be appointed to the position of drug control official or chaperone. The Committee suggests that 
 these powers of delegation are too wide, and that delegations should, for instance, be limited to employees of the Agency.
Consultation with Privacy Commissioner
The Explanatory Statement to the Regulations stated that the `Privacy Commissioner has been consulted [about the Regulations] but notes that compliance with the Privacy Act 1988  will depend upon the way Drug Testing Scheme A is implemented'. The Orders appear to implement Scheme A, but the Explanatory Statement to these Orders states that the `Privacy Commissioner has been consulted on the [Orders] but notes that compliance with the Privacy Act 1988  will depend upon the way the Orders are implemented'.
Explanatory Statements
The Explanatory Statements for both the Regulations and the Orders give a broad picture only. These statements are deficient, in that there is no detailed explanation of each individual regulation. There is also no indication whether these Regulations and Orders are consistent with standard testing orders used throughout the international community and whether international and domestic sporting bodies were consulted about the testing scheme.
Determination No.1/1999—Determination of Education and Courses made under subsections 3(1) and 5D(1) of the  Student Assistance Act 1973
This Determination specifies those education institutions and the courses offered therein which are approved for the purposes of the Act. Despite having been made on 22 June 1999, the Determination is deemed to have commenced on 1 July 1998. Unfortunately, the Explanatory Statement does not provide any indication of whether this retrospectivity may adversely affect any person other than the Commonwealth. The Explanatory Statement also does not advise whether the Determination which is revoked by this instrument, and which was apparently defective, operated to the disadvantage of any person.
Exemption No. CASA 25/1999 made under regulation 308 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988
CASA 25/1999 exempts Brumby pilotless aircraft from compliance with most of the Civil Aviation Regulations while a member of the aeronautical engineering department of the University of Sydney flies them for developmental testing purposes. Clause 5 of the Conditions, subject to which this 
 Exemption has been granted, requires a flight tester who is flying a Brumby pilotless aircraft to `ensure that persons operating ultralight aircraft at Medway are notified not less than 24 hours before flights begin under this exemption'. This provision may be unreasonable as it may not be possible for a flight tester to know every person who planned to fly an ultralight aircraft on the following day.
Fisheries Management Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.3) Statutory Rules 1999 No.130
These Statutory Rules amend the Principal Regulations in relation to the Christmas Island Fishery, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Fishery and the Macquarie Island Fishery. One purpose of these Statutory Rules is to set an application fee for entry to the Macquarie Island Fishery. That fee, of $5350, is described in the Explanatory Statement as being `significantly higher than the usual fee' for such an application. The explanation given for this higher fee is merely `the process involved', but the higher fee is also justified on the basis of the costs that the AFMA will incur in that process. There is, however, no indication, in the Explanatory Statement, of the degree to which this fee is higher than others, nor is there any indication of the nature of the process involved in considering applications.
Health Insurance Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.3) Statutory Rules 1999 No.157
These Statutory Rules clarify provisions of the Principal Regulations. Items 1 to 5 of Schedule 1 to these Regulations make machinery amendments to ensure that the references to items in the Health Insurance Regulations correctly refer to items in the General Medical Services Table and the Diagnostic Imaging Services Table. The Explanatory Statement advises that this is to `reflect recent changes to the tables where new items have been added and superfluous items have been removed from the tables'. The Statement does not, however, advise whether the incorrect referencing between the item numbers, which appeared in the Regulations and those appearing in the Tables, resulted in any disadvantage to members of the public.
Hearing Services Amendment Rules of Conduct 1999 (No.1) made under subsection 17(1) of the  Hearing Services Administration Act 1997
These Rules prescribe fees for the maintenance and replacement of hearing devices that have been supplied to voucher-holders free of charge. Sched 
 ule 1 to the Rules provides for a fee of $30 for the maintenance and replacement of batteries in a device that has been provided free of charge to a voucher-holder who is a participant in the voucher system. Prior to the making of this instrument, a person who was a voucher-holder, and a dependant of a participant in the voucher system, paid a reduced amount for the maintenance and replacement of batteries in a hearing device that had been provided free of charge to the voucher-holder (Hearing Services Rules of Conduct 1997, subparagraph 20(2)(c)(ii), as in force up to 30 June 1999). One effect of the amendment made by these Rules is to remove the reference to this category of person from the Rules of Conduct.
Native Title (Prescribed Bodies Corporate) Regulations 1999 Statutory Rules 1999 No.151
These Statutory Rules provide the necessary administrative framework for the operation of aspects of the Native Title Act 1993 .
Subregulation 8(3) provides that a `prescribed body corporate must ensure that the common law holders [of native title] understand the purpose and nature of a proposed native title decision'. This provision appears to be unworkable.
Paragraph 9(3)(a) allows a document to be good evidence of consultation with and consent by the common law holders of native title if it is signed by `at least 5 members of the prescribed body corporate'. However, neither the regulation, nor the Explanatory Statement, indicates why five members of such a body are regarded as sufficiently representative of the group.
Paragraph 10(3)(a) provides that a person is entitled to a copy of a document if the person `has a substantial interest in the decision to which the document relates'. However, r.10 does not indicate who is to determine that question, nor by what means the determination is to be made.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,0,1

"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I will continue my remarks from yesterday on the Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999 . Fraudulent providers are currently still operating. Due to the Howard government's ineptness, shonky operators are still running some of the homes, which further exacerbates the vulnerability of the elderly. The Tasmanian situation is particularly horrendous, due to the ill-fated coalescence proposal that will represent a cut of over $22 million in seven years. This will rip the heart out of our regional economy, naturally translating into reduced choices and comfort for 
 the generation that carries the scars of defending the nation.
The proven therapeutic value of residing in a local community will be further limited, as the possibility of units closing becomes a reality; and the elderly will be moved like cattle as this dollar-driven government continues with its ideological agenda. Thus the option of the elderly being cared for by the children and grandchildren of past and present friends may only exist for the few, and their treasured memories—that are often cued by the sight of familiar surroundings—may disappear more readily than otherwise.
We have a family friend, a lady in her late 80s, who has lived in her community all her life. She is a typical example of somebody who has no family close by and no means of transport. If she had to move from that community, she would be devastated. She needs to live where she is able to be visited by friends and friends' children, people she has known all her life. At this stage, fortunately, that is not going to happen; but, if in future it does, I suspect that her lifespan will be much shorter. She is in good health at present, but I know that for her family it is a concern that she may eventually have to move away from that community, because the nursing home there is a very small one.
An assessment of nursing homes in Tasmania found that a number of homes fell short of meeting some of the requirements for adequate care of the elderly. This was in most cases due to shortages of funds needed for staff and training or capital works. It therefore seems ironical that the bill contains no real remedies to fix the shortfall in capital funding, as the accommodation charges fall short of the funds needed. Additionally, there is no requirement for providers to spend the money raised by the accommodation charge on capital works. As in any industry, there will be those that simply pocket the money without the upgrades needed being started. This will become specifically relevant as the government's plans for accreditation are exerted.
Accreditation is often a useful way of increasing standards and universality of care. However, this can only be achieved if ad 
 equate funding is given to enable the standards to be met. Remember that the cost of accreditation in Tasmania will range from $40,000 to $120,000 per annum. Thus this policy has many obvious flaws that will inevitably translate into increased hardship, reduced security and a real reduction in care received, as sound policy and realistic capital grants are compromised by the government's cynical, penny-pinching agenda. Remember that this is happening in the International Year of Older Persons. Heaven help them when this year is over.
The resident classification scale revised on 1 November 1998 will also cause some problems, as in the case of St. Mark's Home in Deloraine. These changes in the criteria essentially rest on whether a patient has to have their tablets placed in their mouth or in their hand, and will result in a loss of subsidies of up to $84,000—according to a fax I received from St Mark's Home. It is important to remember that the quality of life for the elderly in homes directly relates to the experience of life in many institutions—as this short statement eloquently shows:
Others are in charge of me now.
I have no private place of my own.
I do not belong here.
I share my bedroom with people I would not have in my own home.
There are too many people here in this nursing home. I don't feel comfortable here. I mean, where else would you live where people just come and barge in?
This statement is contained in volume 36 of the Lincoln Papers in Gerontology , in an article called The Articulate Resident's Perspective on Nursing Home Life , which paints a picture that is in stark contrast to the happy snaps contained in the department's `Home & Residence Choices for Older People'. After peering into the happy snaps created by the department, one would be excused for signing up straight away and neglecting to think that, for many of the elderly, nursing homes can be places of isolation and shame.
There is nothing in the government's policy that will enrich anyone's life; rather, the Tasmanian experience will create a reduction in choice of location and residence and an 
 increasing insecurity in staff—an insecurity that invariably translates into compromised service. The Tasmanian industry does not need greater proportional funding because of greed or ineptness; rather, it is a natural consequence of regional economies of scale and an island status. This is recognised by the Productivity Commission but was rejected by the government, who hid the report and ignored many parts that they did not like.
Again I need to repeat the figures which I alluded to previously in the chamber and which clearly illustrate the unique nature of Tasmania's position as a regional industry. The proportion of nursing homes with one to 20 beds in Tasmania is 17 per cent, compared with the national average of 6.4 per cent—a difference of over 10 per cent. This difference means that more homes in Tasmania are vulnerable as, in the economic rationalistic equation of the Howard government, small is not beautiful: small is crushed.
The likely non-viability of smaller, more intimate homes flies in the face of a study conducted in Sweden in 1992. The study found that dementia patients living in small units containing no more than eight patients demonstrated slower rates of intellectual deterioration compared with those in larger homes. This bill will do nothing to protect smaller institutions—in fact, it will most likely result in their closure. This testament clearly reveals the inherent flaws of economic ideology without commonsense. The nuances of regional and rural communities do not always fit the needs of still unproven economic theories that are so often removed from the human experience and have scant regard for the higher ideals of compassion and empathy.
What of the rights of the elderly, mentioned in my opening remarks? One of the government's first acts on being elected in 1996 was to dramatically reduce the capacity of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This act was a prophetic statement on this government's attitude to all marginalised groups in our society. Thus the problems faced by those who need care in their elderly years should come as no surprise at all.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I think we almost ought to start here with a moment's silence for what this government has done to aged care and indeed what it attempted to do under the Moylan so-called reforms a few years ago. I speak here today—and I am not going to delay this by taking my full allocation of time—to get a few remarks on the public record about some specific problems. It seems that the government is not only happy roughing up pensioners and roughing up nursing home people; they also want to rough up my home state of South Australia.
It would appear that in South Australia there has been a much more zealous application by this government of the residential classification scale. I say that because, when officers go out and review various nursing home patients, nationally there has been a 37 per cent figure for downgrading—that is, 37 per cent  of residents have incurred the provisions whereby the nursing home that is providing that care needs to downgrade the facilities which are provided and pay back, as I understand it, six months of fees to the Commonwealth. That is a fairly high figure.
But the zealots in South Australia have managed to score a 72 per cent figure. It would appear that nursing homes in South Australia have been singled out for a bit of extra special care. We have had cases where some care providers have had to foot the bill for literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to go back to the Commonwealth. In some instances, we have had facilities so heavily penalised that it has become a really significant problem for them, because anyone who knows much about this industry knows that it is not an enormously profitable industry for individual persons who run nursing homes. It may well be that it will make a lot of money for the Doug Morans of this world if they can get the right government policy up or if they are in business long enough—and I single out that particular individual because I think that, until the Howard government saw how unpopular their changes were the other year, he was really the minister for aged care in this country. 
I want to say for South Australia on this issue that, whilst this bill makes a number of technical amendments, it is appropriate for us to have a look at where we are going with this. In South Australia we have to be very cognisant of the fact that we have a larger aged profile than many other states in this country. In fact, in South Australia we probably will be facing problems of health and ageing more than most other parts of this country, because South Australia is a place many people go to to retire. Sadly, many young people from South Australia see that they can have a better career in the bigger eastern states, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney. Many of these people come back at the end of their working life.
This is not a new phenomenon. There are whole areas of South Australia, particularly down at Victor Harbor and a number of other spots, where people find that they can retire, give up their working life in Sydney, sell their assets there and realise a very much more substantial gain on those assets than they ever would have in South Australia. They would also have had more profitable employment over the years so that, when they come back to South Australia, they are reasonably well set up. But the problem for us as a community is that we then have to make sure that when they go to the next stage—that is, the need for aged care accommodation—they are adequately provided for.
I do not want to go on for too long about this today, but I just want to get it on record. I would like some answers as to why the rate in South Australia is double the national average. In fact, if I look at the RCS review statistics for the different states in the first half of this year, I find that in fact for the downgrading in New South Wales it is a figure of 28 per cent and in Victoria it is 57 per cent. Some questions need to be asked as to what the difference is between those two states. I cannot at this stage see what the difference would be, other than the zealousness of some of the officers who are carrying out these reviews. In Queensland it is 25 per cent, in Western Australia 51 per cent and in Tasmania 34 per cent. The national average 
 is 37 per cent, but in South Australia it is 72 per cent.
Several questions immediately emerge from this. Why is there such a high figure in South Australia? What has generated this? What is different in South Australia compared with the other states? The second question is why in the three larger states—and that includes Queensland—there is such an enormous discrepancy between Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales. The statistics that I have just elaborated to the Senate should start to ring some alarm bells, particularly within the department. It is quite obvious that there are problems here that really need to be addressed and addressed very quickly.
What has been put to me by the providers in South Australia is that this process has been grossly unfair to them. It is threatening their viability and, indeed, it is adversely affecting my state more than anywhere else. The figures that I have just read out seem to support what the providers are saying. Very large and substantial amounts of money are going from providers into Commonwealth coffers in South Australia which is not happening in other states, and the question as to why this is the case seriously has to be asked.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I rise to speak on the Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999. Last night in this chamber Senator Allison delivered an extremely defensive speech. No doubt this was the signal that the Democrats will yet again sell out and vote with the government. They will cave in on this bill just like they caved in on the GST and industrial relations bills. This bill seeks to address the problems that this government, with the willing help of the likes of Senator Allison and her gang of 10, have foisted on the aged care sector. Even the minister could not hide the flaws from parliament. In her own speech she said:
This bill also addresses anomalies in the Aged Care Act 1997 . . . 
I could not agree more with the minister when she said that they deserve better, but, after three years of this government, older Australians deserve a whole lot better.
Labor will be moving a number of amendments to this bill to address what we see as 
 further problems in the aged care sector. However, Labor will support the broad concept of this bill, in particular the amendments designed to ensure that people in rural and remote areas who own houses worth less than $23,000 are not denied concessional resident status. As a Queensland senator, I find this of particular importance. As the Senate is aware, Queensland is the most decentralised state in Australia, so this amendment is very important to us.
The history of this government's aged care reforms have read like a circus program, backflip after backflip. Indeed, in March 1998, the government introduced the Aged Care Amendment Bill 1998, but let it lapse so as to minimise their exposure on the issue as the 1998 election approached. The government had been aware of the serious flaws in the Aged Care Act since at least March last year, and only now do they act to rectify this.
This bill also has provisions to ensure that nursing home patients before October 1997 will be refunded any accommodation fees they may have been charged, in contravention of the Prime Minister's promise to the contrary. And where did the Prime Minister announce this backflip? Not in parliament. No. He showed utter contempt for this institution by announcing the change on A Current Affair. Labor can quite proudly claim responsibility for this measure, as the Prime Minister only changed tack after almost 18 months of ALP pressure.
Nursing homes and aged care is an issue of particular importance to me and the people of Queensland. In my home of Ipswich and surroundings, we have some of the highest median ages in the country. In the electorate of Moreton, 16.5 per cent of the population is over 65 years old. In Coolangatta the median age is around 60 years. The Gold Coast has the highest median age in the country. My electorate office is constantly fielding questions from worried and scared older Australians and their families about the devastating effects of this government's relentless cuts to the aged care sector. 	Yet nursing home service in Queensland has been reduced to the worst in the country. We have the highest waiting lists, lowest funding and worst paid 
 nurses in the country. Now we see the further deskilling of enrolled nurses and assistants in nursing. A 12-month report on the impact of aged care reform on nurses in Queensland compiled by the Queensland Nurses Union shows that staffing hours for all nurses have been cut in more than 50 per cent of nursing homes. Almost 30 per cent of providers directly attribute these cuts to the new resident classification scale introduced by this government. This all adds up to a reduction in the quality of care for nursing home residents, and an increase in stress and anxiety for residents and their families.
The report details changes occurring in the aged care sector in Queensland. The report says that staff have reported increasing work loads; problems with accessing leave; cuts in hours and accompanying changes to skills mix; inability to take meal breaks; an increase in the performance of unpaid overtime; lack of access to training and professional development; pressure on nurses to perform non-nursing duties; and pressure on non-nursing staff to undertake nursing duties. This can only do one thing to the care given to patients, and that is force it down.
The Queensland Nurses Union Secretary, Gay Hawkesworth, said:
There is a notion in some sections of the aged care industry that nursing homes are just homes for elderly people and that they don't need proper nursing staff levels. This idea defies reality. Nursing homes should not be confused with retirement villages. While people in nursing homes are usually referred to as residents for reasons of dignity, they are really patients requiring specialised geriatric health services.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Most people go into nursing homes as a last resort—when they are too sick to look after themselves or be cared for by relatives. Most go directly from hospital and all require nursing and medical care.
Queensland has the second-worst waiting list for nursing homes in the country—behind the Northern Territory. In Queensland in 1998-99, the average waiting period for a nursing home bed was 93 days, compared with 68 days nationally. In the past three years, waiting lists in Queensland have increased by almost 50 per cent, more than double the national 
 increase. Queensland has also seen a nearly 60 per cent increase in waiting periods in remote areas, up to 93 days.
Evidence provided to the Queensland Nurses Union shows that, in many of the better nursing homes, waiting lists can be up to 18 months. This is a national disgrace. What a way to celebrate and recognise the International Year of Older Persons—making them wait up to 18 months for a nursing home bed. Rather than reduce waiting lists, this government's incompetence over the last three years has caused a national increase of 21 per cent. If this isn't bad enough, when older Australians do finally get a bed in a nursing home, thanks to this government they do not receive the high quality of medical and nursing care they so desperately need and deserve.
A story in the Courier-Mail on 27 July titled `Nursing home terror' claimed:
Some Queensland nursing home residents are living in a culture of terror in which they are subjected to gross degradations, including freezing showers on winter mornings [and] verbal and physical abuse, chemical restraint of patients and starvation.
This is most certainly not the way we expect our older Australians to be cared for. Senator Harradine's unforgettable line in his GST speech on 14 May 1999—`The true test of a civilised society is how it regards and treats its most vulnerable'—is, I think, very apt in the current debate on aged care. This government has well and truly failed this test.
The Aged Care Act removed any detailed regulations as to the ratio of nurses to patients. This has led to the deskilling of nursing staff, as some providers seek to make a quick buck. This has led to a further reduction in the quality of care provided to nursing home patients. This bill does nothing to rectify this situation. Qualified, dedicated and committed nurses will not continue to work under such appalling conditions, where their skills are not adequately recognised and, after five years of being an `aged care worker', they lose their practising licence. These qualified nurses will be replaced with underqualified aged care workers, thus further reducing the standard of care given to our older Australians.
In many nursing homes in Queensland, patients receive less than 1.8 hours of nursing care per day, with there often only being one registered nurse to care for between 30 and 60 patients. The Nurses Union says there should be one registered nurse for between 10 and 25 patients—not 60. Under the guise of deregulation, the government has removed the requirement that at nursing homes with more than eight high-care residents there be 24-hour registered nurse coverage. This further reduces the quality of care being provided for older Australians in nursing homes.
The last thing this side of the chamber wants is to return to the pre-1985 days, when lack of regulation allowed bad practices and low quality of care to flourish. We cannot let cost minimisation be the be-all and end-all of aged care. Nursing is a job where another person's life is at stake, requiring great training and responsibilities. We do not want second-rate aged carers; we need trained nurses.
Aged care reform, with its focus on the reduction of government funding, deregulation and user pays, has resulted in both staff and residents feeling insecure—insecure about whether high standards of care will continue to be maintained in Queensland. This government's only concern is to minimise costs, regardless of the effect on patient care.
In other nursing homes, nursing staff are required to do non-nursing domestic duties, like washing dishes and cleaning toilets. Queensland nursing homes have the highest qualified toilet cleaners and the lowest qualified aged care workers in the Western world. Nurses are caught in the dilemma of having to decide between washing the dishes and caring for their patients. This is bizarre, to say the least. Nurses should be doing what they do best—caring for their patients, not washing dishes.
Queensland also has the lowest funding for aged care in the country. The standard hourly rate determines the amount the government pays nursing homes. This rate is set at different levels in different states, with the rate paid in Queensland being the lowest of all the states. Why are older Australians in Queensland considered less worthy than nursing 
 home patients in the other states? We know there are plans to rectify this situation. We welcome the government's move to increase nursing home funding in Queensland, but not the coalescence policy of slowly increasing funding. Funding needs to be increased now. The patients need it.
Queensland nurses are also the worst paid in the country. It does not take a rocket scientist or even a Liberal minister to work out what this means. Poor remuneration naturally means that highly qualified nurses either leave the sector or move to another state in order to improve their salaries. This is yet another attack on the quality of care in Queensland nursing homes.
This government has also removed key accountability measures which ensured that moneys given to nursing homes for wages or capital improvements were in fact spent on wages or capital improvements. The accommodation bond, the daily fee from nursing home residents or the subsidy from the government is supposed to be spent on capital improvement, yet there are no accountability measures to ensure that this money is in fact spent on capital improvement and not simply pocketed by shonky proprietors or spent in other areas.
Some disreputable operators are seeking to increase their profits by cutting services and skimming more money off the top, even though patient requirements have not changed. This means that the government will be inadvertently lining some proprietors' pockets to the tune of $142 million in 1999-2000, to the detriment of older Australians. I am sure this is not the intention of the government. It is this significant problem that our amendment seeks to address.
It is an issue that does urgently need to be addressed, and I will outline one scenario to prove the point. Queensland nursing home owners Kerry and Malcolm Bishop were recently sentenced to four years and three years imprisonment respectively for defrauding the Commonwealth government of over $130,000. The couple pleaded guilty to one count each of being knowingly concerned with the defrauding of the Commonwealth between 1987 and 1994. This involved claim 
 ing that domestic staff were performing nursing duties.
In another instance, they claimed that clerical staff in Melbourne were performing nursing duties in Queensland and that gardeners performed occupational therapy. This case was picked up under our CAM and OCRE systems, which require proper auditing and accounting. But, under this government's system, there are no accountability mechanisms, no way of finding out if this sort of thing is going on all the time. Even the judge criticised the new system, stating:
. . . the Commonwealth had developed programs which depended very greatly on the honesty of nursing home proprietors.
Evidence provided to the Queensland Nurses Union shows that this is not an infrequent occurrence.
We all know that not all nursing home owners or proprietors are dishonest—and I am sure the main bulk of them are not—but you always get the few who will take advantage and will do the damage. I urge the government to support the ALP's amendment to stop this systematic rorting and fraud by a very small number of providers to ensure that money designed for capital improvement is spent on exactly that.
In conclusion, this government has presided over some of the worst reforms of the aged care sector in Australia's history. I am glad to see that it has recognised some of its errors, and this bill is a good first step in improving the aged care area. But there is still a long way to go. We should not and cannot accept waiting lists of up to 18 months for some nursing homes, putting the lives of older Australians at risk.
We should not and cannot accept the replacement of highly qualified and trained nurses with underqualified aged care workers. Nor should we accept the lack of accountability in this sector. We must ensure that money destined for capital works actually gets there. Queenslanders will not accept the fact that Queensland nursing homes are the worst funded and Queensland nurses are the worst paid in the country. Most importantly, the citizens of this country should not and cannot 
 accept the government's slash and burn approach to aged care.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-09-23,"—The specific details of the Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999  and the opposition's response to it have been already covered in some detail by my colleague Senator Evans and other speakers for the opposition. So I will not take up the time of the Senate by going into those matters again, but I will make a few comments in relation to the broad issue of aged care and this legislation particularly. I do so because I recall that one of my first duties as a parliamentary secretary for the opposition was to put forward our amendments to the original aged care legislation that was introduced by the government back in 1997.
I will come back to that in a moment, but I cannot let go without some comment the rather outrageous assertions by Senator Allison last night on behalf of the Democrats when she attacked the opposition over our record on aged care. I actually found it interesting that Senator Allison predicted that the opposition would have a go at the Democrats in this debate. I thought, `Why would she predict that?' Of course, when you are guilty and you know you are guilty, you can actually stand up and acknowledge that some criticism will be forthcoming; and Senator Allison knew that. Nevertheless, in relation to when the aged care legislation first came before the parliament and was finally passed, Senator Allison yesterday said:
The Democrats gave qualified support to the government's initial aged care reform package . . . 
That is not quite as I remember it. What I remember was a Senate inquiry which looked in some detail at the issues and at the government's proposals, the key point of which at that time was the introduction of accommodation bonds for nursing home residents. There was extensive debate in this chamber over a number of days. Senator Woodley, who was then the spokesman for the Democrats, expressed his very serious concern and, I believe, genuine concern, knowing his long interest and involvement in this issue, at the government's proposals.
But what happened? As has now become quite a common occurrence, the Democrats rolled over at the eleventh hour and caved in on the issue of accommodation bonds. They did so because the government, forced into backtracking on its original proposals, agreed to some additional payments for concessional residents—something that we and the Democrats had been urging the government to do. But, because the government was forced to cave in on that issue, the Democrats caved in and agreed to accommodation bonds. They were not even prepared to accept our fall-back propositions that the introduction of accommodation bonds be delayed for some time to allow further examination of it. No, it came in from 1 October 1997.
Well, what happened? Within about a month—within probably about a week, from my recollection—the screams and the howls could be heard right around the country. This was an absolutely disastrous policy development and it put the aged care industry in chaos. The government's own protestations by the then minister, Mrs Moylan—who, I note, is no longer on the front bench; she was relieved of her duties because of her incompetence on this issue—and the Prime Minister were simply untrue. They were saying, `No-one will have to sell their house to find the money to put up an accommodation bond to get a spot in a nursing home.' Evidence was brought forward very quickly that people were being pressured into having to dispose of their assets and properties to get a bed in a nursing home.
What happened? The government was forced to walk away from that proposition, to abandon it. So we then had a new minister appointed, Mr Warwick Smith. Not only is he no longer on the front bench of the government; he is not even in the parliament. The people of the electorate of Bass certainly reflected very quickly their attitude to his handling of this portfolio at the last election. Mr Smith introduced certain proposals and legislation to deal with the changes that they were making in respect of moving from accommodation bonds to the $12 per day accommodation charge and a range of other issues. 
But subsequently the government—knowing that when the spotlight focused upon that legislation there would be very serious exposure of the problems that their aged care bill had created—withdrew the bill. Throughout all of this, the Democrats—whilst I do not blame them entirely; at the end of the day this was not their legislation—did agree to the original proposal. It is only now in this bill that some of those problems are finally being addressed.
Senator Allison has also indicated on behalf of the Democrats—and I hope she really does rethink this position—that they cannot support the opposition's amendments. She said:
While the Democrats have some sympathy with the sentiment which obviously lies behind some of those changes, we will not be able to support them, because neither we nor the industry saw them until just a short time ago.
The position is really this: what is contained within the opposition's amendments reflects the views and propositions that the opposition has put forward for some time now—that is, they deal with the situation where the moneys raised from the accommodation charge, paid for by the residents, are not necessarily in all cases being used for their main purpose, which is to rebuild the infrastructure within our nursing homes and to be reinvested as capital into the nursing home sector.
We have pointed out time and time again that there are loopholes and unscrupulous operators who can basically end up taking this money and using it for their own retirement package rather than using it for the purposes for which it is intended. That is what our amendments go to. The fact that the Democrats may have received them, I understand, a couple of days ago does not detract from the fact that they and the government have been aware of what our position has been on these issues all along.
I have to go further and say this: it really is crocodile tears from the Democrats to be saying, `Oh, we can't support the opposition's amendments because we haven't had enough time to see them.' I would think that that is a reasonable point to make if it was put forward as a genuine argument, but it is not. This has been put forward by the party, the 
 Democrats, that did a deal with the government on the GST with hundreds of amendments and then guillotined it through this chamber in the last weeks of sitting before we rose at the end of June. They gave the opposition virtually no time at all to consider the implications of those amendments. And that was for one of the most fundamental legislative changes for many years, virtually reconstructing the taxation system in this country.
We were given virtually no opportunity to properly consider their amendments, and here we have the Democrats saying, `Oh, well, we haven't had time so we're going to vote against yours.' Having not been content with doing that on the GST, at around the same time they did it on the environment bill. They did a last minute deal again with the government on the environment and biodiversity bill. They brought over 500 amendments into this chamber. The opposition had virtually no time to consider them. They were being presented to us as the debate was going on. Again, by weight of numbers with the government, they pushed them through.
Frankly, this is just a nonsense proposition. I noticed at the time that Senator Allison had a smile on her face when she was putting the argument forward because I think even she recognised the ridiculous proposition she was putting. As I understand it, at the end of the second reading stage we are likely to adjourn consideration of this bill and come back to it next week. So there will be further time available for the Democrats to properly consider our amendments.
I turn quickly to a couple of aspects of this legislation that I wanted to touch upon. As I said, the government's original legislation introduced the system of accommodation bonds. That proved to be an unmitigated disaster, as we said it would. They then changed to the system which requires residents of nursing homes after 1 October 1997 who meet the criteria to pay an accommodation charge of $12 per day. As we have pointed out—and this has been identified throughout estimates hearings and questions here in the chamber in question time and in other debates, particularly by my colleague Senator Evans—there have been instances 
 where people who were residents before 1 October 1997 have been hit with that charge, quite contrary to the intent of the legislation.
There have been situations where the nursing home or sections of a nursing home may have been closed down and the residents transferred to a new facility or another part of the facility and then those unscrupulous operators have treated those people as new entrants or as new residents and levied accommodation charges upon them. There have been a variety of these types of unscrupulous activities. Fortunately, it is not the norm throughout the industry. Nevertheless, even when it happens only once it needs to be highlighted and exposed. This legislation does finally give some legislative weight to the promises that have been made by the Prime Minister and the minister over time—that is, those situations will be corrected and the operators will be forced to return the funds to residents who have been incorrectly charged.
The second aspect of the legislation that I point to is that there have been situations where, because of breaches of the requirements of this act and the previous act, the ability to operate should have been revoked. However, because of some technical deficiencies, albeit brought about by the government repealing the previous act and not providing for it in the current act, some operators who may have committed breaches prior to 1 October 1997 are still able to continue operating notwithstanding their past record.
I understand that the legislation also deals with a range of other issues, particularly some amelioration in the assets test, and clarifies situations regarding patients or people who enter a nursing home with a mental impairment. We welcome those aspects of the legislation that do correct anomalies and improve the position. We point out, as we have strongly pointed out throughout this entire debate over the last couple of years, that it was necessary for the government to amend its own legislation to fix up problems which it largely is responsible for.
The fact of the matter is that since this government came to office its approach to aged care has been one where its eyes have 
 been trained more upon the interests of the operators than the specific needs of the residents. It seems that it still has a view that what matters most is the position of the operators, particularly those who treat this as a commercial business rather than this being a service which is provided by a combination of government and private sector and particularly charitable and religious organisation support.
With those remarks, I look forward to the committee stage and hope that the Democrats in particular will take the blinkers off, will pause their current rather long running romance with the government, in which they will do a deal on everything, and will properly consider our amendments.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-09-23,"—This is an important debate relating to the Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999 , and a number of comments have been made by the various speakers in the Senate over the past couple of days. Certainly a number of the issues that have been brought to the attention of the government are important to note. However, I also note that to a very large degree the ALP speakers have, in effect, engaged in what I can only describe as sanctimonious hectoring and have indicated that they have put forward amendments which will not be acceptable to the Senate and therefore are not obviously in tune with this very important issue in the community.
I think the only speaker who raised substantive questions in his contribution was Senator Quirke. Senator Quirke was making a point with regard to the South Australian resident classification reviews and implied that there was a higher rate of downgrade in his state. I can say only that Senator Quirke is obviously using old data which is out of date. Creditably, Minister Bishop took action to improve consistency in the approach between states. I am happy to report to Senator Quirke—if he has not been able to get his information up to date and to ascertain this—that South Australia is now comparable with the national average and, in the July-August downgrades, appears to be below the national average. I 
 hope that Senator Quirke will acknowledge that and will also acknowledge that the government has responded and was never going to threaten this important viability.
The Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999  formalises the accommodation charge in principal legislation and introduces a range of resident protection measures. It also addresses anomalies in the act in relation to the revocation of approved provider status and the imposition of sanctions for breaches of approved provider responsibilities under previous aged care legislation. This bill also implements the 1999 budget initiative to exempt from paying an accommodation charge those nursing home residents who were in care at the commencement of the Aged Care Act 1997 and who would otherwise have been liable to pay an accommodation charge on moving to another aged care service. The implementation date for the budget initiative was 1 July 1999.
The initiative ensures that those residents who have already moved will be reimbursed for accommodation charges already paid. Some residents have already moved, paid an accommodation charge and rented their homes to pay the charge. In these cases, the exemption of home and rental income from the pension income and assets tests will continue. This will be achieved through amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.
Due to Labor's refusal to accord the bill non-controversial status, the bill could not be passed through the Senate in time to implement the budget initiative by the stated date of 1 July 1999. Labor's refusal to pass the legislation is disadvantaging many older Australians who are currently still paying the charge because of the delay. People who were in nursing homes when the Aged Care Act 1997 was introduced can still be asked to pay an accommodation charge on moving to another facility after 1 July 1999. The repayment of charges already paid by qualifying residents is delayed pending passage of the legislation.
The government amendment to the bill simply changes the implementation date of the budget initiative from 1 July 1999 to the 
 date of passage of the bill due to Labor's refusal to pass the bill in the last sitting of parliament. The amendment is necessary to ensure that elderly Australians do not suffer as a result of Labor's delays in passing the legislation.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The parliamentary secretary is deliberately misleading the Senate. The timing of the legislation listed on the paper is a matter for the government. They list it when they are ready. There has been no delay by the Labor opposition. They can bring it on whenever they like. It is clearly misleading for the parliamentary secretary to claim, as he has been trying to, that we have delayed the legislation.
—Senator Evans, there is no point of order. That is a debating point which you can take up later.
—The government's amendments ensure that people who become charge exempt residents after 1 July 1999 but before the passage of the Aged Care Amendment (Omnibus) Bill 1999  are covered by the provisions exempting the principal home and rental income earned on a principal home to pay for accommodation charges from the pension income and assets tests. The government's amendment fully implements the election commitment to ensure that residents of nursing homes on 1 September 1997 do not pay the accommodation charge on moving to another facility, including those who move after the proposed implementation date of 1 July 1999, as stated in the budget. The amendment is required only as a result of Labor's unnecessary and cynical delays and ensures that elderly residents who qualify as charge exempt residents after 1 July 1999 are not disadvantaged by Labor's intransigence.
It is important to note that other important resident protection measures have also been delayed by Labor's refusal to pass the legislation. These include: ensuring that elderly people are not inappropriately charged pre-entry leave fees, extending deadlines for entering agreements where a resident has a mental impairment, formalising in principal 
 legislation the qualifying period of co-residence of a carer from five to two years for the home to be exempted from the assets test, ensuring that residents paying accommodation charges have the same protections as residents paying accommodation bonds and allowing those residents who move from a hostel to a nursing home to negotiate a rollover of bonds. I have seen the opposition amendments, even though they were provided only late last night. It is definitely not a case of better late than never.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Tambling is deliberately misleading the Senate again. The government received the amendments on Tuesday. I wish you would correct the record.
—There is no point of order, Senator Evans. You can again take that up as a debating point.
—I do acknowledge the point made by Senator Evans with regard to the availability of the amendments, which did come in on Tuesday. I should have corrected that point; I correct that point now. Unlike the government amendments, which have been out in the public arena for months, the opposition amendments have not been subject to consultation. Industry and consumers have had no chance to comment. Patently, the opposition is not interested in their views. Looking at these amendments, it is no wonder. These opposition amendments would condemn aged care residents to inadequate care in substandard facilities. Providers would be hamstrung in their attempts to manage their finances effectively, to transfer their places to better quality services or to attract finance to make necessary improvements.
 The amendments would encourage older people and their legal representatives to give away their homes to attract additional taxpayer subsidies of around $4,000 a year—subsidies that are intended for genuinely financially disadvantaged older people. However—and this is the nasty twist—older people who did this could be much worse off. They could lose their pensions and face 
 higher fees due to Centrelink and Veterans' Affairs gifting provisions.
I note also that Labor provided another amendment this morning—again, no consultation and, again, totally unworkable. In fact, the draft amendment that I saw did not even spell `Labor' properly. I do not know which country the drafter came from in that they cannot recognise the proper spelling of the Labor Party in Australia. This morning's amendment is a complete shambles. The opposition has already delayed this legislation long enough. Every day over 2,000 older people who were in nursing homes before October 1997 are paying an accommodation charge that is totally unnecessary. They are sick of waiting for this legislation to be proclaimed so their money can be refunded. How much longer will they have to wait?
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.
Ordered that consideration of this bill in committee of the whole be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (OMNIBUS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-23,"—The National Health Amendment (Lifetime Health Cover) Bill 1999  implements the major health initiative contained in the 1999 budget. The objective is to bring the premiums for private health insurance more into line with the actuarial costs by charging an additional two per cent for every year after the age of 30 that a person waits before entering a private health insurance scheme.
There is no imperative to join private health insurance, as the public system provided by Medicare is a universal system that is available to everyone. However, there is logic in ensuring that those who seek additional benefits through private health insurance should pay in proportion to the likelihood that 
 they will draw on the scheme. House insurance and car insurance are fully risk rated, and there is no dispute over this form of charging.
The opposition does not oppose the introduction of lifetime committee rating. However, we believe the scheme that the government has dubbed `lifetime health cover' falls a long way short of being a great reform. It has been hastily designed and poorly executed. The opposition has always said that it supports the private health sector working to complement Medicare. Most other OECD countries have private health insurance available to provide a service to a particular part of the community that wants, and can afford, such a product.
Where we part company with the government is on its fixation that membership of private health insurance has to be artificially boosted at public expense. We strongly object to the $1.7 billion government rebate and we will oppose measures that limit access to the public hospital system or anything that results in resources being taken from the public sector to subsidise the private sector. Lifetime health cover is a step away from community rating but its design is confused, and the opposition will be proposing a number of measures to improve the scheme to make it more workable and fairer.
The consultant actuaries who designed the original scheme worked on the assumption that the proportion of people covered by private health insurance would increase to 36 per cent. If lifetime health cover succeeds in this goal, it will create two major problems. Firstly, it will result in $200 million being clawed back from public hospitals under the Australian health care agreements without any evidence being necessary that the pressure on public hospitals had been reduced. Secondly, it may worsen the degree of adverse selection within the health funds. The people who are most likely to join in the next 12 months are those between the ages of 50 and 65. Those over 65 have been given an exemption but, if a lot of middle-aged people join, the funds may develop a very skewed age profile. If so, this will give them serious financial problems 
 in a decade when those members start making large claims.
This legislation was prepared in haste by a government that prefers to cloak itself in secrecy. The result was that the design of the scheme was flawed and the execution of the politically motivated exemptions failed the test of fairness or consistency. The secret reports prepared for the government by actuaries were forced into the light of day only after the bill had been passed in the House of Representatives. If it were not for the work of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee there would not have been any detailed scrutiny of this bill and the government would have imposed a flawed scheme.
The government claimed that it had consulted widely on the detail of the lifetime health cover. It was evident from the submissions that, although there had been consultation on the concept, there had been virtually no consultation on the detail. Substantial changes were made to the design of the scheme as announced in the budget for political motives which, in the view of some witnesses at the inquiry, undermined the intent of the scheme. For example, the rationale for excluding over-65-year-olds without excluding other retirees on pensions was weak. No explanation was given for the decision to drop the recommended discounts for young people.
The Senate committee looked carefully at what impact lifetime health cover would have on the viability of private health insurance and the flow-on impact for the public hospital system. The committee did not get a clear picture about the likely effect of lifetime health cover on overall membership. Trowbridge argued that there would not be a very large increase in health fund membership but foresaw a surge during the period of grace.
The problems that lifetime health cover is meant to solve may in fact get worse. Health funds warn that adverse selection would be increased by the grace period arrangements. Short-term membership to cover particular treatment requirements—or hit-and-run behaviour—may well increase in the view of econo 
 mists and even Medibank Private. People over 65 and young mothers are apparently the most frequent groups involved in hit-and-run memberships, and both groups were largely insulated from any impact of lifetime health cover. MBF cautioned that medical gaps remained the major source of complaint and dissatisfaction. It did not foresee any improvement in participation until the gap issue was resolved, apart from the short-term impact during the holiday period.
A number of industry witnesses who previously had forecast a large increase in participation due to the 30 per cent rebate now were pleased that the rebate had simply stabilised participation. Others, including the AMA, warned that, like the 30 per cent rebate, lifetime health cover would not work as a panacea to the underlying problems of the private health funds. The bottom line is that it is very likely that lifetime health cover would have the effect of inducing a short-term rush into the scheme followed by a virtual freeze-out of many consumers who would face high penalties to later change their minds.
Medibank Private expected a significant reduction in recruitment of members over 30, and said its future marketing activities would focus on those under 31 and those already in the industry. Clearly this would reduce future growth prospects substantially. Private health insurance will become a poor option for new migrants to this country when compared with Medicare. The market for selling private health insurance would be substantially reduced with a new focus on those just turning 30 and those currently over 65.
I will now turn to the specific concerns raised during the inquiry that will be dealt with by amendments to be moved by the Labor Party. The most important amendment is the removal of the clawback provision under the Australian health care agreements that provides for the states to lose up to $200 million in funding if the participation rate in private health insurance exceeds 36 per cent. The current rate is 30.5 per cent, but this could rise if the government's proposed advertising scares people into joining. Lifetime health cover targets young healthy 
 people and will not produce a significant drop in public hospital usage even if it succeeds in increasing coverage. The clawback provisions were agreed prior to lifetime health cover being proposed, and therefore they would have an unanticipated punitive effect on the states.
Particular concern was raised at the hearings by the Institute of Actuaries and HCF that many people would join the fund for a short time in June 2000 to get the benefit of being a member on the critical date. There is nothing to stop a person joining for just one month next June to gain a permanent exemption from the impact of higher premiums. At little cost a person of any age can acquire the nominal age of 30. Wouldn't we all like to be 30 again! This is a potential rort that will be of great interest to accountants looking for novel advice for their clients. HCF describe this as `join and lapse behaviour', and argued it was a major flaw in the design of the scheme and one that would cost the industry heavily in the future. The minister has since acknowledged this problem and foreshadowed his intention to produce an amendment requiring people to hold membership for from three to 12 months.
Another potential rort is that there is no deterrent to a person buying a low value policy and upgrading when they need to use a hospital—apart from the normal waiting times. These policies, with large front-end deductibles and exclusions, have become popular as a way to avoid the Medicare surcharge. Several solutions to this problem have been proposed, although most are very complicated, involving using the ratio of the values of premiums in calculation of the penalty to be paid after an upgrade. Perhaps the simplest way to curb misuse would be to limit the extent of the front-end deductible to $500 and ban exclusionary products. The proposed scheme is completely cancelled out by the current reinsurance pool arrangements. The government has been moving slowly on this issue because it is unwilling to act, as it would disturb some of the smaller, less sufficient funds. The opposition proposes to set a deadline to require the minister to adopt new rules for the reinsurance pool by 30 June 
 2000 that do not discourage efficiency. The Senate committee heard about a range of concerns raised by groups in submissions and during evidence. These suggest that there are several areas where the design of the scheme should be improved and anomalies removed. This would improve the overall fairness of the proposed system.
The Trowbridge report makes it clear that the selection of the cut-off at 65 years old was arbitrary. The department has not clearly stated the foundation for choosing 65 as a cut-off point, but it appears to be based on the perception that 65 is the normal retirement age, after which the greater majority of people live on fixed incomes. This is also the view argued by Medibank Private in support of the cut-off at 65 years. The Consumers Health Forum said its members were concerned the scheme would discriminate against elderly consumers. Other motives mentioned were not to put older people under pressure during the grace period and not to induce a sudden increase in adverse risk by pushing large numbers of older people into private health insurance. The logic of these arguments has just as much force when applied to others who are retired and living on limited incomes, most notably women over 60 receiving the age pension and those on veterans pensions. They are in the same situation as other people over 65 because, in just the same way, the recent emergence of lifetime health cover was unanticipated and they are unable to adjust their plans to accommodate joining earlier than they ought. From an actuarial viewpoint there is also no benefit to the funds if this group is left exposed and is pressured into joining health insurance. Over time its claims will exceed its contributions, weakening the viability of funds, not strengthening it.
The National Youth Initiative submitted that the reaction of young people was most likely to be adverse. They argued that most young people who had taken out health insurance did so because their parents had or because they were in the minority who had sufficient disposable income to afford it. They reported strong support for universal health care through Medicare and lack of interest in private health insurance because the cost 
 structure was weighted against young people. They concluded that the bill is `well intentioned but likely to miss its target'.
The purpose of lifetime health cover is meant to be to  give incentives to young people, but it fails to deliver them. Contrary to the original design, there is no discount for people who join at a young age, even though they are contributing far in excess of their demand on the insurance pool. In the original scheme there were to be discounts for people under the age of 35. In the same way that older people were to be charged a penalty premium for joining late, younger people were to be given a discount of 2.5 per cent. Trowbridge emphasised this would make lifetime health cover attractive relative to the existing system. The long-term strength of the funds depends on young people joining, and it is unrealistic to expect them to do so when insurance offers them such poor value. It would be feasible to retain the original structure recommended by Trowbridge by giving those under 30 a two per cent discount for each year prior to the age of 30 that they joined. The financial cost to the funds would be offset if more young people joined or otherwise by fractionally higher premium increases over the years. Overall it would further reduce the extent to which young people cross-subsidise older groups.
I note that, in the week since the opposition announced its intention to modify the scheme, the government has not produced any actuarial evidence that such a move would weaken the scheme. The government's arguments have been based on the earlier scheme that Trowbridge produced, which was based on 2.5 per cent discounts from the age of 35. The opposition's proposal is much more modest and would, averaged across other members, impact less than two per cent on the long-term price of health insurance. The evidence presented to the Senate inquiry demonstrated that young people made very low claims and, even with a discount, would be providing a cross-subsidy to older members.
There seems little logic in imposing such a contribution level on young people when they are financially stretched. If the concept is to give an incentive, then there must be some 
 thing tangible to attract people when they are healthy and facing numerous other financial demands at a time of typically lower income. The only counterargument advanced was the claims pattern of young women for obstetrics, which peaks in their early 30s. This suggests that the funds should re-examine the pricing of the products and the benefits for childbirth, rather than denying all young people a product at a reasonable price free of cross-subsidy to older groups.
The bill treats harshly those who have been long-term members but have let their membership lapse. For example, a 59-year-old retiree who held membership for a total of 20 years in their working life but did not have it on 1 July 2000 would get a penalty premium of 58 per cent. Under the opposition's amendments, a person with this record would only get penalty premium of 18 per cent. There has been no justification given of why future periods of membership are to be included in the calculation of the penalty premiums but past ones are not. Older people without current coverage feel justifiably aggrieved that their past loyalty counts for nothing under the new arrangements.
The current provisions for hardship are limited to approval by the minister under special circumstances notified within two years of commencement of the scheme, determined in accordance with regulations. In Labor's view, this is unduly restrictive. It is likely that the minister will not personally consider hardship cases and the question will be determined bureaucratically in accordance with fixed regulations. This seems a most inappropriate manner to resolve questions of hardship.
This is particularly the case given that there is already a Private Health Insurance Ombudsman, who would seem to be equipped to consider such subjective issues as might be raised by the complex personal circumstances of individuals. It is not hard to imagine that there will be unforeseen cases where there is conflict between the rules and an individual's circumstances—for example, where people were out of Australia at key times, when important information was not provided to them, when guardians acted against their 
 long-term interests or when memberships lapsed at a critical point in time.
There should be a wider power for the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to make a determination of hardship at any time. The ombudsman should also be able to resolve any disputes that arise about the correct age of a person when documentary evidence of birth is not present or where it is unclear what prior history of membership the person has. Remember that many people will have to demonstrate that they were born prior to 1 July 1934 in countries for which records of that time may not now exist.
The design of lifetime health cover gives no special treatment to migrants to Australia. On the basis that they have not made a prior contribution to Australia's health system, they are given the same penalties as those who choose not to join private health insurance, even though they did not have the opportunity to participate earlier. The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman argued that the rules applying to migrants as a whole were too harsh and some provision should be made for people who have shown a commitment in their country of origin. He also pointed out that some funds recognise people transferring from overseas funds by dropping the waiting periods.
The Private Health Insurance Ombudsman approved of a number of features of the scheme that he believed would retain consumer rights as they presently existed. However, he did recommend, on the basis of his experience with complaints, that it would be important for funds to be required to notify non-contributors when their partner stops making payments. The ombudsman also recommended that the legislation should contain a review mechanism. This is a sensible suggestion, and the opposition will move to ensure that it is a requirement in the legislation.
In conclusion, lifetime health cover has been promoted as a complete solution for the ailing private health insurance industry. But the government knows that at best it is just a small step forward for the private health insurance industry. It is time the industry underwent a thorough process of internal 
 reform that tackles three major issues: the inefficiency of the funds, the failure to control costs and the gap payments that are the major disincentive to consumers retaining their health insurance.
The opposition will support this bill, but it wants the industry and the government to be under no misapprehension that the industry must sort out its own problems. If lifetime health cover is a failure or, as I previously warned, it increases adverse selection and freezes out new purchasers of insurance, then the industry should not expect to be able to run to the government of the day for yet another handout. I look forward to discussing these issues in more detail as we move to the committee stage and hope that in a positive process we can improve the bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (LIFETIME HEALTH COVER) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-09-23,"—The Democrats, along with the opposition—and, indeed, most health experts and consumer groups—support the underlying principles of the National Health Amendment (Lifetime Health Cover) Bill 1999 . It is basically aimed at encouraging stability within private health insurance. Lifetime health cover has the support of the private health industry—and I include there doctors, specialists generally, private hospitals and certainly the health funds themselves. It is also supported by such consumer organisations as the Council on the Ageing and the Association of Independent Retirees, representing the group that I guess will have the most in the longer term to gain from these measures.
I can certainly say on behalf of the Democrats that this measure to encourage people to stay in, if not join, health funds is a lot better than other government ideas and other government measures. In particular, it is a much better response than the 30 per cent rebate. It is certainly very pleasing to note that this scheme does not involve any government expenditure. It is now going to be, to some extent, over to the funds to advertise and indeed to provide products that meet consumers' needs far better than they do at the moment. So there is no ongoing expenditure on behalf of the government.
However, we believe that on its own this is not the magic solution—that it is not going to substantially increase the number of people who are choosing to either purchase private health insurance or stay with an existing provider. This is because it does not address some of the key issues and, in particular, gap payments. This has been a long-term issue. Virtually every time we discuss health or talk about private health insurance in this place we get back to the issue of gaps and how best to deal with them. The Democrats' concern is not just for those people who have private health insurance; it is for all consumers who attend a doctor's surgery or perhaps book themselves in for some procedure only to find at the end of the time that there are a couple of dollars, maybe a couple of hundred dollars or, in some cases, several thousand dollars yet to be paid—money that they were not aware of needing to save or indeed to spend. We have had further discussions with the minister on this issue, and I will look in more detail at that in a moment.
As we deal with this particular bill, one of our main concerns is to ensure that no group would be disadvantaged by the introduction of the scheme and, in particular, to ensure that the public health system would not be disadvantaged in any way by the introduction of this scheme. The first task of any government should be to maintain a high quality public health system. We would not support any legislation that had the ability to threaten in any way such a public health system or to undermine its ability to provide very high quality care. So we are very pleased that the government has agreed to two new measures associated with the introduction of this lifetime health cover.
The first of these measures addresses our concerns regarding the public health system and gap payments. I note with interest issues raised in committee and issues raised by the Labor Party both in this place a moment ago and by amendment. We do not believe that, with the Medicare agreements signed and sealed, and indeed with the consent of federal parliament, we should now be changing the fine print of those agreements. But obviously it is a problem. When the agreements were 
 signed there was nothing in the pipeline even vaguely resembling this that the government had committed to do.
There have been discussions on and some examination of this issue. Indeed the funds themselves were quite interested in it, but it was not considered by the states at the time the Medicare agreement was signed—and nor was the 30 per cent rebate. So we are putting in place measures that do affect that Medicare agreement. I guess it is like building a house and starting to shuffle around the foundations. There is a need for government to recognise that there are potential threats to the public health system.
We have a commitment from government that public hospitals will not lose revenue due to the clawback provisions under the Medicare agreement. I will table a letter in a moment saying that the government agrees that, over the life of the current health care agreement 1998-2003, no state or territory will be worse off as a result of the clawback provisions in the health care agreement. As we move into the committee stage of this bill, we will be tabling further information on the process of that.
One of my real interests in all of this is that we might actually start getting some figures out of the states. If the states have to show that there is a problem, we might finally start finding out what Mr Kennett has been spending and in which hospitals in Victoria, in particular what is happening in some of the private hospitals. I am very keen to have a look at the whole issue of the states actually having to show what is being spent.
The states keep blaming the Commonwealth every time there is a problem in a public hospital. Now they are actually going to have to put the information on the table and prove that they do have a problem. Indeed, the Commonwealth has to show us in detail that there is no difficulty before they take any money back. So it is a significant measure. It will ensure that the public health system, which is where most Australians receive their care, is not going to suffer financially because of any of the changes that we are putting in place here.
The second measure is an initiative to advise consumers of their rights regarding gap payments. One of the arguments about legislating for gap is that protection, in effect, already exists under the Trade Practices Act. People will be informed of past decisions by magistrates courts, in particular, where they have found that a person who did not know that they were going to incur a particular expenditure did not have to pay it. Over the years we have received letters from people complaining, and our first step is always to say, `Go back to the doctor and explain that you did not know.' It does appear that unfortunately, in some instances, it is more an ambit claim, particularly from some specialists. It can be waived if a person goes back and says, `I did not know about this. I am not in a position to pay this.'
It is also detailed in the letter from the minister that I will table in a moment that these brochures will advise people of what their rights are. Not only is it government policy that people should not get gaps unless they know about them but it is also the policy of the AMA. I congratulate them for that. Undisclosed gaps are causing hardship. Perhaps even more of a problem than that is the potential for a gap. People know of a friend or someone down the road or someone they have heard of who has had a gap payment, in some cases quite large. It deters people from getting involved in private health insurance at all. Knowing this and having these leaflets available in Medicare offices saying that they do not have to pay those gaps unless they were told that there was going to be a gap and what it was going to be will hopefully give people greater confidence in private health insurance products.
There are a range of other concerns that have been raised during the committee process. I will go over these only briefly today because a lot of them will be dealt with in far greater detail as we move into the committee stage. First of all and up-front is the need for a review of this. What is the impact of it? Are there problems with it? In particular, consideration should be given to a range of issues, from the impact on migrants to some of the concerns regarding how it will operate. We 
 will be supporting, when we get to the committee stage, the opposition's amendment on this. It will give us a chance to assess the impact of the scheme in terms of what it is supposed to do, which is to encourage stability of private health insurance membership.
There is also the issue of spousal records. The Democrats understand the problems that can occur when partnerships break up and the funds do not have records of who was paying. One partner's fund membership, for example, might be obvious but the other's might not. With the introduction of lifetime health cover, the issue of keeping records is important. Obviously we will need a specific amendment rather than any sort of undertaking. Again, we will be supporting what the Labor Party is doing.
We raised through committee, and others commented on, the issue of migrants. Here is an issue that, as we get to the committee stage, we will be tabling some further advice on. We will be looking specifically at Australia's health system generally compared to other countries. I do not think there is the big problem that some have outlined. Part of my concern with a general amendment is that today more and more migrants are indeed very well able to look after themselves. They come here as business migrants and as quite wealthy investors. As we said before, the scheme is not going to have additional government money put into it, rather it is going to be holding the funds of all of those people who are contributing, so I do think we need to look at that the fairness and equity issue of simply letting migrants in whenever they arrive.
But we do need to have some concern for those migrants who are already in the pipeline, particularly those who are here and who are in the process of that two-year period before they can access Medicare. As we know, until they can access Medicare, they cannot get into normal private health insurance. The government has agreed to address our main concerns here. I have one of the letters here that I will table in a moment in which the government has noted our concerns and is looking at the ability of the minister to 
 deal with those cases where there are problems under the hardship provisions.
Very briefly, looking at the reinsurance issue, I do not think this is as big a concern as some have raised. As we get to the committee stage, I think that further information will show that the government has obtained actuarial advice on this issue and that the changes would jeopardise the consultation process that is now going on with the industry to do, basically within the next couple of years, what the opposition is pushing for immediately.
The Ombudsman's powers are excessive in the way that the opposition has drafted its amendments. As for the youth discount, I really do not think this is going to encourage young people at all. It is going to make it more expensive for others: obviously, if young people get a discount, someone has to pay for it. It may indeed undo what the aim is, which is to attract people once they are established in work, have left a family situation where they may have had private health insurance anyway, are now independent and on their own and are looking at such things as buying a house.
We really do run the risk that starting with additional discounts is going to undo some of the very things this measure is aimed at doing. I think that there is a very small percentage of young people with health insurance. I note some of the Australian Consumers Association's concerns, basically saying to us that this is not an issue that we should worry about and that it is not a really significant problem among young people.
The issue of refugees is an important one. Obviously they are coming to this country without the means that many migrants have. However, because of some technical problems with the Labor Party amendment—and I congratulate them for the work they have done in this area—and the level of concern, the government is trying to look again at this issue and is going to be showing us very shortly, hopefully, an amendment without those technical problems.
The hardship provisions are, I think, adequate. As I said, we are now rolling in to those the issue of some people who are 
 coming out as migrants, particularly in the period when this measure is settling in. As I have said, for those who have already applied, understanding what the current system is, and for those who are in the pipeline for the two years, those issues are going to be dealt with under the hardship provisions as well.
As far as an advertising campaign is concerned, I have a third letter from the minister outlining the concerns that were raised during the committee process and dealing with each of those. I will not in the remaining few minutes go through those individually, but certainly he is emphasising the existing system—in other words, that everyone is entitled to access a free public hospital system—and in particular setting out their rights and responsibilities under this new measure.
The government, I understand, will be moving a few amendments, and we will look at these as we go. Government amendments Nos 1 to 4 generally are issues that we can support. I will leave our comments there. Obviously, as we get into the committee stage, we will be going into further detail on all of the issues raised, both in the Labor Party's comments and in the government amendments.
I wish to table three letters of undertaking from the minister with regard to the issues that the Democrats have been concerned about. In particular, I highlight that we do seem to be making some progress as far as known gaps are concerned. In other words, people should know what they are up for, whether they are insured or not, before a procedure is undertaken by a doctor. There have been cases where people have indeed not had to pay those gaps if they were not known ones.
—Senator Lees, you need leave to table those documents. Will you identify them for the purpose of the record, please, seeing that you are tabling three documents?
—Two of the letters are from Dr Wooldridge and are dated 22 September 1999 and 23 September 1999, and the other letter is signed by Chief of Staff Ken Smith on 23 September 1999.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (LIFETIME HEALTH COVER) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I rise to take part in the debate on the National Health Amendment (Lifetime Health Cover) Bill 1999  to provide a Queensland perspective on health funding and on the impacts on our state that will flow from the implementation of the bill. At the outset, I reiterate the Labor Party's commitment to a universal health care system that provides quality health care for all Australians irrespective of their means or their place of residence. Australians support Medicare. The Australian Labor Party supports Medicare and we will always support Medicare as the basis of a fair and just health system.
We also recognise that the private health insurance system provides a strategy complementary to the public system, thus providing a complete health service for the Australian community. We recognise that the private health insurance sector needs to be a viable and strong industry in order to play that role. The two systems are complementary.
The Labor Party recognises that the bill is the government's latest attempt to stem the community's drift away from private health insurance. We believe that, unfortunately, it is an ill-conceived piece of legislation that has not been properly consulted on with the community. The Labor Party has proposed a number of amendments that will improve the bill and address a number of concerns raised, especially through the Senate community affairs committee.
We also recognise that this is not the government's first attempt to address the drift away from private health insurance. We have already seen the government try to entice the community back through the Private Health Insurance Incentives Scheme. The 1996 means-tested scheme failed because premiums increased immediately after its introduction. In fact, the participation rates fell by approximately two per cent over the life of the scheme. The 30 per cent rebate now in place costs a massive $1.7 billion a year, and yet the proportion of people with insurance has increased only by a marginal 0.2 per cent, a fraction of the recent decline.
The real tragedy is that these funds could have been so well used in the public health sector. This is a direct subsidy to private health insurance, a subsidy which has shown no measurable benefit to the overall health of the community. The Australian Labor Party have a clear position. We will oppose any strategy that limits access to the public hospital system. We will oppose anything that results in resources being taken away from the public sector to subsidise the private sector.
Through this bill, the government is proposing to revisit the Australian health care agreements with the states. The government's rationale, we understand, is that there will be a direct shift of demand for public hospital services to the private sector when people are insured. It is proposed that when private health insurance levels increase above a national average of 34 per cent there will be a corresponding decrease of funds allocated through the agreement. If participation reaches 36 per cent nationally, the states will lose around $200 million.
In Queensland it is proposed that this provision will mean a loss of some $15 million for every percentage point of increase above the safety net figure of 30.4 per cent. However, there is a fundamental flaw in the rationale. There is no evidence to suggest that increased private health cover results in an equal decline in people using the public hospital system. It sounds simple and easy but the evidence is just not there.
Evidence from my state of Queensland in fact shows that people with private cover continue—and will continue—to use the public system and that the reasons for their use of the system are not necessarily related to whether or not they have private health insurance. Firstly, the Queensland public system provides services that are not always available in the private system. Especially in regional Queensland, the public hospital system provides the emergency services for the community. Public hospitals provide the care for new babies born in difficult circumstances. The public health service provides the specialist care for patients who require intensive health management. These types of care are technology intensive. The costs of the 
 equipment and the staff with the skills to operate that equipment are very high, and the private sector simply cannot afford to provide these services in areas with smaller levels of population.
Secondly, people use the public system because it has a hospital nearer their home. As we have heard earlier today, Queensland is decentralised, with 55 per cent of our population living outside the capital city and 20 per cent of our population living in rural and remote locations. There is simply no market for the private hospital sector in rural and remote Queensland. There are no private hospitals, for example,  west of the Great Dividing Range. People using the hospital system—any hospital system—want that event to be as drama free as possible. Naturally, they desire to be treated as close as possible to their family support structures. They want to be treated in their local hospital. Western Queenslanders know that, if they have a significant health issue, it will probably be an emergency, it may require emergency evacuation and they will probably end up in the regional public hospital.
Thirdly, patients know that there still will be large out-of-pocket expenses even though they have private health insurance. This bill does not address that significant issue nor the deterrents to accessing private health insurance: the gap payments. Whilst the reality of the gap between the refund and the actual cost remains at current levels, people will continue to weigh up the options and opt away from private health insurance.
If the participation rate does rise to the predicted level of 36 per cent, the result for Queensland will be a loss of some $80 million annually. That is a shift of $80 million from the public health sector, with no evidence that there will be a corresponding shift of the burden on the public sector.
The states are understandably concerned about these arrangements. And they have a right to be. The states were not aware of the government's plan when, in good faith, they signed the Australian health care agreements. And they can see the funds used to provide the services that simply cannot be provided by the private sector, for reasons of location 
 or specialty, being whittled away and having to be provided by a state with limited capacity—and soon to be no capacity—for raising the revenue.
We know that the federal government are working toward a national private health care membership level of 36 per cent—that is what they are spending the money on. But the government have made it clear that the basis for proceeding with lifetime health cover is that it will come at no cost. Well, we have to ask: where is the money coming from? It is very evident that the public hospital sector will pay, without any evidence whatsoever that the pressure on that system will be reduced.
Queensland has had an interesting relationship with private health care. My state has historically had low levels of private health insurance—it currently stands at just over 28 per cent, compared to the national average of 30.3 per cent. But Queensland also exhibits a far more stable relationship with the private funds. When private coverage fell nationally by some 14 per cent in the 10 years from 1989, in Queensland the figures fell by less than three per cent. Thus, we have a lower but more stable private health insurance participation rate.
At the same time the figures show that our private hospital share of the hospital market has grown. In the five years to 1998, the private hospital share of hospital services provided in my state grew from 31 per cent to 36 per cent. But those figures can be misleading: they are not comparing apples with apples. Private hospitals have focused on elective and day surgery, while our public system continues to treat patients with chronic and complex health conditions. Despite the growth in the private hospital sector, there has been little impact on the demand for public hospital services. It is too simplistic to assume that the availability of a private provider will mean that people will choose to use it for all their hospital services. Furthermore, it is the experience in Queensland that private patients do choose to use the public system.
As you may know, Queensland Health provides what is nationally recognised as an excellent and efficient elective surgery pro 
 gram. It is a program that operates in public hospitals for public patients and, where there is capacity, privately insured patients as well. But, from modelling the demands on this program, it is the opinion of Queensland Health that considerable numbers of privately insured patients choose to use the program as public patients. The utilisation of this program is above and beyond the expected demands, based on projections for a growing population, an ageing demographic and existing levels of private health care. There is also anecdotal evidence from Queensland Health that patients anxious about the gap payments for some procedures are advised to use the public program for non-urgent procedures—and they use it for free.
The Senate committee inquiring into this legislation heard evidence of people shopping around for low cost health cover without having any intention to use it. This is also a concern in Queensland. There is no incentive in the government's proposals to encourage people, especially young healthy people this bill is supposed to be targeting, to take out comprehensive hospital cover. Young people and many other informed consumers who are concerned about the long-term implications of lifetime rating can simply take out a cheap private policy and continue to use the public system.
Recent private health insurance data shows that, while overall figures for private health insurance have fallen, there has been growth in one sector of the market, front-end deductible policies and exclusionary policies; in essence a shift toward cheaper policies offering a lower level of care. These are not policies which lessen the demand on our public system. In fact in Queensland people who have purchased low cost private health cover are increasingly using the public hospital system. They have initially purchased these policies to avoid the Medicare surcharge and now have the ability to insulate themselves from the penalties contained in the lifetime health cover proposals.
One of the principles of the  National Health Amendment (Lifetime Health Cover) Bill 1999  is the desire to attract young people to private health insurance and keep them there. 
 The Labor amendment to provide a further incentive to young people under the age of 30 should be supported as a measure which will encourage participation. The Institute of Actuaries' submission to the Senate committee said:
The closer the scale of the contribution rates is to the actual cost for each age then the more likely young healthy people are to take out private health insurance.
Young people do not have high levels of disposable income. They are a healthy group in our community and they are focused on their immediate futures, not their old age when they may be in need of more expensive health services.
I am concerned that the advice provided by the youth sector to the Senate committee seems to have been overlooked. The National Youth Initiative said in their submission:
The National Youth Initiative believes that this bill will have little or no impact on the numbers of young people taking out private cover . . . The obvious result of this for the public system is viewed only as continued strain and pressure.
Yet the government continues to pursue its simplistic equation. The government premise is that you just have to increase the number of privately insured and there will be a corresponding decrease on the demand for the public hospital system. I am sorry, but the states are not telling us that that will happen, and the evidence before us simply does not add up.
As I said earlier, if the Howard government achieves its aim of 36 per cent private coverage, our hospitals will lose nationally up to $200 million annually. In Queensland that is $80 million every year. Let us take a moment to think what that might mean. If you take $80 million out of the Queensland health budget, what could happen on the ground? In Queensland that is equivalent to over 117,000 public hospital admission; that is, over 117,000 Queenslanders could be denied access through the public system to such procedures as eye, thoracic, gynaecological or urology surgery. Eighty million dollars is greater than the entire elective surgery budget in Queensland. Eighty million dollars per annum could mean the loss of twelve 30-bed public wards and the decommissioning of 
 operating rooms. It is equivalent to 1,500 jobs in the public system. Our nurses alone are recognised as one of the public system's greatest assets. Of course, some of those jobs are based in provincial and rural areas. It means cutting Queensland's efforts to make quality hospital care available to all Queenslanders by up to $80 million.
As I said, $80 million out of the public system is equivalent to over 117,000 admissions in the public system. The idea that all those people want or can afford to seek treatment in the private system is unsustainable. There is not the capacity, and more to the point, there is not the wish of Queenslanders to seek private cover or private procedures. We like our public system. It has a unique history dating back to the 1930s. I suggest that this government is prepared to sacrifice it, and for what? A system that some people cannot afford, that many people do not like and which most people choose not to belong to.
It is clear where we will end up under this government's ill-targeted and ill-considered private health care recruitment drive. If you take money from the public system on the basis of that incorrect assumption about the links between private membership and pressure on public health facilities, you will end up with pressure from state governments to limit access to public hospitals. We have already heard it from Liberal premiers Kennett—if he still is—and Court, who have advocated that entry into public hospitals should be means tested. Richard Court went even further to say that the public system should be limited only to those who receive social security benefits. This is the real philosophy behind this bill; to develop a health system of haves and have-nots and to move to an American style health system of health for the rich and, sorry, if you are poor. This bill is driven by the Liberal philosophy of user-pays if you can afford it.
This is another attempt by this government to cost shift the health bill to the states, just as they did with the Commonwealth dental program which has simply been defunded in Queensland to the tune of $20 million annually. This tab has had to be picked up by the 
 Queensland government. The Queensland government realises that the program provides excellent dental services to those Queenslanders who cannot access dental services because of their location or their means. The Commonwealth government do not care about the dental health of these Queenslanders, and do not care about the impact of the potential loss of up to $80 million from our public hospital system.
I sympathise with the states. They were not aware of the government's plan when they signed on to the Australian health care agreements. If the lifetime health cover is to proceed, there must be assurances that there will be no reduction in public hospital funding, and in particular a clawback in public funding which is not related to actual demand for public hospital services. Without these assurances, what we have is an attack on the public hospital system and an attack on the principle of universal coverage under Medicare.
The Australian public and the Australian Labor Party support Medicare and support its provision of universality of access to free hospital services. We will not be part of arrangements which erode that principle and force the states to question the merit of equitable access to health services in an environment of inadequate funding arrangements with the Commonwealth.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (LIFETIME HEALTH COVER) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Lifetime Health Cover) Bill 1999 . As stated in Labor's minority report, `the concept of unfunded lifetime community rating is sound', and as has been mentioned by previous speakers, it has support pretty well across the board in the industry and many other groups. However, this is qualified by suggesting that it needs to be well-designed reform. Unfortunately, we are again faced with a policy full of glaring omissions and optimistic costing.
To begin, the cut-off age of 65 has problems. It fails to account for individuals who have retired at an early age. Thus pensioners under 65 will be unduly penalised once the grace period is over. Another assumption is that the health problems of those who join 
 will be less on the whole than current members. This is an important aspect as, remember, the motivation for these reforms is to make the funds more viable.
Thus if the influx of new members places inordinate demands on health funds via a need for expensive treatment, the purpose of the exercise becomes redundant. It may be possible that the intent of the policy is to provide a revenue positive outcome for the industry. It could be reversed, with a revenue negative outcome for the industry being a probable end result. This would severely compromise the industry and the government's aims would be left in tatters. HCF and MBF, which both suggested the possibility of an older average group joining particularly in the initial grace period, have alluded to this possibility. This would of course result in an influx of high-cost demands in the short term which may not be reduced in the long term. Ian McAuley suggested that a rush to join the funds in the initial grace period by the 57- to 65-year-olds could result in `a body blow to the industry'. This again challenges the costing assumptions of the model.
Unduly optimistic projections of a growth in participation rates by Trowbridge further undermine the assumptions of the policy. To suggest that participation rates will reach 35 per cent by the end of the grace period is fanciful. Additionally, the Trowbridge model relies on an exaggerated negative projection of participation rates without the policy changes. To suggest that rates would fall to 20 per cent is overtly pessimistic and, other than unsubstantiated opinion, challenges the philosophical underpinnings of the model completely. Further alternative outcomes include the possibility of a freeze on new entries for the over 30s as they become unwilling to pay the penalty. If, at the same time, the take-up rate of the under 30s does not increase, a cycle of increasing costs and dropping membership could result in premium rises of 20 per cent over five years.
One of the concerns raised was the propensity of consumers to take low cost products thus avoiding the Medicare surcharge. This also allows consumers to avoid any future penalties and does not exclude them from 
 simply upgrading to a more comprehensive coverage in the future. Thus a variation of hit and run is possible as healthy consumers pay the minimum contribution at the low cost product end and simply switch to a higher coverage as health concerns become an issue. Furthermore, if the heath problem is high cost but transitory, once it is dealt with they can drop back to the low cost end and simply switch back and forward depending on their own perception of their health status. Thus a quasi hit-and-run scenario is viable.
Accountants will most likely advise their clients to join en masse for one month prior to June 2000. This will enable consumers to avoid the penalties from that point forward for every subsequent year they join. Remember, the main intent of this policy is to reward the genuine long-term members and to discourage the economic manipulation of funds by consumers or their advisers.
As other speakers have said, migrants are not catered for in this bill. Through no fault of their own, many will come to Australia after the age of 30. This will mean they will attract a penalty for not joining at a younger age. How can they, when they are not in this country? This is obviously discriminatory and will most likely result in low rates of participation in private health insurance from new arrivals. Thus, over time, new arrivals will represent lower rates of private health insurance than is currently the case. Obviously, this will mean migrants will have a disproportionate reliance on the public system. It does not take much imagination to see the warning signs of a truly entrenched two-tier system emerging, with low income earners and migrants increasingly relying on an underfunded public health system.
Most health experts agree that illness is related to income and status. Thus the higher cost demographic groups will still be overrepresented in the public system. This would not be a concern if the participation rates in private health were not related to public health funding, but they are.
It is worth remembering that, once the private health insurance rates reach 36 per cent, states will lose $200 million under a clause in the Australian health care agree 
 ments. Thus, if the optimistic projections of this policy come to fruition, it is highly probable that the growth in participation rates will be at the low end cost range. Private health consumers may still rely on the public health system for expensive procedures not covered by the lower cost private health insurance policies. When I was on the committee that was inquiring into this issue, we did hear people admit that was what they were doing.
Thus a duality is constructed that will see a fall in public health funding based on the flawed theory that higher rates of private health insurance will always reduce the need for public health funding. If the policy was tight, this may be true but this is not the case with this bill. Many in this chamber will have very little regard for the rights of those who serve time at Her Majesty's pleasure—that is, in prison. We are still overseen by the monarchy, but hopefully we will not be after the end of this year when it may then be at the `President's pleasure'.
Regardless of one's view of the socially challenged, this policy will result in an added punishment for those who are  already incarcerated. If an individual is to serve more than a year or so, or will be in prison at the introduction of this legislation, they will incur a penalty for not joining should their release date coincide with an age of over 30. Again, prisoners represent for a variety of social reasons, mainly economic disadvantage, a high cost to the public health system. Again, we are seeing the higher cost demographic groups most likely relying completely on the public health system for their care with an unintended disincentive for those who could or would take up private health insurance.
Refugees are in a similar predicament to migrants—and we will probably see a growth in this because of the dreadful situation in East Timor. After having to endure the emotional burden of often involuntary removal from their country, they could be penalised if they arrive here after the age of 30. Many refugees may benefit from extra cover for post-traumatic stress counselling or medical care needed as a result of their physical 
 legacy of torture—and that is good, they should.
If public health is further eroded by this Howard government's philosophical bias against Medicare, refugees may well be faced with lengthy delays in receiving care when time is of vital importance, particularly in the case of post-trauma counselling. Again, refugees over 30 after June 2000 will face a prohibitive penalty that realistically translates to a reduction in choice for this group. Yet again, a high cost demographic will be completely reliant on the public system, further challenging the correlation between higher private insurance and less funding for public health. I see that a lot in the area where I live on the north-west coast of Tasmania. We have one private hospital and a number of public hospitals, and the public hospitals particularly are drained because the area is economically poorer.
Often people in relationships pay their contributions under the one scheme. It is therefore imperative that, should their normal contributions cease for a variety of reasons, should one party discontinue paying their contributions, all parties should be informed of the end of payment. Another oversight of this bill is that there is no provision for this to occur. The implications are obvious, given the premium paid is reliant on length of membership. Thus an individual may not know that their partner's contributions have ceased and therefore receive a unfair penalty. We all realise this could happen if a partnership break-up was a controversial one. In fact, in the most extreme cases, the non-payment may constitute a deliberate aggressive action to disadvantage a former partner.
The continuing problem of gap payments is not mentioned in this bill, and yet time and time again this issue has been shown as the largest contributing factor in individuals deciding not to take out private health insurance. Fixing the issue of gap payments might be a more equitable way of achieving an increased participation than many of the flawed proposals contained in this bill, and many constituents have discussed this issue with me. The gap payment is one of the main 
 reasons that people do not want to take out private health insurance.
This bill also does nothing to fix a crisis in the public health system. Tasmania, like many other states, is experiencing a shortage of nurses. There are many nurses who have left the industry and will not return under the current working conditions, and that is because the public hospital system is being run down. Often focusing entirely on waiting lists and throughput has overlooked this. Thus, fewer people are attracted into the profession, and those with long-term experience are finding the conditions they are working under unacceptable.
They are not just unacceptable in terms of their own self-interest, many feel they cannot adequately fulfil the expectations of the clients. This invariably leads to a loop that includes lack of job satisfaction, lowering self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy with no end in sight. Finally they leave, taking the corporate knowledge with them. Recently, on the north-west coast, a group of doctors made an appointment to see me to discuss these issues, and there has been a great deal of concern about this particular issue where I live.
The government may attempt to shift the blame to the states. However, the states can fund public health need only according to the grants received from the Commonwealth. As mentioned, this bill could achieve greater pressure on the public health system as young healthy people take out low cost insurance, thus leaving high cost groups and high cost procedures to the care of public health. Rather than acknowledging this and increasing health funding, public health will be punished via the removal of funds if private health insurance reaches a certain level.
Again, we are faced with a bill that aims to achieve one thing—that is, unfunded lifetime community rating—but it is unlikely to achieve it. Instead, there is a distinct possibility that the funds will have to be bailed out yet again, if the types of consumers they are seeking do not arrive. Finally, I doubt that the proposed advertisement campaign will achieve anything other than misinformation and fear. I suggest it will be yet another example of 
 wasting money that could have been spent where it is needed most—that is, on public health.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT (LIFETIME HEALTH COVER) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-09-23,"—in reply—I am pleased to acknowledge many of the comments that have been made in this debate on the second reading of the National Health Amendment (Lifetime Health Cover) Bill 1999 , particularly those today by Senator Lees, and the fact that the Australian Democrats and the Minister for Health and Aged Care have been able to reach an accord on this that will be very important. The government is committed to ensuring a balance between the public and the private health sectors, and this legislation goes a long way in that regard.
There were a number of issues raised that I am sure will be addressed in the committee stage. But the fact is that we will be able to better inform consumers and guarantee and underpin the differences that may have arisen previously between the public and the private health sector systems. I commend the bill.

"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-23,"—In speaking to the War Crimes Amendment Bill 1999 , I point out to the Senate that I am definitely not implying that any Australian Defence Force personnel who served in World War II may have been involved in any conduct that was unbecoming, but neither can I accept the risk or the possibility that any Australian Defence Force personnel could be extradited for war crimes without the establishment of a prima facie case against them, and that will be the case if the government's proposal to amend the War Crimes Act 1945 is carried.
The amendment I will move in the committee stage will ensure that any proceedings in an Australian state or territory under the Extradition Act 1988 and the War Crimes Act 1945 and involving a member of the Australian Defence Force will require a magistrate to be satisfied as to the veracity of the allegation and that a prima facie case exists before extradition is possible. I do not accept the argument that we need to water down the inherent protections contained in our legal system to comply with a request from another country, just as I do not accept the arguments that we should arbitrarily lower our quarantine standards either.
We cannot predict the vagaries of the legal system or the consequences of future legal action. We cannot assume that what has transpired in the past will do so in the future. It would be a travesty if any Australian Defence Force personnel were extradited as a result of this action of the government without the establishment of a prima facie case against them, and that is why I intend to move my amendment today. If the government subsequently enacts war crime legislation that would cover subsequent conflicts that had occurred since the Second World War and the intention of that was also to protect Australian Defence Force personnel 
 and their support people, then I would support the government in its endeavours to protect our service men and women and the people who have supported them since the Second World War.
In concluding, I reiterate to the Senate two things: I am not about protecting any war criminals in Australia who may be residing here, and I am definitely not implying that any Australian defence personnel have actually carried out any such conduct.",SENATE,<title>WAR CRIMES AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-09-23,"—I would like to thank Senator Harris for his contribution, although we will not be able to support his amendment. The War Crimes Amendment Bill 1999  repeals section 22 of the War Crimes Act 1945. Section 22 imposes a specific requirement for the content of extradition requests to Australia in respect of conduct which will be covered by the act, that is, certain crimes committed in Europe during World War II. Currently such requests must be accompanied by the presentation of evidence which establishes a prima facie case that the person has committed the alleged conduct. The main justification for the repeal of section 22 is that it is no longer appropriate to include this onerous requirement for war crimes extraditions, particularly following the emergence of newly independent states in Europe from behind the Iron Curtain.
In principle, Australia is interested in establishing modern extradition arrangements with such countries should they be accepted as members of the Council of Europe. Enactment of this bill, together with the conclusion of such arrangements, will increase significantly our ability to cooperate with other countries which seek our assistance in bringing alleged war criminals to trial.
With respect to the amendment that Senator Harris has put forward, the government's response is that it rejects any implication that Australians who served in Europe during World War II may have been involved in war crimes, and it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commonwealth parliament to endorse such a suggestion in legislation by enacting laws specifying that these persons require 
 special measures to protect them from such allegations. The Minister for Justice and Customs has corresponded with the National President of the RSL on this issue, and I understand that the RSL has indicated its acceptance of the government's position. For these reasons, we will not be supporting Senator Harris's amendment. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-23,"—The opposition supports the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1999  and the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 . The Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1999  is a simple mechanism for the ABA to collect increased fees over the next three years to recover costs incurred by the ABA. I am informed that the increased fees will be $3.4 million over the next three years. The Commonwealth collects $194 million in television broadcasting fees. In that context, it is a very modest increase indeed. The opposition supports the increase.
The  Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  deals with issues which include the introduction of digital television, which we will be dealing with soon. The opposition want to note that there are still a number of unanswered questions and issues that have to be put before this parliament about the introduction of digital television. In the Television Broadcasting Services (Digital Conversion) Bill, which came before the parliament and was passed in 1998, the minister was given specific instructions by legislation to report back on a whole range of regulatory arrangements for the introduction of digital television. We note that those reviews are under 
 way, and we hope that they are coming very rapidly to their conclusion. We expect that the minister will report to cabinet in September and October for the government to make a decision in respect of those matters and to have the matters before the parliament before the end of the year. We also note that the minister recently adverted to the fact that this may come back into parliament early next year, which would be February or March of next year.
We would point out that the longer the minister leaves the reporting back to parliament on the introduction of digital television, the more he creates some tension about planning arrangements. The commitment which the opposition supported was for digital broadcasting to commence in metropolitan areas by 1 January 2001. We point out that, if the resolutions are not to be dealt with until February and March of next year, the deadline becomes quite pressing. We would hope that the minister does not leave it too late. We also want to warn that the opposition will not be stampeded into a cursory approval of the legislation next year on the basis that, if it is not passed, the introduction date will not be achieved. The government has known since last year that that is the deadline, and we will not be stampeded by that deadline.

Following concerns from various groups in the community, who felt that the new wording was too soft from an environmental perspective, the Labor Party—led by my colleague Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow minister for tourism—negotiated new wording to give greater balance. Those words are:
. . . in meeting those objects, to work with other relevant agencies to promote the principles of ecologically sustainable development set out in subsection 21(3) of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia Act 1997 and to seek to raise awareness of the social and cultural impacts of international tourism in Australia.

This amendment does not remove the requirement for the commission to be responsible for the social and environmental effects of international tourism. Rather, it brings the commission's responsibilities into line with its powers and capabilities in this area. Linking the commission's environmental responsibilities to the principles of ecologically sustainable development, as set out in the Natural Heritage Trust Act, provides the commission with a clear working definition of its responsibilities and maintains consistency between Commonwealth agencies in this area.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources (Senator Minchin) to a question without notice asked by Senator Schacht today, relating to petrol prices.
Today we pointed out that the Treasurer of this country claimed last year that the government's policy of so-called reform of the petroleum industry would unashamedly bring down petrol prices. That is what he said. Since then, prices have gone up. Senator Minchin thought he had me and the opposition trumped in his answer by saying, `They've gone up because the wholesale price around the world has gone up.' He then said that the government's policy had not even yet been passed by the Senate.
What Senator Minchin did not subsequently realise was that the Treasurer, when the price had gone down briefly last year, had claimed it as a credit to the government's policy. He did not wait for it to be passed by the Senate. He claimed that the government's policy was already working and was reducing petrol prices in the cities and particularly in country towns. No wonder the coalition in Victoria got such a belting in regional Victoria last Saturday when you have a Treasurer so out of touch that he is claiming that petrol prices in the country have gone down, when everybody knows they have actually gone the other way and the disparity between city and country 
 prices, by a number of measures, has got worse.
No wonder the country areas of Victoria revolted against the coalition and had staggering swings against them. That is one of the issues. As we all know, petrol prices in the bush have been a consistent issue for country people for many years. The Treasurer tried to claim credit last year by saying that the price going down for a short period was a triumph for his own policy. He has now been caught out and the Liberal Party in Victoria, even though it was a state election, paid part of the price for this Treasurer's stupidity in claiming that this was a success for the government's policy.
There was also a debate here this morning on a disallowance motion relating to an amendment to the regulations that Senator Minchin tried to put through to give a special benefit to BP Australia. They had not conformed to the law under the sites act and therefore were seeking retrospectively to have the regulations amended. They had not issued new contracts to franchisees under the sites act. They wanted that to be retrospectively approved and not contrary to the act. Today in the Senate we rejected that special treatment be given to only one company when all the other companies had complied with the law.
What this shows is that this government's policy on petroleum and petrol prices is in absolute disarray. We have waited in this place now for over three years for the government to reach a conclusion on negotiations of the Oilcode. We have admitted—and we have been very patient in opposition—that it is a very difficult job to get the major parties to agree on a new Oilcode; and still the government has not been able to achieve it. Now all it can do as a temporary measure is try to give a regulatory benefit to one company.
We have still not had a response from the government as to what they are going to do now that that regulation has not been able to be achieved. We do not know what they are doing to further negotiate with all the parties in the oil industry. We have made it clear that we want a mandatory Oilcode under the Trade Practices Act which gives franchisees—that 
 is, retailers—protection for the long term. This is small business at its very best. I would have thought that a Liberal government would bend over backwards to help small business.
In this area, there is certainly pressure in the cabinet for the big end of town to get the benefit by the government doing nothing. If a number of franchisees lose out in the end, that will be on the head of the government. The government do not have a policy. After the Treasurer trumpeted the great success last year by saying that prices were coming down, they have now been caught out holus-bolus for the sham that was. The government do not have a policy on getting the best for retailers, the petroleum industry and, above all, Australian consumers. They stand condemned for their lack of policy.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Petrol: Prices</title>,Miscellaneous,27,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1999-09-23,"—It really is a joke to hear the Labor Party, which we know has absolutely no policies and openly proclaims the fact that it has no policies following the last election and which probably will not have until we are much closer to the next election—the policy free zone—accuse us of having no policy. They know perfectly well that we have a well-articulated, comprehensive policy in response to the ACCC and Productivity Commission inquiries.
After only two to 2½ years in office we bit the bullet on this issue. Labor did nothing in 13 years to address the problems in petrol retailing. We did a very comprehensive program that involved the repeal of the sites act and the franchise act and the insertion of an Oilcode into the Trade Practices Act. We did say at the last election that we would proceed with that package only if we had agreement from all parties to that package. There is a significant sticking point in reaching agreement to that comprehensive policy package because of disputes over the repeal of the sites act.
Senator Schacht refers to statements made by the Treasurer last year. What Senator Schacht forgets in his accusations that we are claiming credit for something that we do not deserve to is that, at the time we announced the reform package, the companies agreed to 
 propositions put by the government that involved significant elements in the first stage of reform. The companies agreed to open access to the terminal gate at the refineries for new entrants, and that particularly included things like farming groups getting together and forming cooperatives or whatever to purchase petroleum direct from terminals on an open access basis. That had never been the case before and that was a significant achievement of this government, with the cooperation of the companies.
We also set up a rural price monitoring program which the companies are actually paying for and which is audited by the Australian Automobile Association, with prices published on the Net. The Treasurer directed the ACCC to have a specific charter to investigate anticompetitive behaviour, in particular hot spots in the petroleum retailing market around the country. So a number of very specific initiatives were taken last year as a result of the package which we announced and were able to be introduced immediately. That is why it is appropriate for the Treasurer to have said that as a result of those moves there was a depressing effect on prices. Of course in all of these things you have to say `other things being equal'.
Obviously the most significant impact on petrol prices is world prices, but this opposition are attacking us over petrol prices when they were the ones who took the excise on petrol from something like 7c to 40c during their time in government and they are the ones most responsible for the price of petrol in this country today because of what they did to increase the excise by stealth through their 13 years in government. We have held that; in fact, we will be bringing about a reduction in petrol prices as a result of the GST and our reforms to transport fuel costs.
We also believe that there will be a depressing effect on prices, other things being equal, by the further reforms that we want to introduce, but they can be introduced only if there is agreement, because we made a commitment to agreement, and if the Labor Party and Democrats are prepared to support that reform. We have had no commitment from the Labor Party or the Democrats that they 
 are prepared to repeal the sites act. At this stage our reform package does not look promising so far as its legislative passage is concerned. That would be extremely disappointing and would mean that the one great chance we do have to reform petrol retailing in such a way as to bring about a depressing effect on prices may well be lost. Of course, above and beyond all that, there is absolutely nothing that any one of us can do—Labor, Liberal or Democrat—about world price increases generated through APEC.
We have tried to work very closely with all the parties involved in this to reach agreement. It is not easy. It does not help to have the Labor Party grandstanding and attacking us for having no policy when they know we have a very comprehensive policy which we are attempting to negotiate with the parties following their 13 years of complete inactivity apart from their disastrous and perennial increases in the excise on petrol, which is now the major part of the price of petrol which consumers must pay.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Petrol: Prices</title>,Miscellaneous,27,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I also wish to take note of the same answer to the same question. I have a degree of respect for Senator Minchin, and it is probably not his fault that we have this mess before us at the moment because the minister really responsible for the mess is in the other place—he is now Minister for Defence—which probably partly explains why we have such a mess somewhere else. If anyone was watching the debate on East Timor on Tuesday when the Minister for Defence read his speech to the parliament, no-one in Australia would have felt more disappointed in a Minister for Defence at that point in time. Those members of the defence forces of Australia would have had to have had a degree of lack of faith instilled in them with regard to the minister.
—Senator Murphy, I will allow a wide-ranging debate but I think you should get back to the question.
—Yes, but I thought it was relevant because this is the same minister who gave us this package that is yet to pass this place, as Senator Minchin said. That is 
 the very point. Minister Moore claimed in a joint statement with the Treasurer that petrol prices would indeed go down. In fact, he said:
The package recognises the particular problems faced by consumers in rural and regional Australia. Those consumers pay the price of a lack of competition in the retail market. For the first time this package does something to help them. Consumers in large cities—
this is where we are talking about the government claiming success for the package already—
have already benefited from retail competition with prices as much as 20c per litre cheaper than in the country.
Will this lower prices at the pump?
This package will bring increased competition to the petroleum retail sector with benefits for the motoring public.
With regard to the proposed code of practice, if you look at what has happened in Victoria and Western Australia, where they did actually introduce state legislation that somehow reflected proposals to bring in more competition, what did the oil companies do? They just worked around it. That is exactly the problem you have with what is proposed by the government at a federal level.
There is no mechanism to ensure that the oil companies will comply with the Oilcode—there is nothing. That is why we in opposition proposed the  Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill 1999 , which is a private member's bill introduced in the other place by Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow minister for small business. We did that because your Oilcode, as proposed, does not do anything in the interest of increased market competition. I noted the minister said, `They agreed to access to their terminals for people in rural and regional areas to go in and buy a bulk supply.' It is difficult enough for a lot of people to do that anyway.
I also noted what the minister said in terms of their price monitoring arrangements, which the oil companies are actually paying for. Of course, he also said the results are on the net. Minister, I would have been interested to hear you read out the results of the price controls thus far to see how successful the monitoring has been and whether or not it has delivered lower prices, in particular, to the consumers 
 in regional and rural Australia. It has not, nor will your Oilcode. It will fail because you have not put in, and are not prepared to put in, the right sorts of controls.
I know that our shadow minister made an offer to you. You should have accepted it, because it was a very good offer, but you rejected it. So I do not think you should come in here and try to take the high moral ground with regard to legislation that you have and want passed that will not serve the interests of the public in this country one little bit in respect of petrol prices. When we offer you the opportunity to make significant increases in terms of the number of franchised service stations that can be brought under the control of the majors and, at the same time, seek to have a review of the process, you ought to accept it.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-09-23,"—I rise to speak on this motion and, in doing so, I think it would be appropriate at this time to remind the Senate of a very famous comment that Senator Peter Walsh made some time ago. He said, `If you don't know the answer to the question, don't ask it.' We can extend that with a little bit of poetic licence to say, `If you don't know what you're talking about, don't get up and talk.' I think that is very important. The proposition put before us then by Senator Murphy shows just how little he understands this issue and Oilcode.
I want to deal with the Oilcode for a moment. The proposal, which is supported by the production side of the industry, the MTAA and the retail representatives—and I think it has been signed off now or is very close to being signed off—is in fact going to become part of part IVB of the Trade Practices Act. It will have the enforcement of the law through the Trade Practices Act. You cannot come in and say it has no enforcement—it comes under the full surveillance of the Trade Practices Act. It has all the power of the unconscionable conduct provisions that exist in that act and all the other aspects of the Trade Practices Act.
We heard something about misleading the Senate in question time today, but if ever I have heard a misleading contribution from a 
 senator in this place, that was it. To make the claim that the proposal will not have the force of law is so wrong that it is sad to have it broadcast around the country. If I do nothing else in my contribution, I will correct that misrepresentation that you just made. The proposal will become part of the Trade Practices Act and be enforceable under that act, which is, incidentally, one of the most powerful acts that has ever been brought into this parliament, particularly with the additions that Mr Reith, as the minister representing small business, contributed in terms of unconscionable conduct.
I want to move to one or two other aspects of this particular debate. As has been noted earlier today, the Labor Party and the Democrats decided to knock back the regulations that were put before this place. That is another knife in the back to achieving more fairness and reform in this industry. They have in fact held this up. I chaired the committee that dealt with this particular issue, and we worked through a whole host of issues with the MTAA, the oil companies and representatives of the franchisees, et cetera.
One of the things that was said this morning, under the proposals coming forward under this reform, was that franchisees could have all their stations, operations and the business side of their franchise, but they would operate their fuel as a commission agency. They tried to slur that and put it down. I inform the Senate that that proposal was put in there at the request of the franchisee operators, not because we wanted it or because it was part of the original statement. They came and put the arguments before us, we accepted those particular arguments and made that recommendation and the government accepted it through Minister Minchin.
Senator Schacht sat on that committee and went through the process. I have to say that he was rather generous to me in some of his comments this morning. I am not sure that that is going to do me any good at preselection; nonetheless, he was rather generous in terms of those particular comments. But the facts are that he misrepresented the position in terms of that. I find that quite disappointing. It is a difficult issue. He was a minister 
 for as long as we have been in government and could not resolve the problem, and yet he comes in here and starts throwing bricks around.
Finally, I want to speak for a couple of moments on the Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill 1999  from Mr Fitzgibbon. That bill is so short in dealing with some of the practical aspects relating to the breaking of a contract that it is almost unbelievable that it has been brought into this place without the homework being done. You cannot legally break a contract. It is saying in effect, `We will legislate to break contracts.' It does not deal with the compensation or the rights of the people there. It does not deal with how you are going to handle the branding of fuel. What are you going to do when you have somebody else's fuel there? Are you going to change the signs of the fuel companies or the agents? A lot of service stations today are owned by agents—three, four or five stations. Are they going to have to change the brand when they have the franchise agreement?
There are a whole lot of follow-on aspects to this. One of the things that is very important in this country is contract law. A lot of it has been developed through common law. You cannot go out and deal with people in that manner and say, `Take their rights away.' It is a ridiculous proposition. If you ever put up that sort of bill, you have to deal with all aspects of it. It is unworkable and unmanageable. I cannot believe that the Democrats—for example, Senator Murray—came in and supported this position.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I would also like to take note of the answer given by Senator Minchin today to Senator Schacht's question. I have heard a few of the comments made by the previous speakers and I am a bit amazed—you would think the oil companies are one of those benevolent organisations that operate in this world on behalf of the populace and the consumer. We have to understand this about where the government is going in relation to this issue: since 1980 when the sites act was introduced, the oil companies have campaigned vigorously against the operation of 
 that act. They have done everything they can and used every device they can muster to try to have that sites act repealed.
You would think that the government's policies would be working, but we have not had any lower prices in the last few years since this government has been in power. In fact, prices have gone up. In my previous occupation I used to have some dealings with some of these gentle giants that the government would have us believe are looking after the interests of the consumer and the community, and they are probably some of the most ruthless people I have ever had to deal with. I have had experience on a few sides of the Trade Practices Act.
The oil companies have not wanted the act that was introduced in 1980 and, as I said earlier, they have done everything they can to try to have it repealed, reneged or reviewed. As I understand it, the problem for the companies has been that on 19 September 1998 the second round of the nine-year tenure for franchisees was up for renewal. Unfortunately for the oil companies—and, I suppose, for the government—the government promised to repeal that act, so the companies failed to renew their contracts with the franchisees.
Where does that leave us in relation to the current situation with prices? We believe that the government has failed to deliver in a number of areas. We have not had reduced prices. We have not had the security in the industry and, from my point of view and from my experience, we are handing over control of the source to the bowser to the oil companies. We should bear in mind this: not that long ago there were seven oil companies operating in this country; now we are down to four. If that is not an oligopoly, then I might be a duffer—I was going to say something else. We are handing over control of prices to those gentle giants that the government has made commitments to look after.
As far as we are concerned, the government has failed to deliver, and we now have a situation where there is a lot of uncertainty in the industry. The way to go is the way being proposed by the Labor Party, and that is to give that security to the industry and to give some sort of surety to the franchisees and to 
 the other people involved. Unfortunately, the actions of the government since it has been in power have made things more and more uncertain. The government has not been able to give people the certainty that they need to operate in this community.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Petrol: Prices</title>,Miscellaneous,27,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-09-23,"—I also join in this debate to take note of the answer given by Senator Minchin on petrol pricing. We all understand that petrol pricing is a very sensitive issue. It is sensitive in everyone's electorate, especially in my rural electorate, because every time families have to go to the bowser, they are paying $40 to $50 cold to fill their tanks. That is what people know; that is what they see. The question that is relayed back to us is: why are the petrol prices so high? We can only say that petrol prices are dependent on many factors. There is no one single factor, least of all a government factor. One factor is that petrol is very sensitive to world prices, and today the world price for barrels of oil is high. It is high for many different reasons, one being the fact that supply has been reduced from the Middle East countries. It is always dependent on the oil prices. We have all established that transport costs are a minimal part of the price of petrol—coming in at 1c to 2c, at least in rural areas. So they have a minimal effect but, nevertheless, an effect.
Another factor is that government tax does affect petrol pricing. But I should add that the government, since being in government for well over three years now, have not increased the government petrol tax one cent. In fact, because the tax is indexed to inflation—inflation has virtually been zero in this country—it has not gone up at all. It is to our credit that we have not taken advantage of government taxing of petrol. But I will tell you who has and who did: the previous government. In the 1993 budget, and probably in every budget that they produced, Labor increased petrol taxes. We have not. Under the tax reform package for businesses we will be reducing petrol prices by at least 7c. But, all in all, petrol pricing is sensitive to world prices and competition.
We know that in the rural areas no-one can go to a meeting without being asked that perennial question: why are petrol prices so much higher in the country than they are in the city? The answer is competition. The turnover by the rural petrol stations is just not as great as it is in the city, so there is an enormous difference in the competitive forces. For that reason, the cost structures are higher for the petrol stations in the country areas and therefore the petrol prices are higher. That is the predominant reason. This government has undertaken to increase the competitive forces, and by increasing the competitive forces we will get downward pressure on the prices. The introduction of the independents, particularly Woolworths, has had the enormous effect in country areas of forcing the four majors to reduce their prices in country areas.
The government are fully aware of the sensitivities of petrol pricing and have introduced a reform scheme to deregulate so as to introduce competitive pressures on the petrol prices. Our plan is to abolish the sites act and the franchise act, as well as the Laidley agreement which prevented direct access to the terminals, but we are not going to abolish them—this is something the other side failed to acknowledge during this debate—until we get an Oilcode.
It sits on the table until an Oilcode, agreed to by the oil companies and the service station owners, is signed off. Until that happens it sits on the table. There will be no rush to deregulate until all parties accept the Oilcode so as to ensure fair and proper competition and so that the four major oil companies do not get an unfair advantage. Any private member's bill that the other side bring in is, I think, to be dismissed immediately, and any opportunism that they bring to this debate is to be dismissed. (Time expired)

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-09-23,"—I table a statement by the Minister for Trade on a report on the visit to South America and the meetings of the Cairns Group and APEC, together with a copy of Australia's APEC Individual Action Plan for 1999. I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
REPORT ON VISIT TO SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE MEETINGS OF THE CAIRNS GROUP AND APEC
STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT
I thank the House for this opportunity to report on the outcomes of my visit earlier this month to four South American countries, and on the meetings of the Cairns Group and APEC that I also attended.
Cairns Group Ministerial meeting
In Buenos Aires, I chaired the nineteenth Ministerial Meeting of the Cairns Group of fair trading agricultural nations from 27-29 August.
Mr Speaker, coming less than three months before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) meeting at Seattle which is expected to agree on an agenda and a framework for WTO trade negotiations, the Cairns Group meeting could not have been more timely. I am pleased to report that, in a strongly worded communique, the Group reaffirmed its commitment to an ambitious liberalising outcome from the next round of agricultural negotiations and agreed to work closely during the lead-up to Seattle.
The meeting reconfirmed the Group's ambitions for freer, fairer and more market-oriented global trading conditions, with trade in agriculture placed on the same footing as trade in other products. The Group agreed that at Seattle, they would push for a clear and detailed mandate for agricultural negotiations to ensure they begin on time, conclude before 2003, and have clear objectives.
The Group also welcomed the strong message of support from Mr Dan Glickman, US Secretary for Agriculture, who was a guest at the meeting and who assured us that the United States would not agree to any WTO outcome that did not include a good result on agriculture. Given the broad convergence of Cairns Group and US interests, Secretary Glickman agreed that the United States should 
 cooperate closely with the Cairns Group in the lead-up to Seattle and beyond.
Mr Speaker, Secretary Glickman's presence also gave me another opportunity to convey Australia's continuing concerns over the US decision to restrict Australian lamb exports, and also to seek details on the United States' proposed US$7.5 billion emergency farm aid package. Secretary Glickman assured me that the proposed package would not breach US obligations under the WTO.
Cairns Group Ministers agreed to meet next in Seattle on the eve of the WTO Conference, and again in Canada next year.

South American visits
Mr Speaker, during my trip to South America from 27 August to 5 September I visited Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. Highlights of those visits included the signature of a double taxation agreement with Argentina, the opening of the new Australian Consulate-General and Austrade office in Lima and an IDP Education Australia office in Sao Paulo, and high-level official and business contacts in all countries visited. My meetings with Australian business representatives emphasised the trade and investment opportunities for Australian companies in the region, particularly in the mining, agri-business, infrastructure and services sectors. The rapid development of these markets demonstrates the effectiveness of the Government's policy of encouraging greater market diversification by Australian exporters.
Merchandise exports to South America were valued at just $200 million in the mid-1980s, but have grown to around $900 million in 1998-99. While Australia's exports are concentrated in the minerals and resources sector, exports of manufactures have grown strongly in the last decade and now account for over 40 per cent of all exports. With merchandise imports from South America valued at $550 million in 1998-99, Australia enjoys a substantial merchandise trade surplus with the region.
South America is also a promising market for services, and Australian exports of services now exceed $250 million. Apart from traditional areas like banking, finance and mining, there are also new opportunities in education, superannuation, health and telecommunications.
Investment, estimated at $3.6 billion in mid-1998, has been the cornerstone of Australia's involvement in the region. South America's strong resource and agricultural base has been attractive to Australian companies, particularly the mining sector, but the range of Australian investment is diversifying.
The longer-term economic outlook for the countries I visited is positive. All have massive natural resources, increasingly affluent populations and are moving towards more open markets. Opportunities 
 in South America warrant a fresh look by Australian businesses and the Government is doing its part to help, as the new trade- focused Consulate-General in Lima demonstrates. And the current inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into Australia's Trade and Investment Relationship with South America will provide a valuable review of Australia's links with this region.

APEC Ministerial meeting
Mr Speaker, together with my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I attended the APEC Ministerial Meeting in Auckland on 9 and 10 September. I went with three key objectives:
to produce a strong unambiguous statement of support by APEC for the launch of a new WTO round;
to maintain the emphasis in APEC on trade and investment liberalisation and to ensure that Individual Action Plans reflect a determination to meet the Bogor goals; and
to highlight the useful trade facilitation work that has been done by APEC and to accelerate progress where possible.
I'm pleased to report that the Ministerial and Leaders' meetings delivered strong outcomes that very much met these objectives.
We now have an unambiguous commitment by the Asia-Pacific region to a pragmatic set of negotiations that deliver substantial improvements in market access. The agreement forged by APEC in Auckland, which has set the scene for a successful WTO meeting in Seattle, includes:
a call for comprehensive market access negotiations, including on industrial tariffs in addition to agriculture and services;
agreement that the Round should be completed in three years as a single package without precluding the possibility of early results on a provisional basis—including the Accelerated Tariff Liberalisation package; and
on agriculture, a commitment to participate actively and constructively in the negotiations, and support for the elimination of agricultural export subsidies and unjustifiable export prohibitions and restrictions.
Another significant outcome of the meeting was agreement to improve APEC members' Individual Action Plans, the documents which record the steps economies have taken—or will take—to reach the APEC goals of free and open trade and investment. I will be working hard to ensure that the Individual Action Plan process delivers better market access for Australian companies and that the Plans themselves are improved. To this end, Australia will provide technical assistance to help developing economy APEC members produce better Plans. 

Mr Speaker, I presented Australia's own Individual Action Plan to APEC in Auckland and today I have the pleasure of tabling it for the information of Honourable Members. I commend it to the House.
I also used the margins of the APEC meeting to launch a study on the benefits to APEC members of opening up sugar markets in the region. Australian sugar producers are the most efficient in the world and I will be doing all I can to highlight the distortions in global sugar trade, including at the WTO meeting in Seattle.
The other outcome from Auckland with which I was closely involved was an agreement to boost business facilitation. APEC's work on streamlining standards, customs procedures, business travel and in other areas complements the more traditional trade liberalisation work and reduces costs of conducting business in the region in a very concrete and direct way. For example, the Auckland meeting signed off on a new Mutual Recognition Agreement on Conformity Assessment for electrical and electronic goods which could take five per cent off the production costs of this US$250 billion regional trade—saving exporters and consumers up to US$12.5 billion a year, once fully implemented. APEC Ministers agreed in Auckland to give more attention to this practical kind of work and to involve business groups more in setting priorities and taking advice.

Conclusion
Mr Speaker, the Cairns Group and APEC meetings have laid the groundwork for the crucial WTO meeting in Seattle. I am encouraged by the great support Australia has generated for its WTO objectives, and our Government is determined to pull out all stops to ensure that those objectives are met.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,"<title>Report on Visit to South America, and the Meetings of Cairns Group and APEC</title>",Ministerial Statements,28,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
I seek leave to make a short statement in reply.
Leave granted.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Go ahead, Senator Cook.
—He is complaining about what an idiot Senator Ian Macdonald is.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask for that to be withdrawn.
—Senator Carr, I think you should withdraw.
—I withdraw.
—Let's get back to business.
—Mr Vaile's statement dealt with the Cairns Group, South America and APEC. I will respond in each area and make some general comments about where this leaves us—with a new World Trade Organisation round fast approaching.
Overall, it has to be said that this is an insipid and weak statement. It reads like a travelogue rather than a serious report on policy and a report on how Australia's interests have been advanced by the Minister for Trade in these three areas. What is now of critical urgency is that the Howard government say what its policy position will be when the expected millennium round commences in Seattle, as it is anticipated it will at the end of November this year. In particular, Australians are entitled to know what the government's position is on competition policy as part of the world trade agenda, on investment measures, on labour standards, on environmental measures and on what is now fast becoming a controversial matter—genetically modified organisms.
I turn first to that part of Minister Vaile's statement dealing with the Cairns Group. Mr Vaile gives us a potted summary of the objectives of the Cairns Group but nothing on the challenges it will face and how it intends to meet them. Worse, he betrays no sense that he understands how the Cairns Group fits into the overall trade picture. It has to be said that eight of the 15 Cairns Group countries are also members of APEC but there is no mention in the statement as to how that substantial bloc, in favour of agricultural trade liberalisation, could have played a role at the recent APEC conference. It reminds us on this side of the Cairns Group communique from Buenos Aires in August which read more like a tirade against agricultural protection than a strategy for removing the barriers that cost Australian farmers so dearly. It might as well have been recycled from the year before with just the names and the dates changed. My point here is that this is a significant group that gives Australia more clout in world trade negotiations than our ordinary size would 
 suggest, and there ought to have been in the statement some vision about how we intended to affect the millennium round to open up the world agricultural markets.
Finally, dealing with this part of the statement, Mr Vaile said that the US Secretary for Agriculture, Mr Dan Glickman, assured him that the US $7.5 billion aid package to American farmers to support them because of lower commodity prices does not breach WTO rules. But there are some more fundamental questions for him to deal with and which we would have expected would have been in the forefront of the mind of a former agriculture minister. First, will the US package hurt Australian farmers? Second, if so, what does he intend to do about it? I look forward to hearing Mr Vaile's answers on those matters.
Mr Vaile in this statement also reports on his visit to South America. It is terrific to see Mr Vaile visiting four South American countries and ensuring that Australian exporters get slightly better access to those markets. But while Mr Vaile is focusing on market access, there is a much bigger game being played out—that is, the free trade agreement game. Negotiations are currently occurring on free trade agreements between a range of Asian countries and their South American trading partners. These include Japan and Mexico, Singapore and Mexico, and Korea and Chile.
All these agreements, if they were to succeed, would hurt Australia. But it is not only that we are not being asked to play some of these games; even when we are asked to play we seem to choose to sit on the sidelines. The one potential free trade agreement that might include Australia is known as P5, made up of the United States, New Zealand, Australia, Chile and Singapore. However, despite frequent entreaties from the New Zealanders, we are refusing to put any real work into P5 whatsoever. Why? It is almost impossible to know because the minister has made no public statements about it. Perhaps trade for this government is limited to trade promotion.
Let me now turn to APEC. Labor feels passionately about APEC, which is why in June Kim Beazley gave a pathways speech focusing on APEC and I produced a 27-page 
 discussion paper on APEC. We cannot help but despair as we watch the organisation of APEC drift into irrelevance under the Howard government. Mark Vaile's goals for APEC give some idea of where the organisation has got to.
Labor has urged the government to grasp the nettle of achieving the Bogor goals of free trade by 2010 for developed countries and by 2020 for developing countries. We have pointed out that the next WTO round will be the last round to be completed before the year 2010. If Australia wants to see the Bogor goals achieved, it needs to get them up in the WTO. That means APEC members—who had all committed themselves to the Bogor goals—agreeing to take those goals together into the WTO round. Instead, anxious not to aim for something that is not absolutely sure to be achieved, the government opted to just have APEC members endorse a new round—a modest objective if ever there was one. Mr Vaile's second and third goals for APEC are vacuous in the extreme. Goal No. 2 is:
.	 to maintain the emphasis in APEC on trade and investment liberalisation . . . 
It is an extraordinarily anodyne goal. Surely this is the core of what APEC is about. How difficult can it be to focus the organisation's attention on its reason for existence? Goal No. 3 is:
.	 to highlight the useful trade facilitation work that has been done by APEC . . . 
This is not a goal; it is a public relations strategy. I quote it again:
.	 to highlight the useful trade facilitation work that has been done by APEC . . . 
Amidst all of this vacuity there is no mention of China's accession to the World Trade Organisation. Whilst it was not an agenda item at the Auckland APEC meeting, the meeting between President Bill Clinton of the United States and President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China was one of the major events in Auckland, yet it does not even rate a mention in Mr Vaile's report. What is the government doing, if anything, to promote China's accession to the World Trade Organisation?
We understand that Australia and China have settled their bilateral package. It is in the 
 national economic interest of this country for China's membership of the WTO to go ahead. It will help stabilise the Chinese economy and enable them to continue with further restructuring and addressing their unemployment needs. This is a matter in our national interest and it should be clear on the agenda where Australia stands and what Australia is doing to achieve a positive outcome, rather than Australia hanging back and waiting for settlement with the superpowers without any consideration about what our role can be in forging some sort of agreement on that front.
Today's platitudinous statement will do nothing to reassure those who are looking for a sense of drive and vision in November's Seattle World Trade Organisation meeting. Already we are being told privately that the minister is not sure whether he wants to liaise with Australian business in Seattle. Conditions for liberalising world trade are better than at any time in the past 20 years, but there is no sense that this government is ready to play the leading role that Australia played in the Uruguay Round.
In the concluding stages of the Uruguay Round, Australia sat with the United States, Europe and Japan and forged the final outcome. It did so because as the permanent chair of the Cairns Group it had a major stake in ensuring that agricultural trade liberalisation proceeded. The fundamental position adopted by Australia in the concluding stages of the Uruguay Round was that there would be no agreement to a settlement in the whole of the trade package for the rest of the world unless there was a settlement on agriculture. By holding strongly to that point and being supported by the Cairns Group countries—the nations of South-East Asia, Latin America, New Zealand and Canada—we were able to force a major breakthrough in terms of agricultural liberalisation.
We opened the door. The door is not open all the way, but it is substantially opened. The challenge for this coming round is to push the door open all of the way. That means dealing with issues of agricultural protection that we have seen on the rise in Japan, particularly in the rice industry where access by Australian rice producers has declined, and to see that 
 American subsidies for agriculture—which, irrespective of their WTO compliance, will nonetheless dilute world prices—do not harm Australian agricultural interests. These issues and the opening up of the common agricultural policy in Europe are major issues. In the statement there ought to have been some vision about how we intend to deal with them, rather than leaving Australian farmers wondering what this government is doing on the international trade front to open market access for them. Our farmers are the most competitive agricultural producers in the world. They export most of what they produce. If they cannot get into foreign markets because of barriers to trade, then this government is to blame.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-23,"—I would like to speak briefly to this Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. It is a significant report. As honourable senators would know, the Democrats have spoken for many years about the need to improve the treatment of gay, lesbian and bisexual people in Australian society. There are still wide ranging areas of discrimination. As my colleague Senator Greig outlined in his excellent first speech a couple of weeks ago, this discrimination has very real impacts on many people throughout the Australian community.
There is no logical rationale for that ongoing discrimination. This report addresses one of those areas—which is the superannuation entitlements of same sex couples—and it examines federal legislation. I urge all senators to examine the issues that are contained in this report. It is a fairly straightforward report, because in many ways it is a straightforward issue. Perhaps in years gone by, when there was less of a social understanding or acceptance of de facto couples, the concept might have been a bit harder for people to wrestle with. But, clearly, to suggest that there should be some fundamental difference between de facto heterosexual couples and same sex couples is absurd. There is no social or legal justification for such a differentiation.
Clearly, there are many people who are disadvantaged by the fact that their sexual orientation is what determines the fact that they cannot access their partner's superannuation and that they have fewer entitlements 
 than others in the Australian community. It is a fundamental and clear-cut area of unjustifiable and inappropriate discrimination and one that leads to a significant proportion of the Australian population being discriminated against unfairly. On behalf of the Democrats I urge all members of all parties in this chamber and in this parliament to support moves to address the areas of discrimination such as the one outlined in this report from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.
It is probably appropriate that I also mention the Democrats' private senator's bill that has been in this place for over three years now—originally introduced by former senator Sid Spindler. It has been the subject of a comprehensive Senate committee inquiry which produced a lot of helpful information. The passage of that legislation would address not just this problem of superannuation entitlements of same sex couples but also many other areas of unfair discrimination. I also urge senators and, ideally, eventually members in the other place to lend their support to that legislation in order to address the issues that are raised in this report.

"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1999-09-23,"—I welcome the response to this report—and not only for the reason that the response has been lodged. The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration into the working holiday makers scheme, entitled Working holiday makers: more than tourists , was presented to the parliament in August 1997. Here we are in September 1999, two years and one month later, and we get a response to the report—a report on a matter that the minister himself initiated that there should be inquiry into. There is a convention around the place, which I know is not rigidly adhered to, that the government respond to committee reports within three months. Nobody in the chamber expects that that will be adhered to on a rigid basis, but I think that having to wait two years and one month for a response is perhaps an indication that things could be done better than has been the case on this particular occasion.
The working holiday makers scheme, as the committee identified, is a very important element of Australia's tourism program. It is also of great importance to various sections of industry that depend on these people from time to time to fill holes in their labour market programs. The government response to the report is welcome, but in itself it is not enough. We are awaiting the report of Mr Noel Hicks. Mr Hicks has been commissioned by the government to look into other elements of what I believe to be part of the working holiday makers program; that is, those elements dealing with transient workers in the agricultural industry—the fruit picking industry. Mr Hicks has been commissioned to do some research and present the minister with a report. Unfortunately, we have no details of whom Mr Hicks has spoken to, where he has travelled and whom he has received submissions from. We are not even sure that the report by Mr Hicks will see the light of day.
I think it is very unfortunate that so many things are now being done in secret by the government. I do not think this leads to good policy development. I was of the opinion that a different body, perhaps even the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, could have undertaken the task that Mr Hicks has been 
 engaged to undertake. Indeed, if the committee had undertaken that task, it would have been conducted in public. The community right across Australia would have been invited to participate in it. I have no knowledge whatsoever of Mr Hicks having any involvement with those involved in Western Australia in that very important element of the program. Anyway, that is an aside from the government response to the report.
The committee worked long and hard in developing the 41 recommendations in the report, which were put to the minister. I am pleased to note that the majority of the recommendations have been accepted by the government. While they have been accepted, however, not all of them have been accepted in full. But it is pleasing to see that the government is at least taking some interest in what the committee put forward to it. That some recommendations have not been accepted is also quite appropriate because, in developing the recommendations that we put to the government, we endeavoured to engage it in the thought processes of more policy development in this area. There were other recommendations which the government did not accept and, as I say, that is part of the policy development area as well, which is quite acceptable to us.
Another area which also probably deserves a mention is the work being commissioned by the minister in appointing the chair of the committee, the member for Hindmarsh, Mrs Chris Gallus, to chair a working group. The working group will oversight the progress and implementation of the harvest trail. Again, this is being done by Mrs Gallus, it is a working group of the government and there is no involvement of the parliament, as such, in its work. I am sure that Mrs Gallus will do a very thorough job of it, but it is a task that probably could have been undertaken by the committee as a whole. Others in the parliament would then be able to have an input into the work that is being done. I would hope that, when that report and Mr Hicks's report are completed and presented to the minister, they will be made public—or, at least, presented to the parliament in order that they can be made public—so that others who have a 
 big interest in this area will be able to give some scrutiny to the work that was undertaken and to any recommendations that may develop from that work.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Migration Committee</title>,Committees,32,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-23,"—I would also like to speak briefly on the government response to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration report on working holiday makers. As Senator McKiernan noted, the response has been a long time coming. Like Senator McKiernan, I am also a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, but I was not involved in the preparation of this report because it was brought down before I came into this place. While it feels like I have been here for an eternity, it is slightly less than two years—but that is still a fair while. I think that is more than adequate time for a government response. While it was a fairly comprehensive report, it was not a set of encyclopedia, and I think it should have been able to be responded to more promptly.
Not having been part of the initial inquiry, I would not seek to say I have extensive knowledge in this area of working holiday makers. But an important and often overlooked part of our migration program is not just working holiday visa holders but temporary visitors of all sorts. Whilst tourists are often not seen as migrants—and in a technical sense they are not—people applying for visitor visas are part of the operation of our laws that relate to enabling people to enter and leave the country and the restrictions and requirements applying to that. Working holiday makers are no different in that regard. There are some areas of overlap in terms of principles and issues that apply across the board. Whilst oftentimes in this place, the Democrats and I focus a lot on refugee and humanitarian issues, which seem a long way removed from working holiday visas, some of those principles do have similarities across the board in terms of fairness of process.
One of the recommendations that was not accepted—and I can understand the rationale, but I think it is still worth highlighting—was that nationals of non-agreement countries involved in the working holiday program be eligible for a working holiday visa if they can 
 satisfy appropriate bona fide checks and are aged between 18 and 25. There was also a recommendation that a cap be introduced on the number of working holiday visas to be granted to nationals of non-agreement countries, with the cap set at five per cent of the overall program number.
Not having been part of the committee's deliberations, I would not want to completely speak on what the motivation for those recommendations was. But from my point of view from reading them, it seemed like a very sensible approach of trying to ensure there is at least some small amount of input from non-agreement countries. The agreement countries at present are limited to Canada, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Japan, Korea and Malta. The committee felt there are a lot of other countries in the world outside that group of seven whose people would benefit—and so would Australia—if a wider range of people were able to come to this country under this program.
The feeling I get from the government's response is that not only do they not want to have a five per cent cap but they are moving further away from offering visas to non-agreement country nationals. They are trying to extend the program to other countries, which is a good thing, and they want to emphasise the issue of reciprocity—where we allow people in from particular countries if those countries allow Australians in. That is a principle I would agree with as well.
Nonetheless, I do believe that enabling a small number of people in from non-agreement countries is important. I have a small concern that some of the broader countries outside those agreement countries are developing countries. It is beneficial for Australia and for the individual person to come here on those sorts of visas, and it is also beneficial for them to be able to go back to developing countries and take part of what they have learnt from Australia, which could be of assistance to those countries.
I have expressed in this place before some concern about what appears to be an approach which makes it harder for people from particular countries to get visitor visas of any type into Australia because of a heightened 
 level of suspicion on the part of the department that those people are more likely to overstay, breach the terms of their conditions, come here and seek a protection visa or things such as that. Whilst I do not suggest those concerns should not occupy the thoughts of the department at all, I do feel they have been overemphasised in recent times. I wonder if a bit of that feeling is spilling over into the government's response in relation to people from non-agreement countries getting working holiday visas. I do not know if that is the case; I simply flag it as a hope that it is not and a concern that we ensure it is not. People on working holiday visas from developing countries can offer just as much to Australia as people from the UK, Canada and Ireland, and I think it would be beneficial to Australia to have a broader range of people from different nationalities able to access this program.
The government, I suppose, would argue it is going down that track somewhat more slowly but more coherently by trying to expand the number of agreement countries. I recognise that and do not have a problem with it, but I do express a bit of disappointment that, if anything, a further reduction in the number of people from non-agreement countries is going to occur. Potentially, eventually, not allowing any at all appears to be a possible implication one could draw from the government's response here, which I think would be a shame. Nonetheless, it is pleasing to see the government has responded positively to many recommendations, but it would be better if it had responded positively somewhat quicker.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-09-23,"—Honourable senators will recall my addressing the Senate on Wednesday, 1 September with regard to a very large predicament in the potato industry in Tasmania as a consequence of a potato disease scare raised by Western Australian quarantine offices. Three russet burbank potatoes, part of a small consignment from Tasmanian to Western Australia, had been identified as possibly carrying the exotic disease bacterial ring rot. I am pleased to report that the outcome, after extensive tests and investigations, proved that there was no substance to the allegation. In fact, tests on DNA of the disease, specifically brought in from Canada for matching, proved beyond any doubt that the disease was not bacterial ring rot. The good news, unfortunately, was tainted. The massive overreaction has sinister political overtones.
I have already brought to the Senate's attention the transfer of Simplot's potato tonnage from Western Australia to Tasmania and the trouble with quarantine documents for potatoes from Tasmania entering Western Australia since that date. It also appears that Western Australians became very angry when potato cyst nematode, or PCN, was found to exist in their state because this put the lid on them selling potatoes to other states which do not have the disease. I inform the Senate that Tasmania does not have potato cyst nematode, but Tasmanian potato growers have unfortunately been victimised.
This very foolish exercise by Western Australian quarantine officers has brought the possibility of an exotic potato disease existing in Australia to the world's attention. How absolutely stupid! The damage done by this exercise will be absolutely enormous. Now producers from all over Australia wishing to export will have to try to explain the situation to likely buyers. It is extremely difficult to undo this type of damage and along the way it costs the industry very dearly. All Western Australian quarantine officers involved in this scam should hang their heads in shame.
The officer who found the first potato was inexperienced in the identification of potato diseases and, without a sound second or even third opinion, the Western Australian media were notified. The whistle was blown loud and clear, far and wide. ABC radio in Tasmania was advised by ABC Western Australia that a consignment of Tasmanian potatoes was suspected of carrying or having bacterial ring rot. In the absence of any positive identification of the disease, this action was totally irresponsible. The Tasmanian farmers are not amused. In fact, they are hurt and they are angry.
Both the farmer who grew the potatoes and the packer who shipped the potatoes have been disadvantaged financially. The packer has been affected considerably because the two containers that landed in Western Australia, the two containers on the water and 200 tonnes of potatoes in his warehouse were all quarantined. The two containers on the land and the two on the water could not be used until the whole mess was cleared, but by that time the potatoes, having been stored inappropriately, went soft and they sprouted. They were wasted and thrown out. Some of them were unusable before that time anyway because, after finding one suspect potato, quarantine officers in Western Australia cut two tonnes of potatoes in half trying to find further evidence. But no further evidence was found.
The farmer not only suffered financially but also suffered health wise. The stress was enormous, and he became stricken with shingles. As well as farming he has a contracting business, and the machinery that was 
 not on his farm at the time was being used on other farms. Owners of those farms became paranoid—not surprisingly—that their property could catch the alleged disease, even though nothing had been proven.
The disease had never before existed in Australia. I repeat: never before! And one inexperienced quarantine officer caused this monumental problem with immeasurable damage. I say: that person should be sacked. But what about compensation? You can bet the Western Australian department involved will not pay for it. There is no precedent for compensation being paid and probably no likelihood of it being paid. The irony is that if the disease had been found, then compensation would have been paid. Approaches by the packer to the Tasmanian Minister for Primary Industries, David Llewellyn, were unanswered until an assistant returned his call—not the minister himself. This is an insult to one who has suffered so much, and none of it from his own wrongdoing. The Tasmanian Premier's department was also contacted, but it has not even bothered to return the call. The national body must closely investigate this case. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia is responsible for export controls on primary industries products.
There are many questions to be answered: why was a very loud panic button pressed after only one suspected potato was found in a consignment of two shipping containers, especially when the disease was not known to exist in Australia? Why weren't experienced quarantine officers called in to check the suspect find? Why was such a hasty decision taken? Why weren't the Tasmanian quarantine officials given the opportunity to comment on whether or not it was likely for bacterial ring rot to have been found? Why was the packer in Tasmania notified of the problem by his buyer, not the department of primary industries in Western Australia or even the department in Tasmania? Why did it take five days for a sample of the suspect potato to reach the Tasmanian laboratory for testing? Why were the results of the first test inconclusive—indeed, what were the testing procedures? Is there a need for a better and more rapid identification system? Precisely so.
Why did it take exactly three weeks from the time of the quarantine being implemented to it being lifted—and that was the day after I raised it in the Senate, incidentally; three agonising weeks for the Tasmanian potato industry? Why all along the way did Western Australian quarantine officers and department officials frustrate the situation? Those involved in Western Australia knew what they were doing. The issue is very political from an agricultural point of view, with Western Australia trying to protect its own industry. I believe the whole issue was quite disgraceful. I thank the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Tasmanian Potatoes: Ring Rot Disease</title>,Adjournment,33,1
