"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-03-07,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked by Senators Sherry and George Campbell today relating to the economy and interest rates.
In question time today Labor posed a number of questions on key economic issues to the Minister for Finance and Administration and Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Minchin. These questions follow the release of some important economic data last week with respect to interest rates, the current account deficit, national debt and economic growth. This follows a series of questions the opposition has been asking not just about figures relating to last week but with respect to the general economic performance of the Australian economy, particularly over the last three or four months.
Today we have seen, as we have seen on previous occasions, an arrogant, out-of-touch and complacent display from the Liberal government economic ministers. Over the last 10 years in the Senate—and it has been 10 years of Liberal government—time and time again we have had ministers, such as Senator Minchin, boasting about the Liberal government’s economic performance and its economic credentials, boasting about how good things are in a whole range of areas. They have continually talked about interest rates, government debt and economic growth, and they have taken all the credit. I do not find that surprising.
These ministers have continually reminded the Australian people that the Liberal government was responsible for a range of economic data, which they acclaimed were good economic data. More often than not, they have found it very convenient to do two other things. Firstly, they ignore any bad economic data—and there have been some bad economic data over a long period. The current account deficit and household and personal savings have not been good areas of economic performance under this government. If they do not want to ignore the bad economic data, they adopt a second strategy: if there is bad economic data, you blame someone else. So they take the credit for good economic data and blame someone else for the bad economic data—the blame game; blame someone else.
This blame has been ratcheted up in recent times. In the past we have had drought blamed for poor economic circumstances, we have had the SARS disease, we have had the Asian economic crisis and now we see a new range of individual organisations responsible for bad economic data. The states have been blamed, the Public Service has been blamed, Labor has been blamed—now the Senate is being blamed. All the time, the government cannot front up when there is some bad news. After 10 years, you would think they would take a little bit of responsibility and at least front up and honestly admit, ‘We could’ve done better in this particular area.’ But, no, we get the blame game all the time. Good economic news, take the credit; bad economic news, everyone is to blame but the Liberal government! We are seeing more and more of that as we are given bad news on economic data and fundamental issues about the Australian economy.
I mentioned that household savings in Australia—together with the United States—is almost the lowest, if not the lowest, of any advanced economy in the world. Our current account deficit, which is the deficit of imports over exports, now stands at 7.1 per cent of gross domestic product. Not only is that a record current account deficit for Australia but, again, it is the highest—even significantly higher than the United States—current account deficit amongst the 15 advanced economies. That is adding to the national debt of this country.
There was an interest rate rise last week. This government has continually talked about interest rates. At the last election it said—or certainly implied—that interest rates would not go up under a re-elected Liberal government. What happened? Interest rates went up by one-quarter of a per cent last week. We have the highest interest rates in the advanced economic world. (Time expired)

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2005-03-07,"—It is obvious from the nature of the questions asked by honourable senators opposite that they have come into this place yet again without a plan and without a clue as to how to keep the Howard-Costello government accountable. We have just heard a speech that basically said nothing. I suggest to Senator Sherry and to others on his side of the Senate that they are simply asking the wrong questions. They should be asking what the independent umpire, the OECD, in its 2004 economic survey has concluded about the performance of the Australian economy under the Howard-Costello government. They should also be asking: what has this government done in relation to the fundamental prerequisites for sustaining the record economic growth and achievement that Australia has been experiencing under this government?
I know that Senator Johnston, who is to follow me, will talk about record low interest rates, record low levels of unemployment, record employment growth and record labour force participation rates under the Howard-Costello government. But let me quote the independent umpire. It is okay for people like me on this side of the Senate to come in and say, ‘Look, we’re doing fantastically well.’ It is not surprising that some people listening to that would discount what is said as self-praise, although I would suggest to honourable senators opposite that self-praise is well and truly merited in this case.
Here are some of the key points that the independent umpire, the OECD, made in its 2004 survey of the Australian economy. It provided a strong endorsement of the government’s management and Australia’s economic performance. The OECD survey noted that ‘in the last decade of the 20th century, Australia became a model for other OECD countries’ in relation to structural reform and its adoption of medium-term macro-economic frameworks. It also noted that the government has made ‘commendable progress’ towards reforming the tax system and comments on the ‘remarkable progress’ Australia has made in strengthening competition. So there you have it: an independent umpire, not members of the government, giving us a big tick.
Look at what the government has done to put in place strong economic measures and strong infrastructure measures to sustain that growth. That has given us, as I said, record low unemployment rates, record employment creation, record low interest rates and a record participation rate, which means that a lot of job seekers have great confidence in the Australian economy and want to participate in the activity that is occurring in the economy of Australia. What else has the government done in order to sustain this level of economic activity? Look at infrastructure. Whether it is hard infrastructure, such as road infrastructure spending, or whether it is social infrastructure, such as that which we put into schools, universities, science and higher education, there is a significant commitment by the government to long-term sustainable progress.
Have a look at AusLink. We launched a white paper, then we committed over a five-year period $12.5 billion, from 2004-05 to 2008-09. That is record infrastructure spending and commitment. Look at the revitalisation of the national rail network. In 2004 the wholly government owned national rail track manager, the Australian Rail Track Corporation, assumed control of the New South Wales interstate and Hunter Valley tracks and now provides a single access regime from Perth to the Queensland border. That was an investment of $1.8 billion.
Look at enhanced transport security. The government has provided $35 million to support the security measures which make our infrastructure safe. Look at the natural disaster mitigation and relief measures that have been implemented so that we can get businesses, and particularly rural businesses, over the hump. Again, there have been massive amounts of expenditure; $89.4 million has been earmarked for 2004-05. Financial assistance to local government is $1.5 billion in untied grants to local councils to provide infrastructure and services to their communities. I could keep going, but time is going to beat me.
The government are committed to infrastructure expenditure and continuing sound economic management to enhance the achievements that we are already able to talk about. We do not do it in a skiting, insincere way but in a way that is demonstrable not just in this place but in the electorate. That is the major reason why, I suggest to honourable senators opposite, the government were so handsomely returned at the last election. Those opposite need to be asking relevant questions, which will get truthful answers. On this side of the chamber we are always truthful. (Time expired)

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2005-03-07,"—I also seek to take note of answers given to questions from the opposition in relation to the Australian economy. I make the point that what is remarkable about the government is that from 1996 they have perfected the art of doublespeak: saying one thing and meaning something totally different. Now they have started perfecting the art of the blame game. They took a number of questions from the opposition today in relation to the Australian economy. In not one answer did they even remotely accept that after 10 years somehow or other they might be responsible for problems in the Australian economy. If there is a positive they are quick to point out that they are running the economy. If it is a negative they are quick to point out what happened 15, 20 or 30 years ago. But nothing that they could have done or would have since 1996 could have impacted upon the economy!
Let me make three brief points in relation to that. The reality is that the facade is starting to crack. We have seen interest rates rise. We have seen the Reserve Bank put up interest rates. Why? Because of concerns about the implications for the Australian economy of the overheating of the labour market and the potential for wages to increase rapidly. We have seen our current account deficit blow out to 7.1 per cent of GDP—the worst record in the nation’s history. We have seen foreign debt reach a staggering $421 billion—triple what it was under Labor in 1996.
We all know what the Treasurer, Peter Costello, said in 1995 about the debt truck, about foreign debt, and the implications that would have for interest rates. We all know what the then Leader of the Opposition, the current Prime Minister, John Howard, said in 1995 about our foreign debt. Those on the other side of the chamber have conveniently forgotten. If those two men were honest and judged themselves by their performance and what they said about others in 1995, Peter Costello would not be worried about going to the Lodge, because he would be going back to the unemployed ranks, and our Prime Minister would be joining him, because, based on their own measure of success and failure in 1995, they have both failed miserably.
The worst performance of all by this government has been in the skills area. Since 1996, when this government came to power, there has been an evident decline in the number of young people under training in the traditional trades area. There has been a significant decline over the past three or four years, but that decline has been evident since 1996. What has this government done about it? Absolutely nothing. It cut funding to TAFE in three years—I think it was in 1997, 1999 and 2001—yet the Prime Minister had the cheek to go on the Sunday program yesterday and say that young people ought to go into the technical stream. They cannot get into the technical stream, because there are not enough places for those young people because the government will not put the funding in.
I chaired the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee, which reported to the Senate on skills shortages two years ago. The report made three points, covered some 50 recommendations about identifying where the shortages were and covered our VET network and the role of industry in meeting those skills shortages. That report was tabled 18 months ago, and the Minister for Education, Science and Training is yet to respond to those 50 recommendations. What has he done? He has sat on his hands and done nothing, because he has no idea of how to deal with the skills issue and he has no idea of how to deal with young people. Why do you think there are problems in Macquarie Fields? Why do you think there are problems in our outer suburbs? Because young people cannot get into decent training and decent employment in order to get jobs so that they can create a decent future for their families. (Time expired)

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2005-03-07,"—We really need some form of award for the opposition, given their misconstruction of the facts. The only time you see the faintest flicker of life or enthusiasm on the other side of this chamber is when the opposition suspect there is a bit of a free kick in some bad news. Let me remind the chamber and, indeed, all of those good people out there who are listening: this is good news for Australia. Senator George Campbell would be pleased to know that in Western Australia the current rate of unemployment is 4.6 per cent—the lowest it has been in 35 years. Everybody has a good job. We have the highest rate of average weekly earnings.
Let me suggest to the opposition that there is more good news than that: we have an economy that is the envy of the OECD and the Western world. Here is the adjudication. The OECD 2004 economic survey of Australia said that ‘in the last decade of the 20th century, Australia has become a model for other OECD countries’. It noted that the government has made commendable progress towards reforming the tax system and commented on the remarkable progress Australia has made in strengthening competition. That is all in the face of the following adversities: we have had an Asian economic meltdown, where we have seen the stock market in Singapore, Bangkok and Hong Kong go through the floor; we have seen SARS devastate our tourist industry; we have seen avian influenza, or the bird flu, cause massive problems in economic growth in China; we have seen historically high oil prices; and we have seen a crippling drought across the whole nation. I want to draw this point to the learned senator’s attention: interest rates throughout that drought were about 5½ to 6½ per cent, and, let me tell you, it was a lot easier then for those farmers and primary producers than it was when Labor were last in power, when they were paying 20 per cent and 30 per cent to stay alive.
We inherited a $90 billion black hole from the previous Beazley government. Our reforms and our economic approach have had the Labor Party in this chamber standing on the hose, seeking to make cheap political points at every turn of the corner. Let me tell you what they have stopped us from doing. We wanted to exempt small business from unfair dismissal laws, but do you think that was an acceptable approach to the opposition? No—they stopped that; they ganged up on the government with the Democrats and the Greens and opposed that reform. We wanted to streamline the processing of Australian workplace agreements. Do you think the opposition wanted to do that? No—they wanted to defend the CFMEU running riot on building sites throughout the country. But, let me say to every Australian’s satisfaction, come 30 June things will get better on that front.
When we introduced legislation for secret ballots in the taking of industrial action, the Labor Party, in line with their accord and their obedience to their union masters, stopped that legislation. We wanted to reform welfare to tighten the rules governing access to disability support pensions, and again the Labor Party stood on the hose. We wanted to change media ownership laws to refine and reform media ownership and the operation of media in Australia, and the opposition opposed that. We wanted to sell Telstra, and of course they opposed that. All of these reforms have been opposed by the opposition in a most politically greedy and desperate fashion, in the vain hope of seeking to establish some form of goodwill with the Australian people. Of course, we know how much goodwill they established at the last federal election: they went absolutely backwards. Notwithstanding the opposition’s obfuscation, obstruction and stand-on-the-hose mentality in this place, the government have given Australians substantial tax relief by raising the threshold for the 30c tax rate from $20,000 to $21,600.

"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2005-03-07,"—I must say that it has been quite a remarkable performance by those opposite. So far, in discussing the downturn in the Australian economy, the government have managed to blame the Asian economic crisis, SARS, bird flu, the Senate and a government that lost power some 13 years ago. What we are really witnessing is a government that has been in power for 13 long years and that cannot accept responsibility for its own inaction.
—It is nine years, not 13 years.
—Yes, indeed, Senator Murray. This government has been more than happy to claim all the good economic news since its election in 1996 but now we are seeing the result of its inactivity. At last that is coming through. We have an economy that the Prime Minister recently claimed is a victim of its own success. It is not a victim of its own success; it is actually a victim of this government’s sloth and plain old-fashioned idleness—the do-nothing approach while things are good. This government has been idle while the economy has leapt ahead—there is no doubt about that. There have been signs for a long time, yet the government has chosen the easy way out. It has sat and watched the economy grow and then taken all the extra tax revenue that has come along and frittered it away on buying its way back into office time and again. Last year we saw a classic example.
Now we face, amongst other things, a skills crisis. There is a lack of skilled people—a lack of tradespeople. This crisis has not sprung up overnight, as Senator George Campbell has said. It takes years and years for shortages like that to develop. Trade unions and business have been warning for years that a skills crisis was coming, and this government has done almost nothing. In fact it has probably done worse than nothing; since 1997 it has actually turned away over 400,000 people from vocational training or university studies. That is one hell of a record to be proud of. This government’s New Apprenticeships system has not delivered tradespeople in the areas where they are now required. The government’s offer of toolboxes and technical colleges is a case of saying something and offering Australians something way too late. It is clear that the act of announcing something does not actually address the long-term problem. From what we hear in Perth, it may take years before these new technical colleges are built and operating. How is building a technical college that may be ready in five years going to help us now?
Then there is the notion that we can source our labour offshore. Whether that is through guest worker programs, increases in skill migration or the now infamous class 457 visa process, it again smacks of desperation. Surely all those experts that we have at the departments of immigration and employment should have recognised the warning signs of the impending skills shortage through the sheer number of class 457 visa applications over the last few years and through the increases in job vacancies that were unfilled, especially in the trades. The government has been blind to these problems because it is committed to implementing its Job Network and workplace agreements policies while the main game was about the lack of new tradespeople—the game it chose to ignore. At a certain level, Australian business is also to blame for not training new apprentices but who can blame it—another element of the blame game—when the government’s assistance package for apprentices does not compare to the easy and cheaper option of sourcing labour from overseas?
In my time in this place I have dealt with a number of class 457 visa applications. They deal with new categories of labour shortage, and I am sure that Senator George Campbell is aware of them: the fertiliser engineers—the fertiliser plant manufacturers. To the lay person out there, they are actually good old-fashioned workers, but companies on the Kwinana strip and companies in the north-west of Western Australia apply for category 457 visas in these specialised labour areas so that they can import cheap labour from overseas rather than commit to the long-term training and development of Australian labour.
There are many other class 457 visa applicants who come to Western Australia on the promise of working on resource projects in the north-west of my home state. It is not hard to see why qualified tradespeople in other countries would want to work on our resource projects where wages are high. (Time expired)

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2005-03-07,"—At the request of Senator Tchen, Chair of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today Senator Tchen shall move:
No. 1—That Amendment No. 1 to the Transitional Arrangements for Students Guidelines, pursuant to items 4 and 8 of Schedule 1 of the Higher Education Support (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003, be disallowed.
No. 2—That Administration Guidelines, made under section 238-10 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, be disallowed.
No. 3—That OS-Help Guidelines, made under section 238-10 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, be disallowed.
No. 4—That Other Grants Guidelines, made under section 238-10 of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, be disallowed.
—I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—

Amendment No. 1 to the Transitional Arrangements for Students Guidelines

This Amendment excludes students who commenced their qualifying or preliminary course of study before 1997 from paragraph 2.5.1(b) of the Transitional Arrangements for Students Guidelines. The Committee has written to the minister seeking clarification on the commencement date for this Amendment.

Administration Guidelines

These Guidelines revise the Administration Guidelines by including new provisions concerning the reporting obligations of higher education providers and the requirements for provision of Commonwealth Assistance Notices to students.
According to the Explanatory Statement, these Guidelines purport to revoke and replace the previous Administration Guidelines that commenced on 30 June 2004. However, neither the making statement that accompanies these Guidelines, nor the Guidelines themselves, expressly revoke the previous Guidelines.

OS-Help Guidelines

These Guidelines specify procedures to be followed by higher education providers in the selection of students for the receipt of OS-HELP assistance and in the administration of such assistance, and specify the method for determining the number of students who may be selected for such assistance.
Clause 3.5.15 of these Guidelines requires a higher education provider to advise the Department of Education, Science and Training if the provider knows or has reason to believe that a student in receipt of OS-Help assistance has provided false or misleading information to the provider in their application for assistance. The Clause states that the provider should not discuss the matter with the student unless advised to the contrary by the Department. Neither the Clause nor the Explanatory Statement gives information about the reason for this prohibition on contact with the student. It is not clear at what stage the student will be made aware of the provider’s suspicions. Further, it is not clear whether a provider is at liberty to make inquiries of the student in order to confirm whether an initial suspicion is something that should be notified to the Department.

Other Grants Guidelines

These Guidelines specify the requirements for certain grants specified in subsection 41-10(1) of the Act.
Subclause 6.45.1 provides that the Department is bound by the Information Privacy Principles set out in section 14 of the Privacy Act 1988. Subclause 6.45.2 states that the only personal information collected by the Department ‘relates to’ the name, work telephone, fax and email details of the contact officer of the higher education provider. It is not clear whether the words ‘relates to’ imply that personal information other than actual names, telephone/fax numbers and emails will be collected. The impression that other information may be collected is reinforced by subclause 6.45.3, which describes procedures that seem to contemplate a much larger collection of personal information.
Chapter 9 of the Guidelines deals with Grants to Foster Collaboration and Reform in Higher Education. Subclause 9.15.5 provides that 20% of the allocation in each year may be reserved for consideration of proposals that are outside the competitive funding rounds. These proposals must be consistent with objectives of the programme, and they must strategically address programme priorities. Presumably the objectives are those set out in clause 9.5, but it is not clear where the programme priorities are specified.
Clause 9.25 states that application forms and information are available on the Department’s website. It might assist users of these Guidelines if this clause included a cross-reference to the website address.
Chapter 11 of the Guidelines deals with Grants to Enhance the Quality of Australia’s Higher Education Sector. Clause 11.2 lists four bodies corporate that are eligible for grants. Subclause 11.2.10 specifies an amount of grant to the Carrick Institute for 2005 and 2006. No amounts are specified for the other three eligible bodies.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2005-03-07,"—I seek leave to make a statement relating to the Australian task group deployment in Iraq.
Leave granted.
—The Senate will be aware that on 22 February the Prime Minister announced the government’s decision to send an Australian task group to Iraq.
This task group will go to Al Muthanna province in southern Iraq. It will work closely with the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction Support Group, which is making a valuable humanitarian contribution to the rebuilding process in the province. It will also work with British forces, who maintain operational control of southern Iraq.
The Australian task group will have two roles.
First, it will provide a secure environment for the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction Support Group which is currently building roads and schools, ensuring clean water supply, and delivering incidental health services.
Second, the task group will be involved in the further training of the Iraqi security forces. That training is essential if Iraqis are to assume responsibility for their own security.
This deployment was a difficult decision, taken by the government after careful consideration of Australia’s interests and our global and regional responsibilities.
It is a sign of Australia’s commitment to the people of Iraq in their struggle for a better future. It is also a sign of the importance the government places on working with Japan—a close friend and regional partner—on global security issues.
Iraq today is at a critical juncture; the Prime Minister has referred to it as a ‘tilting point’—one where the balance between success and failure turns on a test of wills.
Terrorists and insurgents have set themselves the goal of thwarting the emergence of a secure and democratic Iraq. The international community must deny them this objective.
Australia shares an obligation and an opportunity to help build a secure and democratic Iraq—an opportunity given new force by the magnificent expression of Iraqi democracy that we all witnessed at the end of January.
A failure of will now would be an abrogation of our nation’s interests and values. It would see Australia shun our closest friends, reward our avowed enemies and turn away from a courageous people who have chosen the path of our deepest convictions.

The deployment

The task group will total approximately 450 personnel—the bulk drawn from the Darwin based 1st Brigade. It will include some 40 ASLAV armoured vehicles.
The period from the Prime Minister’s announcement of the task group through to deployment will be about 10 weeks.
The task group will add to approximately 920 ADF personnel that are currently deployed to the Middle East area of operations. At present, some 50 to 70 Australian personnel are engaged in training Iraqi security forces north of Baghdad. This contingent will be rolled into the Al Muthanna Task Group when their current assignment is completed.
The task group will operate under the national command of Australia’s joint task force in the Middle East area of operations, while being under operational control of the UK multi-national division in southern Iraq. ADF units and personnel deployed in Iraq remain under Australian national command and in all their operations will abide by Australian law.
The precise length of the deployment will be determined by circumstances as they emerge, bearing in mind that the central goal of the coalition in Iraq is to ensure the earliest practicable transfer of internal and external security to the Iraqis themselves.
Initially, the task group deployment will be for a period of 12 months, based on two rotations of six months each. If the Japanese presence were to end prior to the conclusion of the initial 12-month deployment, the government would review the operation.
The interim Iraqi government warmly welcomes and endorses the Australian task group deployment. The continued presence of our forces in Iraq will be conditional on the continuing support of the incoming Iraqi transitional government.

The new circumstances

While the Prime Minister has stated consistently that we keep the level and composition of our forces in Iraq under review, he has not sought to disguise the fact that this deployment represents a change in the government’s previously stated position that we did not plan any major increase in our commitment.
This change reflects the convergence of new circumstances on the ground.
As the Prime Minister has said before, from time to time since the end of combat operations, there have been informal requests from the Americans and the British for a greater Australian presence in Iraq.
So far as the decision he announced on 22 February is concerned, the trigger for discussions within the coalition involving Australia was the final confirmation by the Dutch in mid-November 2004 of their decision not to renew their deployment to Iraq.
For the past two years the Dutch have maintained some 1,400 troops in Al Muthanna province providing security for the Japanese forces. Under Japan’s constitution, that country’s military can only operate in a non-combat zone, can only be involved in humanitarian and reconstruction activities, and the use of force by the Japanese is limited to self-defence only.
Unless additional security could be provided to replace the Dutch, there was a real possibility the Japanese could no longer remain in Iraq. This would have been a serious blow to the coalition’s reconstruction effort and to the broader credibility of the coalition in Iraq.
The Senate, of course, will be aware of the very heavy burden being carried in Iraq by the United States and British forces.
Japan’s presence in Iraq as part of the coalition is very important, both in substance and through its symbolism. Japan is a significant Asian power, a great Pacific democracy and a global economic power. Its presence in Iraq indicates the broad range of nations working to assist that country to consolidate a democratic future.
The other factor weighing heavily on the Australian government’s decision making was the success of the Iraqi national elections—an outcome far more inspiring and impressive than anybody was entitled to expect.
Nothing better illustrates what is at stake in Iraq than the memorable images of brave Iraqi men and women holding aloft their ink-stained fingers to record their first ever act of democratic freedom.
We should not underestimate the positive force that this—the first genuine experiment in Arab democracy—can have in bringing a more hopeful future to the Middle East.
Indeed, recent months have seen a number of very positive developments in that troubled region. As well as the success of the Iraqi elections, we have seen new steps towards peace between Israel and the Palestinians. We have seen moves towards multicandidate presidential elections in Egypt and greater democracy at a municipal level in Saudi Arabia. And just last week, there was a dramatic expression of people power in Lebanon which has led to an announcement of a phased Syrian withdrawal from that country.
The importance to all these events of the ousting of Saddam Hussein—opening the way to democracy in Iraq—should not be underestimated. It may yet prove a historic turning point for the Middle East—one that could profoundly alter the outlook for freedom and democracy in that part of the world.
For the benefit of the Senate, I want to put on record the key exchanges between the Australian, British and Japanese governments leading up to the Prime Minister’s announcement of the task group.
Confirmation in mid-November 2004 of the Dutch government’s decision not to renew their Iraq deployment led to discussions between coalition partners on the need to maintain an appropriate security force in Al Muthanna province.
UK Defence Secretary, Mr Geoffrey Hoon, conveyed to me by letter on 20 January 2005 a request for an Australian contribution in the province.
UK Foreign Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, wrote to Mr Downer on 4 February 2005 requesting Australian support.
The National Security Committee of Cabinet met on 16 February 2005 and considered the matter very carefully—on the basis of advice from the Chief of the Defence Force and assessments from relevant intelligence agencies.
The Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Koizumi, telephoned the Prime Minister on 18 February and requested Australia’s contribution.
The British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, telephoned the Prime Minister in Auckland on 21 February to reinforce the requests that had previously been conveyed by Mr Straw to Mr Downer and Mr Hoon to me.
I want to repeat—this deployment to Iraq was not an easy decision for the government. I know it will be unpopular with a good number of Australians. But a government—acting in the national interest—must have a capacity to respond to new circumstances as they arise.

Security situation in Al Muthanna province

The military deployment does involve the risk of casualties. The security situation in this part of Iraq, however, is different from that in other areas such as the Sunni Triangle.
Al Muthanna province has a small population and, relatively speaking, has been free of violence. Nevertheless, Iraq remains a dangerous place and the ADF constantly reviews the threat environment and adjusts its force protection measures accordingly.
The government has ensured that the ADF personnel are well trained and have the right type of equipment for their mission.
All 40 ASLAVs will be fitted with enhanced protective measures to ensure multiple layers of protection for each vehicle. In some cases, enhanced protection will be fitted on arrival in theatre prior to operations commencing. We will not discuss the exact and full details of enhancements to individual vehicles for operational security reasons.
There has been some commentary relating to the fact that the size of the Australian task group is substantially less than the Dutch contingent it is replacing.
This largely reflects the different tasks of the two forces. Whereas the Dutch contingent assumed broad security responsibilities, the Australian task group will have a narrower mission working in collaboration with British forces that will have overall responsibility for the security of the province. The size of the task group also reflects an updated assessment of the enhanced capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
In the end, the figure of 450 personnel reflected the advice provided to cabinet by the Australian Defence Force, following consultations with military officials from Britain, Japan and the United States.

Our responsibilities in the region

This latest commitment to Iraq will not affect Australia’s ability to support current operations or to respond to other national and regional tasks.
Our forces will continue to discharge their other responsibilities to their normal high standard—whether in the Solomon Islands, in East Timor or continuing their important humanitarian work in Operation Sumatra Assist. The ADF is prepared, equipped and structured to face all these challenges.
In a world more interconnected than ever before, Australia must maintain a global perspective on the security threats we face in the 21st century. Australia’s capacity to hold such a perspective—necessarily influenced by regional interests and responsibilities—is a measure of our strategic maturity as a nation.
In closing, I wish to pay tribute to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. Under tough conditions, they are performing magnificent work to secure their country and to extend the reach of peace and freedom.
This deployment is consistent with Australia’s strategic interests and with the best traditions of our forces. I know that the thoughts and prayers of all Australians will be with them when they embark on their mission.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,13,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2005-03-07,"—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the statement.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the statement.
Today’s statement by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives and by the Minister for Defence in the Senate regarding the additional deployment of some 400 troops and equipment to Iraq is much more than a change in position, as described by the minister. It is a major foreign policy deception by the Howard government. It was only last April—27 April 2004, to be precise—that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, declared on the John Laws radio program:
I can definitely say we won’t be adding hundreds, I can definitely say that we’re not going to have a capacity to put more regular soldiers on the ground, we just don’t have that and I’ve made that clear to the Americans and the British all along, it goes back to the beginning of last year.
This was a clear, unambiguous statement that defined the limits of our military capacity to undertake further deployments to Iraq. It was an expression of finality, which denoted in unmistakable terms that Australia had done enough. It was also a political statement designed to close down the domestic debate before a federal election, no matter what changes there were in strategic circumstances.
Labor does not support the deployment of these additional troops. Our argument is not with the troops; they have our absolute support and commitment. We wish our troops safe return and hope their mission goes well. We will do our level best as an opposition to make sure they want for nothing. Having said that, we now face the situation where 450 ADF personnel are replacing a 1,600-strong Dutch force.
Labor’s primary concern whenever Australian troops are deployed overseas is, first and foremost, the safety of our troops. The safety of our troops should be the end product of careful and deliberate planning—planning which encompasses the input of intelligence assessments on the situation in Iraq, particularly covering the area into which our troops are to be deployed; planning which guarantees that our troops are properly trained and prepared for the military tasks that they will undertake; and longer term planning which ensures that our troops have the best equipment that the nation can provide.
In all these aspects this deployment is too hasty and made on the run by the Howard government. They describe it as ‘a change of policy’, made supposedly on the basis of a request from the government of Japan—the origin of which remains to be explained—despite having known of the long-anticipated Dutch withdrawal since mid-2004 and despite having declined a United Nations request for additional military support during 2004 and having been dishonest about the details of that request.
The Australian government had been under pressure from the Americans for a long period of time, but the Prime Minister had made our position clear. Now, he has committed more Australian lives to risk. There is no evidence that any serious intelligence assessments were carried out before cabinet made this decision. A force deployed in this kind of environment needs tanks; it needs armoured fighting vehicles and artillery; and it needs helicopter fire support. That is what the Dutch had in this part of Iraq. They had six Apache attack helicopters which could provide timely responses for combat operations. When our forces were last engaged in this sort of work—in Vietnam—they had overwhelming fire support.
Where are the government’s reasons for approving the deployment of 450 Australians to replace 1,600 Dutch combat troops? We know from leaks from Defence headquarters that the deployment of just 450 was the smallest option that was proposed. We know that our defence chiefs believed that 450 was far below what is needed and offered four more alternatives—
—The British are doing chopper surveillance.
—Senator, you might be happy with the British troops providing security for ours. We have always adopted the policy that we ought to provide our own security. That is what General Cosgrove said was the ADF’s motivation in all previous deployments. But if that is another change of policy I am interested to hear it. What we have is 450 troops replacing 1,600.
—I am quite satisfied.
—You are quite satisfied that the troops are safe? I hope you are right. I would like to know what intelligence you received before you came to that conclusion. On our part, we are concerned. Ill-informed contributions from you, Senator McGauran, are not a replacement for good, sound policy. The government had a position. It has changed its position and there has been no adequate explanation of it.
We know that defence chiefs believed that 450 is far below what is needed and offered four more alternatives, all including much larger force levels and combat power. Cabinet ignored these four and chose the minimum option. Even the 44 ASLAVs, the light armoured vehicles that will support the troops, will not be fitted with full internal armoured linings. The spall linings provide the most effective protection. Initially we were told that up to 20 of the vehicles would only be fitted with internal curtains—a second-best solution to the lack of long-term planning in vehicle preparation. Today’s statement by the minister and the Prime Minister seeks to hide behind operational security reasons in not providing detail on the ASLAV enhancements. The minister gave quite a different answer again in Senate question time today. It is not at all clear to me or the Australian public whether the ASLAVs have been fitted with adequate protection or whether in fact some will be substandard and will increase the risk to Australian troops.
We should not be surprised about this. What we do know is that the Defence 2003-04 annual report reported that the 1st Brigade, where the bulk of the troops and equipment are to be drawn from, is suffering from significant inadequacies with regard to personnel shortages, insufficient equipment, ammunition shortages and training deficiencies. This is a report from the government’s own department. We in the opposition want nothing more than the safe return of our troops to Australia, and we hold the Howard government accountable for the effectiveness with which they pursue the safety of our troops. That is one of the reasons that we question the longer term motives of the Prime Minister, who has refused to declare his exit strategy.
Where is government policy going in Iraq? We hear that there has been a change in policy in making this deployment. If the Sunni and Shia populations of Iraq come to an accommodation then we may be fortunate. But if they do not, what then? Effectively, the Australians are protecting the Japanese and the British are protecting the Australians. If the Ukrainians or the Poles, for instance, withdraw their troops, will Australia be asked to contribute to their replacement? Will we be required to commit even more troops? If the British are forced to replace the Ukrainians and the Poles and cannot provide as much protection for the Australian forces, will the government reinforce the new Australian contingent with the protection they need? These are the unanswered questions that permeate this ministerial statement. This government is silent on the future, and the lack of a clear, unambiguous exit strategy has warped the Howard government’s policies and made planning on the run the norm. When will this government give a definitive assurance as to when our forces will come home? Why won’t it?
The opposition do not support this deployment. It is a wrong decision, taken without reference to Australia’s primary strategic needs. There is a direct reversal of everything that the Prime Minister has said about our involvement in Iraq for the last two years. Our priorities do not lie in Iraq; our priorities lie here in our region. But with this deployment we risk becoming even more deeply involved in an area outside our strategic priorities. Our efforts should be concentrated here. This deployment policy is wrong, and the Labor Party stand against it. We hope, though, that our troops return safe and that they find the situation in Iraq does not put them at any unnecessary risk. But, as I say, this change in policy by the government needs much more explanation. We need much more reassurance about what we are getting into in terms of this commitment.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,13,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2005-03-07,"—The Democrats want to put on the record our strong opposition to the government sending 450 personnel to Iraq, bringing the number there to 1,370. These troops are to provide what is called a secure environment for the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction Support Group. They are to replace 1,400 Dutch troops, as I understand it. It is not altogether clear why the Dutch have pulled out their troops but it is more than likely that, like Australia, the vast majority of their population did not support the involvement in the attack on Iraq in the first place.
The Democrats, as everyone would know, were strongly opposed to Australia’s involvement in the attack on Iraq. Whilst we hope Iraq becomes a stable, more prosperous and democratic country, the odds that this will be the case are shaky, to say the least. The attack was illegal. It was justified on the basis that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that were a direct threat to Australia, which was neither true at the time of the decision nor at the end of the exhaustive search for them. Regime change was said by our Prime Minister to be a second-order reason for attacking Iraq. The Prime Minister also said at the National Press Club just before the war that Saddam Hussein could stay on in power, provided he got rid of his weapons of mass destruction.
Whilst opposing the war, the Democrats were prepared to say that, having joined in the destruction of much of Iraq’s infrastructure, we should pull our weight in repairing the damage. But we waited in vain for the government to tell us just what our role was in rebuilding the country and re-establishing security, and just how long this would take. What exactly is the job we have undertaken and when will we know it is finished? So it is against this backdrop of uncertainty and the seriously contradictory justifications for sending in troops in the first place that we should now consider this latest decision by the government. If, as the government has said, our troops are needed to support the recent election in Iraq, how does this sit with assurances by the coalition of the willing prior to the attack that our soldiers would be welcomed with open arms? How does this sit with the fact that most candidates and the United Iraqi Alliance, which secured the largest single block of votes in the 30 January election, won their votes on the basis, presumably, of their campaign of ending the US led occupation? I understand that the alliance has since called for a timetable for the withdrawal of the United States, UK and Australian troops in Iraq. I would ask the minister whether it is the case that the coalition of the willing has rejected that proposal and even refused to meet with the alliance about developing such a plan.
We would like to know from the minister whether or not the incoming government was consulted about the decision, or didn’t the US government even bother briefing us on the matter? Is it yet another case of blindly following the United States and of risking the lives of our troops in what is effectively still a war zone?
Days before the election, there was an attack on an Australian light armoured vehicle and the Australian embassy was fired upon. Australian troops are not safe in Iraq. There are, on average, 60 attacks by insurgents every day, up from 25 in 2004. Iraqi intelligence estimates are that there are 40,000 hard-core insurgents and 200,000 part-time fighters in Iraq. Yet, the government claims in this statement that the election was successful beyond expectations. I would hate to think how many of our troops would be needed had it been a failure.
The attack on Iraq was also said to be an attack on terrorists but, last month, the head of the CIA told a US Senate committee:
Islamic extremists are exploiting the Iraqi conflict to recruit new anti-US jihadists ... who will leave Iraq experienced in and focused on acts of urban terrorism. They represent a potential pool of contacts to build transnational terrorist cells, groups, and networks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries.
He went on to say:
The Iraq conflict, while not a cause of extremism, has become a cause for extremists.
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian terrorist who has joined al-Qaeda since the invasion, hopes to establish a safe haven in Iraq, according to the CIA, from which he could operate against Western nations and moderate Muslim governments. The committee was told:
Our—
meaning the United States—
policies in the Middle East fuel Islamic resentment.
And it may only be a matter of time before al-Qaeda or another group attempts to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. Intensive military raids over Iraq have killed several thousand suspected insurgents and put 8,000 in detention but have made almost no impact on the 30 or so most wanted insurgents, according to US military officers. Syria is said to be a base for financing and supplying the insurgents, which no doubt accounts for the latest moves by the US against Syria in Lebanon.
As I said, the Democrats supported Australian troops staying in Iraq until the election but, six weeks on, we think it is time that they were returned, unless the Prime Minister can persuade Australians that there is a plan—an exit strategy—that they are welcomed by the transitional government and that they are not in danger. We are told that this will be an initial deployment of 12 months but that the precise length of that deployment will be determined by circumstances as they emerge. What circumstances? We accept that the deployment of our troops in southern Iraq is less dangerous than in the northern Sunni-dominated triangle but the fact that they are needed there at all in a part of Iraq where there is supposed to be support for democracy I think speaks volumes for the high-risk strategy of bringing about democracy by violent means.
The government says it was a difficult decision, citing the importance of working with Japan on global security issues. It sounds to me as if, like the original tack, this has much more to do with alliances than a decision that is in Australia’s overall interests. It is a double standard for the government on the one hand to ignore its commitments and obligations to one set of neighbours, such as East Timor, while on the other hand to put ahead of those its neighbourly obligations to Japan. Certainly, we acknowledge that we have long-term obligations to help rebuild Iraq, but sending additional soldiers in is not the way to do it, in our view. Rebuilding does not equate to increasing our military involvement.
The Democrats insist that the government should be planning to bring troops home, not increasing our commitment. As I said, there seems to be no withdrawal plan, just escalating costs. The cost of our invasion of Iraq is enormously expensive. At a time when the Australian government is planning to claw back millions of dollars from disabled Australians, it is now seeking to justify the blown-out cost of the war at more than $1.2 billion by conservative estimates. This latest commitment could see the costs reaching $2 billion in a year or so. We have maintained several hundred personnel in the region, with another 450 Australian men and women to be deployed in weeks, at a further cost of $300 million a year. The cost to Iraq has been incalculable in dollar terms, with estimates of in excess of 100,000 civilian dead as a result of the war.
Tomorrow is International Women’s Day. A recent Amnesty report entitled Iraq: decades of suffering, now women deserve better suggests that women are no better off now in terms of safety than under Saddam Hussein, with increased murders and sexual abuse, including by US forces. According to the report, the lawlessness and increased killings, abductions and rapes have restricted women’s freedom of movement. This includes women being subjected to sexual threats. There are also reports that some detained women have been sexually abused and possibly raped.
The Democrats support Amnesty International’s call on the Iraqi authorities and newly elected members of the national assembly to enshrine the rights of women in the new constitution. Australia has a long-term obligation to provide aid and assistance in the rebuilding of Iraq, but repair and rebuilding must be done with aid, not tanks and guns pointed at Iraqi citizens. We believe the bulk of Australian troops should now be withdrawn, with the exception of essential personnel for protecting Australian diplomatic staff. This would largely involve withdrawing the Australian ship from the gulf and bringing home Australian personnel training the Iraqi army. It certainly does not involve sending additional troops to southern Iraq.
The minister today called the invasion of Iraq ‘a first genuine experiment in Arab democracy’. If this is an experiment then, in terms of the loss of lives and devastation, it is a failed experiment and one which should not be compounded. The Democrats have put forward legislation to take the power to go to war out of the hands of the cabinet and place it with both houses of parliament. The war in Iraq is clear evidence that parliamentary consent should be needed before Australian troops are sent to overseas conflicts. Will the next experiment be a war on Iran? Just how many experiments on other sovereign nations should we be joint participants in? This is a case of an experiment gone wrong. Recent comments on Iran by the United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, should concern all Australians who do not want this nation to again take part in a pre-emptive strike and get involved in yet another drawn-out, destructive conflict.
War should not be the prerogative of the Prime Minister. Our Prime Minister should not have the power to send our troops to war without the support of the UN, the Australian parliament or the Australian people—and without the Governor-General needing to authorise that decision. If war is an experiment then the Prime Minister is the mad scientist. The Howard government was the first in our history to go to war without the support of the parliament and today seeks to justify further military aggression by committing more young Australians.
The Senate voted against going to war in Iraq even as the bombs began to fall on Baghdad but had no power to prevent it. Democrat legislation would ensure that that did not happen again. Our position is clear: the executive should not be able to involve Australian troops in overseas conflict if they have not been able to successfully make their case, at least to the parliament. That is the position the Democrats have held and proposed for some 25 years.
The ongoing violence in Iraq proves, I think, that regime change through invasion has too high a cost. The minister cannot say today that the government is acting in the national interest in committing more Australian troops to Iraq. Australian people have the right, through their elected representatives, to participate in issues of national interest, but the government continues to deny Australians that right, even as it blithely acknowledges that its actions are unpopular.
Iraq is in crisis; there is no question about that. A survey of health conditions in Iraq has found huge increases in deaths and mental and physical illness from all causes as a result of the conflict. In a recent report of a survey of health in Iraq, the Medical Association for Prevention of War estimated that 100,000 civilians have died as a result of the invasion and the continuing conflict. The risk of violent death in the 18 months after the invasion was 58 times higher than in the 15 months before it, while the risk of death from all causes was 2.5 times higher.
A report in recent months by Iraq’s health ministry and the UN Development Program found that the rate of malnutrition amongst children under five has almost doubled in the last two years, with 7.7 per cent acutely malnourished. As one of the nations who initiated this war Australia has a legal and ethical obligation to ensure that the health system and situation faced by the local people is improved. The Democrats call on the government to acknowledge the crisis and immediately inject additional funding into overseas aid. Our obligation is to health restoration programs in Iraq, as well as to health and education, not to more troops.
The government’s commitment of Australian troops to the southern province has significant repercussions for the safety of those troops and that of Iraqi civilians, because of its disregard for the use of depleted uranium ammunition in this area. Despite the minister’s assertion today that this province has seen a low level of violence, this does not equate to a safe level of DU in the area. Reports suggest that depleted uranium munition was routinely employed in encounters with armoured enemy vehicles, including in urban environments, and airborne ordnance has been fired less discriminately.
It is a fact that DU ammunition has been widely used during Operation Iraqi Freedom and it has been used in southern Iraq. This region is no exception: the usage of DU ammunition in and around the capital of the province, As Samawah, has been confirmed by US troops and embedded journalists. A report last year by Dr Asaf Durakovic, one of the world’s leading experts on depleted uranium, has confirmed that nine US military police officers tested positive for depleted uranium contamination after their return from service in Samawah in Iraq. Samawah, which has been used as a dump for material destroyed by DU-tipped shells, is radioactive. Since the US government has so far not disclosed exact numbers, it remains as yet unknown just how much DU has been used in the war, and surveys will not reveal this.
The British government has been a bit more forthcoming, admitting that British Challenger tanks expended 1.9 tons of DU. Reports predict that 100 to 200 tons of DU may have been released during combat, with much centred in and around urban areas. This increases the potential for civilian exposure to DU, as well as exposure for Australians now destined for the area. Indeed, all over Iraq, the remains of spent DU shells and DU contaminated debris have been found littering the streets in urban areas. Some wrecked vehicles have been towed away, and the most obvious contaminated sites are marked; however, most locations have not even been identified, let alone cleaned, even though there is wide consensus that DU contamination is a potential health hazard.
There is no clear answer on the amount of depleted uranium in the area to which our troops are being sent. Until this is known and addressed, we say Australian service men and women should not be subjected to the risk of contamination. My colleague Senator Bartlett asked the minister today what precautions would be taken to prevent the exposure of this additional contingent to DU. The response—that surveys will be conducted—is, we think, manifestly inadequate. The Democrats do not find it acceptable for the Australian government to subject Australian service men and women to these risks.
The minister’s statement today does not justify Australia’s increased commitment to Iraq, it does not provide aid to the Iraqi civilians who have suffered terribly as a consequence of modern warfare and it does nothing to alleviate the fear of pre-emptive strikes against other nations. We do not wish ill on our troops—in fact, we hope that they return to this country safely—but we do not think the government is being responsible in sending them there in the first place.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,13,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2005-03-07,"—I rise to support the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, and the Prime Minister in their statement today relating to Australia’s deployment of an extra 450 troops to Iraq. As it was outlined, the troops will be going to southern Iraq—relatively speaking, a safer zone than around Baghdad, of course, or in the Sunni triangle. Their task is twofold. Firstly, they will provide a secure environment for the Japanese Iraqi Reconstruction Support Group, which is currently undertaking the building of roads and schools, and the provision of clean water supplies and health services. That is critical to Australia’s decision to deploy these extra troops: to give protection and support to not only the Japanese, who are close and long-time allies of Australia—60 years to be exact—but also the work they are carrying out.
Secondly, the task force will be involved in further training of the Iraqi security forces. Again, a key point as to why we made this most difficult decision is that those 450 troops will in some part be training Iraqi security forces. As the Chief of the Defence Force said, we aim for this deployment to terminate within 12 months because the Iraqi security forces will be trained up to take over, and therein lies the mission. This is, as Senator Hill rightly outlined, a sign that Australia is committed to the people of Iraq, who have just come through a most difficult election period. They have come through it with courage, determination and an absolute thirst for democracy. The fact that they had to get their hands dipped in purple, as we all saw on television screens, the fact that they had to carry that purple finger around for days after the election under the threat of death from the insurgents—terrorists, Islamic militants—and yet eight million people went to the polls, means we owe a commitment to those eight million people who have a thirst for democracy. Therein lies the government’s reason for making this most difficult decision.
These decisions are of the gravest kind a government can make, but they are studied. They are emotional decisions, but rest assured they are studied decisions—the process undertaken to reach the conclusion that we are sending these troops vouches for this. As was stated by the Prime Minister in the other place and by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the first request came from the UK defence minister to our Minister for Foreign Affairs on 20 January 2005. Then a second request, probably more formal, came from the UK foreign minister, Jack Straw, to our foreign minister, Mr Downer, on 4 February 2005. Naturally, that request was considered by the Australian cabinet’s National Security Committee, made up of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, who made the statement here today. It was carefully considered, with all the advice and relevant intelligence from the Defence Force. Even with those deliberations, it was still necessary, I believe, for the Prime Minister of Japan to telephone our Prime Minister on 18 February and request Australia’s contribution, adding greater gravity to the need in Iraq. And then the British Prime Minister, a very close ally to Australia, rang our Prime Minister, adding to the gravity and seriousness of the need for Australia to finish the job, to see it through and to send extra troops to protect the good work that the Japanese workers are undertaking. That was the process.
This was no rushed decision. The Leader of the Opposition would have us believe that this was a rush of blood to the head of the Prime Minister. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition has been contradictory in his attack. He is simply using this quite serious decision to his political advantage. He is all over the shop. He began by saying that this was always in the mind of the government before the election: we were just waiting for the election to come and go, and then we would make this decision. That is absolutely untrue. Nor was it a rush of blood to the head or a quick decision, as the process highlights. It is a decision we had to make. It is one we had to seriously consider, and we have done so. We have done it for the reasons outlined and, in particular, to reassure the Iraqi people that they do have a better future ahead of them, that the gameness and gutsiness of some eight million of them to come out and vote under the serious threat of death—not idle, as we all know—will be backed up by Australia and by the coalition that is now in Iraq.
It seems that every speaker so far in this debate today—and I have no hope to think that Senator Brown, who will speak after me, will change the idea or policy they all have—is against this deployment. And they have all thus far begrudgingly accepted the fact that the election was a success—in fact, I am not even sure Senator Allison believes that, but it was a great success. But if it is not good enough for them to make their own judgments and they rely so much on the United Nations, then they ought to look to the United Nations for their next step and their next policy. Quite frankly, the United Nations support the training of Iraqi security forces and troops. And why wouldn’t you support the training of Iraqi security forces so that one day they can run their own country? This is a mandate that the United Nations support.
Moreover, from June last year, resolution 1546 gave the coalition operations in Iraq unquestioned international legitimacy and obliged member states to do all in their power to aid the country’s post-Saddam reconstruction. And what do we hear from the other side? Those parties are out of step with the international community; they are out of step with the United Nations. We have reached a stage where they have to decide, ‘Do they support the reconstruction of Iraq or not?’ instead of bogging down the debate in the same old, tired mantra that they chant. They are still arguing the point of whether we should have been in there or not. That is a failed argument, and it is a very dangerous one at this point of time. Not even the United Nations—not Russia, not China—would support that point of view now. In fact, the international community are now arguing: ‘Finish the job, and we will give you that support.’ But we are not hearing that from the Labor Party, we have not heard it from the Democrats and of course we will not hear it from Senator Brown.
The coalition of the willing will stay and support the Iraqi people, and we will do that by protecting the Japanese workers in southern Iraq. We got the powerful message of the 8.5 million Iraqis who went to vote. We were told by all the doomsayers, particularly from the other side, that the turnout would be a disaster. The turnout rounded up to around 60 per cent—a marvellous turnout, a gutsy turnout. They are crying out for democracy. For us to pick up now and leave would cause chaos. For us not to give added support when asked would not be helping them to the extent that we should. Already we see the winds of change in the Middle East, as the other speakers from this side of the parliament have rightly outlined. They have rightly outlined the change we have seen on our televisions. Just of late, in Lebanon, the people have taken to the streets. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,13,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2005-03-07,"—Until the end of February Senator McGauran opposed the deployment of hundreds more Australian troops to Iraq. He did that because the Prime Minister of this country, John Howard, had made a commitment to the electorates of this country in November last year that there would not be a large deployment of hundreds more troops to Iraq. The Prime Minister did that to gain electoral favour with the Australian people because he correctly read the mood of this country against a further large deployment of Australian troops, good and true, to Iraq for political purposes.
So what happened at the end of February? After quite a deal of lobbying from the British government and the US government, the Australian government changed its mind—to wit, the Prime Minister changed his mind. It is now on the record, although the Prime Minister’s statement today does not repeat it, that the Dutch had flagged their intention to remove their 1,400 troops from al-Samawah in the middle of last year. The Prime Minister knew this at election time. What is more, there was quite a lot of discussion amongst the coalition forces as to how they would be replaced to protect the 600 Japanese personnel, noncombatants, who were in the province of Al Muthanna, the capital of which is al-Samawah.
The Prime Minister knew all that in November but was not putting his hand up in the run to the election—at least he was not going to tell the Australian people about that. But his politics then came into play. He received a call from the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Junichiro Koizumi, on 18 February asking him to deploy these 450 troops. Let us put this into perspective. Two days prior to that call, the Kyoto protocol was ratified globally with enormous celebration and coverage in Japan. There was major convention coverage in Kyoto city itself—I was there. There was a mood of condemnation of the Bush administration and the Howard government. The two recalcitrants from around the world will not do their duty to coming generations and join the international effort, represented in the Kyoto protocol, to turn around the coming scourge and the present scourge—it is manifest already—of global warming.
Prime Minister Howard’s government was in great disfavour in Japan. But in Japan there is massive publicity about the oncoming world expo. Australia has a $40 million pavilion. What is more, Prime Minister Howard is very intent on a free trade agreement with a reluctant Koizumi administration in Tokyo. Prime Minister Koizumi told Mr Howard he would be delighted if the 450 troops were provided. Let me shorthand what has happened: Prime Minister Howard decided that he would put at risk 450 Australian Defence Force personnel and send them to Iraq at the request of the Japanese government in return for getting red carpet treatment when he visits Tokyo in April. This is the Prime Minister, in his hubris, with a political intent of moving to a free trade agreement, deploying these Australian troops not for all the purposes that we have heard here but to score himself points in Tokyo in April in pursuit of this free trade agreement.
So the Australian troops are having their lives, their safety, their good office, put at risk for a political purpose which the Prime Minister has not had the gumption and courage to state clearly to the Australian people. That is what is happening here, and it is deplorable. Let me state something very clearly: this parliament, as with the original deployment, has not been consulted. The responsibility for this decision is Prime Minister Howard’s. The safety and wellbeing of these 450 excellent Australians is his responsibility alone. If there are deaths, if there is injury, if there is a terrible consequence from this deployment, that is on the head of this Prime Minister. It is his decision. It is made for the wrong reasons—he takes responsibility.
Senator Allison referred to the potential for contamination with depleted uranium in Al Muthanna province. Before we move to that, I want to dispel one myth which has again been put forward by Senator Hill in here today. It is very notable that he changed one part of the Prime Minister’s speech in the House of Representatives. On page 7 of the speech we see the Prime Minister saying:
Al Muthanna province has a small population and, relatively speaking, has seen a low level of violence.
Senator Hill read that as:
Al Muthanna province has a small population and, relatively speaking, has been free of violence.
That is simply not true. Insurgents have exploded devices in Al Muthanna province. Indeed, a key reason for the Dutch withdrawal is the death of two of their personnel in this province—one as a result of an exploding grenade; the other as a result of a vehicle being blown up. So, when the Minister for Defence comes into the Senate and says, ‘This place has been free of violence,’ it is simply not true. It is a risky place, and it is not the isolated place the government would have it. In fact, it is on the main road between al-Basra and Baghdad. The capital is the site of a crossing of the Euphrates river, where there was a pitched battle between the original invasion of Iraq and the death of 112 civilians in that city, in a battle that took a week to finally repress in the early days of this invasion. It is not the safe zone that the Prime Minister and, in particular, the Minister for Defence would have us believe.
On the matter of depleted uranium, it is estimated—and I am more conservative than Senator Allison here—that some 59 tonnes of depleted uranium have been exploded or utilised in weaponry that has been fired by the British and US defence forces since arrival in this country. There have been casualties as a result of that amongst the American forces. We know that the danger from depleted uranium is highest when the weapons are fired and the radioactive gases are given off. There has been great concern in this province with both the Japanese and the Dutch forces. The Dutch forces were originally put in a former US military camp and moved very rapidly due to radiation contamination. The Japanese forces have noted the radiation and each member of the Japanese forces wears a radiation dosimeter to register the level of radiation in the province.
I ask the minister, here and now: will Australian Defence Force personnel each be supplied with a radiation dosimeter to make sure they are not exposed to unnatural radiation as part of their deployment to this province? It is known that there are contaminated sites. They are not properly fenced off. Kids are playing in the region and there are extraordinarily high health risks involved. I ask the minister, who is in the Senate now, to report back to the Senate, as matter of urgency, on the situation regarding depleted radiation contamination in the area to which our Australian troops are going and the precautions which are being taken to make absolutely sure that there will not be health consequences for Australian Defence Force personnel going to Iraq so that the Prime Minister will have a better reception in Tokyo come April.
The Australian Greens have enormous admiration for the Australian Defence Force personnel who are involved. We believe their good office and their intention to defend our country as needed is being abused by the Prime Minister for a political purpose which does not warrant their deployment in Iraq. But, that said, we are with them all the way. Godspeed. May they come back to this country safe and sound. The Prime Minister bears an enormous responsibility for the safety and wellbeing of each one of these sterling Australian citizens.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,13,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2005-03-07,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, they say good things come to those who wait long enough. I rise to provide some contribution—
—We nearly closed the debate before question time.
—I understand that, Senator Hill, but having such a significant and fantastic representation of the Defence Force in the Northern Territory, how could I let this opportunity to say something about it go by? The Defence Amendment Bill 2005 deals with the regime for the testing of drugs and other prohibited substances in the Australian Defence Force. It also applies to those people who serve in the reserves and to defence civilians. This bill is designed to clarify and strengthen the drug-testing procedures within the defence forces. The objective is a drug-free Defence Force. Let me clearly say at the outset that that is also a position that the Labor Party takes: we want a Defence Force that is drug free, but we want a Defence Force that has fairness in its procedures for dealing with people who may be suspected of using drugs.
This bill is intended to provide benefits for the health and safety of the individual and other service personnel, improved performance and greater operational effectiveness. In particular, I want to summarise what this legislation is meant to do. It is meant to expand the range of drugs tested beyond those narcotic substances currently provided to include other prohibited substances. It will authorise the Chief of the Defence Force by legislative instrument to determine that a substance is a prohibited substance. It will broaden testing beyond ADF members undertaking combat-related duties to all defence members and defence civilians. Defence civilians constitute a small group accompanying a part of the ADF on deployment who have consented to subjecting themselves to Defence Force discipline, in particular the reservists. It will allow the Chief of the Defence Force, or an officer delegated by him—or her as the case may be, one day in the future—to make provisions for testing by means other than urinalysis as new tests and new drugs are developed. The bill will clarify the power to terminate employment after the return of a confirmed positive test result and clarify the power to take other administrative action. It will enable details of the drug-testing regime to be set out in Defence instructions.
Let me say, though, that this bill is nearly 2½ years too late. We welcome this bill and we are certainly going to support it, but you have to ask yourself why it has taken this government so long to take action on this particular aspect relating to our Defence Force. We know that on 17 September 2002 the assistant defence minister at the time, Danna Vale, promised to introduce regulations for random drug testing of defence personnel. That was more than two years ago. The regulations had not appeared during that time. Of course, it was only the trigger that occurred last year that forced this government to take any action in respect of this matter.
In fact, a question that I asked the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, in this chamber on 7 December last year might just have twigged and prompted this government to do something about it. That question related to whether or not it was true that a Defence Force magistrate, hearing an appeal from an ADF member regarding the issue of drug testing, had no option other than to rule in favour of the officer because the government had not made the regulations to legally authorise officers to collect urine samples for drug-testing purposes. To this day, as I said back then, this government has done nothing about that. As I said, the magistrate at that time was forced to rule in favour of the officer. A drug charge against the officer was dismissed because the magistrate had no option. There was no legal avenue for the magistrate to rule otherwise. That is because this area had been neglected by this government. Senator Hill’s response to me was as follows:
Apart from that, yes, a magistrate did dismiss a case. The magistrate found that the method adopted to require the taking of these tests was, and I am paraphrasing, ‘inconsistent with part VIIIA’, I think, ‘of the Defence Act’.
Then the blame, once again, was placed on the defence department. This is not a government that would say: ‘We’re at fault. I am at fault as a minister for not picking this up, for not getting my parliamentary secretary to say to me, “Wait a second, there was a problem about this a couple of years ago.” What’ve we done? We’ve done nothing. Now we have to have a ruling from a magistrate that makes us look silly because it brings to light the fact that we haven’t done anything about this for two years.’ We then have this flurry of activity and finally legislation. At the time, the minister’s answer was:
It is true that Defence decided to bring in this system through command rather than through legislative prescription.
Someone must have authorised Defence to do that. Obviously, bringing this system into place through command, rather than through a legislative process, was not strong enough and did not give the Defence Force magistrate the powers he needed at the time to uphold the ruling against the officer. We have a system of always shifting blame from this government—not a responsibility whereby the minister fairly says, ‘Well, that was totally my responsibility and I should have done something about it beforehand, but I didn’t.’ They have to shift the blame to the Defence Force. Again, back then advice was sought on what this government ought to do and finally, of course, we see this legislation come into play.
Senator Hill, at the time, also said to me in his response:
... it is not related to the issue of regulations under the Defence Act, because there are significant shortcomings within that provision that would have limited the capacity to test for the drugs in question. The military has chosen to proceed through command.
The military must have surely done it with the knowledge of this government and this minister. If it was inadequate at the time, someone should have said to the military, ‘No, that is not the strongest course of action you can take. The better course of action and the stronger course of action would be to ensure that this process is held in a legislative instrument.’
In introducing this speech into parliament, the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, who represents the Minister for Defence in the House of Representatives, went on to say:
These limitations under the legislative drug-testing program were a major reason why a command initiated program of drug testing was implemented. This program was used for drug testing until September last year, when a Defence Force magistrate’s finding was made that there is no scope for such testing outside part VIIIA of the Defence Act. The command initiated program has therefore been temporarily suspended whilst changes to part VIIIA have been pursued to ensure that the legislation better reflects Defence Force policy regarding drug use.
Once again this highlights that we had to have a trip-wire in the system—a magistrate’s finding—before this government finally realised that what it had in place was not strong enough and was not comprehensive enough to deal with the issues. The issues came about following the drug raids in October 2003 at the Robertson Barracks in Darwin, where we now know 47 personnel returned positive drug tests. But if the regulations to allow the random drug testing in the ADF had been introduced when they were due to be—which was September 2002, some 13 months before—then this person would not have had their conviction overturned. In fact, there would have been a legal regime in place to ensure that those 47 cases were dealt with and that there was a strong outcome in relation to how these officers were dealt with. It is interesting that we finally do have this legislation before us, although it is somewhat too late. This bill is designed to clarify and strengthen the drug-testing procedures within the Defence Force. As I said, the position of our party is that we want a drug-free Defence Force. The bill expands the range of drugs that may be tested and enables, as I said, the Chief of the Defence Force to determine that a substance is a prohibited substance.
I turn briefly to the issue of the effect on defence members and defence civilians, because this bill will also broaden the testing regime beyond ADF members undertaking combat or combat related duties. As I said, it will include defence civilians—that is, mainly reservists. Defence civilians constitute a small group among the ADF—that is for sure—accompanying a part of the ADF on deployment and must be those who have consented to subject themselves to Defence Force discipline. From my experience in dealing with defence civilians, there is very little recourse for these people in terms of fair and proper procedures when it comes to being dealt with by the Defence Force. If they are at all under discipline or they are at all under duress in their position as a reservist within the Defence Force, there are very few impartial procedures and processes that these people can use. So, while we welcome this bill and we welcome the expansion to include all of those people who will be undertaking active duty within the ADF, we must now be satisfied that this new legal regime will fit not only the regular members of the Defence Force but defence civilians as well. We need to be satisfied and we need to satisfy ourselves that if this legislation is applied to defence civilians they will get a fair, proper and impartial hearing.
Following the recent decision by this government to deploy a significant number of our defence personnel—up to 450—these personnel will come from 1st Brigade in Darwin at Robertson Barracks. They are a splendid group of young men and women who are extremely professional and dedicated. The drug testing and the drug raid that was carried out found that a very small number of ADF personnel were caught up in this. It is a shame that sometimes such stories about the ADF and the actions of a small group overwhelm the tremendous professional actions that are taken by a large number of ADF personnel, particularly in a place like Darwin. But this was a situation that only set off a trip-wire last year when the magistrate’s ruling was handed down. It is good to see that this government has finally done something about ensuring there is a legislative base in place so that those people who are in the ADF and who are caught taking drugs do not have an easy out—that they cannot use the loophole that was used last year in getting their matters overturned. This legislation is welcomed. It is 2½ years too late but I suppose it is better late than never. It is good to finally see the minister taking some responsibility for this rather than shifting the blame once again to his senior officers in the Defence Force.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE AMENDMENT BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,27,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2005-03-07,"—I will sum up briefly. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate on the Defence Amendment Bill 2005. It has been a very helpful debate. Useful points have been made concerning privacy, the role of the Ombudsman, independent sample testing and Defence instructions. The bottom line is that I am pleased that all honourable senators support the bill. We have some amendments that we will have to deal with during the committee stage. We believe these are important reforms. The ADF does operate on a zero tolerance of drugs basis and it is important to have the tools to enable commanders to effectively implement the policies that have been set in place. I thank senators for their support and look forward to the second reading passage.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2005-03-07,"—I rise to speak on the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Amendment (Application) Bill 2005. I think it could be described as a bit of essential housekeeping. However, it is an essential area that does require addressing in our nation’s security interests. It is topical that we speak of national security in parliament this evening because I would like to make a few remarks concerning the important national security issue of money laundering as well. The annual US Department of State’s International narcotics control strategy report was released just last week. It contains an analysis of money laundering in various countries around the globe. The Senate will know that money laundering is conducted by both drug dealers and terrorists. This fact highlights the point that when we are talking about terrorist organisations we are dealing with criminals.
I want to bring to the attention of the house some of the findings of that report because it is possible, for example, that a terrorist organisation involved in money laundering could well be subject to the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Act and indeed to some of the measures in the bill that we have before us. The US Department of State have found that Australia is ‘a major money-laundering country’. The state department had this to say about major money-laundering countries, and I quote directly from their report.
“A major money laundering country is defined by statute as one whose financial institutions engage in currency transactions involving significant amounts of proceeds from international narcotics trafficking” ... However, the complex nature of money laundering transactions today makes it difficult in many cases to distinguish the proceeds of narcotics trafficking from the proceeds of other serious crime ... This year’s list of major money laundering countries recognizes this relationship by including all countries and other jurisdictions, whose financial institutions engage in transactions involving significant amounts of proceeds from all serious crime.
The report then goes on to list Australia amongst 52 other jurisdictions, so unfortunately we are not alone. It is a failure of the Howard government in this area. The minister is clearly not doing enough to combat threats to national security, whether they be terrorist or drug related, through the monitoring and seizure of laundered money. Part of this relates to extended review of AUSTRAC, which has been ongoing since late 2003. In my view, it is time for the minister to act and complete this task so that AUSTRAC can know what their operational focus and strategic direction will be so that they can get on with the job of detecting money laundering in our banks.
The bill before us today seeks to clarify that the act will apply to existing proceedings that were already under way as at 11 January 2005, the day on which the main provisions of that act commenced. Secondly, it clarifies the procedure of notification so it is clear that the prosecutor has to give the requisite notice of intention to adduce security sensitive information to the court and defendants on only one occasion. This bill aims to eliminate ambiguities in the existing act on the basis of crown law advice received by the government. The purpose of the existing act was to ensure that the courts and prosecutors could use information that was security sensitive to conduct criminal trials in a way that would balance the defendant’s right to a fair trial with the need to publicly divulge national security information where to do so would be a threat to national security.
The original bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, where I and other senators investigated the bill and made a number of recommendations. It was unfortunate that the Attorney-General failed, as he has on a number of occasions before, to heed all the recommendations made by the committee. That said, several of the committee’s recommendations were taken on board—I should be thankful for that, at least—and are now reflected in the current legislation. However, it was disappointing to see that the Attorney-General consciously chose to ignore most of the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission report entitled Keeping secrets: the protection of classified and security sensitive information in drafting the original legislation. But I will not go into that in the debate on this bill. I think I dealt with that substantively during the second reading debate when the amendments were put forward and the bill debated. It did highlight at the time that the final draft was produced at a time which made it impossible to believe that the Keeping secrets report was taken into consideration at all. It was reflected by the legal and constitutional committee that, by the time we got to look at the bill, a raft of recommendations were made that sought to improve upon the legislation.
I think that, if the Attorney-General and Senator Ellison had turned their minds to this matter a bit more dutifully, if they had been able to examine Keeping secrets in draft, a lot of it could have been done better. They may not have wanted to follow the report—that is a matter for government policy and its direction—but they could have taken it on board and structured a final piece of legislation that was both effective and tight in terms of its legislative drafting. The recommendations that came from the legal and constitutional committee report might not have needed to be so expansive and to cover a range of areas that really should have been dealt with at first blush. That said, Labor supported the thrust of the legislation, and that legislation is now an act. We were able to raise ourselves above the inability of the Attorney-General to get around the real issues that were highlighted in Keeping secrets. We recognised the importance of the issues, we recognised the need for the legislation to be passed and we recognised the improvements that had been made to the bill as a result of the committee process.
As I said at the time, the legislation was not perfect and Labor would have done things differently. Under a Labor government, we would have implemented a new federal protected disclosure regime, which would have included appropriate protections for persons working in the area. However, the need for legislation was clear, for without it we would still be placed in the situation where the Commonwealth prosecutor would effectively be unable to tender security sensitive information in criminal trials where that information would compromise national security. If the law were unchanged, the Commonwealth would simply have to balance the interests of prosecuting the suspected criminal with the interests of national security. It is not a desirable situation when you have to weigh up one worthy goal against another and simply drop the lesser. Instead, it is desirable for the Commonwealth to be free to pursue goals of defending national security while prosecuting suspected criminals. This was the aim of the original legislation.
While we in the Labor Party were not entirely pleased with the legislation, the legislation did pass with our support because we are a party that is concerned with both good government and good governance. We understood that the government needed the legislative tool to get on with the job, and, while we were offering a better tool, we did not stand in the way of the government promoting this legislation or dig in our heels out of spite and do nothing at all. It was far better to accept the position that this legislation was required. That was responsible politics, in my view. We ended up with a compromise, and the legislation was passed. It is now the case that some ambiguities have been picked up, and as a party that takes national security seriously we again recognise the government’s need for our assistance in passing this legislation.
Passage of this bill now clarifies the law in regard to some five existing criminal trials against suspected terrorists. Although it was certainly the intention of the government, it was not entirely clear from the original act whether trials where proceedings had already begun were to be included. These amendments will make that explicit, remove the ambiguity and give all involved in those cases some certainty as to where they stand in relation to the law. Similarly, the tighter description of the process by which requisite notice is given under the act is also a welcome development. On the basis of the above, Labor supports the passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) AMENDMENT (APPLICATION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2005-03-07,"—The National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Amendment (Application) Bill 2005 makes two changes to the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Act, which came into force on 11 January this year. The Senate may recall that we Democrats opposed the passage of that legislation. While we recognised that there was a need to examine and clarify the way in which courts handle sensitive, security-related information, and we acknowledged that the government had made a genuine attempt to formulate appropriate legislation, we nevertheless took the view that the proposed scheme had a number of serious flaws. In particular, we expressed concerns regarding the very broad definition of national security and the fact that the legislation permits a court to hear evidence in the absence of the accused person and his or her lawyer if the lawyer has not submitted to a security clearance.
The bill now before us attempts to apply these new national security information regime proposals to a handful of proceedings which were already before the courts at the time the legislation came into effect on 11 January this year. The act, as it currently stands, unequivocally excludes any proceedings which commenced prior to 11 January. It is therefore curious, I think, that the explanatory memorandum suggests that the purpose of the bill is simply to ‘clarify how the act applies to certain proceedings’. The opposition appears to have taken a similar position, as evidenced by the comments of the shadow minister for homeland security, Mr Robert McClelland, in the other place when he stated that ‘the clarification is consistent with what both sides of the House assumed was the potential operation of that original act’. On the contrary, we argue that the act is perfectly clear in that it does not apply to those proceedings. What this bill does is change—not clarify—the application of the act to certain proceedings.
The government has indicated that there are a number of terrorism-related prosecutions currently before the courts to which the regime could potentially apply. The passage of this bill will enable the national security information regime to apply to those proceedings. The government argues that the bill will not have any retrospective operation. This is true in a literal sense, since the national security information regime will be applied to existing proceedings only from the time that this amending legislation comes into effect. However, we Democrats believe there is a compelling argument which suggests that the bill will in fact have some retrospective impact. For example, a defendant in existing proceedings may have retained a lawyer who is unwilling to submit to a security clearance for the purposes of this regime. The defendant will therefore need to either start from scratch with a new lawyer or risk having his or her existing lawyer excluded from parts of the proceedings. Moreover, the fact that the regime will now apply to the defendant’s trial may necessitate a change of the defendant’s case plan or strategy, particularly if he or she had intended to rely on evidence which will now be excluded.
Perhaps the most significant potential impact of this legislation arises in the context of the disclosure obligations it places on defendants and their lawyers. The explanatory memorandum says that ‘there are currently under way a number of terrorism-related proceedings to which the act could possibly apply if the prosecutor gives the requisite notice to the court and defendant’. What the government has failed to point out is that the act will apply to existing proceedings, regardless of whether the prosecutor gives any notice, if the defendant intends to rely on security related information. This is because the principal act requires defendants to notify the Attorney-General if they propose to introduce evidence that is relevant to Australia’s national security. A failure to provide such advance notification attracts a significant penalty of up to two years imprisonment. We Democrats are very concerned that defendants in existing proceedings will acquire new obligations as a result of the passage of this bill and may not be aware of those obligations. There is therefore a risk that a defendant could unknowingly commit an offence of failing to notify the Attorney-General and face up to two years in prison.
While the Democrats are well aware of the maxim that ‘ignorance of the law is no excuse’, we question whether this maxim should apply to legislation which is introduced part way through existing criminal proceedings. If this legislation is passed, we would expect the government to draw it to the attention of all defendants who the government has reason to believe may be affected by its provisions. We will be seeking an undertaking from the minister to this effect.
For the record, I indicate that the Democrats have no objection to the second amendment proposed by this bill, which provides that where a prosecutor gives the requisite notice to the court and the defendant after proceedings have commenced, the act will apply to each subsequent part of those proceedings. In closing, we Democrats maintain our objections to this bill, and they relate solely to its attempt to apply the national security information regime to proceedings that are currently before the courts. We had strong objections to the principal act, and we are therefore naturally reluctant to see it apply to any additional proceedings. Moreover, we believe that this extended application could have an adverse retrospective effect on defendants in existing proceedings. For these reasons, we oppose the passage of the bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) AMENDMENT (APPLICATION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2005-03-07,"—I join in the second reading debate on the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Amendment (Application) Bill 2005, which, as previous speakers have noted, is not a complex piece of legislation but nevertheless an important amendment to a very complex substantive act, the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Act. As I am sure Senator Ludwig observed in his cogent remarks, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee had cause to consider at some length the head act, the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Act, in a report tabled in August of last year. That legislation was later brought forward after the election.
The most important aspect of this bill is its effort to clarify how that act applies to particular federal proceedings of a criminal nature. As has been alluded to, it reinforces the fact that the application of the act is to proceedings that commenced prior to 11 January 2005—which is the day on which the main provisions of the act came into effect. The amendment ensures that the act can in fact be applied to a number of terrorism related proceedings that are currently under way, once a prosecutor has given requisite notice to both the court and the defendant. The act seeks to ensure that there is no capacity to avoid application of it just because a person had been charged and a bail hearing had occurred before the commencement of the act on 11 January.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—I will continue the brief remarks I made earlier before the dinner adjournment, and my remarks in conclusion will also be brief. I would like to make a couple of further points. Before the adjournment we were discussing the application of the act to terrorism proceedings that are currently under way, once the prosecutor gives the notice that is required by the act to the court and to the defendant. The bill clarifies the position, if there was any doubt, that just because a matter had commenced before 11 January 2005, that is, before the act came into effect, the act could not be applied to those proceedings—either the committal or the trial of an individual some time later. What the Attorney-General has assured in the other place and publicly elsewhere is that this amendment does not give the act any retrospective effect. That is to say, it does not affect anything that occurred before the notice that the prosecutor is required to give is actually provided.
The bill also seeks to clarify the manner in which the act applies to any proceeding in which the prosecutor does give that requisite notice to the court and the defendant after the proceeding commenced. As the Attorney stated in his, also relatively brief, second reading speech:
This amendment restates the intent of the act to require a prosecutor to give the requisite notice only once, after which time the act will apply to all subsequent parts of the proceeding.
The Attorney also emphasised that the act as it currently stands could possibly be, in the government’s view, subject to some misinterpretation that may have the potential effect of putting in jeopardy the underlying intent of the act, which is to ensure that the prosecution can be carried out without any risk to national security or to a defendant’s right to a fair trial. I alluded in my earlier remarks to the consideration by the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee of the substantive act in 2004—the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Act 2004. The committee paid some attention to the question of ensuring that the defendant has the right to a fair trial. In that report the committee made something like 13 or 14 recommendations in relation to a number of those measures, some of which were taken up and some of which, in the normal course of these procedures between government and committees, were not taken up. But they did go some way to addressing those concerns.
In that process we also considered the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission of May 2004 entitledKeeping secrets: the protection of classified and security sensitive information. A number of the recommendations that the ALRC brought forward in that report were taken up in the legislation; some were not. The Attorney-General’s Department gave evidence to the committee in relation to those that were not accepted, and the committee made further recommendations in that regard.
But the main provisions of the bill were to ensure that we had adequate and appropriate procedures for dealing with sensitive national security information during federal criminal proceedings. That is of course necessary in the current climate in which we find ourselves, for a range of reasons. It is necessary to ensure that we have an effective management of information, both pre-trial and during trial; a mechanism by which there can be a notification of expected disclosure of security sensitive information; adequate procedures to follow where it is expected that a witness might disclose information that is potentially prejudicial to national security; and some provisions for the use of an Attorney-General’s certificate in certain instances and the consequences of the Attorney-General giving that non-disclosure certificate. Also of some concern to the committee and considered in that inquiry were the requirements for closed hearings and the court orders that may be made in those circumstances; the methods for appeal against those court orders; and an issue which has been debated across a number of pieces of legislation in recent times, the need for a security clearance for the defendant’s legal representative. A number of offences were created under the bill and it concluded with the requirement for the Attorney-General to report to parliament on an annual basis in a report which would state the number of certificates given by the Attorney-General under the relevant clauses of the act each year, and identification of the criminal proceedings to which those certificates relate.
In conclusion, Senator Greig raised some concerns in relation to what he described as a retrospective impact of the bill. I note that the Attorney has gone to great lengths—as I understand it, agreed with by the shadow minister in this case—to indicate that the bill is not regarded as having a retrospective effect as may be viewed elsewhere. The Bills Digest, for example, considers but does not particularly expand upon some of those issues. I noted, and listened with interest to, the matters that Senator Greig raised. But I do not think the bill qualifies, if you like, as a retrospective piece of legislation in the sense which we understand that to be the case. In looking again at the explanatory memorandum this evening and rereading the speeches on the second reading in the other place, I think that we can proceed with the legislation in its current form with this small amendment bill on the basis that it does not have the sort of retrospective application which we might otherwise be opposed to.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order! Senator Payne, you have been working under quite considerable competition, and I think that perhaps we should allow you to proceed in silence.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I was hoping they were distractions, in fact, but it does not appear to have worked that way. As I was concluding, in the climate in which we find ourselves and the need for very strict procedures as to how this legislation should operate, it is important that the legislation operates in a case where there is no room for doubt, and this amendment seeks to achieve that result.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) AMENDMENT (APPLICATION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2005-03-07,"—I thank senators for their contribution to this debate on the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Amendment (Application) Bill 2005, a very important bill indeed. Before I turn to the provisions of the bill, I would like to clarify an issue that was raised by Senator Greig. I would point out that there is no obligation on parties to notify the Attorney-General of an intention to lead national security information unless the prosecutor has notified the defendant and the court that the act applies to particular proceedings. Senator Greig’s concern therefore that defendants in matters currently before the court may be disadvantaged if they do not realise that these amendments have passed or what the implications of these amendments are to their matter, is unfounded. We believe that they are not disadvantaged accordingly.
In relation to Senator Ludwig’s comments, which were directed in part to anti-money-laundering measures, I think it is useful to place on the record the situation in relation to the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which mentioned Australia. It is a report prepared annually by the United States Department of State for the congress, and it describes the efforts of key countries to attack the drugs trade and associated crime—in this case during 2004. The INCSR categorisation system is based on the size of the country’s economy and the sophistication of financial institutions and financial transactions. Obviously, countries which have larger and more complex flows of funds will be more vulnerable to money laundering. The INCSR makes it clear that the categorisation is not based on the anti-money-laundering measures taken by that particular country. Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada are all identified as being of primary concern despite having comprehensive anti-money-laundering laws and conducting aggressive anti-money-laundering enforcement efforts.
In an article this week, it was mentioned that Australia was in the company of some Third World countries in relation to this designation of primary concern. What was not mentioned in the article was that, included with Australia, were the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. They have anti-money-laundering provisions which are among the best in the world. Australia has AUSTRAC, of course, which I believe demonstrates world’s best practice in anti-money-laundering enforcement. In fact, many other countries come here to look at AUSTRAC and the work it does. The INCSR notes:
The current ability of money launderers to penetrate virtually any financial system makes every jurisdiction a potential money laundering center.
I think that is a worthwhile basis from which to look at this report. As a major financial centre, Australia will be vulnerable to money laundering, and we have always acknowledged that fact. In response to this, the Australian government and law-enforcement agencies continue efforts to combat money laundering and financial crime both domestically and in the Asia-Pacific region. In fact, Australia helped cofound the Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering and, of course, has been an active participant in the Egmont Group and the financial action task force.
To ensure that Australia maintains robust and effective systems to combat money laundering, the government has undertaken a reform process in response to the revised recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering. Indeed, I have stated publicly that the government has a draft bill which will be released soon for public consultation. That is in response to recommendations made by FATF—some 40 recommendations in all, eight of them relating to terrorist activity. I think it is very important that with an article like the one that I think was in the Daily Telegraph, which says Australia is a country of prime concern, we look at it in the context of the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report and the fact that Afghanistan was not listed as a country of concern. Why? Because it does not have a sophisticated financial market like Australia. Where you have financial markets such as Australia has, you have records of transactions, you have a large financial sector and of course you become a target for money laundering. I just think it is important to place that on the record as that was raised by Senator Ludwig.
Returning to the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Amendment (Application) Bill 2005: when the National Security Information Act 2004 commenced in January this year, it added a further layer of protection for Australia’s national security. The act facilitates the prosecution of Commonwealth offences without jeopardising national security or a defendant’s right to a fair trial. This bill clarifies two related aspects of the act to ensure that it operates as intended. It confirms that the act can apply to proceedings that began prior to the commencement of the main provisions of the act. The bill does not act retrospectively. It does not affect proceedings or parts of proceedings that have already been completed. It clarifies the fact that a proceeding commenced prior to the commencement of the act does not prevent the application of the act’s provisions to future stages of the proceeding. The bill also ensures that if a prosecutor applies the act after a proceeding has commenced, the prosecutor only has to give the requisite notice once and not separately for each subsequent part of the proceeding.
I welcomed the opposition’s support for these amendments last month during the second reading debate in the House of Representatives. The member for Barton stated that the amendments were justified and consistent with the understanding of both sides of the House. The primary act was passed last December. The member for Barton added that the bill avoids complications, additional expense and delay that could otherwise arise from the need to issue fresh charges. I certainly agree with these views of the member for Barton and I emphasise that the bill minimises the risk of the act being misinterpreted, which in turn might impede the protection of security sensitive information. This is a very important bill and, although technical in nature, I believe it enhances the legislation that we have in place already. I commend this bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION (CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS) AMENDMENT (APPLICATION) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2005-03-07,"—At the outset of the debate on the Aged Care Amendment (Transition Care and Assets Testing) Bill 2005 I have to say that this is a bill that Labor have been waiting for and wanting to debate in this place for a very long period of time. While Labor will be supporting the intent of the bill, I do need to make some comments about matters relating to this piece of legislation.
This legislation will ensure that residents of aged care facilities retain their places at those facilities whilst receiving transitional care after discharge from a hospital. The second part of the legislation transfers asset testing from aged care providers to Centrelink and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs—a component which is also welcomed by Labor. Labor, as this chamber knows, will always support measures that improve the lives of our frail aged Australians and older citizens and we support the intent of the bill even though, as I said earlier, there has been a delay in its introduction. The measures that we are dealing with today are based on some of the recommendations in the Hogan review into pricing arrangements in the residential aged care sector. I want to return to other recommendations from the Hogan review if the opportunity arises later.
The amendments are necessary to ensure that leave arrangements are in place to allow existing residents of residential care to receive transitional care following a hospital stay. Normal care arrangements need to be made available for people if they go into an acute care facility and then subsequently take the opportunity of the alternative transitional care arrangements that have been adopted. We will support that principle. It is sound health policy and it should have been around a little earlier, but that is by the by.
The bill also establishes a form of flexible care that allows for a subsidy to be paid and specifies that transitional care is a form of flexible care. It also extends provisions of the act that deal with the reduction of the residential aged care subsidy when a carer is on extended hospital leave. This now applies to flexible care leave. That is a definitional way that the bill operates. The legislation also recognises the situation faced by concessional residents and extends the current arrangements applying to concessional residents in hospital to their flexible care leave.
I want to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the Senate something that I found a little bit astonishing in the explanatory memorandum. There is a section in the explanatory memorandum that talks about the financial impact. When trying to ascertain what the savings might be, it says:
It is not possible to estimate the savings with any degree of confidence because:
there are no clear views with respect to the number of existing residents who will utilise the transition care program; and
the classification levels of these residents, which will affect the level of subsidy reduction, are not known.
As I said, I express concern about that statement in the explanatory memorandum. In my view these sorts of policy changes should be based on sound data collection and then using that data to model what may or may not happen into the future. I do not think it is appropriate for us to say that it is a bit too hard and that we have no confidence in our data when making the sorts of policy changes that this bill proposes.
This bill is not in the realms of the Medicare safety net, which, as we know, has blown out by an enormous amount of money. I do acknowledge that we are talking about savings. But I think it is instructive to the Senate and also to the community that we are making decisions in a vacuum of information. I do not know that that is an appropriate platform for us to be making policy changes around. It is not good policy, in my view, to be underconfident about the potential financial impact of any bill, even if it is a savings bill. This leads me to believe that there is a lack of research, data collection and appropriate modelling in the aged care sector. I have to say that I am not the only person who suggests this.
Looking at this particular bill it is clear to me that we do not have enough research into the balance of care provision between acute care, residential care and community care. We need to undertake that sort of research so that we can truly understand the numbers of people that might access this sort of transitional care, but we also need to undertake it for a broader intent. If we are going to make the provision of aged care, whether residential or community based, sustainable in this nation, we have to work from sound data so we can make informed choices and predict what may happen. We have had Mr Costello’s Intergenerational report talking, apparently very forcefully, about how we need to project into the future what care needs may be, but if we are working from a basis of a lack of information it is very hard to do that. The government would be well advised to have a look at the data sets that we have available to us and then make some sound judgments on what data is not there so we can start to collect it.
We need to do research on the interface between acute, residential or community based care so we can predict the financial impact of any decision, but we also need to be looking at the models of appropriate care delivery in the transitional stage of care. We need to be developing transitional care practices that are sound, client focused and interested in moving people from the acute sector into their care situation comfortably and safely. Transition is a critical event for the frail aged. Any movement from one place to another is a critical event, and we should be working from a basis of sound research to be able to make decisions about them. Some work has been done on the balance between high, low and community care settings. My view is that more work needs to be done. We had some discussion at estimates about that. It does not fill me with great confidence that we have got that balance right. Little work has been done on the interrelationship between acute, residential and community care settings. The other part of that discussion is the interface with the disability sector.
I commend to the Senate a paper that I was fortunate to come across recently entitled ‘Trends in the use of hospital beds by older people in Australia: 1993—2002’ by Len Gray, Margaret Yeo and Stephen Duckett printed in the Medical Journal of Australia late last year. This is a fairly important piece of work, and I do not know that it has had the resonance in the sector that it could have had. As an aside, I understand this research was done without any government funding—NHMRC, ARC or even state funding. It was completely self-funded by these academics. It is an important but preliminary piece of work about the nexus between the acute, residential and community care sectors. It is a good piece of work. More needs to be done in that area until we know not only what best practice is in care delivery but also the potential costs we may be facing.
As I said, this legislation implements two of the recommendations of Professor Hogan. It does not go to another important recommendation of Professor Hogan in an area where the sector is crying out for some attention, and that is the issue of work force and how we deal with the pressing issues of providing an appropriately skilled, balanced work force into not only the residential aged care sector—that is the area that is given a lot of focus—but also community care. At every single meeting I attend as Labor shadow minister for ageing, the issue of work force shortages is raised with me. The answers are many and varied, but I am concerned that the government is holding back and not participating in the debate that we truly have to have if we are going to ensure a well-staffed, strong, client-focused aged care sector into the future.
The issue of wage disparity, which is often raised with us, is the main reason why we have an undersupply of not only nursing staff but aged care workers across the range of certifications. It is true that the wage disparity between a registered nurse in the acute care sector and a registered nurse working in aged care is enormous and it is growing. That surely is of concern to us all. I was at a meeting in Western Australia last week and we talked about the question of wage disparity, and service providers are also of the view that there is a problem in ensuring some sort of equity between the acute care sector and aged care. One of the participants in the meeting said to me that it is not only wages but the conditions that nurses—let us focus on nurses for the moment—have to deal with that are a disincentive to work in residential aged care. They have to deal with the enormous and seemingly growing amount of red tape—the enormous amount of paperwork that has to be complied with in order to comply with requirements of the accreditation process and acquittals of funds back to the department. It seems to me a fairly old-fashioned way of doing business.
There is a fairly low reliance on computerised systems, which I think is an area we can pay a lot of attention to. Families of people who live in residential care find it extraordinary that some of the most talented people dealing with their loved ones are spending three or four hours a day sitting at a desk filling in sheets of paper instead of working with the residents of that aged care facility. Families of residents find it astonishing and I think the whole community finds it astonishing. These qualified, talented and very valuable members of care teams should be doing what they are trained to do—that is, helping and assisting the residents of an aged care facility.
The other real disincentive to encouraging more nurses and aged care workers into residential and community aged care is that the mythology around aged care has been built up to a point where now there is a common view in the community that it is not a successful, productive or fulfilling job. That is the mythology. As those who work in the sector know, that is wrong. What is true is that those who want to do the work love assisting and helping people who are elderly, but less of their time is spent doing what they want to do. The time they spend with the older people who live in residential aged care is very fulfilling—they just do not get enough of it.
The increased workload of nurses is seen as another disincentive. The shortage of qualified nursing staff means that, once you get to that lack of a critical mass of qualified nurses, the flow-on effect of one nurse leaving will often mean that two others will leave. You then get a complete undersupply of qualified staff in a particular setting. As I said, the perception is that residential aged care, aged care nursing and aged care provision are not that wonderful. I am frightened and concerned that the perception may become the reality if we do not do something about turning around the needs of the work force in residential and community aged care.
In the last election, the government suggested that there would be some more nurses. Professor Hogan suggested that we needed 1,000 new first-year nursing places in 2005. The government offered 400. I suppose we have to say that is the first tiptoe down the road which, in over four years, will lead to 1,094 new nursing places. Over four years—starting this year—we get a little over what Professor Hogan said we should get annually, so there is a long way to go in terms of training. Alternatively, the Labor Party said that we would have new places introduced over time leading to an extra 1,000 nurses graduating every year by I think it was 2007. When you look at the actual number of nurses delivered by each policy, everyone would agree that you would actually get more under the Labor policy.
Professor Hogan said that we need 12,000 new traineeships—for want of a better word—for aged care workers in medication management. The government has offered 1,500, or a total of 5,000 over four years. Professor Hogan also suggested a clear number of increased training paths for aged care workers: 2,400 in certificate III and 6,000 in certificate IV by 2007-08. The government’s response to that is not crystal clear. There are indications of some increases in vocational education and training, but nowhere near the number Professor Hogan said was required.
When it comes to the skills mix required in residential aged care, the government has taken a very hands-off approach. As far as I can see, there has been no movement by the government to engage in or show leadership by working with the aged care sector to work out how we can best provide comfort to those people receiving care and to their loved ones—the families who are most interested about what is happening to their dear mum or dad. There is no leadership being shown to indicate that we need to work to give you the comfort that your loved one is being cared for appropriately.
It is clear to me that it is not a formulaic approach that we need to take; we need to give more surety and strength in the advice that we give to families about what is happening, especially in residential aged care. We need to have an appropriate skills mix. That is important. It has to be related to the care needs of the residents and should be driven not by a formula but by the care needs of the people living in that residential aged care facility. It is not easy, but in my view it has to be tackled. In supporting this legislation today, I make those observations about research and about the work force. Professor Hogan made strong commentary in his report about the work force. I do not know that the government has tackled the issue to the level that it needs to at this point in time.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (TRANSITION CARE AND ASSETS TESTING) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2005-03-07,"—I am very excited and pleased to rise tonight to support the Aged Care Amendment (Transition Care and Assets Testing) Bill 2005. I see in this legislation a significant step by the Australian government to pursue a much better framework for older Australians to age in and much better levels of care and support for them than have been available in the past. Whatever comment you want to make about the breadth, effectiveness and statistical backing of the government’s program, you would have to say that what is being laid out here is a huge improvement on what came before. The sheer amount of money being expended by the Australian government in addressing the needs of older Australians demonstrates the enormous problem and the enormous lack of service available in the past.
Between 1996 and 2008, the Australian government will have invested $67 billion in aged care in this country. In 1996 we were spending about $3 billion a year on support and services for aged Australians. Today we are spending $6.7 billion a year. That is a 125 per cent increase in services available to aged Australians. Obviously the number of aged Australians has not increased by 125 per cent in that time.
—Is that in constant dollars?
—That is in constant dollars. The proportion of the population aged 70 and over has in fact increased by 20 per cent in that time. So whether it is constant dollars or some other basis, you can see that the outlay has been enormous. There is a simple reason for that: we simply were not properly catering for the needs of older Australians beforehand. The services were not there. The number of places were not adequate for the needs of the community. The quality of those services left a lot to be desired in many cases. This government has made the commitment that it will lift its game in all of those areas. This legislation package is part of doing that, and it is doing that very successfully.
This legislation achieves two important aims. One is to put in place the transition care program. It is not merely, as Senator McLucas suggested, to reserve places for older Australians who move from an aged care facility to a hospital for a period. It does much more than that. It does other things that put in place the transition care program. The legislation also takes the burden off Australian nursing homes and other facilities in terms of assets testing their residents to ensure that workers in those aged care facilities are able to focus on their core business, which is caring for Australia’s elderly.
I will talk first about the transition care program and why it is important. This program will provide 2,000 places to help older Australians make a successful transition from a hospital—where of course many have to go from time to time for a variety of treatments—to longer term arrangements, whether they are going back to their own home, into some kind of accommodation with relatives or carers or into a residential aged care facility. Transition care provides a time-limited episode of low-intensity therapy and support to older people to improve their health and independence after a hospital stay and to increase the likelihood of them going back into some community setting rather than having to enter residential aged care because their frailty has been exacerbated by their period in hospital.
It is targeted at people who need further assistance and support before they can make an adequate and appropriate decision about their long-term care needs. It is designed to make sure that they are not hurried to make the wrong decision and that they are able to take their time to assess their capacity, to look at what capacity they have to find support, hopefully in the community setting, and to give them the means of being able to make the right decision for them. At the moment, with the enormous pressure on hospitals to vacate those beds to get what have been disparagingly called ‘bed blockers’ out of the system, very often they are not in a position to make those decisions while they are still lying in a hospital bed. This transition care is a model which gives them the chance to do that in a much better environment than was available before.
As I said, 2,000 places will be made available under this program between now and 2006-07. Although there are 2,000 places, the average time during which a person might be expected to occupy one of those places is estimated to be about eight weeks, which means that the 2,000 places will translate into assistance for about 13,000 people in any given year. Each state and territory is being asked to share in the process of allocating and using those places. The places will be allocated proportionally around Australia in line with the number of people over the age of 70 in each state and territory or, in the case of Indigenous people, over the age of 50. At the moment, the states and territories are developing their implementation plans and putting them on the table to see how they can maximise the use of those places.
The places are broken up between 1,600 new flexible aged care places, which will be released over this and the next two financial years, and 400 intermittent care service places, which were allocated in 2003-04 and which will be used under a pilot program in a number of places to ensure that we are flexibly meeting the needs of aged Australians. I mention that particularly because only this morning the intermittent care service pilot for the ACT was launched here at Parliament House by the Minister for Ageing, Julie Bishop, and the ACT Minister for Health, Simon Corbell. It is a very exciting program. It will start with 25 community based packages for older Canberrans needing short-term care and it is supported more or less equally by the Australian and ACT governments, which are forking out about $1.95 million between them to provide for a service to be delivered by Baptist Community Services, which has a long history of service in this community and other places in Australia. About 25 places will translate into about 120 older Canberrans being given the benefit of those services in any given year.
The service has two distinct aspects: firstly, to support older residents to prevent hospital admission or readmission and to help them remain in their own home; and, secondly, to offer older Canberrans presently in hospital an in-patient rehabilitation program so they can return home with community based support. That is what the intermittent care concept is all about: identifying the nature of assistance which these people need, flexibly tailoring it to their particular set of needs and moving those people into a setting where they can get that service and make educated decisions about their future care needs. June Heinrich from Baptist Community Services even mentioned this morning that one of the things that they were able to do was to ensure that the pet dog of one of the residents was able to be fed on a regular basis. That was a problem for that particular resident going home. That is the kind of thing that this particular model can provide. That gave that person independence. As a result, it was a success for them. That is why this kind of model needs to be flexible.
The other element of this package, as I mentioned, provides for a movement of the role of asset testing away from the aged care facilities themselves to bodies like Centrelink and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, which has a much longer history of and experience in providing those kinds of services. It means that approved providers of aged care services will be relieved of the administrative burden of conducting assessments and will be able to spend more time on their core business, which is caring for older Australians.
In the Investing in Australia’s Aged Care: More Places, Better Care package, which was part of last year’s budget, there have been already attempts to streamline the administration of aged care in this country to free up a focus on delivering high-quality care. For example, the Australian government has removed the requirement for providers to obtain approval from an ACAT to move a resident already in a particular facility from low care to high care. A bit of bureaucracy which was not seen as being necessary can now be dispensed with. Of course, the other part of that streamlining process which is very important at the moment is collapsing the resident classification scale from eight different classifications down to three and simplifying the process. That is an important part of what this package represents as well.
I am pleased to say that the Australian Capital Territory has been able to benefit from this process and from the general provisions that are in the Investing in Australia’s Aged Care: More Places, Better Care package. Just the other day there was an announcement of 160 new residential aged care places in the latest allocation of subsidised places by the government. That consists of 48 new high-care places and 112 low-care places at a current cost of $3.58 million in the Territory. Incidentally, about one-third of those places will be directed towards providing particular services for people with dementia, which is a growing problem. The ACT has the lowest mean age population in Australia but, perhaps logically, it means that our population is ageing faster than almost anywhere else in Australia. It means that there is a bigger scramble to catch up with the level of services required for a community like this.
Senator McLucas made reference in her remarks to the lack of data available in the sector on which to properly base decisions about the nature of services in the future. I take those comments on board. I think it is very important that we do examine ways of getting ourselves the best possible level of data in this sector so that we make fully educated decisions. She may have been reading a little more into the words of the explanatory memorandum than was intended. The other side of the coin of having adequate data about what is going on in our aged care sector is that that data needs to be collected by people working in the sector. That very often means nurses, administrators and other people in aged care settings. As Senator McLucas herself went on to point out, that is one of the things which the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into aged care in Australia is hearing a great deal about—that is, the number of times that people are being required to sit down and fill out paperwork which may or may not be necessary. Establishing a balance in that respect is pretty important. I hope that that will be one of the things that emerges from the inquiry which is currently under way.
Senator McLucas also made reference to the study conducted by Professor Len Gray, Professor Stephen Duckett and another academic, which has recently been published in the Medical Journal of Australia and which looks at the interface between the aged care residential sector and hospitals in Australia. It is a very interesting study, and I am surprised and disappointed that there was not some public money in that study because I think it did produce some important information that we can all advert to when making decisions in this area. One thing I am told it did make clear is that, although the aged population of Australia increased by 18 per cent over the period of the study, which was 1993 to 2002, compared with a general population growth of 10 per cent over that period the proportion of hospital beds occupied by older people remained stable over that 10-year period.
I cite that fact because it is very important in rebutting an argument which has been very often put by the Labor Party in the course of this debate. That argument has been that the Australian government has somehow underfunded aged care facilities in this country, forcing more and more older Australian to spend their time in public hospital wards or hospital beds. That data indicates pretty clearly that there has not been an increase in the proportion of Australians aged over 70 spending time in public hospital beds as a proportion of the population. I am very pleased to note that Senator McLucas did not repeat the assertion which has been made by some of her colleagues that somehow the Australian government is conspiring to keep Australians in hospital beds inappropriately.
I was also intrigued to hear Senator McLucas talk about Labor’s policy on aged care services and say that there would be more places for trainee nurses, for example, under Labor’s policy. I am encouraged and pleased to hear her say that but I would be grateful if she could tell me where I can find Labor’s policy on aged care or, indeed, on any aspect of health. The only policy I am aware of is the one that was christened with great fanfare during the recent election campaign, Medicare Gold, which I understand was the very first policy that the Labor Party dumped as soon as the election was over—the same policy that was described by the incoming president of the ALP as a turkey of a policy. So, if I can be directed to where I can find Labor’s policy on aged care, Senator McLucas, I would be very grateful indeed. I could then see what Labor plans to do to match the impressive program which the Australian government is putting in place to meet the needs of older Australians.
As I said at the outset of these remarks, I am very excited about this bill. I think it is very important that we pay very close attention to the needs of older Australians. We are seeing a burgeoning problem which is associated with the growth in our population of people over the age of 65. We need to have public policy firmly directed at meeting that problem as it emerges. As people like me, baby boomers, reach retirement age and need to be accommodated, we need to have those policies in place. I see in the Aged Care Amendment (Transition Care and Assets Testing) Bill a serious attempt to get those policies in place. It is a welcome step towards making sure that we have a sustainable basis for caring for older Australians, that we have the kinds of flexible models that we need to make sure we can cope with those increasing numbers in the future. I am pleased that this bill will have the support of others in the chamber today and I hope that it will be only the first of many measures which will demonstrate this government’s capacity to meet that challenge into the future.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (TRANSITION CARE AND ASSETS TESTING) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,1
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2005-03-07,"—The Aged Care Amendment (Transition Care and Assets Testing) Bill 2005 amends the Aged Care Act 1997 to implement two important measures in the coalition government’s Investing in Australia’s Aged Care: More Places, Better Care package. These amendments will benefit older Australians, particularly those living in residential aged care or considering entering residential aged care. The amendments support, firstly, the implementation of the transition care program and, secondly, the transfer of assets testing to Centrelink and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
The transition care program, comprising 2,000 transition care places, will assist older people who, after a hospital stay, require more time and support in a non-hospital environment to complete the restorative process, optimise their functional capacity and consider their longer term care arrangements. This important program will ease pressures on health services for older Australians by providing greater access to a full range of aged care services in hospital, residential and community care. We have through these amendments ensured that, if any of these older Australians are living in residential care before they access the transition care program, they will have the peace of mind of knowing that they will be able to return to their aged care home after receiving the transition care. We have done this by creating a new category of leave from residential care for the purpose of receiving flexible care.
These amendments also provide for the responsibility for assets testing for residents and potential residents of aged care facilities to be transferred from approved providers to Centrelink and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. This change in the responsibility for assets testing is aimed at streamlining the administration of aged care. Approved providers will be relieved of the administrative burden of conducting assessments, freeing up staff to focus on delivering high-quality care to residents. Approved providers will have greater certainty as to their income, due to the experience and expertise that Centrelink and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs have in conducting accurate and consistent assessments. The improvements in the integrity of the assets test will also be of substantial benefit to residents and potential residents.
These are but two of the suite of measures included in the coalition government’s $2.2 billion Investing in Australia’s Aged Care: More Places, Better Care 2004-05 package, the majority of which have been implemented. This package brings the government’s total investment in the care of older Australians to $30 billion over the next four years. There is $6.7 billion in 2004-05, rising to $8.2 billion in 2007-08, resulting in a total of $67 billion between 1996 and 2008. This demonstrates the coalition government’s strong commitment to ensuring a robust and viable aged care sector into the future, providing high-quality and affordable care to older Australians.
I would like to acknowledge the recognition by Senator McLucas and also by Senator Humphries of the study by Professor Len Gray, Stephen Duckett and others, entitled Trends in the use of hospital beds by older people in Australia: 1993–2002. I note that Senator McLucas called the study early and perhaps provisional work, but I think Senator Humphries noted, importantly, that the report found that, although the aged population increased by 18 per cent compared to the general population growth of 10 per cent during the period of the report, the proportion of hospital beds occupied by older people remained stable over that 10-year period. I acknowledge Senator Humphries comments on that.
In relation to giving confidence to the families of people who are going into aged care, I think Senator McLucas could have another look at the very strict accreditation process that the government has in place. As Senator Humphries said, Senator McLucas made comments against red tape and seemed to be suggesting further processes to assist families with confidence, although the accreditation process that aged care facilities go through is indeed very strict. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate and I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>AGED CARE AMENDMENT (TRANSITION CARE AND ASSETS TESTING) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2005-03-07,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 6) Bill 2004 is an omnibus tax bill that seeks to make a number of necessary amendments to tax law. Labor is prepared to work with the Liberal government to seek to modify and improve taxation legislation in order to respond to the legitimate concerns of taxpayers and the business community. I will shortly proceed to discuss the various schedules of the bill. However, I will initially take this opportunity to outline some broader perspectives on the tax reform process.
Debate in the Senate is not simply served by detailed discussion of the aspects of the bill as presented to it. Consideration of the overall framework in tax policy must be viewed in this context as well. Labor is committed to an economically efficient and non-distortionary tax system. This means that, as far as possible, tax policy measures should have the minimum compliance cost and operate in such a way as to have the least possible adverse consequences on choices of economic agents. This keeps the efficiency cost of the tax—the so-called ‘excess burden’—to a minimum. In this light, the process of tax reform is a key plank of microeconomic reform projects.
In the most recent economic survey on Australia the OECD indicates that the evident high levels of growth are driven by the significant reforms advanced in the late 1980s and early nineties by the then Labor government. It was Labor that reduced corporate tax rates; it was Labor that introduced the dividend imputation system and extended it to the superannuation sector—this is now regarded as the best dividend imputation system in the world—it was Labor that introduced the capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax; and it was Labor that began the process of simplification of the tax act, a project that the current government has tried to take up but has miserably failed in advancing.
In contrast to this impressive record of tax reform, what can we say about the current Liberal government’s approach over the last 10 years? It is a very mixed taxation policy record. Firstly, I make the point that the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Liberal government are no friends of the taxpayer. According to the government’s own statistics, the Liberal government is the highest-taxing government in this nation’s history. Total Commonwealth tax revenue is estimated to be $224 billion in 2004-05, up 90 per cent since 1996. Remember, this was the broken tax system we heard so much about in the context of the GST. Personal income tax will be up 80 per cent since 1996. What is more staggering is the additional burden this places on the average taxpayer. Since the Liberal government came to office, the tax burden on taxpayers has increased by $11,000, and this will grow to $14,000 over the next four years.
This build-up has largely occurred because the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the government have not compensated taxpayers for the impact of inflation on the taxation scales—so-called bracket creep. Figures by Access Economics indicate that total personal income tax cuts are smaller in revenue terms than the impact of bracket creep. So the government takes more substantially with one hand than it reduces with the other. The truth is that under the Treasurer, Mr Costello, the tax take has risen to significant proportions. There is an urgent need for the Liberal government to provide broad-based taxation relief for struggling Australian families. The government has wasted an opportunity to do this with its $66 billion spending spree on election promises. Part of this was to cut the income tax for only one in five Australians: those earning over $52,000. The average lower middle-income earner has essentially been ignored.
When considering this bill, the staff of the office of the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Mr Fitzgibbon, approached the Assistant Treasurer’s office to obtain a briefing on the provisions. We acknowledge and thank the Assistant Treasurer for making departmental staff available. I have been informed that an edict was issued from above, from the Treasurer, Mr Costello, to insist the briefing be truncated and related only to new aspects of the bill—typical of the creeping arrogance, complacency and dismissiveness of this government, and of course we will see this in worse forms after 1 July. It is out of respect for the parliamentary process that the Labor opposition took the tax bills very seriously and looked at them so closely. In matters of some complexity it is both useful and necessary to obtain a full and complete departmental briefing. But the Treasurer, Mr Costello, is not interested in proper parliamentary consideration. He just arrogantly believes, as part of this government, ‘Do as we say and follow—just do our bidding.’ I expect that in future the Treasurer, Mr Costello, will not intervene and prevent his junior minister from arranging a full and complete briefing in respect of tax matters of this type.
To turn to specific elements of the bill, schedule 1 of the bill deals with the new consolidation regime which came into operation on 1 July 2002. The amendments will apply retrospectively from 1 July 2002. The aim of the amendments is to provide greater flexibility and certainty to consolidated groups, clarifying the operation of the consolidation regime and ensuring the regime interacts appropriately with other aspects of income tax law. The amendments will, firstly, ensure that the appointment of an administrator will not prevent entities from remaining members by forcing their exit from a consolidated group; secondly, provide special rules for setting the tax cost of assets that are subject to a finance lease held by an entity that becomes a member or ceases to be a member of a consolidated group; and, thirdly, clarify the function of the cost-setting rules and the inherited history rules for assets arising from allowable capital expenditure, transport capital expenditure or exploration and prospecting expenditure in the mining industry, aligning them where possible with other depreciable assets.
The bill ensures that the head company of a consolidated group receives appropriate allowances for the decline in the value of the joining entity’s low value and software development pool. Similarly, both parties receive the appropriate allowances for the decline in value if the leading entity exits taking part of the pool. The bill alleviates the notice requirements under the inter-entity lost multiplication rules during the consolidation transitional period for entities that are in the same consolidatable group. The Commissioner of Taxation will have the discretion to extend the time for giving notices or waiving the notice requirement in appropriate circumstances.
The bill sets out the treatment for irrevocable, entity wide elections. When a consolidation occurs the head company has a choice about whether to endorse decisions made by the former company with taxation consequences—for example, the choice of a functional currency. The bill provides special rules for specified irrevocable elections or choices made by the head of the consolidated group aimed at producing compliance costs and clarifying that, where the choices of joining companies are inconsistent, the head company has the power to make the decision.
Schedule 2 of the bill modifies the taxation treatment of copyright-collecting societies and their members. Copyright-collecting societies administer certain rights of copyright on behalf of copyright owners such as composers and authors. Income received in relation to copyrights is held by societies pending identification of and allocation to the copyright owner. From 1 July 2002 the societies lost their income tax exemption and have been subject to taxation as discretionary trusts. Consequently, if the society has not identified the copyright holder entitled to certain royalties by the end of a financial year those royalties are taxed in the hands of the trustee at the top marginal rate. Because the amendments do not create a tax liability for the member at the time they become entitled to that income—that is, when their entitlement was identified by the copyright-collecting society—these amendments do present a slight opportunity for income tax deferral. There are, however, safeguards in this bill to prevent tax avoidance. But if these safeguards prove ineffective, it may be necessary to revisit the issue. The amendments will significantly reduce the compliance costs for copyright-collecting societies, which is important in ensuring that intellectual property rights are protected in Australia. The amendments will date from 1 July 2002; however, societies under certain circumstances may defer entry into the new regime until 1 July 2004.
Schedule 3 of the bill deals with the simplified imputation system, which commenced on 1 July 2002 and is known as SIS—not to be confused with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, another SIS. The amendments in this bill mainly relate to consequential and technical changes to other areas of income tax law to ensure that the SIS operates as intended—in particular, replacing references to the former imputation system with references to the simplified imputation system and updating the terminology of the former imputation provisions to SIS-equivalent terms. The bill also defines the anti-avoidance rules as they apply to certain income tax exempt charities and deductible gift recipients, which will be eligible for a refundable tax offset when the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Bill 2004 comes into effect.
Schedule 4 of the bill deals with the specific listing of numerous organisations as deductible gift recipients, commonly known as DGRs. DGRs have access to a range of tax concessions, including being able to receive donations over $2 that provide a tax deduction for the donor. Organisations that fall within the general categories of DGRs can be endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation as DGRs. Organisations that do not fall within these categories must be specifically listed in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
The Howard Liberal government has been attempting to change this requirement so that organisations could be specifically listed as DGRs by regulation rather than by legislation. This would have presented a number of issues, including lack of scrutiny of organisations being granted specific listing and the ability of the government to place restrictions on organisations specifically listed to ensure that they do not criticise the government. The Australian Democrats have also expressed concern that determining DGR status through regulation would remove the right of non-government members to propose the specific listing of organisations. Regardless of the last point, Labor opposed these provisions. Labor welcomes the government’s backflip during the last session of parliament to remove these provisions from Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 2003.
Some schools that cater for disabled children and had previously been granted DGR status are now considered by the Commissioner of Taxation as government bodies and are therefore ineligible for that status. As government bodies they cannot be considered as a charity, which is one of the requirements for DGR status. This bill will ensure that schools catering exclusively for disabled children will be able to continue to receive tax deductible gifts. The Liberal government sought to change the taxation treatment of charities. Its efforts were misguided and the charities bill was scaled back. This was welcome as charities needed to be sure that they retained their common law tax concessions that the charities bill threatened. Charities are an important part of Australian social life and the general community.
Schedule 5 of the bill deals with the debt-equity rules and the treatment of at-call loans. New debt-equity rules were introduced from 1 July 2001. Whether an interest is considered as debt or equity has important taxation consequences. In particular, if it is considered as a debt then an interest expense can be claimed by a business. At-call loans are typically made by small business owners to their own businesses, have no fixed term and are repayable on demand. Transitional rules allowed certain related party at-call loans entered into on or after 21 February 2001 and on or before 31 December 2002 to be considered as debt interest so that an interest deduction would continue to be available. The amendments in this bill will extend the transitional period until 30 June 2005 with the effect that any at-call loans made to a company by a connected entity on or before 30 June 2005 will be treated as debt interests under the debt-equity rules and that a company will continue to be able to claim an interest expense. This bill aims to allow small business more time to adjust to the new rules.
Schedule 6 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to allow irrigation water providers in Australia who are principally in the business of supplying water to primary producers to access water facilities tax concession and landcare tax concession. It will have effect from 1 July 2004 at a cost of some $15 million over the 2004-05 to 2007‑08 financial years. Primary producers have access to accelerated depreciation for capital expenditure on water facilities. They can write the expenditure off over three years rather than the much longer effective life of the asset. The bill would extend these tax concessions to irrigation water providers. This will provide greater equity between the treatment of the activities of primary producers and irrigation water providers that supply those primary producers with water—essentially the same service—while the landcare concessions will be made available to irrigation water providers who supply water to businesses using rural land, excluding mining activities. Irrigation water providers are defined as entities who provide infrastructure, water management and water storage but do not include businesses that use vehicles to transport water or that are not primarily in the business of supplying water to primary producers. That may be a little difficult to identify at times in some areas, I suspect. However, the general approach and the details are important and should be supported. The bill also includes a number of technical amendments to clarify the types of expenditures that are eligible for the concessions.
Schedule 7 broadens the exemption of fringe benefits tax for the purchase of a new dwelling as a result of relocation effective from 1 April 2004. An FBT exemption currently exists for costs incidental to the sale or acquisition of a dwelling as a result of relocation as long as the employee sells their previous dwelling within two years and purchases a dwelling at the new locality within four years of the commencement date of the new employment position. The amendment will ensure that, when an employee purchases a dwelling in a new locality without having already sold their dwelling at the old locality, the employer is able to access the FBT exemption for costs incidental to the purchase of a new dwelling provided they then sell their dwelling at the old locality within two years of commencing their new employment position.
Schedule 8 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and extends the scope of the capital gains tax event G3 to allow the administrator of a company to declare shares and other equities worthless for CGT purposes. This allows taxpayers to choose to make a capital loss. If the shares subsequently regain their value then a cost base of zero is used for future capital gains tax calculations. This amendment allows a company to appoint an administrator rather than a liquidator to conduct external administration proceedings.
Schedule 9 removes an anomaly in the GST legislation. I do not know how many GST amendments we have dealt with. Senator Murray is smiling.
—And whose fault is it?
—Senator Murray should not be smiling; you are right, Senator Conroy.
—There are two villains in the room at the moment.
—There are two villains. We must not reflect on the chair, Senator John Cherry, for his role in all this. There have been more than 1,650 amendments to the GST, the so-called simple tax to fix the so-called broken tax system, and here is another one. With respect to the GST treatment of residents and nonresidents with regard to the services associated with supplies of residential property, advertising, maintenance et cetera, there is currently a loophole which permits foreign residents who own and sell or rent out property in Australia to treat services related to this property as GST-free supplies. This means they pay no GST but can, if registered, claim an input tax credit. For residents, these services are input taxed, meaning there is no GST and no credit.
Schedule 10 will allow people who are legally responsible for a child eligible for adoption and who are in the process of applying for adoption to lodge a claim for the first child tax offset or baby bonus. The current law requires that they are the child’s legal guardians before being eligible. The amendment, retrospective to 1 July 2001, will ensure that, where there is a delay in custody proceedings, they can claim the baby bonus from the time they begin to take care of the child. Schedule 11 includes minor technical amendments. Labor will support the bill. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 6) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,30,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2005-03-07,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 6) Bill 2004 is largely technical. It contains 12 distinct schedules, another 129 pages of taxation law and 175 pages of explanatory memorandum. Schedule 1 contains technical amendments to the company consolidation regime. The company consolidation regime was a recommendation of the Ralph review of business taxes. I, as Democrat taxation spokesperson, have been considerably involved in the process. The parliament has seen plenty of legislative changes since the introduction of consolidation on 1 July 2002. On various occasions I have stated that we are placing plenty of faith in the expertise of the Treasury and Taxation Office representatives and that I was always going to be nervous that the costs that they foresaw were going to be much less than those that would eventuate. I think that is likely to be proven true. However, we remain supporters of that tax consolidation regime as a contribution to market efficiencies, flexibilities and rationalisation.
During the past three years, company taxation receipts have been increasing at over 10 per cent per annum to over $37 billion. We supported lowering the company tax rate in return for broadening the base. We agreed with the government that the result would be increased, not decreased, revenue—and that has proven to be the case. It is sometimes said by those who are ignorant of these matters or who do not listen to what we actually say that the Democrats are supporters of high tax. We are not. We are supporters of high revenue sufficient to meet the legitimate and reasonable needs of Australians. Of course, that company tax situation is typical. We supported a tax cut as we knew it would deliver greater revenue because of the way in which it was structured.
Schedule 2 deals with the taxation of copyright collection societies and ensures that money received on behalf of authors and composers is not taxed at the full top marginal effective rate. Quite appropriately, this bill ensures that the income is taxed in the hands of the author or composer and not treated as trust income taxable in the hands of the trustee. Schedule 3 contains some minor technical amendments to the simplified imputation system. Schedule 4 establishes a new category of deductible gift recipient for special schools for students with a disability. Obviously the Democrats support this initiative. We are also pleased to see that this bill ensures DGR status for the various state fire and emergency service authorities. This is an area that my colleague Senator Cherry, who is presently in the chair, has lobbied on and taken a strong interest in.
Schedule 5 extends the transitional rules for the debt and equity rules. Some small businesses often inject funds into their businesses, but not all small business people have an accounting background and some do not recognise the difference between debt and equity. Most small businesses will simply consider that they have injected ‘their money’ into ‘their business’; they do not recognise the accounting difference. This transitional amendment allows them until 30 June 2005 to determine, for accounting purposes, if the injection of funds is debt or equity for taxation purposes.
Schedule 6 implements the government’s announcement that eligible irrigation water providers have access to the water facilities and land care tax concessions that are currently available to primary producers—a ‘levelling the field’ provision. Schedule 7 extends the fringe benefits tax exemption for relocation to the incidental costs associated with purchasing a new home. This is a minor but beneficial amendment.
Schedule 8 deals with the capital gains tax treatment of companies that are in liquidation. The rules allow an insolvency practitioner to declare that shares are worthless. This change allows shareholders to claim the capital loss immediately rather than waiting until the company is dissolved. There is often a long lag between the realisation that a company is worthless and going through the mechanics of dissolution. In the meantime, an accounting period may be missed, during which those who have experienced the capital loss could have had the opportunity to make the appropriate claims.
Schedule 9 was just put in to excite the Labor Party. If you put ‘GST’ into a bill, they automatically react in a Pavlovian manner, and we all smile and wave at each other and gesture. The GST is now well established as a very significant tax measure, delivering on its way to $40 billion in the next year or two. It has, of course, the need for constant tinkering. Schedule 9 ensures that nonresidents who own rental properties are input taxed for GST purposes. As Senator Sherry outlined, there was a technical loophole that allowed nonresidents to treat their rental properties as GST free and accordingly claim input tax credits. However, this amendment will ensure that residents and nonresidents are treated the same—another ‘levelling the field’ amendment.
Schedule 10 amends eligibility for the first child tax offset to make it available to adoptive parents. My colleague Senator Stott Despoja, working with our shared adviser, Kellie Caught, has lobbied the government for this change, and hopefully she will be relieved from her maternal duties and be able to speak to this positive development. If she does not, I merely commend the work she has done on it. Schedule 11 contains some technical amendments to the franking rules for life insurance companies. Schedule 12 also deals with life insurance companies. It corrects some technical anomalies dealing with the transfer of a life insurance business to another life insurance company.
The Democrats will be supporting the bill without amendment, although we do have a second reading amendment—which Senator Stott Despoja will speak to—which calls on the government to provide adoptive parents with the same rights and support as biological parents.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 6) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,30,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2005-03-07,"—The Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 6) Bill 2004 contains several reminders that this government’s record on taxation reform is one of its notable achievements. It was great that Senator Sherry urged the Senate to put this particular omnibus bill in a wider policy context; I am delighted to do that. It is remarkable what has been achieved, despite a hostile Senate, in relation to tax reform. Despite the efforts of senators opposite, the government was able to deliver, with the assistance of the Australian Democrats, a better tax system. Senators on this side of the chamber will never forget the contributions of Senator Murray or Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Cherry, in his former capacity. And Senator Stott Despoja: although you did have some misgivings about elements of the new tax system, it is great to see you back here today.
The government delivered, amongst other things, four rounds of income tax cuts—including from 1 July this year. It also reduced the withdrawal rates on income support payments, halved the capital gains tax rate, reduced the company tax rate twice and funded the abolition of a range of state taxes. Contrary to Senator Sherry’s assertions, we have indeed returned more than the proceeds of bracket creep since we have been in government. This year, the GST is raising $35 billion, and all of that revenue is going to the states and territories. Senators opposite have complained about the treatment of the GST—that this government treats it as a state tax—yet I did not see anything in Labor’s election policy that would treat it differently.
All the states and territories are better off financially as a result of the GST. They have a secure and growing source of revenue, and it provides an opportunity for the states to reduce even more of their own taxes and provide adequate funding for vital services such as hospitals and schools. It was extremely heartening to see Mr Swan, in another place, urge his state Labor colleagues to complete the job of the new tax system and to further reduce their own state taxes. The Labor Party voted against the introduction of the GST. They voted against a secure and growing source of revenue for the states—a secure source of revenue for schools and hospitals. The Australian Democrats, by voting for that legislation, distinguished themselves from the Labor Party as a genuine party of reform—unlike the Australian Labor Party.
—Distinguished and extinguished!
—We are far more charitable on this side of the chamber. We have a long memory; we will not forget. This is an omnibus bill which continues the ongoing refurbishment necessary for our tax system to operate with efficiency and certainty. Schedule 1 of the bill relates to the consolidation regime. The regime was introduced from 1 July 2002 as part of this government’s business tax reforms. The amendments in this bill will improve the operation of that regime. The bill clarifies the consolidation membership rules and also provides clearer cost-cutting rules in relation to financial leases, some mining expenditure and low-value and software development pools. The bill also makes some changes which will help to reduce compliance costs.
Schedule 2 relates to the income of copyright collecting societies. Copyright collecting societies organise and administer some rights of copyright on behalf of the copyright owners. These societies are in general treated as trusts under tax law, and without the amendments in this bill the existing law would require that they pay the top marginal tax rate of 47 per cent on a substantial amount of the income collected on behalf of their members. This amendment will ensure that copyright collecting societies are not taxed on income they collect on behalf of copyright owners.
Schedule 3 contains amendments relating to the simplified imputation system. The simplified imputation system was a key component of the government’s business tax reforms and commenced from 1 July 2002. It improved and simplified the existing imputation rules, increased the flexibility in the way in which corporate tax entities frank distributions and provided consistent treatment across entities receiving franked dividends. The amendments contained in this bill are generally consequential amendments updating references to the new system within the tax law and updating some terminology. There are also some technical amendments in relation to exempt entities to ensure that the system operates as originally intended.
Schedule 4 relates to deductible gift recipients listed in the tax law. Every year there are similar amendments in one or more of the omnibus tax bills adding new organisations to those already listed. This is a very popular section of the law. It is one which, as Senator Coonan would know from her previous incarnation, keeps assistant treasurers busy from time to time. In this omnibus bill we have a list of fire and emergency services bodies to be added as gift deducible recipients. It is nice to see in this fairly dry and technical legislation that there is something unequivocally positive. This schedule in the bill provides a reminder that we have a sophisticated financial system and copyright law, but there is also a reminder for people who want to donate to these particular bodies that they can donate to the Victorian SES or the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service.
The amendments will also bring into legislation a new category of gift deductible recipient. Certain special schools had, in the past, been considered as deductible gift recipients by virtue of being public benevolent institutions. However, given that government schools cannot be a public benevolent institution under common law, these amendments will ensure that special government schools do qualify for gift deductible recipient status. Schools which qualify are those which provide special education for students who have a permanent disability and do not provide education for other students. This is probably one of the most important changes in this bill.
Schedule 5 of the bill extends a transitional rule allowing certain at-call loans to be a debt interest rather than equity for income tax purposes. Schedule 6 covers the government’s announcement to allow certain irrigation water providers to be eligible for the water facilities and landcare tax concessions which are available to primary producers. These changes will help irrigators to improve their services to primary producers.
Schedule 7 makes a small extension to the fringe benefits tax exemption for the costs incidental to the sale or acquisition of a dwelling by an employee relocating for work purposes. This change will mean that the employer does not have to wait for the previous dwelling to be sold before being eligible for the exemption. But the exemption will still be contingent on the former dwelling being sold within two years of the employee starting their new position.
Schedule 8 relates to capital losses for capital gains tax purposes. ‘CGT event G3’ might sound more like a crisis reminiscent of a Michael Crichton or Robert Ludlum novel, but it is actually an innocent reference to a provision under subdivision 104-G of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 which deals with capital gains tax in relation to shares. Specifically, the law currently relating to CGT event G3 currently provides that a liquidator can declare shares in a company to be worthless for capital gains tax purposes—not to downplay the significance of such an event for those involved, but it is hardly something worthy of a Michael Crichton book. As a further aside, I note that there is an event G1 but no G2 in subdivision 104-G, which is a mystery. The amendment in this bill will ensure that an administrator, not just a liquidator, can declare shares in a company to be worthless for capital gains tax purposes.
Schedule 9 relates to the GST, which, as I noted earlier, is providing $35 billion revenue to the states and territories this year. These amendments will remove an anomaly which previously allowed some services relating to the supply of residential premises in Australia to be GST free. It will help strengthen the GST base, ensuring that it continues to be a good source of revenue for the states and territories into the future.
Schedule 10 relates to the eligibility of adoptive parents for the government’s first child tax offset, otherwise known as the baby bonus, which has since been replaced by the new maternity payment, which commenced from 1 July 2004. The maternity payment and the baby bonus before it demonstrate the government’s commitment to assisting new parents with the costs of a new baby. The amendment will ensure that adoptive parents can also be eligible for the baby bonus after commencing caring for a child. Once given legal responsibility for the child, which can occur some months after adoptive parents begin caring for a child, the parents will be able to lodge a retrospective claim. This is a sensible and worthwhile thing to do.
Schedule 11 is a technical correction relating to the franking deficit tax offset provisions for life insurance companies. Schedule 12 covers amendments relating to the tax consequences of transferring life insurance business from one company to another. These amendments address some concerns which had been raised by the industry and are intended to ensure that tax is not an impediment in such circumstances.
It has been quite a while since senators opposite actually had the responsibility of running a tax system so they have probably forgotten that the job of continually renovating our tax system is an ongoing one; it is a job that is never done. This bill is the latest instalment in that effort and I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 6) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,30,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2005-03-07,"—I wish to address the amendment in schedule 10 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 6) Bill 2004. It is an amendment to which Senator Fifield has referred—that is, the retrospective entitlement of adoptive parents to apply for the baby bonus. That amendment has come about, as I understand it, as a direct result of lobbying by my office on behalf of the Australian Democrats. Senator Murray referred to Kellie Caught, our adviser on this issue. I pay tribute to her and Raina Hunter for their work on this issue. We called for greater recognition of the adoptive process and for appropriate support for what is a very worthy group of parents, who no doubt face similar experiences to parents who have a new biological family.
The eligibility criteria for the baby bonus included the requirement that the taxpayer must be legally responsible for the child. Adoptive parents are legally responsible for a child only when an adoption order is issued. However, in all states and territories, except, I think, your home state of Queensland, Mr Acting Deputy President Cherry, a child is placed with a potential adoptive parent for some months, sometimes even years, before an approach is made to a court to legally formalise the adoption. During the time of placement and prior to the adoption order being made, the legal responsibility for the child is actually with the director-general of the department responsible for overseeing adoptions in that particular state. However, the responsibility for the day-to-day care of that child and, of course, the child’s welfare and development, is with the prospective adoptive parents.
When the baby bonus legislation was first introduced, adoptive parents were not entitled to claim the baby bonus during the period from the commencement of care to the granting of the adoption order. According to research by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, as many as 500 families each year who adopt children under the age of five are excluded as a result of this process. During that placement period, up to 500 families were not eligible to claim the baby bonus.
It is no secret to anyone here that the Australian Democrats were not strong supporters of the baby bonus. In fact, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would know, we voted against the baby bonus, preferring a system of government funded, nationally run, paid maternity leave. Having said that—and the government having introduced the baby bonus and then replaced it with the maternity payment—we see no reason for a particular group of parents such as adoptive parents to be ineligible to claim that payment.
As some members would know, I wrote to Minister Helen Coonan, who is in the chamber, who at the time was the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, asking her to consider amending the appropriate legislation so that adoptive parents would be eligible for the baby bonus and would be eligible from the date of placement. I am very pleased that the government has acted on this issue and to see the amendment to this legislation before the Senate today, though somewhat belatedly. Nonetheless, this legislation will backdate eligibility to 1 July 2001 when the initial scheme was introduced.
But there are some outstanding issues. After receiving a letter from Mr Ross Cameron on 9 February informing me and the Democrats that the government was going to amend the legislation specifically in relation to the baby bonus, we were quite bemused that only three months later—this was last year—the government announced it was going to change the process so that baby bonus would no longer be the financial support to be offered by the government and it would be replaced by the $3,000 maternity payment. We were bemused not only because the government once again had decided to forgo the option of, say, a 14-week national government-funded paid maternity leave scheme but because, once again, in introducing the maternity payment, the government had discriminated against adoptive parents.
I do understand that the maternity payment legislation recognises that adoption is a method of forming a family and that parents adopting a child face the same financial impacts of a new child entering a home as any other new parent—biological parents et cetera. However, the problem with that legislation is that it actually limits the eligibility of adoptive parents to those adopting a child under 26 weeks of age. This limitation will exclude the majority of parents who adopt a child from outside Australia. The vast majority of these children are older than 26 weeks when they are adopted. For example, in the 2003-04 financial year there were 370 placement adoptions of children from outside Australia—41 per cent of these were aged one year or under and 52 per cent were between the ages of one and four. Unfortunately, we do not know how many were older than 26 weeks. The data supplied to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare by the states and territories does not have a more detailed breakdown in relation to ages, but the anecdotal evidence does suggest that the majority are actually older than 26 weeks.
Once again, a group of parents—adoptive parents—are going to be excluded under the current legislation. This amendment bill will deal with those people who are claiming the baby bonus retrospectively, but it will not deal with those parents who are now excluded as a consequence of the maternity payment changes. In the 2004-05 budget, the Treasurer stated:
The Maternity Payment recognises the cost of a new child and will assist all mothers many of whom leave the workforce and leave paid work at the time of the birth of their child.
Adoptive parents of course also incur additional costs when adopting a child, and often they choose to take time out of the work force as well in order to care for their newly adopted child. In fact, while it is not legislated by the states or territories, the adoption unit in each state strongly encourages parents to take time out and to stay at home full time for up to 12 months following an adoption, irrespective of the child’s age. If parents do not agree to this, it actually can hamper the likelihood that they will be chosen as adoptive parents.
The Workplace Relations Act 1996 also recognises the right of adoptive parents to access unpaid maternity and paternity leave regardless of the child’s age. In addition, the HREOC report entitled A time to value: proposal for a national scheme of paid maternity leave examined a number of the issues facing adoptive parents and recommended that government funded paid maternity leave should be available to all adoptive parents irrespective of the age of the child.
The current maternity payment legislation does discriminate. It discriminates against the vast majority of families who are endeavouring to start or grow their family through the process of adoption. What I can do is continue to lobby the government on this particular issue. Tonight I hope that the opposition and the government will consider the amendment that has been circulated in my name on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We seek to rectify an omission that we believe the government has already acknowledged in relation to the baby bonus and we hope it will acknowledge in relation to the maternity payment. I wrote to Ministers Coonan and Patterson pretty much immediately after the budget in May last year outlining my concerns and the many concerns that have been made clear to me by adoptive parents. In that letter the Democrats urged the government to amend the legislation and make the maternity payment available to all adoptive parents, irrespective of the child’s age.
I am happy to be corrected on this if there has been some update in recent weeks or months, acknowledging that I have been on maternity leave, but I am not aware of a response from the ministers and I am certainly not aware of any attempts to amend the legislation to give those families the access to the maternity payment that we believe they deserve. My understanding is, however, that the Prime Minister said to cabinet that he would be willing to consider those changes, and I hope that that is true. I believe that was reported in the media. I hope that the Prime Minister is sincere in that comment and that it will come about.
As I said in my letter to the ministers, given the relatively small numbers of parents who adopt, inclusion of this group into the maternity payment legislation would be quite inexpensive for the government but it would provide financial support and recognition for a very worthy group of parents who face similar experiences to those of parents starting a new biological family. To this end, I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
 “but the Senate:
         (a)    is concerned that the Government continues to discriminate against parents who adopt children, by restricting eligibility to the Maternity Payment (which has replaced the Baby Bonus); and
         (b)    calls on the Government to:
               (i)    afford adoptive parents the same rights and supports as biological parents, and
              (ii)    amend the Maternity Payment to make it available to all adoptive parents, irrespective of the child’s age”.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2004 MEASURES NO. 6) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,30,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2005-03-07,"—I thank all senators for their contribution and note that Senator Stott Despoja is now back from maternity leave. I am only surprised that Conrad is not here to make a contribution this evening.
—He’s asleep.
—You can enjoy it while he is asleep, Senator Stott Despoja. In any event, welcome back.
—Thank you.
—I am now summing up on the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 6) Bill 2004. The bill continues the government’s steady program of modification and improvements to the tax laws and gives effect to a number of budget announcements from last year. The first measures in the bill deal with consolidations. As the new consultation regime has changed the tax landscape for many corporate groups, the government has continued its active consultation with business on its implementation. The bill further demonstrates the government’s commitment to this process and results in greater flexibility and certainty for taxpayers.
For instance, the bill clarifies the position of entities under external administration. The membership rules are being modified to ensure that an entity in liquidation or under administration can still be a member of a group. The bill also gives taxpayers joining or leaving groups more options with regard to certain elections and clarifies the consolidation cost-setting rules on finance leases, certain types of mining expenditure and low-value and software development pools.
The bill ensures that copyright-collecting societies are not taxed on income collected on behalf of members. Copyright-collecting societies administer copyrights for copyright owners, including authors and composers, and may receive payment in relation to the copyrights. Where this happens the societies hold the payments in trust for the copyright owners. The bill will ensure that copyright-collecting societies that meet certain criteria will be exempt from income tax on copyright related income and certain other income. Instead, the income will be taxed in the hands of the copyright owner. The third schedule to the bill implements a further tranche of the simplified imputation system. It continues the roll-out of the simplified imputation system and contains a number of technical and consequential amendments to this end.
Next, the government is updating the lists of organisations which qualify as deductible gift recipients. Deductible gift recipient status assists organisations to attract public support for their activities. In particular, the government is ensuring that special schools, which, I think we all agree, do such an important job, can continue to qualify as deductible gift recipients when endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation. Importantly, given the events earlier this year in South Australia, the Country Fire Authority in Victoria and equivalent coordinating bodies in other states and territories are being assisted by being given deductible gift recipient status.
The bill provides some relief for businesses with at-call loans by extending an existing transitional provision in the debt equity rules. Transitional arrangements which treat at-call loans as debt for income tax purposes will be extended from 30 June 2004 to 30 June 2005. This will give businesses more time to assess existing loans and, if need be, adjust their arrangements. In the meantime the government has announced that it will develop a carve-out from the debt equity rules to reduce unnecessary compliance costs for many small businesses using at-call loans.
The next measure will assist irrigation providers and rural land irrigators to renew water supply infrastructure and encourage rural land irrigators to carry out land care operations by giving them an outright deduction for the cost of capital expenditure on land care. I know that this is a particularly welcome measure. Another feature of this measure is that it clarifies the meaning of the term ‘water facility’ and makes it plain that it might include, depending on circumstances, a bridge over an irrigation channel or a fence to keep livestock out of an irrigation channel.
The seventh measure in the bill removes an anomaly in the fringe benefits tax law by making sure that employers do not lose the exemption for relocation costs just because the employee buys a new house before selling an old house. This is part of a program of measures to ensure that the exemption remains relevant to small business and other employers with regional work forces such as police and ambulance services, a particularly important measure given some of the great difficulties of attracting police and other services to rural and regional areas. The eighth measure will allow taxpayers to more easily claim a capital loss on worthless shares. The capital gains tax rules will be simplified to allow any insolvency practitioner and not just the liquidator to declare shares or other equity interests in a company to be worthless for capital gains tax purposes. The measure will certainly be welcomed by shareholders because it will assist them to close the book on worthless investments earlier and with less cost.
Turning to the GST law: an anomaly was identified in relation to residential property whereby certain services are GST free if the owner is overseas but subject to GST if the owner is in Australia. This anomaly will now be corrected.
As to the baby bonus, that of course is a matter of equity, and I acknowledge Senator Stott Despoja’s interest and role in this particular measure. It will allow adoptive parents to claim the baby bonus retrospectively for the period between taking care of the child and being granted legal responsibility so that they are effectively in the same position as non-adoptive parents. The changes also ensure that parents who have already claimed the bonus for the period between taking care of the child and being granted legal responsibility will not have to repay if their claim was otherwise correct.
This may be a convenient place to deal with Senator Stott Despoja’s second reading amendment relating to the maternity payment. The maternity payment recognises the legal relationship between a mother and a newborn baby and the extra costs associated with the birth or adoption of a baby. It is, I think on any view, a generous scheme which represents a streamlining of the previous maternity allowance and baby bonus. One of the changes the scheme makes is to move the payment of the benefit from the tax system to the social security system. This means that the particular issue that has been identified might therefore be better considered in another context. I no longer occupy my former role in terms of being able to respond directly to Senator Stott Despoja’s letter, but I will certainly ensure that the concerns she has enunciated are brought to the attention of Senator Patterson. For that reason, the government will not be supporting the second reading amendment.
The last measure in the bill relates to life insurance transfers and it alleviates unintended income tax consequences that can occur when a life insurer transfers some or all of its life insurance business to another life company under either part 9 of the Life Insurance Act 1995 or the Financial Sector Reform (Transfer of Business) Act 1999. Given the debate and former speeches in relation to this matter, apart from these summaries of the measures, I do not propose to delay the Senate any longer. Taken as a whole, it is a fair comment to say that the bill represents some substantial improvements to the tax law, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2005-03-07,"—Labor welcomes the opportunity to debate the Postal Industry Ombudsman Bill 2004 [2005]. Today the Senate finally has the chance to consider the government’s attempt to implement a reform that was initially promised by the coalition 3½ years ago in the run-up to the 2001 election. It is worth recalling the history of this initiative because it gives an insight into the priority of the Howard government and the priority that is given to improving postal services. On 21 October 2001, the then minister, former Senator Alston—
—A great man.
—a great Collingwood supporter—announced with great fanfare that the coalition would:
Establish a dedicated postal industry ombudsman who will operate in similar fashion to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman in assisting customers who have not been able to resolve disputes satisfactorily with postal operators.
It is important to note that the government’s commitment was to introduce a postal industry ombudsman, or PIO, based on the model provided by the telecommunications ombudsman scheme—or TIO, as it is known. As I will detail, this is a commitment that has manifestly not been delivered. It was not until October 2002 that the government was moved to release a discussion paper on its proposal to establish a postal industry ombudsman.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order! Would senators please resume their seats or resume their conversations outside the chamber.
—Hear, hear! Throw them out.
—I do not need your help, Senator Conroy.
—It is those Western Australians; they are still over there. The paper indicated that the government was trying to get out of its promise to base the PIO on the successful telecommunications ombudsman model. It was when it released that paper in 2002 that you got the hint that it was actually running away from Senator Alston’s commitment. It floated a number of weaker options, including the option of industry self-regulation, as an alternative to the TIO approach. It was not until another year later, in October 2003, that the government finally announced its model for the PIO, which forms the basis of the legislation the Senate is considering today.
Senators may think that after all this time the government would have been able to develop legislation for the PIO which complies with its initial promise. Regrettably, that is not the case. Before I discuss the issue in more detail, let us be clear, Senator Abetz, as you moan over on the other side of the chamber: this is simply asking the government to keep its word—that is all. We are asking the government to keep its word, its promise, before it dishonours Senator Alston. This government is now dishonouring—in your words—a ‘great’ senator’s promise. Before I discussed this issue I wanted to make that point to Senator Abetz.
This bill inserts a new part into the Ombudsman Act 1976 which will establish the Postal Industry Ombudsman as a separate office within the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s office. The PIO will investigate complaints relating to the provision of postal services by Australia Post and other private postal operators who voluntarily choose to register with the scheme. For the purposes of this legislation, postal services are defined broadly to include courier services and parcel services. The ombudsman is not limited to act on the basis of complaints but can, on his or her own initiative, investigate Australia Post or a registered private postal operator in relation to the provision of postal or similar services. The ombudsman will have the capacity to investigate a wide range of complaints from consumers and small businesses.
The PIO will also provide a means for post office licensees, mail contractors and postal agents to resolve disputes with Australia Post. Sensibly, the ombudsman is not authorised to investigate complaints made by a postal operator against one of its competitors in the industry. The ombudsman is also unable to investigate complaints that relate to conduct which is more than 12 months old. The range of powers available to the PIO will be similar in scope to those of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The PIO will be able to require the production of written information and require people to appear before the PIO to answer questions.
The PIO will not have some of the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s stronger powers, such as the power to enter premises or to override a person’s claims that documents are protected by legal professional privilege. The government’s view is that these stronger powers may act as a deterrent to private postal operators joining up to the scheme. Following an investigation, if the PIO believes that Australia Post or a registered private postal operator has breached the law or has been unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or otherwise acted wrongly, it may recommend that the postal operator take remedial action. This may include steps to mitigate or rectify the effects of the action or to alter policies or practices which caused the conduct under examination. In the event that the postal operator declines to take appropriate action following the PIO’s advice, the PIO may request the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to table a report detailing its findings in parliament. The PIO will operate on a cost-recovery basis whereby Australia Post and registered private operators are charged for the cost of conducting investigations related to them. The details of the cost recovery mechanism will be prescribed in regulations. At this point, it is estimated that the operation of a PIO will cost around $300,000 per year.
I would like to make it very clear that Labor supports the establishment of the Postal Industry Ombudsman to provide users of postal services with a means to cheaply and efficiently deal with disputes that cannot be satisfactorily resolved by postal operators. The establishment of an ombudsman was a key Labor postal services policy at the last election. It is important, however, not only to have a postal ombudsman but also to establish an ombudsman with appropriate jurisdiction and powers to address consumer disputes. Labor believes that unfortunately the model that the government has chosen is the wrong one. Labor believes that the new postal ombudsman should closely follow the structure and powers that are associated with the TIO. As I noted at the outset, this is exactly what the government promised back in 2001. While I realise that 2001 was a couple of elections ago, it is still no excuse for the government to back out on its policies and commitments of 2001.
The TIO has been operating successfully since 1993 as a free and independent dispute scheme for people who have a complaint about their telephone or internet service. There are a number of significant differences between the TIO and the structure proposed for the Postal Industry Ombudsman. These differences have the potential to substantially undermine the effectiveness of the PIO in resolving complaints from users of postal services. Firstly, the TIO is a dedicated, stand-alone entity. The telecommunications ombudsman does not have responsibility for performing other regulatory roles for the Commonwealth. In contrast, the postal ombudsman will be an office within the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Under proposed section 19L, which will be inserted by this bill, the office of the postal ombudsman will be held by the same person who occupies the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. There are undoubtedly many dedicated and skilled staff in the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Nevertheless, the fact that the person filling the position of postal ombudsman will not have a dedicated focus on postal issues means that the role will not be given the full attention that it deserves. The government is effectively saying that the PIO is a part-time job. This will do little to bring the office to public attention or inspire public confidence.
Another major distinction between the telecommunications ombudsman and the postal ombudsman proposed by this bill is the extent to which the scheme covers participants in the industry. Under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999, all carriers and carriage service providers are required to join the TIO scheme. In contrast, this bill states that the PlO will only have the capacity to deal with complaints against Australia Post and private postal operators who choose to join the scheme. It is not possible to imagine that a government would put forward a proposal for a telecommunications ombudsman that only required Telstra to join the scheme and said to other players like Optus and Vodafone that they could join the scheme if they wanted to. But that is just what the government is doing in postal services.
There is no question that Australia Post is still the dominant provider of postal services in this country. In order to fund its community service obligations, legislation gives Australia Post exclusive rights in relation to delivery of letters weighing less than 250 grams. Private operators are only allowed to carry letters if they charge at least four times the standard rate. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that, outside those services reserved by legislation, Australia Post faces a substantial amount of competition in relation to other postal services. In addition, the relative importance of the reserved services as a share of services provided by Australia Post has been declining. In 2003-04 reserved services accounted for only 45 per cent of Australia Post’s revenue, down from 51 per cent six years earlier. In the last decade in particular, Australia Post has begun to face tough competition in parcel courier and express mail services. Companies like Toll Holdings, DHL, UPS, Allied Express, TNT and the Australian Document Exchange are significant players in these markets. While the bill gives the PIO jurisdiction to investigate complaints about postal or similar services such as couriers and parcel carrying services, the ombudsman will not be able to investigate complaints against these large and successful companies unless they voluntarily register for the scheme. Labor does not believe that this is a satisfactory outcome for consumers.
Given the growing size of private operators providing postal services, Labor believes that the ombudsman must have the capacity to have oversight of all the major players in the market. While it is to be hoped that many private operators would sign up to the scheme as a way of instilling consumer confidence in their service, the parliament should not leave this matter to chance. During the election campaign, Labor stated that it would act to ensure that the PIO scheme had coverage over all significant postal operators, not just Australia Post. In the committee stage of this bill, I will move amendments to broaden the scope of the PIO’s jurisdiction. These amendments will require all private postal operators who have more than 20 employees and an annual turnover in excess of $1 million to register for the scheme. This will ensure that more consumers are able to utilise the ombudsman scheme to resolve disputes with private postal operators. It may also have the effect of improving standards across the postal services industry as more operators will be subject to the scrutiny of the ombudsman. I hope that the Senate will support this strengthening of the powers of the PIO.
The final point of difference that I would like to highlight between the PIO and the TIO relates to the fact that the postal ombudsman will have no power to order postal operators to compensate consumers where they have engaged in wrongful conduct. The telecommunications ombudsman has the authority to make decisions, such as orders compensating consumers, up to the value of $10,000. These determinations are binding on all licensed telecommunications carriers. In contrast under this bill, where the PIO finds that a postal operator has engaged in wrongful conduct, the PIO may ask the postal service provider to take action to mitigate or rectify the effect of the conduct. If satisfactory action is not taken, the PIO’s only recourse is to request that the minister table a report on the company in parliament.
Adverse reports tabled in parliament would undoubtedly act as a deterrent to Australia Post and registered postal operators from acting wrongfully. Nevertheless, the bill does not provide much in the way of meaningful redress for individual consumers. Labor has given detailed consideration to the option of amending the bill to address this deficiency. On balance, however, the opposition has decided against this course of action. Labor recognises that empowering the PIO to make orders compensating consumers is a difficult drafting exercise, given the way the PIO is structured under this bill.
We are particularly mindful that care must be taken to ensure that the PIO is not given judicial powers in breach of the Constitution. While we will not be amending the bill to provide for compensation orders at this stage over the next few years, Labor will be closely monitoring the operation of the scheme. In government, Labor would review the adequacy of the Postal Industry Ombudsman’s powers and restructure the scheme to provide for compensation orders if necessary.
It is regrettable that in this area, as in many others, the government has not kept its election promises. More than three years ago, it said it would introduce a postal industry ombudsman that would be similar to the successful telecommunications ombudsman scheme. In reality, after a long and inexplicable delay, it has delivered a scheme that is inferior in several significant ways to the TIO model. Labor will seek to remedy one of its most glaring weaknesses when this bill enters the committee stage. I urge senators to support Labor’s proposal to ensure that the PIO has the capacity to investigate all significant postal operators.
Despite the deficiencies in the government’s approach, the proposed PIO is a step forward for consumers and will be supported by the opposition. There is a clear need for the establishment of an independent body to assist users of postal services to resolve disputes without the need to resort to costly litigation. I hope that the new Postal Industry Ombudsman will be able to successfully perform that role.",SENATE,<title>POSTAL INDUSTRY OMBUDSMAN BILL 2004 [2005]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,31,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2005-03-07,"—I rise to speak on the Postal Industry Ombudsman Bill 2004, which aims to establish an external dispute resolution scheme in the form of an ombudsman regime for the postal industry. In May last year, the government introduced legislation which sought to shift to the Australian Communications Authority responsibility for monitoring and reporting on the supply of postal services, including the establishment of a consumer complaints mechanism. At the time of debating that bill last year, I pointed out that a consumer complaints mechanism already exists through the Commonwealth Ombudsman and Australia Post. As I pointed out then in my speech in the second reading debate the Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2004, the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman noted that the number of complaints received by the Ombudsman in relation to post is quite small.
In their 2002-03 annual report, the Commonwealth Ombudsman said:
The total number of complaints received this year was 1,082, compared to 1,060 in 2000–01 and the 2001–02 total of 896 ...
To put some perspective to these figures, every day of the year, Australia Post moves in excess of 18 million articles (this figure reaches 50 million in the days prior to Christmas). The proportion of complaints received by the Ombudsman is therefore a small percentage of the total number of transactions undertaken by Australia Post.
Much of the reason for this can be attributed to the generally high level of service that Australia Post provides to its customers and its own effective handling of complaints by its Customer Contact Centres in each State.
The Ombudsman also praised the Australian Post complaint mechanism in its 2001-02 annual report. The report said that not only does the Ombudsman’s office believe that the number of complaints is small but it also believes that Australia Post has an effective complaints handling procedure. As a result, the Democrats could not see any particular reason to argue for the Australian Communications Authority to have an additional complaints mechanism for Australia Post and therefore rejected the bill last year.
The Postal Industry Ombudsman Bill 2004 currently before us is a very different kettle of fish. It is about ensuring that the postal services industry in its broader sense comes under the context of the ombudsman. One of the unique aspects of the bill—and I note the comments from the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan—is that this bill will apply the jurisdiction of the ombudsman to the private sector for the first time. Yet, unfortunately, as Senator Conroy has pointed out, in this bill only Australia Post is required to participate. Private postal operators will only register on a voluntary basis in the scheme. In addition, the postal industry ombudsman’s powers will not be as extensive as the powers of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. As a result, the Commonwealth Ombudsman will retain jurisdiction over Australia Post.
However, it is still a bit unclear—and it will develop over time—as to when and how complaints are to be dealt with by the Commonwealth Ombudsman or by the postal industry ombudsman’s office. I note the comment in the explanatory memorandum that the PIO’s powers have been customised for the investigation of service delivery complaints in relation to Australia Post but that it would be expected that over time the Commonwealth Ombudsman would end up using those powers primarily to investigate actions that were not related to the provision of postal services, which would come under the PIO. This concerns me a bit.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2005-03-07,"—I rise tonight to draw to the attention of the Senate the needs of the mentally ill, their families and mental health workers in Australia, and to discuss the need for a review of the funding and resource allocations nationally in the area of mental health through the establishment of a comprehensive parliamentary mental health inquiry. It needs to be a national inquiry because we are facing a national mental health crisis: statistics now indicate that one in five Australians will experience a mental illness at some stage in their lives and that almost every family in Australia will be touched directly by mental illness. With existing services poorly funded and under ever-increasing pressure, the mental health system is in crisis. The gap between the burden of mental illness in our society and the amount of funding being allocated is stark, and action needs to be taken.
Twenty-two years have passed since the Richmond report recommended moving people with mental illnesses out of psychiatric institutions and into the community. The state governments’ resulting programs of deinstitutionalisation were supposed to move people out of institutional care and into community homes with supervision and care, but the necessary state funding never followed the patients into the community. Brian Burdekin, former commissioner for human rights, has acknowledged that deinstitutionalisation has largely failed because not enough resources have been allocated to front-line services by state governments. This means that, despite applauding mental health plans, families are struggling to get access to services quickly when they need the support most.
While the Australian government funding for mental health increased by 128 per cent or $643 million between 1993 and 2002, the state governments have lagged behind appallingly, with a combined 40 per cent increase over the same period. State governments are spending less than $100 a year on mental health for every Australian. This is simply not good enough. It is the states that are constitutionally responsible for mental health and yet it is the federal government that is increasing funding and setting the agenda for mental health reform in this country.
Nationally, we are now in the early stages of the third national mental health plan, which will run from 2003 to 2008. It is a fine plan and it has been agreed to by the federal and all state and territory governments. This plan has received favourable international recognition, but there is no point having a fantastic plan if there is not enough money to implement it. Professor Ian Hickie, Executive Director of the Brain and Mind Institute at the University of Sydney, recently said that, despite having a world-best national policy for the past 12 years, Australia has failed to fund mental health adequately. Mental illness represents, according to Professor Hickie, 14 per cent of Australia’s disease burden but receives only 6.4 per cent of health funding.
It is for these reasons that it is necessary to examine properly the adequacy of mental health services in Australia. We need to understand the current level of resources directed to mental health, the allocation of these resources and the role that the states play in their delivery. We need to look at the division of responsibility between the Commonwealth and the states, whether the states are meeting their responsibilities to those who are suffering from mental health issues and all the aspects of how mental health services are delivered in this country. It is now time to try to determine how we can better manage mental health funding, resource allocation and service delivery.
I therefore have worked with other senators to establish a Senate select committee to inquire into mental health services. This committee will conduct a broad-ranging inquiry into mental health services right across Australia. The inquiry will investigate the lack of hospital and community care, chronic shortages in crisis services and the growing demand for care of the young, the homeless and people in custody. The establishment of this inquiry has been supported by mental health leaders, who acknowledge that the system is dramatically underfunded and underserviced. The chairman of beyondblue, the Hon. Jeff Kennett, has welcomed the inquiry and called for this inquiry to develop a blueprint for the future in terms of resourcing and funding. Like Mr Kennett, I am committed to ensuring that both individuals and organisations, particularly the professionals associated with treating those with mental illness and their families, have proper access to this inquiry. The Senate inquiry will also examine issues affecting Indigenous Australians, carers, children and people living in rural and regional areas. The over-representation of people with mental illnesses in prisons and the need for public education so as to remove any stigma will also be examined.
Like many developed countries, Australia needs to further integrate mental health services—not only into the community but also into the primary health care system. In particular, we need to balance resources and the disease burden of mental health. The states are clearly not delivering when it comes to allocating resources to those who are in need and those who support those people in need, such as GPs, nurses, social workers and other health care practitioners who are on the front line. Over the next eight years, from 2005 to 2013, the states need to bring into line the proportion of their health budget that goes to mental health so that it matches the proportion of the total disease burden that mental ill-health represents. In particular, we need to rebalance these resources.
The latest national mental health report states that, while Australia has made significant progress against the national reform agenda, there are many challenges still to be addressed. The number of mentally ill people who are committing suicide is rising, families do not have access to the services they so desperately need and state governments are simply not allocating the funds necessary to help people suffering from mental illness and to help those service providers on the front line.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Health: Mental Illness</title>,ADJOURNMENT,32,1
