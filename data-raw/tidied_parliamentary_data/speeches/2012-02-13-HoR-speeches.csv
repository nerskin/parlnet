Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (10:09):  On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, I present the committee's report entitled Second report: interactive and online gambling and gambling advertising; and Interactive Gambling and Broadcasting Amendment (Online Transactions and Other Measures) Bill 2011, incorporating additional comments, together with evidence received by the committee.


Online gambling is the fastest growing form of gambling in Australia. In fact Australians spend around $790 million each year playing overseas online casino-type games and around the same amount on sports betting in Australia, increasingly in the online format. Those involved are not your typical poker machine player or racetrack goer but rather younger people, particularly younger men.


The primary legislation covering online gambling in Australia is the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. The committee examined this legislation and found that it had been very effective in banning the provision of Australian based interactive gambling services to Australians. Consequently we agreed that the act should be retained and recommended a strengthening of its ban on certain advertising practices, such as 'practice' websites and offering inducements to gamble. However, committee members took different views on how to address the area where the IGA appears to be most deficient—that is, the ability of the IGA to limit or restrict Australians accessing overseas online gambling services.


Another key area covered by the committee's report was gambling advertising, particularly in association with sport. Gambling during sport has become normalised in Australia and the committee agreed there should be much stricter regulation in this area.


What was also evident during the inquiry was the significant community concern about the proliferation of advertising for sports betting services. Children in particular are being constantly bombarded with advertising for gambling during sporting programs and the committee heard alarming stories about children and young people now not talking about their team's form but instead talking about their team's odds.


Experts told the committee that the proliferation of advertising at sporting venues and during sporting broadcasts could be having an adverse impact on children who are vulnerable to such marketing—that it is contributing to what has been called the 'gamblification' of sport. In other words the abundance of gambling advertising during sport is normalising gambling for children.


While the committee welcomes the work already underway by government and industry to reduce and control the broadcasting of live odds, our report calls for a total ban on their promotion, underpinned by legislation. The committee has also recommended that the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 be amended to prohibit gambling advertising during times when children are likely to be watching, including all sporting broadcasts during those times.


The committee also examined the risk of match fixing and welcomes the current work underway through the Council of Australian Governments to develop the national policy on match fixing. We also looked at certain bet types such as 'in play' betting and exotic betting and recommended further research on the risks of such practices.


And finally the committee considered Senator Xenophon's Interactive Gambling and Broadcasting Amendment (Online Transactions and Other Measures) Bill 2011. While generally supportive of the intent of several proposals in the bill—for example, on advertising and match fixing—the committee formed the view that more work was required and the bill should not be passed in its present form.


The committee received a total of 78 submissions and heard from a wide variety of interested stakeholders during the inquiries. In response, 20 recommendations were made across three key areas: the provisions of the Commonwealth's Interactive Gambling Act, online sports betting and wagering services, and advertising for overseas and domestic online gambling sites.


These inquiries have been a valuable opportunity for the committee to learn about relatively new forms of gambling which are entering a period of rapid growth. This is timely because now is the time to learn the lessons from the liberalisation of other forms of gambling, such as poker machines, and to do all we can to reduce further harm.


I sincerely thank all those who submitted material and I thank the witnesses for their contributions. I want to also thank all committee members for their interest and participation in this inquiry and for their genuine spirit of cooperation. And in particular I want to thank the committee's secretariat staff—Ms Lyn Beverley, Ms Meg Banfield and Ms Katie Bird—who have done a very fine job over of a number of inquiries in sometimes difficult circumstances. I commend the report to the House.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (10:15):  I commend the Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform. He has often had to put up with trying circumstances, as I know the secretariat have. I second his commendation of their work. This inquiry into interactive and online gambling and gaming advertising was an important inquiry—it was all about bringing these issues, which have surreptitiously crept into our everyday lives, into this parliament for us to consider. We have noticed over the last 60 years or so the invasion of TV into homes—into living rooms, bedrooms and everywhere else in the modern household—but we are now seeing modern technologies spread themselves into our daily lives more and more. You only have to look at politicians and Twitter accounts and tablets and the like to know they are changing the nature of politics. Of course they are changing the nature of gambling, and that trend will accelerate. This parliament will have to be very aware of emerging technologies so we can legislate appropriately and not just chase the tail of the gambling monster, as it were.


The committee makes a number of important recommendations. The sooner recommendation No. 1, concerning the independent research institute, is implemented, the sooner the parliament will be in a much better position to assess the claims and counterclaims of proponents of reform and those who seek to avoid reform and avoid their increasing responsibilities as the providers of these services. Recommendation No. 9, which talks about a reduction in account verification from 21 days to 72 hours, protects children in particular and also generally the integrity of the industry. Recommendation No. 15 involves a total ban on the promotion of live odds at venues and during the broadcast of games. Much of the evidence given to the committee—and a lot of anecdotal evidence—is that people do not like going to the game and having gambling constantly shoved down their throats and therefore obviously down the throats of young people in attendance.


Recommendation No. 19 concerns prohibiting gambling advertising during children's viewing times. In this modern world we do not give children much time to have a childhood anymore. Kids grow up pretty fast and part of that process involves what they are exposed to on television. Over the last 15 years we have seen a liberalisation of standards and a willingness of broadcasters to push the envelope. Maybe that is because of competitive pressures and maybe it is because of self-regulation, but much of what children take in by watching TV is of concern to society, as it should be to this parliament. Recommendation No. 16 concerns a mandatory code of conduct for the advertising of wagering, including inducements to bet, credit betting, third-party commissions, harm minimisation messages on responsible gambling and having national consistent standards particularly in regard to logos on uniforms and the replication of guernseys, for example, for children which might have gambling logos on them. We want to have a mandatory code of conduct so that some of those more egregious things are taken out. This has inspired some government action, which is on the public record, and that is an important thing. 


It is important that the committee continue its work. This is a very interesting area of public policy, a very contested area of public policy, but I think we have added to the knowledge of this parliament and to the knowledge in the community of some of the issues that the community has to face. I commend the chair once again for his excellent conduct.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (10:32):  On behalf of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's report, entitled Inquiry into Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Bill 2011, incorporating additional comments together with evidence received by the committee.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr RIPOLL:
  On 22 September last year the House referred the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services an inquiry into the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Bill 2011. The committee's report was presented to the Speaker out of session on 2 December last year. As chair of that committee I am pleased now to be able to table the report here in the House. The bill furthers the government's commitment and good work, as well as the resolution of the Council of Australian Governments to introduce a national system of consumer credit regulation—something that has been due and waited for in this country for a very long time. COAG agreed that the new consumer credit system would address areas of concern with the operation of state and territory consumer credit laws and this bill does exactly that. It delivers on the commitment that Labor made to ensure that there was national, state and territorial consistency on consumer credit.


The bill proposes a new approach to the regulation of reverse mortgages, consumer leases and short-term lending, colloquially known as 'payday lending'. The bill also contains measures to assist borrowers to vary repayments under a credit contract in circumstances of financial hardship. In addition the bill introduces remedies for unfair and dishonest conduct on the part of creditors. The committee agrees that improvements are needed to address concerns with the regulation of these areas of consumer credit law and the government has worked hard to ensure that we have the best options put forward. The committee considers that the measures proposed further the objects of consumer protection and fully-informed market participation. However, in the course of the inquiry the committee identified areas where the operation of the proposed consumer credit laws could be further strengthened. To this end the committee has made 14 recommendations.


Much of the public debate regarding the bill has focused on the regulation of short-term loans in particular. It is to this matter that I draw the House's attention. The committee understands that the reforms are intended to balance consumer protection with the continued viability of the short-term lending sector, an industry which provides a valuable service to the community. The bill recognises that more can be done to protect consumers accessing short-term loans, but evidence presented to the committee was not conclusive that the measures proposed are the best means of securing necessary consumer protections while at the same time maintaining a viable short-term loan industry. The government has taken note of this and is working to ensure that we get the balance right between protecting consumers and making sure that an industry continues to survive. Accordingly, the committee recommends that the government undertake further consultation on the proposed regulation of short-term loans.


In conducting the inquiry, the committee received 53 submissions and it held one public hearing, during which the committee heard from 19 different organisations. I want to express my thanks for the good work of the committee secretariat and acknowledge the continuing hard work of all the committee members, and particularly the deputy chair, Senator Sue Boyce, and all of those who participated. 


This inquiry was important because it did look at a particular area of consumer credit that is controversial. There no question about that. People have differing views across differing jurisdictions, particularly when we refer to payday lending. Generally, it would be accepted by most people that it has a bad name and there certainly are some players in that sector of the market that do the wrong thing. That is less and less becoming the case, and with better regulation we will find we have a properly regulated, properly managed and professional sector that can provide a service for a gap in the market for people who find themselves in need of a short-term, small-amount loan. If it is done properly, if it is regulated properly and if consumer protections are in place, then both can coexist: consumers can have access to a service and access to credit and they can be protected against unscrupulous operators, and we will still have a viable sector. That was the intent of the committee of inquiry and of the work of all the committee members. I commend the report to the House.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (10:37): I am pleased to make some comments in relation to the presentation of the report on the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Bill 2011. The issue of so-called payday lending is a complex one. The very use of the term 'payday lending' suggests unattractive images of people being forced to turn to a lender who charges very high rates and the people needing to do so to cope with their cash-flow difficulties, being unable to get from one payday to the next without having to turn to lenders who are putting them in a difficult position. But, like many complex issues, the reality is somewhat different from that assumption which can be made.


The committee heard extensive evidence from a range of interested parties, including members of the short-term lending industry who described their business methods and their charges. We also learnt about the regulatory approach imposed by the disastrous New South Wales Labor government in its dying days, including a notional cap on the amount of interest that may be charged by short-term lenders. In fact, the way the formula works tends to overlook the reality. If you have a loan of a relatively small nominal amount, a few hundred dollars, but flat administrative charges which need to be incurred—charges dealing with such matters as credit assessment and so on—the application of a formula can lead to the charges being presumed to exceed that formulaic limit. That is really because the formula is simply not appropriate to deal with the reality that there are certain costs which need to be incurred and those costs tend not to vary whether the amount which is being lent is a few hundred dollars or a few thousand dollars.


We also heard from groups such as many of the consumer credit legal services around Australia. The coalition wants to commend the important work done by the people in those services. It is important and difficult work. Nevertheless, the coalition members of the committee are in agreement with the conclusion of the majority report that some of the provisions in the bill as it currently stands would have an undesirably deleterious impact on the short-term lending industry. They would make it more difficult for loans of relatively small amounts for short terms to be provided than is possible today. That would leave Australians who rely on this sector with fewer options to meet their needs for short-term finance. The committee process has been a constructive one as to understanding in some detail the business practices of the short-term lending sector.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:41):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I rise to make a statement concerning the committee’s inquiry into the incidence and prevention of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or FASD. FASD is the umbrella term for a spectrum of permanent intellectual disorders that are caused when a foetus is exposed to alcohol in the womb. FASDs do not discriminate and are not just an issue for Indigenous communities with high alcohol consumption. FASD is a hidden epidemic happening right now across Australia—it occurs in all our communities, regardless of socioeconomic or ethnic background.


You may have seen some people with FASD who have the telltale facial features. But many more FASD sufferers carry no physical indication of their intellectual impairment, which includes learning difficulties, low IQ, behavioural and socialising problems, organ damage, mental health issues, poor judgment and an inability to understand consequences or the difference between right and wrong, which can cause problems for young people post puberty. Many of these children will end up in the child protection system, separated from family members and moved from foster home to foster home.


The committee heard moving evidence from a foster father of five children, all with FASD, in Cairns on 31 January of this year. All MPs should read the Hansard transcript to get an idea of how some very dedicated people are struggling to care for kids with FASD without any training, support or financial assistance. There are people with FASD in every electorate in Australia, and they and their carers all need support but are unable to access it.


This is because, unlike the United States and Canada, Australia does not formally recognise FASD as a disability. Australia also lacks a nationally agreed diagnostic tool, and medical professionals are not educated adequately on FASD diagnosis and referral. The prevalence of FASD in Australia has not been ascertained yet. More awareness of the effects of alcohol on unborn babies needs to be promoted in all our communities, especially among young women and those at risk of alcohol abuse.


The best hope for children with FASD is early intervention, followed by comprehensive support services to manage their health, education, housing and employment. Yet, without recognition of FASD as a prescribed disability, people with FASD and their carers are unable to access disability pensions and community care services. Australians with FASD desperately need access to services that improve their life outcomes. For these reasons, the committee’s inquiry into FASD is an important one that builds on the work that FASD sentinels—families, health workers, foster carers, teachers, and Indigenous communities—have done to bring to our nation’s attention this debilitating but preventable affliction.


The committee will investigate effective prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of FASD in future generations. We will look at early intervention therapies that work for those recently born with FASD and at suitable management services which assist them to avoid unemployment, ill health, homelessness and/or involvement with the criminal justice system later in life. The anticipated outcome of our inquiry is a commitment by this parliament to develop a national strategy for intervention and the prevention and management of FASD. This strategy should include a nationwide public health campaign, early adoption of an appropriate national diagnostic tool and recognition of FASD as a disability, thus allowing carers to access disability support benefits. We encourage anyone who has professional or personal experience with FASD to make a submission to our inquiry. Information about the inquiry is available at www.aph.gov.au/FASD. We urge people to make contact now. We need your input. 


I look forward to contributions to this important inquiry, particularly from the member for Murray, who has been so passionate about this topic.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (10:46):  This is one of the most important inquiries we can run in our federal parliament,  given that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is the single largest and most commonly misdiagnosed cause of disability and, in particular, permanent intellectual impairment in the Australian community. At this point it attracts very little funding or support for those who have the condition or their carers. This inquiry is dealing with that need. I am sure it will be well received in a bipartisan way. One of the reasons I have helped to establish a parliamentary bipartisan group of like-minded members and senators is to help lift the cone of silence that has long paralysed Australia's recognition of and response to the damage that may occur to the brain and to other organs in the unborn where the mother consumes alcohol.


For the last 220 years, since the commencement of European settlement, Australia has glorified and elevated the status of the consumption of what we sometimes call grog or booze—beer, wine or spirits. Celebration of wins on our sporting fields and significant stages in people's lives such as births, weddings or funerals do not pass without raising a glass or drenching the victors in alcohol. It is part of our way of life. In our history we have had eras where rum was currency and we had a rum rebellion. That has made us colourful and macho, many think, and certainly we are not unique in the world in sanctioning heavy or regular drinking. 


In the last 40 years, Australian women and girls have stepped up to join the men and boys at the bar. Girls can drink as hard and as long as the boys. This means our children now run an even greater risk of permanent and incurable brain damage should a pregnant mother consume alcohol at a critical time in development of the foetus or should she drink throughout her pregnancy.


The tragedy is that many Australian women are not being informed of the dangers and risks of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Every survey conducted in Australia of women's knowledge about alcohol consumption during pregnancy shows a shocking majority have not been informed. This echoes the fact, backed up by recent WA Department of Health survey data, that health service professionals are also ignorant of the relationship between alcohol consumption and intellectual impairment or they choose not to talk about the relationship in order not to alarm the mother. We have private hospitals boasting of the wine menu accompanying their meals in maternity wards—it is one of their selling points. 


We lag behind other developed countries because we still do not mandate health warnings on alcohol containers, including warnings about the risks of consuming alcohol while pregnant. We lead the world in tobacco advertising and health warnings; we drag behind the world when it comes to highlighting the even more serious health impacts of alcohol consumption. This is why the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs has sought and received ministerial support to conduct this inquiry into the incidence and prevention of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. I commend the government for taking up this critical issue. I trust our final recommendations will be taken up and will help to make a real difference.


In the evidence we have taken so far, in Canberra, Cairns and Townsville, we have seen and heard about the lifelong and tragic consequences that are the result of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Carers, very often foster parents, have told of their desperate struggle to obtain support for their children or even an official diagnosis. We have also seen and heard about the champions who are Australian pioneers in researching this problem, in developing carer support networks, information and education courses, school supports and help for those caught up in the prison system. These champions are very thin on the ground. They are exhausted and many have very little emotional and physical energy left to continue. While countries like Canada and the USA have 40 years of support and diagnostic tools, therapy centres and clinics, some in Australia are still challenging the National Health and Medical Research Council's recommendation that no alcohol during pregnancy or breast feeding is the safest option.


This inquiry is extremely important. I want to thank the carer organisation NOFASARD for the use of their definition of FASD, which echoes the widely accepted international definition. FASD is an umbrella term which includes the abnormal facial features, growth delays, intellectual impairment, problems with learning, memory, attention and communication problems, vision or hearing impairments or damage to the skeleton or major organs of the body such as the heart and kidneys. Clearly this is a major problem which Australia must confront. I commend those already at work on this terrible problem.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:41):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I rise to make a statement concerning the committee’s inquiry into the incidence and prevention of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or FASD. FASD is the umbrella term for a spectrum of permanent intellectual disorders that are caused when a foetus is exposed to alcohol in the womb. FASDs do not discriminate and are not just an issue for Indigenous communities with high alcohol consumption. FASD is a hidden epidemic happening right now across Australia—it occurs in all our communities, regardless of socioeconomic or ethnic background.


You may have seen some people with FASD who have the telltale facial features. But many more FASD sufferers carry no physical indication of their intellectual impairment, which includes learning difficulties, low IQ, behavioural and socialising problems, organ damage, mental health issues, poor judgment and an inability to understand consequences or the difference between right and wrong, which can cause problems for young people post puberty. Many of these children will end up in the child protection system, separated from family members and moved from foster home to foster home.


The committee heard moving evidence from a foster father of five children, all with FASD, in Cairns on 31 January of this year. All MPs should read the Hansard transcript to get an idea of how some very dedicated people are struggling to care for kids with FASD without any training, support or financial assistance. There are people with FASD in every electorate in Australia, and they and their carers all need support but are unable to access it.


This is because, unlike the United States and Canada, Australia does not formally recognise FASD as a disability. Australia also lacks a nationally agreed diagnostic tool, and medical professionals are not educated adequately on FASD diagnosis and referral. The prevalence of FASD in Australia has not been ascertained yet.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-02-13,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:51):  It is with great pride that I present the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2012 and the explanatory memorandum. Today is the eve of Valentine's Day—a big day for love in the Australian parliament. We have here the first equal marriage bill ever to be introduced in this chamber. Last year, I successfully moved a motion calling on parliamentarians to consult their community about their views on marriage equality. We did that so that it could be understood in this place that outside views have moved on and that people in Australia want to see equality in our marriage laws. At the time I said:


Love knows no boundaries. Love knows no limits. And love knows when it has found its partner. There have been many attempts through history to limit love. All have failed. As we move further into the 21st century, I am confident that attempts to limit love will fail again and that full marriage equality will become a reality.


Today we are moving closer to that reality. This is an historic day for this parliament and the country. It is an important step forward for human rights. Today is a good day for those who believe in the power of love and the power of love to change things for the better. This bill will amend the Marriage Act to provide equality for same-sex couples. The bill would remove discrimination under the Marriage Act so that marriage, while still a union between two consenting adults, is not defined by gender.


I want to be clear about what this bill does and does not do. This bill does apply to all marriages but it will also make clear that private religious organisations will not be required to marry anyone they do not wish to. This will mean that those churches or religious organisations that are not yet ready to change will be able to move towards change in their own time and in their own way.


The Greens have worked long and hard to get us to the point that we are at now on the road to marriage equality. In 2009 my colleague Senator Sarah Hanson-Young introduced a similar bill into the Senate and it was sent to a Senate inquiry. That inquiry smashed Senate records, receiving more than 25,000 submissions, more than any other Senate inquiry ever has. It was clear that there was enormous community interest in the issue. In early 2010, the bill was put to a vote and defeated, but Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens vowed to keep campaigning for full equality, and that is what we have done.


As the campaign in the community has grown, we have kept the issue on the parliamentary and political agenda. The issue was a central concern in my successful election campaign in Melbourne. I think I was perhaps the only lower house candidate in the country elected on a platform where the issue was so central. During the campaign and subsequently I have had strong feedback and almost universal support for the Greens' stance on marriage equality. I have received several thousand emails on the issue and over nine in 10 have expressed support for marriage equality. In a survey that I conducted in my electorate of Melbourne in November of the year before last, marriage equality was one of the top priority issues for respondents and, of the 475 people who responded to the survey, only one respondent expressed opposition to equal marriage rights.


One of my first actions in parliament was to move a motion on the issue, and Senator Hanson-Young reintroduced her bill into the Senate. It is now subject to a Senate inquiry. Over the last two years we have become part of a widespread and deeply felt community campaign across this country, and opinion polls show clearly that Australia is ready for change. I am confident that it will not be long before marriage equality is achieved, because love builds bridges where there are none. Love thaws hearts and warms minds. Love is a powerful force for good and a force for change. I believe that it is love that has brought us to this place in this debate and it is love that will carry us over the threshold of discrimination and fear to full marriage equality.


It is important to know that the push for equal love is not just important for those who want to get married. It sends a powerful message to the boy in the country town struggling with his sexuality or the girl at high school who wants to take her partner to the school formal. It makes it clear to them, to their parents and to everyone around them that this parliament, the highest law-making body in the country, believes that their love is equal.


I note that another member also intends to introduce a bill into the House today on this matter. I have been asked a number of times about why there is not just one bill on the issue. I want to be absolutely clear that I and the Greens would like to see one single bill proceed through this place on this issue co-sponsored by members across the political spectrum. In fact, when I announced last year that I intended to introduce this bill, I sought co-sponsorship. And so Mr Wilkie, the Independent member for Denison, and I are co-sponsoring this bill. The recent addition of people to this debate who have not been following it for some time is welcome because the way that we are going to get this bill through this parliament is by changing people's minds. What we cannot do is seek to have any one party own this issue because, with the government and Labor divided on the issue, we will need members of goodwill from the coalition benches to get this through. That is why, if we are to have a successful chance at reform this year, we must proceed softly and carefully and aim to work together with members from all sides of the House, from all backgrounds. The worst thing we could do is bowl this up for a vote to make a political point only to have it defeated. I am hopeful that through that cooperation, through co-sponsorship from members from all across the chamber, we will progress the issue and we will see reform this year.


I am also concerned that, if we bowl it up for a vote prematurely, we may end up with the situation which some media reports have suggested, and that is a vote that fails and then a renewed push for civil unions. Let us be absolutely clear about the status of civil unions. They would entrench two tiers of citizenship in this country. We need to push for full equality.


I know there are many in the coalition who believe that an individual should have the right to do what they like in their private life so long as it does not impinge on someone else. That classic definition of liberalism should lead members of the coalition to support this bill, and I know there are many who already in their hearts wish to support it. We need to allow the Senate inquiry to continue and we need to allay some of the fears that exist about this issue. By doing that, it is my hope that over the coming months we will get more and more people on board. Last week members of the Washington state legislature, Republicans and Democrats, did exactly what we need to do in this House. They worked together to overcome partisanship and party allegiance to pass a law for marriage equality. If they can do it, we can do it too. It is not just there: many countries around the world have taken this step. If Catholic Spain can allow two people of the same sex to marry each other then I am confident that modern, tolerant, democratic Australia can do the same.


There have been times throughout history when the civil rights of a group of people have been violated, often with legal sanction. Many of those struggles continue. The struggle to end discrimination and for full equality did not begin with marriage equality and it will not end when it is achieved, but it is an important turning point for that struggle. 


Last year I referred in this place to the famous aphorism 'Love conquers all,' and I think we are showing the truth of that statement today. Love has brought us here and love will bring us through this impasse, because I believe the power of love will eventually bring this parliament into the 21st century, when we vote to make this bill law. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (11:35):  I move:




That this House agrees that should the 
Marriage Act 1961


be amended to allow for the marriage of same-sex couples, any such amendment should ensure that the Act imposes no obligation on any church or religious minister to perform such a marriage.



My support for marriage equality is well known. However, for me this issue is not simply to do with same-sex marriage. It is about equality that everyone, regardless of their gender, race, sexual preference or faith, should be treated the same under Australian law: in other words, that all people are equal and should be treated as such. It is no wonder then I believe that the current provision of the Marriage Act, that marriage can only be between a man and a woman, is in fact legislated discrimination.


While at all times I have tried to be very clear in my position, hopefully I have also been just as careful to respect the strong views of the many people who disagree with me, because it is a fact that time and time again I have spoken to people I have disagreed with and time and time again people have disagreed with me. That is fair enough, because marriage equality is indeed a polarising issue, for all sorts of reasons. This motion is not about telling people who are against same-sex marriage that they are wrong. Rather, it is about acknowledging that people have many and varied views on this topic and that the Australian parliament should respect those views.


To that end, this parliament should formally recognise again that in Australia the churches are private institutions and that consequently they and their officials must forever retain their right to refuse to marry anyone whom they do not wish to marry. There is nothing remarkable about this proposition, if only because throughout history churches have had differing views on whom they allow to marry. For instance, some churches would not allow a Catholic to marry a Protestant. Others would not allow divorcees to marry again. Some would even refuse a ceremony to those of different creeds or nationalities. While some such refusals would seem out of place in our modern society, the right was protected and churches were not forced to adhere to one rule of eligibility. In other words, their status as a private institution was protected—and rightly so.


It is my firm belief that as a parliament it is not our place to impinge upon free religious practices and beliefs. But as a parliament it is our responsibility to make laws in the best interests of our country and, in the second decade of the 21st century, it is simply not acceptable that as a parliament we are prepared to restrict marriage rights from a section of the population based only on their sexual preference.


When the parliament does tackle this great reform, I do not wish it to be hindered by an argument that we might be seeking to force churches to solemnise marriages they do not agree with. Therefore I am pleased to present this motion to the House. It is my hope that it articulates widespread public sentiment and will help progress the move to marriage equality, a move which is supported by over 60 per cent of the community, according to today's Galaxy poll.


Some people might be concerned that this motion deals with a hypothetical. In response I say that marriage equality is patently inevitable, as it should be, so the public interest is best served by us in this place ensuring that the legislation enacting such reform is carefully crafted to respect the rights and sensitivities of those who oppose it. This motion is simply to that end and I suggest it would be counterproductive for those who oppose marriage equality to oppose this motion.


To the Leader of the Opposition in particular, I say: please respect your party's rule giving all parliamentary members the right to follow their conscience every time they vote in this place. Even if the opposition opposes this motion, there is no reason whatsoever why any number of its members cannot still follow their conscience and support it. This should also be the case when Liberal Party members eventually pass judgment on the bills coming before parliament this week which seek to amend the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriage. I commend this motion to the House and strongly urge all of my parliamentary colleagues to lend it their support.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Is there a seconder for this motion?




Mr Bandt:
  I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.

Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (11:40):  This private member's motion relating to the Marriage Act is interesting, to say the least, because it is not just a hypothetical, as the mover has suggested, but also a contradiction. It asks us as a parliament to consider, in changed legislation, a guarantee that such and such an act will not be enforced. We have legislation which describes the contract of marriage—it is between a man and a woman, entered into voluntarily, to the exclusion of all others, for life. By definition, that does not include the marriage of same-sex couples.


But we are being told that we need to move into the 21st century and get out there with other nations around the world which have changed their legislation. We have legislation. If our legislation is not sacrosanct—to be changed only if necessary for the betterment of good government—then what is the qualification of legislation? Why should we take any notice of any legislation if we can, at the whim of a minority group, seek to change it? There seems to me to be something dreadfully illogical about referring to the sanctity of legislation and then, at the drop of a hat, wanting to change it. It just does not make sense. 


We are all embracing modernity today and GetUp! is considered to be one of the great modern institutions we should all be aware of the significance of. Yet they rate the importance of same-sex marriage and equality in marriage as 11th out of 12 issues. About 14 per cent of the population strongly support changing the Marriage Act while 18 per cent strongly oppose changing the Marriage Act. But what about that vast silent majority for whom this is not even on the radar? Why on earth must we rush headlong to change things simply for the sake of change? 


I find it dreadfully offensive that we are, as though we were all Independents, supposed to rush around plumbing the depths of public opinion to find another point of minority interest so that we can drag that minority group under our clutches. It does not make sense for good, honest, upright members of this chamber to be dragged into such a debate simply because the government of the day wishes to embrace these minorities in order to maintain their support in votes in this House. It is not only a contradiction; it is an affront to good government. We do not need to rush around willy-nilly, heading in different directions and plucking at things to support, when there are so many shameful goings-on being driven by this government as policy today.


I deplore this whole process of embracing and accepting these motions in this place today—and they are numerous. We have the one from the member for Melbourne, another one from the member for Denison and a contribution from the member for Throsby. I do not quite know—maybe he is just formally condoning this relationship between minority groups and the government of the day. Maybe they wish to add this contradiction to their long list of failures. There seems little sense to this other than change for the sake of change—change perhaps to take the scrutiny, the public heat, away from the government's failed policy and their untruths. Maybe that is the basis of the government having all these bills brought to the House by Independents. 


I do not believe that the population of this country want further nonsense from this government—they want a change of government. This would probably be one of the least important issues ever brought this House for the majority—and don't we aspire to govern for the majority? Don't we want good governance that will lead this nation forward to a brighter future, setting good, solid role models for the future of our children? This ought to be an honourable place and a place of permanence. It ought to have good legislation brought before it for good reasons. There is no good reason for the introduction of any of these bills and they ought to be voted down.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (11:45):  This is the third time I have spoken publicly on same-sex marriage. In August 2011, I reported back to parliament on the views of my constituents for and against same-sex marriage. Within Labor Party forums I have also spoken out in favour of changing our party platform. But this is the first time I have spoken in parliament since the Labor Party changed its national platform. That platform now reads:


Labor will amend the Marriage Act to ensure equal access to marriage under statute for all adult couples irrespective of sex who have a mutual commitment to a shared life.


The Labor Party platform also states that on this issue 'any decision reached is not binding on any member of the Party'.


I hope that over the coming months many members on both sides of this place will support a change to the Marriage Act to allow same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage is not about gay versus straight, conservative versus progressive, left versus right. It is about social justice, equality for individuals and the recognition and protection of fundamental political and civil rights. Throughout this great country, people watch Ellen DeGeneres and Erik van der Woodsen, Matt Lucas and John Barrowman, Jodie Foster and Stephen Fry; we listen to Elton John and KD Lang. Equality for same-sex couples is not unfamiliar to everyday Australians. Ce Ce of Hawker told me:


I have just heard you ""come out"" in support of marriage equality and I wanted to express my gratitude. My partner and I registered a civil partnership earlier this year—our society needs more civilisation—I still wait for the day that we might be married. There is something lacking in referring to my civil partner rather than to my wife. Please do not underestimate how much it means.


Warren and Grant of Aranda have been together for 27 years and believe marriage would be the ultimate legitimation of the equality of their relationship. As they told me:


Our marriage would not undermine heterosexual marriage—quite the opposite—our desire to be married reflects our deep respect for the institution of marriage.


Many of the opponents of same-sex marriage are devoutly religious. I respect their faith, but I say to them that it is possible to support marriage equality without undermining marriage, family or religion. Today, two-thirds of marriages in Australia are conducted by civil celebrants—a figure that is steadily rising. Same-sex marriage is supported by many religious leaders, including Lin Hatfield-Dodds, Reverend Bill Crews, Reverend Rowland Croucher, Reverend Matt Glover, Reverend Roger Munson and Father Dave Smith.


I say to my colleagues on the other side of the parliament that there is nothing in same-sex marriage that should offend Liberals and conservatives. Libertarians are among the most prominent advocates of same-sex marriage and, as British Prime Minister David Cameron has said:


Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I do not support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I'm a Conservative.


In 1967, my parents were married in New York. They celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary last Saturday. But if they had been of different races, there are 16 US states that would not have allowed them to get married in February 1967. It was not until June 1967 that the Supreme Court case of Loving v Virginia outlawed bans on miscegenation. These bans were thought natural—and some argued that they were supported by scripture. That matters today because, in the words of Mildred Loving in 2007:


… not a day goes by that I don't think of Richard and our love, our right to marry, and how much it meant to me to have that freedom to marry the person precious to me, even if others thought he was the ""wrong kind of person"" for me to marry. I believe all Americans, no matter their race, no matter their sex, no matter their sexual orientation, should have that same freedom to marry.


In closing, let me quote the words of former Washington state representative Betty Sue Morris. Washington is shortly to become the seventh US state to permit gay marriage. Ms Morris spoke of a vote she cast against same-sex marriage in 1996. She said that in December 1998 her daughter, Annie, had come home for Christmas and told her she was gay. In the days that followed Ms Morris said she remembered her vote and 'felt like she had denied her something. A wholeness. A freedom.' Former representative Morris told Frank Bruni of the New York Times:


Whenever someone opposes this, I always counsel: you never know. You never know when it will be your child or your grandchild. And you will eat your words.


I hope members of the House will support legislation to put in place same-sex marriage.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (11:50):  I rise to oppose this motion about amendments to the Marriage Act. A series of irrational and highly emotional arguments have been put forward on what is loosely termed same-sex marriage. I think that is a misnomer. Marriage is defined, in Australian law, as being between a man and a woman. That was set out in 2004 to clarify a situation that had been in existence in Australian law since 1961. This was done with the full support of the Labor Party, and this understanding has always existed in human history.


Today we have had this clash of Dead Poets Society with Pulp Fiction from the member for Melbourne, the member for Canberra and other members. They have tried to pretend there is unanimity of view that same-sex marriage is universal, supported and inevitable. It used to be death and taxes but now it is inevitable that there will be death, taxes and gay marriage. I do not think it is inevitable in our society. It has never been the case; it is a new and radical proposition. Instead of recognising that it is a new and radical proposition and coming to this place with an approach that is reasonable and measured and that brings the population along with it, the Greens and various Labor members, who are now free to express their views, are proposing something that is highly divisive and ignorant of the majority view around the world today.


We have heard that a procession of countries have enacted legislation in relation to gay marriage. In my research, I can only find 10 out of 200 countries that have enacted such legislation. We have heard about states in the United States, but let us be clear about this: in 30 out of 50 United States states where a referendum on this question has been held, the people said no. They said no in every single one of those 30 referendums where the question was put to the people. And that is the case in the more progressive California, which has been cited today in this place. The legislature there initially passed the laws granting same-sex marriage but then overturned them. In recent months, the French parliament rejected legislation for same-sex marriage. Indeed, in 2010 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that its member states were not obliged to recognise same-sex marriage on human rights grounds. It is a misnomer to suggest that there is a human rights issue.


There is an issue here in this motion before the House. As a liberal, I believe in the freedom of individuals in society. Individuals are the building blocks of society. We are fundamentally built as a group of families—individuals structure themselves into families. I believe that people have the right to associate with whomever they want. I believe civil unions should be recognised at law. I am perfectly willing to consider legislation in relation to civil unions; perfectly willing to consider removing any remaining discrimination. However, I am advised that in federal law there are no such examples, or very limited examples, of any discrimination against same-sex relationships or same-sex couples.


What are we talking about here? We are talking about a radical proposal to undermine a fundamental social institution that has been the basis of our society for thousands of years, an institution between a man and a woman for the reproduction of children which has formed the basic unit of our society. Why can't we recognise civil unions in our society today? Why can't we recognise that they should develop their own traditions and their own customs because they are a new institution? Why don't we retain the successful institution of marriage, which has been the bedrock of our society for so long and done so well for us? We should retain it, encourage it and promote it, as we always have, and of course allow at law the same situation to exist for same-sex couples, which is inevitably what we do at the moment.


Many states now have relationship registers. These could be expanded and I would support that. It would be a step in the right direction. Of course we should clarify any situation where there is discrimination against people, but marriage has been a particular societal institution and convention that has produced so much good and will continue to produce so much good.


This is an attack on the rights of all those who support marriage, and I believe they are a majority. I believe that a majority of Australians voted in the 2004, 2007 and 2010 elections for the position of both major political parties that there be no amendment to the Marriage Act. If the Labor Party is now proposing to change its position, of course it must put it to the people—something we know that it does not like to do. On this side of the House, the coalition have always had the right to exercise our conscience. We should exercise our conscience, and conscience tells us that the majority of Australians today do not support amending the Marriage Act and do support removing any remaining discrimination against same-sex couples.

On 9 February 2012, the Senate referred Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) to Senate committees for examination and report as part of additional estimates. Eight committees of the Senate will conduct wide-ranging scrutiny of executive government over the next four days. It was the view of the committee that it would unnecessarily duplicate the work of these Senate committees and possibly create confusion amongst witnesses if it attempted to undertake its own, concurrent examination.

The referral was done as a safeguard because we have unfortunately seen from this government's past form an increase in the debt ceiling that was pushed through as part of the appropriation bill. With Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4), the coalition was very aware of its responsibility to the Australian people to ensure that once again the government was not attempting to increase the debt ceiling through the use of these two pieces of legislation. That is the reason the referral took place. 


We on this side of the chamber will remain vigilant and steadfast in our opposition to the continued reckless spending of this government and to the lack of good control when it comes to debt and deficit. For that reason we will continue, where appropriate, to refer bills—even if they happen to duplicate some of the work the Senate is doing—if it means putting in place a safeguard to protect Australia's future and the Australian people from the reckless spending of the Labor government.

The bill amends the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, the Family Law Act 1975, the Federal Magistrates Act 1999, and the Judiciary Act 1903. It also makes consequential amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002.


The bill contains provisions to: enhance the Federal Court's powers concerning discovery; in all four federal courts, clarify the circumstances in which suppression and non-publications orders can be made, what information they can cover and what details they should contain; in all four federal courts, clarify the circumstances in which vexatious proceedings orders can be made and the kinds of orders that can be made; align the jurisdictional limit for matters heard by family law magistrates in Western Australia with that of the Federal Magistrates Court in other states and territories; and give the Administrative Appeals Tribunal more flexibility when dealing with the payment of fees.


The committee met on Thursday, 9 February to discuss the referral. The committee noted that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee is currently conducting a public inquiry into this bill and is receiving submissions. The Senate committee is due to report on 22 March 2012. The committee notes that seven submissions have already been received by the Senate committee. The committee supports the public consultation process that is being undertaken by the Senate.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (13:45):  I rise to express my concern at changes that the government has made to child care under the National Quality Framework. As of 1 January this year, childcare operators had to reduce their child-staff ratios from five to one to four to one. The impact of this has been to dramatically increase the cost of child care to families. For example, I have in my electorate a mother, Mrs Geeta Kulkarni, from Boronia, whose child attends the Magic Garden Childcare Centre in Ferntree Gully. She informs me that the new changes have led to a fee increase of 21 per cent, or $65 per week. She asks:


Why are we penalised for working hard and paying our taxes? The changes in staff-to-children ratios will not make a life-changing impact on my child. All of us were very happy with the care being provided before.


The government has introduced these new ratios for no discernible benefit. There is no research that says one to four is better than one to five and even if there is, why can't parents make their own decisions about the level of care they want?


If a parent like Mrs Kulkarni is happy with the quality of care, and if the childcare centre is happy to provide that level of quality, then what is the problem that the government is trying to fix? The government is making the cost of child care dramatically more expensive for everyday Australians and making it unaffordable for many, for little benefit. It should abandon this policy.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (13:59):  Mr Speaker, with your indulgence I wish to make a short statement. On Wednesday this week I will deliver to the House the annual Closing the Gap statement and we will have the opportunity then to speak extensively about progress made in reconciliation with Indigenous Australians. Today we are wearing a flower because it is the anniversary of the day that this parliament said sorry to the stolen generations. I believe we should mark the day that the apology was delivered. No-one who had the privilege of being in this House or listening to the apology beyond this House could have failed to be moved by the dignity of Kevin Rudd's words on that day. They were noble in their directness and moral clarity. It was a moment of grace in the life of our nation, and it gave us an insight into what a reconciled nation could look like.


This year the relevance and timeliness of the apology is more obvious than ever. We need the spirit of the apology to keep urging us on—on to the next step, which is constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians, and on to the next step, too, which is directing our focus always on closing the gap. We know in our own lives that matters of the spirit and practical matters are not divorced from each other; words of apology matter, and that apology mattered in the life of our nation and we mark its anniversary today.

Yes it certainly was the high point of the Rudd prime ministership and arguably it has been the high point of the current government. I want to cite, if I may, the words of the then Prime Minister, who said on that important day:


… unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong.


I think what Mr Rudd said on that day is very important and we should remember it. I do not think we should remember that day in a spirit of self-congratulation; we should remember it in a spirit of consciousness of the magnitude of the task yet to be achieved. We have to get the children to school, we have to get the adults to work, we have to ensure that there are police in remote and other Indigenous communities so that the ordinary laws of the land apply. Yes symbolic change does matter; yes constitutional recognition is a mission as yet unaccomplished for our country. But, in the end, it is practical change that the Aboriginal people of this country need and want, and that is the task to which we should dedicate ourselves.

I refer the Prime Minister, to whom this question is directed, to the government's own Treasury modelling that predicts that output in Australia's aluminium industry, which sustains some 10,000 families, will decrease by 61.7 per cent because of the carbon tax. Why is the Prime Minister introducing the world's biggest carbon tax when the government's own advice shows that it will destroy an industry, cost jobs and hurt struggling communities?

I had the opportunity earlier today to meet with some workers from Alcoa, who of course represented hundreds of others. I did that in association with their local members—with the members for Corio and Corangamite. Interestingly, those workers did not ask me the question that the Leader 
of the Opposition has posed today, because they understand what is driving change in the 
business
 that they work for. They understand with a great degree of sophistication what is driving change in the business that they work for. They understand that the high Australian dollar is making a big difference to their business—there is a big pressure on their shoulders. They understand, too, that we are seeing low prices around the world for aluminium. They understand, as well, that our economy generally is in a very different condition from the nations of Europe. Indeed, they volunteered that to me. Compared with the Leader of the Opposition's fear mongering—






Mr Abbott:



Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My question was about the government's deliberate policy to reduce output by 61.7 per cent in this industry—a deliberate 
policy
 of the government. She should be directly relevant to that question.






The SPEAKER:



I could rule that comment out of order because of the imputation and argument inherent in the use of the word 
'deliberate'
, but I will not. I ask the Prime Minister to focus on the specifics of the question.






Ms GILLARD:



Thank you, Mr Speaker. Whether you are referring to it as an imputation or not, the assertion in the Leader of the Opposition's point of order is wholly 
wrong
 and could not be further from the truth. We want to see an aluminium industry in this country, and we will continue to work with Alcoa and the aluminium industry to ensure that it does have a future in this country.





Opposition members interjecting
—





The SPEAKER:


Order! The Prime Minister will be heard in silence for the remainder of her answer.





Ms GILLARD:
  In order to ensure the industry has a future, you have to work through and understand the nature of the difficulties and problems. There is no point trying to make it up.



The SPEAKER:  And that includes the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition.




Ms GILLARD:
  I think the Leader of the Opposition should contemplate this fact: the average impact of the copper price on the aluminium sector—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will leave the House for one hour under the provisions of standing order 94(a). I have said that the Prime Minister will be heard in silence for the balance of her answer and she will be.



Ms Julie Bishop interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  No. The deputy leader will leave the chamber in accordance with the standing orders.




The member for Curtin then left the chamber.





Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask you to reconsider the ruling you have just made in asking the deputy leader to remove herself from the chamber. While you asked this side of the House to remain silent, you also asked the Prime Minister to be directly relevant to the question and she was defying your ruling.



The SPEAKER:  I asked the deputy leader to leave for one hour under the provisions of standing order 94(a) and she has. The Prime Minister has the call.





Ms GILLARD:
  The statistic I was seeking to share with the House was that the average impact of the carbon price on the aluminium sector is the equivalent of a one cent increase in the exchange rate with the US. I think that gives a sense of the order of magnitude here. What is pressing on the aluminium industry is having an exchange rate which is well above parity with the US dollar, when of course their business models were factored at a different parity price with the US at a different time in Australia's history when we routinely traded far below the US dollar. That is the truth and the Leader of the Opposition should understand— (Time expired)

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:14):  Mr Speaker, I move: 


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately:


That this House calls on the Prime Minister to explain why she has broken yet another commitment to the Australian people when she said that Labor was committed to maintaining the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and in particular why:


(1) the Prime Minister is forcing six million customers to drop or downgrade their private health insurance cover by forcing up premium costs;


(2) in the face of rising cost of living pressures, the Prime Minister is adding over 10 per cent to the cost of premiums;


(3) the Prime Minister is not telling the truth when she says that this is about targeting rich people when half of all people with private health insurance earn less than $50,000 per year and over three million earn less than $35,000 per year; 


(4) the Prime Minister is pretending that cuts to the private health insurance rebate will be good for the public health system when it will mean over 845,000 new procedures will be forced onto public hospital waiting lists that are already under pressure at a cost of $3.8 billion; and 


(5) the Prime Minister is playing the class war card in a desperate attempt to fix Budget black holes brought about by waste and mismanagement.


Standing orders must be suspended because nothing is more important than securing the integrity of government and nothing is more important than protecting Australian families from yet another Gillard government rip-off. This is a government, and this is a Prime Minister, which has broken commitment after commitment, and now another commitment is going down the drain. This is why standing orders have to be suspended. We have had a string of them. We have had the broken promise to the member for Denison and we have had the broken promise on gay marriage. We have had, notoriously, the broken promise on the carbon tax and now we have—this is why standing orders must be suspended—the broken promise on private health insurance. The former Prime Minister wrote just before the 2007 election: 


Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates. 


This is why standing orders must be suspended. The former Minister for Health and Ageing, before the 2007 election, said on many occasions: 


Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates. 


This is why standing orders must be suspended. Finally, the Prime Minister herself has said:


Your correspondent should have no concern that Labor will erode—  


mark that word— 


or abolish the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an ironclad guarantee of this on a number of occasions.


This is why standing orders need to be suspended. What is her excuse? Her excuse is, 'Oh, there was an election.' What she is trying to avoid is the fact that the government tried to break this commitment almost as soon as it was elected. This is why standing orders need to be suspended now.


In the last parliament there were some courageous Independents in the Senate who kept the government honest. I say—and this is why standing orders should be suspended—let the Independents in this parliament be just as honest as the Independents in the last parliament. That is the job of Independent members of parliament—to keep the government honest, not to allow the government to be dishonest. On the subject of Independents, I have a quote here describing the means testing of the private health insurance rebate as 'one of the most retrograde pieces of legislation that I have ever seen'. You might recognise that statement, Mr Speaker, because it is a statement of yours. This is why it is so important that standing orders should be suspended—so that the parliament can debate the importance of keeping governments honest and keeping families decently, not abusing them with yet another Gillard government rip-off. Standing orders ought to be suspended because the forgotten families of Australia have already suffered abundantly at the hands of this government. Look at the way prices have gone up since late 2007: power prices up 50 per cent, gas prices up 29 per cent, water prices up 46 per cent, health costs up 20 per cent, education costs up 24 per cent, rent 21 per cent, and we all know that interest rate rises under this government—and they are happening again—have added hundreds of dollars a month to the cost of mortgage repayments. And the carbon tax is coming. We all know the carbon tax is coming and that it will do such terrible damage to the families and industries of this country. And now yet another hit on the forgotten families of Australia. This is why standing orders must be suspended.


Two-and-a-half million people, who should have been able to believe this Prime Minister and this government, are to be ripped off. This parliament, and you included, Mr Speaker, has a heavy responsibility to keep this government honest. Every single member of this parliament has a responsibility to keep this government honest, to stop the 10 per cent rise in premiums that will take place if this goes through, to stop the hit on 3½ million people earning $35,000 a year or less, to stop the hit on the public hospital system that will have to do 845,000 more procedures as people abandon their private health insurance. It is a $3.8 billion hit on the public hospital system as a result of this Prime Minister's health tax.


This is why standing orders need to be suspended. We heard the Minister for Health in question time today talking about superclinics and nurses. Not a single dollar is going to be invested in the public health system as a result of this change. The reason why this government is slugging the families of Australia is that it will not tackle its own waste, because it is chronically incapable of tackling the waste, the mismanagement and the extravagance for which it has become a notorious byword. This is all about 'bodgying up' a surplus. That is what it is about. It is not about health. It is making up for the repeated waste, incompetence and dishonesty of this government. That is what it is all about.


What is at the heart of so much of what the government do? They hate people to succeed. That is why standing orders must be suspended. They hate success. They do not like people to succeed and, if people do succeed, they hit them. They hit them with the baby bonus means test that they promised was never going to happen but which happened. They hit them with the family tax benefit means test, which they said would never happen but which happened. They are hitting them, or about to hit them, with cuts to private schools. Mark my words; this is the next hit on the aspirational classes of Australia and it is coming like a steam train from this fundamentally dishonest and incompetent government.


Today—and this is why standing orders must be suspended—it is the private health insurance rebate promise that they are breaking. The politics of envy, the politics of the class war, belong back in the 1970s and the 1980s. Isn't it interesting that it should be trotted out again by this Prime Minister who, let's face it, when she is under pressure, goes back to her days as convenor of the Socialist Forum, the old Australian union of activists? She cannot help herself. That is what she comes out with whenever she is under pressure.


Make no mistake about this: this is just the beginning of the assault on private health insurance. This is just another foretaste of the assault on aspiration, of the assault on people who want to get ahead, that we will see from this government. This attack on the universality of the private health insurance rebate foreshadows—if the government's logic is to be believed—an attack on the universality of Medicare. That is what they will be calling 'middle class welfare' next. I predict that this Prime Minister will at some stage in the next few days come to the dispatch box and say, 'There will be no further changes to private health insurance under the government I lead.' She will be a liar if she says that. (Time expired)

",HoR,<title>MOTIONS</title>,<title>Prime Minister</title>,MOTIONS,19,1,speech
"Dutton, Peter, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (15:20):  I second this motion. If anybody needed any reassurance that this government is built on a lie, then they should look no further than this latest betrayal of the Australian people. This government went to the 2007 election saying to the Australian people that under no circumstances would it introduce this change. In question time today, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health tried to say to us that somehow they sought a mandate in 2010 for this change of position. But have a look at the time line and you get an understanding of the depth of betrayal that this government has undertaken on the Australian people.


This is a government that in February 2009 said to the Australian people that this rebate was not going to be modified at all. That was before the 2010 election, Minister Plibersek. This was not a mandate that you sought at the 2010 election. You went with a lie to the Australian people in the 2007 election and you betrayed that by the time of February, March, April and May of 2009. This is a government that did not seek a mandate for a change of policy in 2010. We should put a stop to that lie and that latest betrayal right here and right now.



The SPEAKER:  Order! I am uncomfortable with the use of the term 'lie'. The honourable member would assist the chair if he withdrew it.




Mr DUTTON:
  I withdraw, Mr Speaker. Their record speaks for itself. This is a Prime Minister who, as we said in question time today, made a commitment to the Australian people that this change—this so-called reform—would not be introduced. This is a government which has tried to portray private health insurance in this country as some sort of playground for the rich. When you look at the facts, however, nothing could be further from the truth. We know that in this country almost half the population has private health insurance. We know that, of those people, about five million are on incomes of less than $50,000 per annum. We know that a million people who have private health insurance are on incomes of less than $25,000 per year. These are people who will be affected by these changes.


This government goes around—and of course you cannot rely on any figures that they put into the public debate—saying that, of the 11 million Australians who have private health insurance, about 30,000 will drop out as a result of this change. Does anybody believe for a moment, knowing the track record of this government, that those numbers will hold up? You are going to rip $2 billion—or $2.4 billion, depending on their estimates—out of private health insurance in this country and somehow only 30,000 out of the 11 million people with private health insurance are going to withdraw. It is an absolute nonsense and I do not think anybody should believe those figures. 


The government's own insurer, Medibank, estimates that it alone will lose many thousands more than that figure of 30,000. HBF, the biggest provider in Western Australia, say that, just in WA, 208,000 people—or 23 per cent of their members—stand to lose all or part of their rebates. These people are not rich. These are people who are struggling with all of the cost-of-living pressures which have been heaped on them by the Labor government over the last four years. So, yes, this government has been coming into this place telling untruths about the figures—about how much impact there will be on the private health insurers and on those people with private health insurance in this country.


The other issue people need to be made aware of is that, when people flee private health insurance or when they downgrade their cover, those people are going to end up in the public system. We have a universal system in this country. People can turn up to a public hospital without charge to themselves—the taxpayer picks up the bill. Those people coming out of the private health system will put extra pressure on the public system. The people who are already waiting hours and hours in emergency departments right now will know that that situation is only going to get worse under this Prime Minister. 


I do not think that this government can be believed about the impact of this change over the short term, let alone the longer term. I think that is why standing orders need to be suspended—because this Prime Minister needs to come into this place and explain to the Australian people why she misled them at the last election and why she has continued to mislead them every day since.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:25):  The motion before the chair is yet again for a suspension of standing orders—the 38th time in the 43rd parliament that we have had question time disrupted in order to hear those opposite essentially have a dummy spit about the fact that they are still on that side of the House. Ever since August 2010 we have had the longest dummy spit in Australian political history. 


We should not suspend standing orders to accommodate such a dummy spit. We have important business before the House. In total, more than 10 question times have now been lost as a result of these suspension motions. Time after time, those opposite have moved these suspension motions without building any case whatsoever. In this particular case, the PHI legislation is actually before the parliament. So what they are saying is, 'Suspend standing orders and stop the debate on private health insurance so we can have a debate on private health insurance.' How absurd. For that reason alone we should reject this motion to suspend standing orders.


The Leader of the Opposition spoke about class war. This is a guy who has declared class war on working families on behalf of Clive Palmer and Gina Rinehart. This is an opposition which comes in here day after day to defend the entrenchment of privilege rather than promote the enhancement of opportunity. Day after day, issue after issue, you can see it. It comes from their guts—and I will come back to that term later. In their guts, they defend the entrenchment of privilege—because it is all about who they are, where they have come from and where they want to stay. They have a born-to-rule attitude, which is why we see these dummy spits time after time—always defending the top end of town.


I am not surprised they want to suspend standing orders rather than have question time. No matter what issue you look at, they are out of touch. Look at the issue of the banks. The shadow Treasurer had an absolute shocker last week and I would have thought it had to get better this week. But today he said, 'If the banks are under funding pressures, if you look at their funding profiles and if you speak to people in markets, you can get a feel for what is happening.' That is what he is saying today. He is out there defending the banks for putting up their interest rates last Friday. Over the weekend he was complaining, but today we get the opposite. 


That is the position that they have had. The shadow Treasurer, the shadow finance minister and the Leader of the Opposition have been all over the shop on all of these issues. And yet the Leader of the Opposition has the hide to come in here and speak about honesty and trust. Indeed the suspension motion they have moved here today would go to that. This is a guy who said, in a speech to the Sydney Institute:


One man's lie is another's judgment call.


That was his position on 5 June 2007. In September 2003, he told the Herald:


… there are some things the public has no particular right to know.


Of course we know that in May 2010 he said this:


… sometimes in the heat of discussion you go a little bit further than you would if it was an absolutely calm, considered, prepared, scripted remark. Which is one of the reasons why the statements that need to be taken absolutely as gospel truth are those carefully prepared, scripted remarks.


That is what he had to say, in his own words—do not believe him unless it is written down, unless it is scripted. 


There are some big debates before the nation—there is one about a return to surplus, and one about fairness and opportunity. Those opposite, who speak about truth, said during this debate that 3.5 million Australians earning under $35,000 a year would be impacted by the legislation before the House. They know that is not true. 




The SPEAKER:
  Order! I counsel the Leader of the House that the question before the chair is that the motion be agreed to. I draw him back to the motion to suspend the standing and sessional orders.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Indeed, Mr Speaker—the reason we should not suspend standing orders is that in order to receive no support as result of these changes a single person has to earn above $124,000 a year and for a couple it is $248,000 a year. If we do not have a suspension of standing orders, we can get all those facts out there, with the scare campaign ending. Those opposite do not want members of this House to have an opportunity to debate these issues in full, in substance, because they always lose debates of substance. Those opposite are just reduced to saying no to absolutely everything—unless it is something to help the big end of town, in which case they say, 'Yes; how high can we jump?' That is the position they take.


We have a debate here about manufacturing. There were two or three questions about the economy today before those opposite got back in the gutter, which is the place they are most comfortable. The facts are that between 1996 and 2007, under the former government, manufacturing's share of GDP fell from 11.5 to 9.4 per cent—nearly a fifth. Its share of total employment declined from 12.8 to 9.9 per cent—from one in eight workers to less than one in 10 workers. They would have you believe that companies seeking to go offshore is a new phenomenon, but the former Prime Minister was happy to open the offshoring of Australian jobs. At the opening of BlueScope Steel in Vietnam, on 20 November 2006, he said it was a happy occasion, he hoped the company did well and hoped it made lots of money, paid taxes, as it would, repatriated money back to Australia and employed lots of Vietnamese people. That is what he had to say when he was opening a facility that would take jobs offshore from Australia.




The SPEAKER:
 The Leader of the House will return to the substance of the motion.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Mr Speaker, those opposite want to suspend standing orders so they can have more yelling, more rhetoric—but not debate of issues of substance. They oppose absolutely everything, which is why they engage in this behaviour. Because of their $70 billion black hole, they will not even repeal the means test. They say we should suspend standing orders to debate these issues but they will not even regard the issue as significant enough to commit to repeal the changes that are in the legislation. They cannot, because if they did that the $70 billion black hole would just get bigger and bigger and bigger. That is why they are reduced to this negativity. That is why the opposition leader defined himself, when he became opposition leader, as follows:


The job of the opposition is to be an alternative, not an echo; to provide a choice, not a copy.


I thought to myself that that was a bit familiar. I know I have likened the Leader of the Opposition to Barry Goldwater, and Barry Goldwater said this when he announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination:


I will offer a choice, not an echo.


That was on 3 January 1964. The Leader of the Opposition has modelled himself on Barry Goldwater, which is why 'In your guts, you know he's nuts' is so appropriate for this Leader of the Opposition. 




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Leader will return to the motion under discussion.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Mr Speaker, he has modelled himself on Barry Goldwater because—




Mr Secker:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the House should withdraw that comment. It is totally unparliamentary to refer to people with mental health problems like that.




The SPEAKER:
  Would the honourable member state what he considers unparliamentary?




Mr Secker:
  Using the term he has, about being nuts.




The SPEAKER:
  It would immensely assist the chair if the Leader would withdraw.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Mr Speaker, I was just quoting Democrat Barry Goldwater, who he has modelled himself on.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Leader will withdraw.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I am not sure what I am withdrawing, Mr Speaker, but in deference to you I will withdraw.




The SPEAKER:
  The Leader will withdraw absolutely, without the words 'in deference to you'.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I withdraw, Mr Speaker. (Time expired)



The SPEAKER:  The question before the chair is that the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition for the suspension of standing and sessional orders be agreed to.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (15:51):  In continuing on from my remarks prior to question time, I note that this group of bills is another example of the government breaking its word given to the Australian people. I was talking before about some of the concerns we have locally about the pressures that are already on our existing health system and how these measures are going to make that situation worse. In the Courier-Mail last week there was an article about parents of children with ear, nose and throat problems and the concern that they are being told to consider paying for private treatment. This is despite living in one of the more disadvantaged areas of South-East Queensland. The article notes:


Doctors in Logan, south of Brisbane are at a loss to know where to refer children which have ear, nose and throat conditions for public treatment.


The article states that Logan Hospital, which is located in my electorate, has approximately 1,000 children waiting to be seen. What kind of a place are we creating for our children, particularly those from disadvantaged families who cannot afford private health insurance? And this legislation is not going to make that problem better. It is going to make it worse because it is going to push more people into the public sector. Private hospitals currently treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia. Medibank Private has predicted that some 37,000 members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. Over the next five years it is expected that approximately 1.6 million will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. How is the public system, which is already severely strained, going to cope with the increased costs and pressure? At the end of the day, this becomes a blatant, cost-shifting exercise to transfer responsibility from the Commonwealth to the state public health systems.


The Queensland government has long been struggling to provide sufficient support for their health services, and shifting the responsibility onto the existing resources and staff will result in complete disarray and possibly even tragedy. We do not want to see in hospitals an increase in the incidence of people not getting proper treatment or being left in hallways as they wait for beds. These are all things which could possibly be made worse in light of the current proposed legislation. In addition, upward pressure on insurance premiums will force people to reduce their levels of cover.


For example, in an article in the Albert & Logan News, dated 6 October 2010, a mother was quoted because she had spent some nine hours in the emergency room at Logan Hospital after suffering a miscarriage. She was angry and frustrated that nobody had sought to provide her with any assistance during that time. More recently, there was the headline in the Sunday Mail 'Left lying in own blood, patient claims' about failure to get treatment at Logan Hospital. All in all these are current examples of a system under enormous pressure. That pressure is only going to be made worse by pushing people from the private sector into the public sector.


In this debate it is important to note that our doctors, our nurses and associated health workers are going to bear the brunt of people's frustration, angst and anger. Yet these are the very people who already seek to do such a wonderful job in our community. It is well known that they work long hours under constant pressure. We should be doing everything we can to ease those pressures, not make them worse.


The federal Labor government promised that we would not face this legislation but, as we have discussed numerous times, they have broken this promise again and again. This is the third time that this has been debated in this House. Labor always purport to seek to help the most disadvantaged and underprivileged, yet over time we see the reverse. Their very policies actually hurt those that are most disadvantaged and underprivileged, not help them. Given the cost of private health insurance if premiums go up, the many low-income earners who do have their own private health insurance will bear the burden of the increased premiums because of fewer people being insured privately. I would like to highlight this point by quoting from an email that was recently send to me by one of my constituents. The email reads:


We are very concerned about the proposed means testing of the private health rebate. As it is, the funds have all been regularly increasing their costs and causing us to wonder how much longer we can keep up the payments. Although we will not be immediately affected as our income is below the levels reported, we most certainly are aware that there will be a mass exodus from the funds which will force them to increase their costs further in order to compensate, this will have a further flow on effect and will force us out of private health insurance, to which we have contributed for 35 years.


We note that Labor promised not to touch the subsidy before the 2007 election and regard this as another broken promise.


The email went on to say that they found the government's plot to sell the changes to private health insurance, as stopping the poor from subsidising the rich, as both insulting and dishonest. The authors of this email went to the effort of making some comparisons to support their view, and I would like to note some of their observations, an area that I touched on earlier. If you are earning an income of about $30,000 per annum you are paying about $5,000 per annum in tax and Medicare levy. If you are earning about $60,000 a year, you are paying about $12½ thousand and if you are earning about $90,000 a year, you are paying about $22½ thousand. So you can see that as your income increases you are contributing significantly more to general taxation and also through the Medicare levy. When you have a look in detail at the argument that the poor are subsidising the rich, you see that does not hold any water. It is time this government's ideological bent, of saying that the rich need to pay more for this and more for that and that the poor and needy are suffering, was put away. The politics of envy does no good as to the future of this nation whatsoever. We in the opposition oppose these measures for very good reasons, as I have outlined. Whilst the government seeks to promote this as a win-win solution, I see it as nothing more than a lose-lose one for the individuals and families living in my electorate and those around the country. We oppose this legislation.

Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (15:59):  I speak in support of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011. Together, these bills will proportionally lower the private health insurance rebate for those in higher income tiers and increase the Medicare levy surcharge for those on higher incomes who elect not to purchase private health insurance. Through these measures, the government is seeking to rebalance a range of policies supporting the private health insurance industry, as promised and taken to the 2010 election—a fact that many people in this chamber just recently have chosen to neglect. These new means-testing arrangements will make the private health insurance rebate fairer.


At the moment, more than 45 per cent of the Australian population is covered by some form of private hospital cover. This figure is at a 10-year high. In total, over 10.4 million Australians have private health insurance. Currently, consumers who purchase private health insurance receive a 30 per cent government rebate on the cost of the premium. This is not means tested. Those aged over 65 receive a 35 per cent rebate on their private health insurance costs and those over 70 receive a 40 per cent rebate. These rebates were introduced under the Howard Liberal government and the expenditure on the rebate has grown substantially over the last decade. In 2001-02, government expenditure on the private insurance rebate totalled $2.1 billion. In the 2010-11 financial year, the total expenditure on this rebate had increased to $4.7 billion. That is more than double the amount from 2001-02.


The 2010 Intergenerational report published on the Department of the Treasury website on 1 February that year states that the private health insurance rebate is the fastest-growing component of the Australian government's health expenditure and is forecast to increase by over 50 per cent in real terms per person over the period 2012-13 to 2022-23. The private health insurance rebate is the fastest-growing element of health expenditure and, if not capped, will cost the taxpayer $100 billion over the next 40 years. The fact that the fastest-growing element of health expenditure is not infrastructure, primary health care or pharmaceuticals but is the subsidising of private health insurance shows why these bills are so important.


In the 2009-10 budget, the government announced it would introduce measures to limit the growing cost of the private health insurance rebate. We tried twice to implement changes to the rebate during the last parliament, but the legislation was rejected both times by the Senate.


These bills create three tiers of support for private health insurance based progressively on the annual income of an individual or a family. For singles, there is no change unless a person earns over $83,000 per annum. Once they go over that, then the rebate reduces from 30 to 20 per cent. Going further up the income scale, once a single person earns over $96,000 per year, there is still a rebate, but it is reduced to 10 per cent.  Once they get to $129,000 per year, the rebate cuts out.


For families and couples, the bills propose that the cut-off amounts be doubled. Therefore, following that figure, the rebate for a family or couple is 20 per cent once their combined income exceeds $166,000 per year. Once that couple or family receives an income of more than $192,000 per year taxable income, the rebate is 10 per cent. There is no rebate beyond $258,000 annual taxable income. If there are children involved, then there is an extra $1500 in the threshold for each tier per child. For example, a family with two dependent children would have to earn a combined taxable income of over $169,000 before they lost the rebate. There is no change to the private health insurance rebate for those individuals earning below $83,000 as singles or $169,000 for two-child families. They retain the full rebate.


Nearly eight million policyholders will retain the full rebate on private health insurance. The important figure to remember, I think, in this debate is that nine out of 10 Australians will not be affected at all. With the average yearly wage for 2011-12 trending to around $68,790, the average wage earner will not be affected by these changes. Those opposite are suggesting that an administration assistant, an apprentice, a retail worker and maybe a teacher not only in my electorate of Deakin but right across the country should be subsidising those who have substantially more income than themselves.


I believe the current expenditure on the private health insurance rebate can and should be better allocated to other ways of supporting our health system. The big problem with private health insurance rebates is that this money, rather than being spent in our hospitals for everyone, goes into the pockets of consumers or purchasers of health insurance to subsidise that product. I think it is an inefficient way of supporting our health system.


The other problem with the rebate is that the more that is spent on private health insurance the bigger the subsidy received. So this rebate gives the biggest benefit to those on the highest incomes rather than the money being delivered directly to the health system. The rebate gives more money to those who are well off and less to those who take out basic policies.


Recent data shows that 45 per cent of the population have private health insurance, but this figure is higher for higher income households—for example, 91.3 per cent of couples earning between $240,000 and $300,000 a year have private health insurance. Those on low incomes have lower rates of health insurance—for example, only 25.6 per cent of singles earning less than $50,000 take out private health insurance. Proportionately more of this rebate, which is now costing $4.7 billion a year, is being paid to higher income households. The question that I have to ask—and I have asked it in this chamber before—is: 'Is welfare for the wealthy a good use of health funding dollars?' My answer is I do not think so. The other impact of this legislation is to increase the Medicare levy surcharge, increasing the penalty for those on higher incomes not taking out private health insurance. When the government lifted income thresholds for the Medicare levy surcharge in 2008 in order to apply indexation, the Liberal Party and the private health insurance industry ran around like headless chooks, warning that thousands of people would abandon their private cover. They said it would increase the number of people not purchasing private health insurance. They said it would increase demand for public hospital services as well as push up premiums for private health insurance. But these arguments have been proven wrong.


I remember speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill of 2008 in the last parliament and making the point that people should take out private health insurance if the product and service is good and relevant to the individual's or family's circumstances. As I have said, time has passed and the evidence is now in. A report by KPMG conducted after the introduction of the higher Medicare levy surcharge found that private hospital activity following the changes to the Medicare levy surcharge actually grew at a faster rate than public hospital activity, which also grew.


The facts are there. The current percentage of those taking out private health insurance is at a 10-year high. Treasury modelling estimates 99.7 per cent of people will keep their private health cover, with only about 27,000 people dropping out because of these proposed changes. This would lead to an increase of approximately 8,500 additional public hospital admissions over two years, which is an increase of around 0.1 per cent. This is a very small number indeed and is nothing like the fearmongering predictions that we hear so often from those opposite. These bills will reduce government subsidies for high-income earners and increase the penalty if they opt not to take out insurance. This ensures that most, but not all, high-income earners will still opt to stay in. Indexation will ensure that, over time, the tiers are raised as national incomes rise.


It is important to note that nearly eight million policy holders will not feel any difference at all. There will be no effect on the cost of hospital or general treatment policies because well over 99 per cent of people who have cover will retain their cover. Treasury analysis advises that the combination of reducing the subsidy while increasing the Medicare levy for those on higher incomes will ensure that policyholders retain their private health insurance. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association said that it:


… supports changes to the Medicare levy surcharge and private health insurance (PHI) rebates based on income. The Association has, for many years, known that the PHI rebate is not an effective mechanism to attract and retain members in the health funds. Not only is the mechanism itself ineffective, it is also an extremely inefficient use of taxpayer dollars …


These bills will help Australia get the best value for its health dollar as there is an urgent need to manage this rebate, which is the fastest growing health cost in the nation. I commend these bills to the House.

"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mrs GASH
 (Gilmore) (16:10):  You have got to hand it to the Labor Party. There seems to be no end to their creativity in spinning a good yarn. This bill seeks to cut $2.8 billion in private health subsidies, inevitably forcing more people onto the already strained public hospital waiting lists. And they title their bill the 'Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill', surely an oxymoron. Cutting health insurance rebates can only result in forcing more people onto the Medicare levy, resulting in longer hospital queues in Nowra and Milton hospitals. It is the only logical conclusion to draw. Private industry warned against this when Labor first tried to raise the subject under their former leader a couple of years ago. For example, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons on 12 May 2009 said the budget measure which cut rebates would 'inevitably drive some Australians out of the private health system, placing even greater strain on Australia's public hospitals'. The Australian Medical Association, on the same day, said:


…  if you don't keep your private health insurance, you'll be slugged with an increased Medicare Levy surcharge. They get you both ways.


I could not agree more, and this bill confirms exactly what the two major medical associations were warning us about.


This government has never been a fan of private health insurance, despite the success in easing the pressure off the perpetually struggling public hospital system. This bill is just the latest step in Labor's campaign of dogma. Certainly no lessons were learned through its previous experience in 2009 or through industry advice saying, 'Don't do it,' or, most importantly of all, the chaotic health and hospital systems, which we are still experiencing.


When I was reading the explanatory memorandum to the bill, I could not help thinking that the $1.7 billion in cost overruns and waste remediation for the pink batts fiasco could have paid for the subsidy cuts the government is now proposing. When you add the other amounts that have been wasted, there should have been no need to go down this path at all. No wonder Australians, especially in Gilmore, are angry. They cannot see the justification for this to happen. The government has shown no remorse for generating so much waste through its own incompetence, yet it has no hesitation in slugging the taxpayer when it wants. Gilmore has one of the lowest socioeconomic demographics in Australia and I am astounded the government continues to deny the impact this policy will have on the public hospital system in regions like Gilmore. Many families make significant sacrifices so they can take out private health cover, yet here we are again, under this government, penalising those who would benefit most. There is no gain to be had, only pain.


Then, as if to compound this stupidity, the government want to impose another tax by increasing the Medicare levy on some of the soon-to-be-disenfranchised health insurance subscribers. This latest variation will see a three-tier system of subsidies, starting at $80,000-odd per annum for a single subscriber. The first tier get a 10 per cent cut to their subsidy and their Medicare levy will not go up—at least, not yet. The next tier get a 20 per cent cut but their levy goes up. The third tier get no subsidy and their levy goes up even more. Any incentive is deleted.


I note that Treasury estimates that around 25,000 individuals are predicted to opt out, and in some circles that appears to be a conservative guess. In the Senate hearing earlier this year, Medibank Private admitted no research was done as to the likely impact, but they did some internal modelling. That is another way of saying 'an educated guess'. The upshot is that the government does not really know what the impact will be but is keeping its fingers crossed. I have no doubt that this will be just the tip of the iceberg as other cost pressures encouraged by the government start to sink in. With unemployment predicted to rise by another 100,000 in the next 12 months and daily living expenses just going through the roof, it does not take a genius to predict that many households will be cutting a lot of their spending. In fact, they already have, with cost-of-living pressures and, still to come, the carbon tax. This latest venture will only add to that pressure. So, in a way, Labor will get its wish to destroy private health insurance, not through careful planning but through a combination of incompetence, ineptitude and dogma.


But this latest move by the government is hardly a surprise. They were opposed to the scheme when the coalition introduced it and, with the Greens calling the shots, they are determined to remove it completely. I am amused by the inclusion of the word 'fairer' in the title of the bill. This is not a recent innovation, because they tried this on with their Fair Work Act, which is anything but fair. I think that has been demonstrated well and truly. Perhaps they will now turn to their latest slogan: 'a painful adjustment.'


Next, instead of eradicating the subsidy in one fell swoop, as they said they would, this is going to be the death of a thousand cuts. Nobody should be under the illusion that this bill tells us where it will stop; it is just the next step in a series of steps, because the government have not recanted their determination to get rid of this scheme. It might just take a little longer.


I recall a press release issued by the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, on 26 September 2007, when she was occupying the shadow portfolio. I seek leave to table the press release.


Leave not granted. 




Mrs GASH:
  I am not surprised leave has not been granted, because this press release actually states the truth. The shadow minister was unequivocal in her assurances. In fact, it was a promise. In part, this is what she said:


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


… Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge and other components of the existing private health insurance incentive scheme.


It is now abundantly clear that the words were carefully crafted. The shadow minister did not say that they would not change the qualifying criteria, which they are now attempting to do—another broken promise. It seems to me that Labor, to quote Nicola Roxon's own words from the very same press release, will do anything and say anything to get elected. They were not going to cut the private health insurance rebates—at least, that is what they tried to imply. That was before they were elected. Now Labor have been elected, $2.8 billion worth of cuts are going to be made—another lie, another broken promise. 


If that is not enough, in a letter to Dr Michael Armitage, the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, the then federal Labor leader, Kevin Rudd, in a letter dated 20 November 2007, wrote:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.


Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases.


I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the House that this statement came from the former Labor leader, Mr Rudd.


By their words, they stand condemned. What utter deceit. The government cannot be trusted to tell the truth and they cannot be trusted to do the right thing. And they certainly cannot be relied upon to get things right. The more the Prime Minister talks about going forward, the more we are slipping backwards.


 According to a report in the Australian Financial Review, dated Wednesday, 17 August last year, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council showed that Australia had reached its highest rate of private hospital insurance participation in more than 10 years: in the three months to June 2011, 87,381 people signed up for private health cover. That is what the rebate sought to do when it was introduced. It was an incentive to reduce reliance on the public hospital system by encouraging people to take out private health insurance. It has been an outstanding success, yet this government wants to sabotage that success and trap us in a public hospital system that is groaning under demands that are not being met.


Labor's promise to take over the hospital system has fallen by the wayside and has been diluted to an agreement to share funding—and then only for future growth. How will that work? Another broken promise, but I think it is more a case of Labor confusing their ambitions with their capabilities. This has been the recent pattern of the Prime Minister, making sugary promises on the run and not following through. How many so-called policy announcements have languished after the initial press statement? Making a shallow statement, disguised as a policy announcement is easy. Labor have done it hundreds of times. The challenge for Labor is following through, and that is where they have been found wanting.


Deloitte released a report titled Economic impact assessment of the proposed reforms to private health insurance. I wonder whether the word 'reforms' accurately describes what this government is trying to do, because this proposal is a retrograde step. Deloitte describes the reaction to these proposed changes as significant, not in a good way but with a negative consequence. This is what Deloitte concluded:


In time, it is expected that the cost of servicing increased demand for public hospital services will outweigh the savings to government from the means testing of the rebate.


On this basis, how can anyone in their right mind support this legislation? And that statement comes from an independent and credible body, external to the political process.


 I am not surprised that the Independents have indicated their reluctance to support the changes, as has been reported in the Fin Review. At the back of all this, I have to wonder about this strategy to force people back into public hospitals being pursued at the same time as the government is building superclinics to ease the existing strain on public hospitals. Is it in fact a sly ploy to get people into the yet-to-be-constructed superclinics? And what of the government's plan to ease the demand on public hospital waiting lists by utilising private hospitals? How is this going to work?


This legislation has to be viewed in the context of the health reform announcement, made on 2 August last year. Key changes will not be implemented until at least 2014-15, seven years after Labor first promised to fix public hospitals. They also promised that, if needed, they would hold a referendum to take them over. The core promise of Labor's health reforms was that the Commonwealth would become the dominant funder of 60 per cent of hospital costs. That promise has since been scrapped. Its substitute, the supposed increase to 50 per cent growth funding of hospital services will not occur until 2017. That is at least two elections away and with no explanation as to how it is to be funded. A definition of an efficient price of hospital services has yet to be determined, and further negotiations may even be required on the scope of services eligible for Commonwealth funding.


Kevin Rudd said that, on health, the buck would stop with him. Julia Gillard says that the states will be in charge. Julia Gillard has broken Labor's promise on elective surgery guarantees. Patients in category 1 who had waited the clinically recommended time were promised that they would have their surgery in five days. Patients in category 2 would have surgery in 15 days and patients in category 3 would have surgery in 45 days. What are the chances?


The new national elective surgery targets will not be fully implemented until 2016, with reward funding now paid in advance to state governments and no guarantees for patients. The national emergency access target for patients to be admitted or discharged within four hours has been watered down from 95 per cent of emergency department patients to 90 per cent, and will not be fully implemented until 2015. Labor will spend hundreds of millions of dollars this year establishing the National Health Performance Authority, the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, Medicare Locals and the National Funding Authority. None of this is good news for Gilmore. The superclinic in Shoalhaven, promised by Labor to be up and running by Christmas last year, is not due to commence for perhaps another two years, and even that has a revised forecast that is optimistic. Shoalhaven Hospital is struggling and Milton-Ulladulla Hospital is virtually a second-level operation where some of the services have been cut.


This legislation is a square peg in a round hole. It is a retrograde step. It breaks more promises and it will only compound an already difficult situation. It is not something we need and it is certainly not something we deserve. I cannot for the life of me see any sense in this, and I can see even less in a government that is determined to have its own way despite the cost to the community. I do not support this legislation and I do not trust a government with a proven track record of cunning, deceit and rank stupidity. The Australian people deserve better.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (16:24):  In my remarks today on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 it is my intention to talk a little bit about the historical context in which we find ourselves, particularly with regard to matters of promises, which many other speakers have talked about, and health reform, even though I would say that this bill has nothing at all to do with health reform; this is the budgetary bill.


When we think back to the 2007 election campaign—and I think almost all members in the chamber fought that election campaign—we remember clearly what took place. Some of the things that the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd—whether that title will apply to him again in the next few weeks I do not know—talked about was the end of the blame game, how there was going to be resolution of the conflict between the states and the Commonwealth, how everybody would start to get along better, how there would be great strides forward on health care and how, as was promised, if there was no resolution then there would be a Commonwealth takeover of public hospitals. That was very much part of the 2007 campaign, and it obviously gave the current government and the former prime minister a great deal of momentum. When you go to the front door of anyone's house and say, generically, 'What are your issues?' the default issues are without doubt health and education. Everyone says, 'Let's fix the health system.' So when that imagery was created by the Labor Party before the 2007 election—ending the blame game and fixing up the health system—everybody wanted to believe it, and I think it worked very well for Labor.


Within that context, an aspect of that campaign was the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd—now former Prime Minister and current foreign minister—using a 'younger John Howard' image. As part of that, Mr Rudd and his then shadow health minister, Julia Gillard, were very careful in their addressing of concerns within the health industry and the private health industry. That leads us, as others have alluded, to the letter written by the former federal Labor leader and member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, dated 20 November 2007, just shortly before the election. In this letter he was very clear on the matter of retaining the existing private health insurance rebate.


We talked in that election campaign about the fact that Labor was out to get the private health insurance rebate. They were going to make changes to it and we knew the consequences of that. At the time the Howard government was elected in 1996, we were in the situation where the proportion of Australians that were a part of the private health system was down to something like 33 or 34 per cent. Through the measures the Howard government put together that was elevated to something like 45 per cent, which took pressure off the public hospital system. In Cowan, some 75 per cent of residents in my electorate are covered under the private health insurance arrangements.


However, as I said, it was very clear that the image, the claim or, you might say, the promise that was put out there by Labor before that 2007 election campaign was that there would be no change. As a result the private health industry was fairly quiet on the matter and it did not choose to highlight any further concerns to the people of Australia, and that was another aspect that helped the Labor Party win government in 2007. This matter was addressed quite significantly in question time today, and the point was made by the current Prime Minister that the promises that were made about the private health insurance rebate were pre-2007 election, the point being that promise was made two elections ago. I note as well that the member for Dickson very clearly made the point when we approached the 2010 campaign that comments were on the record which indicated to Australians that there would be no changes to the arrangements for the private health insurance rebate. So the reality is—and I will move further into this bill soon—that the view and the perspective that was given to the Australian people was that their health insurance rebate was not going to be touched. How truly wrong that was.


It is important for me to say that the former minister for health is on the record as saying: 


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor—


this was before the 2007 election—


has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


As I have said, the letter from the Hon. Kevin Rudd to the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Insurance Association, Dr Michael Armitage, again very clearly states that federal Labor was committed to the private health insurance rebates. Unfortunately, as is so often the case in the last four-plus years, what is promised before an election bears little relationship to what takes place after the election. Yet we cannot blame the Greens for any of this of course! The socialist to communist fringe of Australian politics have always been complete and utter socialists. Their view of the world is that anyone who has done well in their life must only have done so due to the sweat of somebody else. So they are fully behind the redistribution of wealth and there are plenty in the government who probably subscribe to a similar view.


When we look at private health insurance circumstances we know that there are 10.2 million Australians who currently have private health insurance for hospital treatment. As I said before, 75 per cent of my electorate of Cowan—some 95,000 voters, citizens over 18, and their families—all believe that they want to make sacrifices in their lives in order to be able to afford private health insurance so that they will have choice in the future. A lot of people might say, and obviously it is also the government's view, that anyone on more than $80,000 a year and any family on more than $180,000 a year must be wealthy. But that is not the whole story, and I will go through that a little bit further. It is certainly the case that 75 per cent of my constituents are within the private health insurance arrangements. In fact, back in August last year we received letters from almost 2,000 of our local residents asking for the retention of the current private health insurance rebate. Residents such as Ken Roberts, Sarah Harris, Lee Davis and Barbara Brown, to name four of those almost 2,000, simply cannot understand why the Labor government is out to cut the private health insurance rebate. They see it as an attack on the hard-working and aspirational people of this country.


In just the last day or so I received an email from my constituent Mark Paulton. I will read into the record what he says:


We are a modest family of 3 with an income just over a gross income of around 180k pa. This is modest really when in context of Perth and the mining boom as you can appreciate.


Since labour have been in power I have seen appreciation for the working family dwindle and really encouragement now goes to those who aren't striving to better their income levels and raise themselves without support of the state. For example here are things that labour has introduced that has directly affected me and my family due this government thinking that a family earning over $150,000 is classed as a millionaire in their view:


1. Means testing of a family Tax Benefit A and B, Child Care Benefit and Baby Bonus … Loss of around $3500 pa


2. Flood Levy introduced … $1000


3. Means Test of Rudds stimulus package so not applicable to our income level … $1000


4. Carbon Tax Introduced $2500pa


5. No change to recent income tax threshold in line with inflation … $1000pa


6. Changes to Medicare and Obstricians fees for using their services … $2500


And now


… The loss and means test of the PHI rebate …$1000pa.


Consideration of not just the PHI rebate means test, it should be considered with all the other changes this government has done and this extra change not only is a burden in its own right, it's compounded by the fact that one has been levied on just purely because we are perceived to be millionaires. The total of the above is around $12,500 in changes that makes us worse off since labour came to office.


Is it any wonder that retailers are feeling it tough as well.


When you have 75 per cent of the people in Cowan concerned about this sort of issue, is it any wonder then that so many people in my electorate are concerned? When Deloittes did the analysis on the impact of the legislation it showed that they expected 175,000 people to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 to downgrade their cover. The AMA shares that sort of viewpoint as well. The health insurance sector predicts that another 730,000 are likely to downgrade their hospital cover and 775,000 are likely to drop from ancillary altogether. Even the government's own Medibank Private has estimated that 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade their cover. That is thousands more than the government estimates will abandon private health insurance due to this bill—due to these measures that the government is trying to introduce today. One private insurance company is saying that they alone will lose more people to private health insurance than the government estimates will happen across the whole country. I ask everyone in this place: who do they think is accurate on these matters?


One of the specific points that has been made about private health insurance and these plans to take the rebate away from so many people relates to the pool base for private health insurance. The reality is that with each person that drops out of private health insurance the pool base gets smaller and smaller. Even if Medibank Private is the only insurer that loses people—which is not necessarily going to be the case—37,000 people will no longer be part of that pool base. All those people that the government claims it is trying to protect will also see their insurance premiums rise as the health insurance companies will have to try to make ends meet whilst continuing to provide services from a reduced number of insurance policyholders.


This legislation does represent a huge knock for those hardworking Australians who want to share the cost of the provision of their own health services—those people who believe that society does not owe them and that they should pay their own way where they can. They are just asking for that little bit of help so that they can take pressure off the public hospital system. I do not think it is too much to ask, particularly for those that pay the majority of the income tax in this country, that they should get that little bit of support. These are people that have been making sure that they are doing the right thing for this country as well as looking after themselves first and foremost and it is not wrong for them to get just that little bit of support.

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (16:39): I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and the two cognate bills that are before the House. This is not the first time that these bills have been seen in this place. The same set of bills has been defeated by the Senate on two separate occasions, but this Labor government is now at it again for a third time. This of course is no surprise: if we have learnt one thing about the Labor government it is that it will never let a little thing like a mandate, or the will of the people, get in the way of it fulfilling its own agenda.


These bills aim to reduce the incentives for Australians to take up private health insurance by slashing the 30 per cent rebate and increasing the Medicare levy surcharge for those without insurance, according to income thresholds. Those earning over $80,001 will have to either receive a reduced rate of 20 per cent or pay a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge. People earning over $93,001 will either receive a rebate of just 10 per cent or pay a 1.25 per cent surcharge, whilst those who earn over $124,001 will no longer receive any private health insurance rebate and will face a Medicare levy surcharge of 1.5 per cent.


This government has selective amnesia when it comes to this issue. In 2007, then Leader of the Opposition Rudd gave assurances to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Health Insurance Association, the Hon. Michael Armitage, that federal Labor would not make any changes to the private health insurance rebate.


A young professional in the seat of Macquarie earning $95,000 per year with a $1,500 per annum health insurance policy will see his rebate slashed from 30 per cent to 10 per cent or in real dollar terms from about $450 to $150. That equates to this person being $300 a year worse off. If they do not have private health insurance, their Medicare levy surcharge will rise from $950 to $1,187.50 and they will be $237.50 a year worse off. Put simply, they are damned if they do and damned if they don't. This is another example of Labor trying to hurt everyday Australians—young families, senior citizens and small business owners who are already struggling to make ends meet as the cost of electricity and other vital items continues to rise. If passed, these bills will add to the ever-increasing cost-of-living burden being felt by people across the electorate of Macquarie.


When in government the coalition implemented incentives which saw a 10 per cent increase in the number of Australians who use private health insurance. Thanks to these incentives we now see around 45 per cent of Australians using one form or another of private health cover. Increased patronage of private health insurance is a vital part of ensuring greater access to health services for everyone.


Public hospitals all over the nation struggle to keep up with the demand. This is not a reflection on the hardworking doctors and nurses who work in public hospitals and are valued members of our community but a reflection on the demand that is currently placed on our health system. Private health insurance assists public hospitals by giving those who can afford it the opportunity to receive private care, which assists by easing pressure on hospital waiting lists. Reducing the rebate will increase the cost burden of private health insurance on mums, dads and self-funded retirees who are already struggling with price hikes. This will leave many with no choice but to drop their private health insurance altogether, whilst forcing others to downgrade to cheaper policies. This was highlighted by a telephone survey conducted by ANOP Research. They found that, if this bill was passed, 11 per cent of those surveyed would drop their hospital cover and a further 24 per cent would downgrade it. This would not only provide them with less cover but in turn place a great deal of pressure on our public hospitals and other health services.


The government's own figures show that around 27,000 people would be forced to drop their private health cover. This would result in an extra 8,500 public hospital admissions, as those previously covered by private health insurance returned to the public hospital system. These figures tell us that the Labor government fails to understand the impact that this bill will have on these 27,000 individuals across the nation—families, students and self-funded retirees who through no fault of their own will be worse off. During Senate estimates hearings, the leading insurer Medibank Private said that according to its own internal modelling about 37,000 of its members would be expected to drop their cover with an additional 92,000 expected to downgrade their policies if this bill were to pass. Medibank's figures suggest that under this bill 10,000 more Australians will be forced to drop private health insurance than the government has suggested. However, Medibank is talking about only their customer base, whilst the government is talking about the entire nation.


To see how the government's national figures stack up, look at the Deloitte report entitled Economic impact assessment of the proposed reforms to private health insurance, commissioned by the Australian Health Insurance Association. This report estimates that, over the first year, 175,000 people will drop their private health insurance and 538,000 people will have to downgrade their policies. We have the government saying 27,000 and a report by Deloitte claiming 175,000. So who can we trust? Who is more believable? The government that brought us the pink batts disaster, the 'building the entertainment revolution' through the set-top box scheme, the ludicrous cash-for-clunkers idea and, for an encore, wants to bring in a carbon tax? Or a company like Deloitte which, since its foundation in 1845 has been regarded as one of the world's largest companies when it comes to professional services?


The Deloitte report also found that this bill, which has been rejected twice by the Senate over five years, will cause the number of those dropping their cover to increase to 1.6 million consumers, while a further 4.3 million will downgrade their policies. Additionally, 2.8 million Australians would drop their general cover, which includes ancillary services such as dental. It found that because of this severe impact on the health insurance market, private health insurance premiums would rise significantly. The rise would be a staggering 10 per cent more than would otherwise be expected, making private health insurance even more unaffordable for those struggling against surging cost-of-living pressures. The report went on to show that this would have a significant impact on the public health system, with public hospitals having to treat a significantly higher number of patients as people withdrew from private health cover.


We need to be very clear about this. What the Labor government is proposing here is bad health policy. This government has a long record of failing to understand what the public wants, and this policy shows that nothing has changed. The impact that this proposal will have on the residents of Macquarie is significant. An average family in which the father works as an accountant and the mother as a schoolteacher, earning wages above the threshold, with a basic private health package costing $2,500 a year, will see their rebate reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent, costing them an extra $250 a year. This is at a time when cost-of-living pressures are high and many among us are calling out for greater access to health services.


By bringing the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and the two related bills back before the parliament, this Labor government is once again showing that it is not listening to what Australians are saying. In both May and November of 2009 the parliament clearly told Labor that we did not want it destroying our health system. We must now again say that in 2012 nothing has changed. This bill needs to be opposed. The last thing we need is more hurt from this Labor government.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:48):  I rise today to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and related bills—the government's latest broken promise and latest attack on aspirational Australians. This is an issue that goes to the very heart of my electorate of Higgins. My electorate is full to the brim with aspiration.


When I stood here for the first time in this place just over two years ago, I referred to the thread that binds the people of Higgins together, that thread being aspiration—whether it be young couples renting for the moment but desperate to own their own homes; whether it be families wanting the best for their children, scrimping and saving to provide them with the best opportunities in life; whether it be small business people, rolling up their sleeves, taking a chance and creating jobs; or whether it be older residents who have worked hard throughout their lives, whose accomplishments prove what can happen when you dare to pursue your ambitions.


Yet this government does not believe in aspiration. It does not believe, as we do, that the best path to our collective prosperity involves giving individuals, families and businesses the freedom, opportunity and encouragement to build and secure their own futures. It does not believe in self-reliance. It is ideologically opposed to encouraging people to work hard, to save and to contribute to their own health care.


This bill is all about penalising individuals and families. It goes to the heart of cost-of-living pressures that families and individuals are already increasingly facing. This bill will increase the cost of private health insurance while at the same time do nothing to decrease the pressure on the public health system. Far from it: the changes that the government seeks to make today will increase the pressure on the public health system.


Seventy-seven per cent of my electorate have private health insurance. That is around 83,258 people, based on the current ABS statistics. Each of those people will be affected, either because their rebate will be taken away in full, because it will be decreased or because their premiums will ultimately rise because of the significant number of people who will drop out of the private health system. Even the remaining 27 per cent of my electorate who do not currently have private health insurance will be affected, because the public health system will come under increasing pressure.


It is instructive to look at the number of people who will be directly impacted when tier 1 of the government's legislation kicks in. In my electorate of Higgins, about 21 per cent of singles and seven per cent of couples will be directly impacted. I think it is telling that the lights have gone out in this chamber, because this legislation is a demonstration of how the lights have gone out on this government and how this government have ultimately been incredibly deceptive in the comments they have made about the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate across the years. It is useful to look back at what this government have said about the 30 per cent rebate—a rebate that was brought into effect by the coalition government, by the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, to ensure that we could have affordable and sustainable health care for all. It was to provide Australians with choice, to encourage people to be self-reliant.


Let us go back and look at what the current Prime Minister, who was then shadow minister, said about the private health insurance rebate. She said that she would give an ironclad guarantee that there would be no change to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. She said that she was so sick of saying it that she would ensure that there would be 'an ironclad guarantee' that there would be no change. All of us in this place know exactly what the Prime Minister's promises are worth. Only days before the last election, the Prime Minister made another promise—that there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. She broke that promise to the Australian people and she broke her promise as shadow minister for health not to rip away the private health insurance rebate. 


But it was not just the Prime Minister who made this assurance to the people of Australia. At the election in 2007, the shadow minister for health, the member for Gellibrand, explicitly stated that federal Labor had:


… made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates.


In the media statement released during the campaign, she stated:


The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.


That is what she said: 'This is absolutely untrue.' She went on to say:


The Howard government will do anything and say anything to get elected.


Doesn't that take the cake? It turned out that it was the shadow minister for health who would say anything or do anything. This is a very interesting statement from the member for Gellibrand. It has to be one of the most duplicitous statements ever made by a shadow minister with respect to a government policy, ranking just after the Prime Minister's famous remark—her famous broken promise—about a carbon tax.


It went on. Kevin Rudd, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, also made some incredibly explicit promises in relation to the private health insurance rebate. He said, in a letter, which I have here today:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year—


This is in 2007—


 that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge. Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for full approval of premium increases.


The Labor government have again broken their promise. In fact, before they went to the 2010 election, they brought forward changes in the 2009 budget which saw a broken promise on private health insurance—a private health insurance broken promise which will affect every single Australian and, most particularly, all of those Australians who currently hold private health insurance. It will affect not just those whom the government claim will be directly affected—those on higher incomes—but every single person who holds private health insurance, because their premiums will rise as people drop out of private health insurance. 


The government have said that we should not be worried about the people who drop out of private health insurance. They say that it is a minuscule number. They say that, for their savings of upwards of $1.9 billion—which they now say is over $2 billion—very few people will drop out of private health insurance. This does not stand up to scrutiny. Private health insurers have conducted their own research and asked Deloitte to provide a report on the number of people who would be anticipated to drop out of private health insurance as a result of the proposed changes. The report said that, over five years, up to 1.6 million Australians will drop their cover, which is pretty radically different from Treasury's estimate of around 25,000 people. Not only that but, according to this report, up to 4.3 million Australians will downgrade their cover over five years. This will see an increase in premiums—the cost of health insurance—of upwards of 10 per cent. This means that the cost of health care in Australia will increase. 


Australians who are battling cost-of-living pressures right now ask themselves: 'Why? Why is this government so committed to ripping away choice for Australians? Why are they committed to raising the cost of private health insurance?' The government claim this is because they need to find savings. But let us look at the government's record. They have the worst economic record of any government in recent history. They have delivered in their four budgets deficits that add up to $167 billion, which of course means that Australians for generations to come will be paying off the subsequent debt that the government are racking up. Already we know that the cost of the government's borrowings will impact Australians—every man, woman and child—by $6,000. This is a government with a terrible record; a government that has needed to increase the gross debt ceiling from $75 billion to $250 billion. 


Warnings abound in our national papers every day that this government is on the path to economic destruction through its waste and mismanagement. It must stop. While this government says it needs to rip out around $2.4 billion from the private health insurance rebate, it has wasted more than $1 billion on pink batts and more than $1.5 billion on trying to correct the mistakes made under that program. This government has managed billion-dollar blowouts in mismanaged programs such as border protection. There has been a blowout of over $1 billion in that policy alone. This government has also wasted billions of dollars on the Julia Gillard memorial school hall projects. A number of school halls and infrastructure projects have not been managed well and there has been an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars. While the government has presided over such waste and mismanagement, it claims that it needs to rip money out of private health insurance. 


The only reason this government is pursuing this action is that, ideologically, it is opposed to private health insurance. It is opposed to people saving and providing for their own futures and it is against choice in health care. It is now on its the third attempt to dismantle the private health insurance industry in this country. I stand against this, as do the people of Higgins. The people in my electorate of Higgins are vitally opposed to these measures and I will continue to fight for private health insurance that will allow Australians to directly participate. This government should hang its head in shame for taking one policy to the 2007 election and then the 2010 election, but then breaking that promise. This government cannot be trusted to maintain its promises; it cannot be trusted to maintain the health care of all Australians. This legislation should not stand.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (17:03):  I am pleased to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and related bills. The House is debating a simple, clear-cut issue—should the Australian tax system encourage all Australians, or as many who are able, to provide for their own medical expenses through taking out health insurance, or should it instead, as this government proposes, put private health insurance and choice of medical provider even further out of the reach of many Australians? Regrettably, that will be the effect of the fundamentally misconceived provisions in the bills the House is debating this afternoon.


When it comes to private health insurance, Labor has form. Labor is relentlessly hostile to private health insurance. Labor is hostile to private hospitals. Labor is hostile to the notion of Australians seeking to rely on their own resources, seeking to make provision for themselves and their families rather than relying solely and exclusively on the public system. This bill is redolent of ideological hostility towards private health insurance and towards self-provision, which is at the absolute core of Labor's approach. That is why this bill is designed to make it harder for Australians to help themselves and their families. This bill is designed to make it more expensive to take out private health insurance; it is designed to penalise many of those who seek to provide for themselves rather than be a burden on the public purse.


Let us remind ourselves of the principal provisions in the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill. Firstly, the current private health insurance rebate, which for most people is set at 30 per cent of expenditures and for older people somewhat higher, will be reduced for those who are above certain income levels. If you are a single and your income level is more than $124,000, the rebate will be reduced to zero; if you fall into certain income levels below that, the rebate will be reduced by lesser amounts. The second major provision in this bill increases the current Medicare levy surcharge on your tax bill which applies if you do not have private health insurance. Today that stands at one percentage point; in the new world, should this bill pass the House, that rate will increase to 1.25 per cent for a single person with an income above $93,000 and 1.5 per cent for a single person with an income above $124,000. We have had some highly illogical and internally inconsistent arguments in support of this measure. Just today in the House the Prime Minister drew a comparison between a highly paid businessmen earning $500,000 a year and an apprentice earning much less, and argued that, in the absence of the measures contained in this bill, there is an unsavoury degree of cross-subsidy on the part of the apprentice to the businessman, who has the benefit of the private health insurance rebate. A brief look at the numbers indicates what a ludicrous claim that is. In the case of the businessman cited by the Prime Minister, the tax on $500,000 is $206,050, prior to the application of the rebate. If we assume a typical level of private health insurance premium then that tax bill will be reduced by a mere $720. By contrast, somebody earning $50,000 will have a tax bill of $10,200. So the suggestion that, in some way, the person paying $206,050 a year in tax is freeloading on the person paying $10,200 in tax, which was essentially the argument put by the Prime Minister in the House, is self-evidently not worth considering when you take even the briefest look at the actual numbers.


I want to make three points in the time I have available. Firstly, the measures inherent in this bill fundamentally attack the provisions of the private health insurance rebate and are an appalling abandonment of what was apparently previously an ironclad commitment. Secondly, for many years we have seen from the Labor side of politics a consistent mismanagement of policy in the area of private health insurance, founded on their implacable ideological hostility to the private health insurance industry. Thirdly, the ill-designed and ill-thought-through measures in this bill will seriously damage choice and equity in health care in Australia.


On the first point, I remind the House, as a number of other speakers have done, of commitments that were made in the lead-up to the 2007 election by a number of eminent members of the Labor Party. The member for Gellibrand had this to say: 'On many occasions for many months federal Labor have made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.' Then it was a commitment; now, apparently, that commitment is out the window and completely meaningless.


What did then opposition leader Kevin Rudd have to say just before the 2007 election? In a written commitment, a letter to the industry body, he had this to say: 'Both my shadow minister for health Nicola Roxon and I have made clear on many occasions this year that federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent rebate and 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.' This is a shameful abandonment of a commitment previously given by the Labor Party.


My second point is that the policy area of private health insurance is one which has been subject to consistent mismanagement over many years by Labor during its times in government, and by contrast the coalition has shown a sure hand in seeking to maximise the number of people who take out private health insurance and thereby contribute themselves towards the cost burden of the health system, which would otherwise fall entirely on the public purse. When Medicare was introduced in 1984, a decline began in the percentage of the population covered by private health insurance. By 1998, only 30.4 per cent of the population was covered by private health insurance. I need hardly add the obvious point that this left the vast majority of Australians drawing on the publicly funded system, putting it under substantial pressure.


The Howard government, I am pleased to say, unlike the approach of the present government, tackled this pressing policy problem with measures that were well designed and which achieved their desired outcome. The desired outcome of course was to increase the proportion of Australians with private health insurance cover—that is, to increase the proportion of people who were taking upon themselves the burden of funding their own health needs rather than simply leaving it to the public purse.


The measures introduced by the Howard government involved a mixture of carrot and stick. The carrot of course was the introduction of the tax rebate, which is now under savage attack in the legislation before the House today. The stick of course was that if you did not take out private health insurance above certain income thresholds, you were required to pay the one per cent Medicare levy surcharge. Those measures were extremely successful. By 2007, private health insurance coverage had climbed to 44.6 per cent of the population. In my own electorate of Bradfield, 85 per cent of households have private health insurance. In other words, a very substantial proportion of the people in my electorate of Bradfield have taken the decision to incur, out of their household budget, expenditure against their future health needs because they want to make sure that they are doing what they can to provide for their own health needs and the costs of those health needs rather than simply leaving it to the public purse to support their health needs. I commend them for doing that.


Let me turn therefore to my third point and perhaps the one which is most important, as the House considers this package of measures. What will be the impact of this legislation on the policy objective of choice and equity in the Australian healthcare system? I am sorry to say the effect of these measures will be very damaging. Some 2.4 million Australians are directly affected and they face an immediate increase in premiums, depending upon which tier they fall within, of between 14 per cent and 43 per cent. In turn, it is likely that there will be a material reduction in the percentage of Australians who hold private health insurance. Conversely, there may also be people reducing the tier of insurance they hold. Private health insurance premiums are likely to rise and the inevitable consequence will be more pressure on the public health system and more pressure on the public purse which funds that public health system.


Analysis by Deloittes, which has been cited by a number of speakers in the House this afternoon, predicts that some 1.6 million consumers are likely to withdraw from private health insurance cover, a number which is very, very different from the panglossian assumption in the work done by the Treasury that a mere 25,000 people will give up coverage. The further issue which presents itself is that the dollars which are purportedly saved out of this exercise must be offset against the extra cost which the government and in turn taxpayers will be required to bear towards the cost of the public health system. According to research conducted by Econtech and other parties in 2004, for every dollar of public funding going into the private health insurance rebate $2 was saved—that is to say, $2 towards the cost of the health system that was met by private health insurers, rather than being required to be paid out of the public purse.


Many of the arguments that have been made by the government in favour of this measure do not bear up to close scrutiny. It is claimed to be a savings measure, but in real terms it is in fact a tax increase, because Australians above a certain income tax threshold who do not take out private health insurance will now face a further increase in their income tax rate, which could be as high as one per cent or 1.5 per cent. This in turn creates what might be described as a price shield for private health insurance premiums, as the eminent economist Henry Ergas has argued in the Australian newspaper today, and the consequence of that is that there will be an upward force on private health insurance premiums which would not have existed in the absence of the measures contained in this bill. The consequence in turn is that private health insurance will become increasingly unaffordable for a proportion of Australians. 


When you step back and look at the overall impact of these measures, it is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that what the Labor Party is doing here is pushing us towards a two-tier health system in Australia, where the poor or the less well off are in the public system and the more affluent are being pushed into a private health insurance funded private system. That seems a very curious approach for the Labor Party to be taking. It is a profound attack on the principles of both economies of scale and equity that the public health system is supposed to deliver and it is one of the many curiosities of this deeply ill-conceived piece of legislation, which attacks fundamentally Australians who seek to provide for themselves.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (17:18):  I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011 before the House. The government's proposed changes, which will means test the private health insurance rebate, is a retrograde step that is vehemently opposed by the coalition. Means testing the rebate will drive up premiums, force millions of Australians to downgrade their private health care with many abandoning it all together and increase the pressure on an already stretched public health system. What is more, it is a fundamental breach of another Labor promise. From Kevin Rudd to Julia Gillard to Labor's last Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, the government repeatedly stated its commitment to maintaining the private health insurance rebate in its current form. In September 2007, Nicola Roxon said:


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates … The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.


Then again in February 2009, Nicola Roxon said: 


… the government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.


We now know the truth. Whatever modicum of trust was left after Labor's successive backflips on the carbon tax, offshore processing and mandatory precommitment for pokies, it must surely have evaporated after this latest government reversal. How can Labor honestly be trusted on anything? In contrast, the coalition has been consistent in our commitment to not means testing the private health insurance rebate. It goes right to the heart of an individual's freedom to choose and for what many consider to be an act of personal responsibility. We as Liberals want a robust private system in health just as in education, and we want this private system sitting side by side with a viable and effective public system. This was well put by Margaret Thatcher when she, as Prime Minister, said of private health insurance in the United Kingdom:


I, along with something like 5 million other people, insure to enable me to go to hospital on the day I want, at the time I want, and with a doctor I want. For me, that is absolutely vital … Like most people, I pay my dues to the National Health Service; I do not add to the queue, and if I said ""Look, because I cannot come when you want me, I must come when I want to"" you would accuse me of jumping the queue. I exercise my right as a free citizen to spend my own money in my own way, so that I can go in on the day, at the time, with the doctor I choose and get out fast.""


So that was Margaret Thatcher and this thinking could equally apply to the Liberals' approach to private health insurance in this country. There you have it: the doyenne of British conservatism, whose record in limiting the excesses of the state are revered the world over, explaining why she and five million of her fellow Britons had private health insurance. So wouldn't Margaret Thatcher be surprised to learn that we in Australia, where our public system is even more effective than that of the UK or the United States, have around 12 million Australians with private health insurance—a remarkable 52.9 per cent of the population. In an electorate like mine, Kooyong, the number is even higher, with 74½ per cent of its people having private health insurance. This includes nearly 25,000 people who are single. In my electorate of Kooyong this means that more than 100,000 residents are covered by private health insurance. These changes will take money out of the pockets of people in Balwyn, Hawthorn, Kew, Camberwell, Deepdene and Canterbury. It means less money for them to meet the rising costs of living because this money will have to now go, if they choose, into keeping their private health insurance.


Significantly, as my colleague and friend the member for Dickson and shadow minister for health said in a very valuable contribution in this House last week, a remarkable 5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $50,000 and 3.4 million Australians with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $35,000. Never let it be said that this is a rebate for the rich. These are aspirational Australians, some of whom do it very tough but take out private health insurance because they have made a considered choice. This is how they want to spend their money. This is the epitome of personal freedom. So too when it comes to the private health insurers in Australia themselves: a number of them are not-for-profit organisations whose bottom line is not to expand their margins but to achieve more affordable health care that delivers a better service for the consumer.


We in this House should also not forget that private hospitals do much of the heavy lifting in our healthcare system. They look after 40 per cent of all patients in Australia. In 2009-10 this equated to 3½ million patients, and for elective surgery the numbers are even higher with nearly two in every three cases taking place in private hospitals. These are remarkable numbers and reflect the fact that the Australian people have been voting with their feet for private health insurance.


Indeed, it was the Howard government's policies which facilitated this very high take-up that we now enjoy. In 1997 John Howard introduced a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge on taxable income, penalising those income earners who did not take up private health insurance; 1999 saw the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate; the year 2000 saw Lifetime Health cover and from 2005 the more elderly people in our community received greater rebates for taking up private health insurance. At every step of this reform process undertaken by the Howard government you could see the take-up rates dramatically improve. For example, in the 12 months after the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate in January 1999, the percentage of Australians with private hospital health cover jumped from 30.6 per cent to 43 per cent and in the years afterwards it jumped to the level we now enjoy at around 52.9 per cent.


What is so concerning to members on this side of the House is the large number of people that will be negatively and directly impacted by this government's legislation. Around 2.4 million people will see immediate rises in their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent or 43 per cent depending on their income levels. According to the Australian Health Insurance Association, over 800,000 more Australians will be admitted to public hospitals. In their analysis, the top-tier consultancy Deloittes has said that 175,000 Australians will withdraw their private health cover in the first year and 583,000 Australians will downgrade their cover. Over a five-year period those numbers will dramatically rise to 1.6 million people who will withdraw their private cover and 4.3 million people who will downgrade their cover. Even the state-owned Medibank Private has come out publicly and stated that 37,000 of its members will remove their private cover and 92½ thousand of their members will downgrade their cover.


I have no doubt that the government's decision to means-test public health insurance will be deeply unpopular with the Australian people. The public understands that this is not about the future costs of the program. The rebate as a proportion of the total healthcare spend, public and private, has stayed constant at 3½ per cent for the last decade. The public understand that this is not about improving the state of our public healthcare system, for they have heard all that before—the hospital fix that Kevin Rudd promised but which never arrived and the superclinics that were promised but never built. But they do know that this government is under enormous budgetary stress as a result of its own fiscal mismanagement.


This is just a mad dash for cash. They need to scramble for a surplus and in doing so will hit Australian families once again. The problem is that in doing so the consequences of these changes will be profound. Healthy and young people will make up thousands of the thousands of people who give up their private cover, reducing the cross-subsidy that is a hallmark of insurance schemes. Premiums will rise, membership will fall and the overall pressure on our public health system will become even more pronounced.


Be under no illusions. This is bad policy from a bad government and it will come at a bad time for Australian families. This legislation before the House to put a means test on private health insurance in this country must be opposed by all clear-thinking members who are interested not just in the good health of our country's balance sheet but also in the physical health and wellbeing of all Australians.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (17:33):  I also rise to speak against the passage of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, which I believe will be a dagger through the heart of the private health insurance industry. I commend the member for Kooyong, who was just speaking, for his remarks, and I associate myself with his comments. There are three reasons I am against this bill before us. First, it is based on a broken promise. Second, it is bad policy that will cause premiums to go up for all Australians. And, third, it is bad economics; it will just lead to greater cost-shifting to the states and longer public hospital waiting lists.


Let me go to the first point—the broken promise. This bill is just another breach of faith from this Labor government. It is another broken promise. We had a firm commitment—in words, in writing—from this government that it would not be amending the private health insurance rebate scheme. The Labor Party made this very, very clear, and it did so time and time again. Perhaps nothing is more clear on this than the letter Mr Kevin Rudd, who at the time was the federal Labor leader, wrote to the chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association in late 2007. He wrote:




Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.



There are many other occasions on which this very firm commitment not to amend the private health insurance rebate was made. But what do we have before us? We have a further breach of faith from this government against an explicit commitment it had made.


The second reason I am against this bill is that it is poor policy that will push premiums up for everyday Australians. Madam Deputy Speaker, as you may be aware, an estimated 12 million Australians now have private health insurance. That constitutes over half the Australian population, or 52.9 per cent. Of those, about 10.3 million have hospital treatment cover. The people who take out private health insurance are not, overall, just the wealthiest in Australian society—not by any stretch of the imagination. To give you a few figures to prove this point: 5.6 million people who have private health insurance have a household income of less than $50,000 per annum and 3.4 million have a household income of less than $35,000 per annum. This is not an individual's income; this is a collective household income. It is a broad cross-section of Australian society that is taking out private health insurance. This is a good thing. It is a good thing that a broad cross-section of society takes out private health insurance. It is a good thing that so many people take out private health insurance, because the more people who take out private health insurance the less pressure there is on the public system. As we know there are extensive waiting lists on the public system, there are stresses and there are pressures on it. The more we can take off the public health system the better it is for everybody.


It has not always been the case that we have had such a high proportion of people who take out private health insurance. Far from it. If you go back to the Hawke and Keating governments people were dropping out and the private health insurance system was at quite a critical point. From memory, I believe at that time the percentage of those with private health insurance was down to about 33 per cent of the population. When Howard and Costello came to government in 1996 they saw this problem and tried to rectify it. Indeed, they put in a number of steps over the course of their government to lift the proportion of people who took out private health insurance, and they had a remarkable effect. An estimated 75 per cent more people took out private health insurance as a result of the measures that the Howard-Costello government put in place. That high proportion has been maintained all the way through to this present time. But now we are again at a critical stage. We are at a moment where the tides may turn once again, and turn in a negative direction.


What will be the impact of the proposed changes contained within the bill before us? As we know, some 2.4 million people will be directly affected. They will face immediate increases in their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent or 43 per cent, depending on their income tier. That is a huge percentage increase in their premiums. This is at a time when many people, even people who are relatively well off, with incomes of $100,000 or $150,000, still have mortgages to pay and when electricity bills, groceries, water bills, child care et cetera are all going up. But the increases will not be limited to those 2.4 million people who are on higher incomes. Rather, the impacts will be felt by everybody who has private health insurance—every single one of those 12 million people.


Deloitte, who have done some analysis of the bill before us, believe that, as a result of the changes proposed, premiums across the board will go up by 10 per cent above what they would ordinarily go up by. Ordinarily we see premiums go up five, six or seven per cent per annum. Here we are talking about potentially a 17 per cent increase in premiums. The government's own private health insurer, Medibank Private, predicts that 37,000 of their members will drop cover because of the increase in premiums. They predict that 95,000 of their members will downgrade their cover because of the increase in premiums that will come about as a result of this bill. That is just one insurance company. That does not include Bupa, Australian Unity or all the other private health insurance companies. That is just one private health insurance company, the government's own, which estimates that 37,000 people with drop out and 95,000 people will downgrade.


Deloitte believe that in the short term 175,000 people could withdraw from private hospital cover and over 500,000 people will downgrade. In the medium term, the five-year horizon, they estimate that 1.6 million people will drop out and 4.3 million people will downgrade. If these figures are anywhere close to being accurate, and I believe they will be, we will be seriously winding back the clock. People will be dropping out again in droves and premiums will skyrocket. This will just put more pressure on the public hospital system, which it does not need at present. More pressure on the public hospital system also means more pressure on taxpayers, who have to pay for the public hospital system.


On that particular point, we have some modelling suggesting that every dollar of funding provided to the private health insurance rebate saves $2 for the government. So, overall, the analysis based on the bill in front of us is that $3.8 billion extra will be required to fund the public hospital system as a result of these particular changes.


In my own electorate over 84,000 people have private health insurance. These are not wealthy people; they are everyday, middle-income Australians. They take out private health insurance not because they are particularly well-off but because they like the convenience, the choice and some of the peace of mind associated with it. Another significant reason for it in my electorate is that they want to have access to Knox Private Hospital, which is for most residents in my electorate the closest and most convenient hospital for them to attend. It is easy for them, and their family members, to get there. Under the changes proposed, many people may have to look further afield in order to access the hospital of their choice, because they may not be able to afford the premiums, should they go up as we expect they will.


Why are the Labor Party doing this, given that it is based on a broken promise and it is poor policy, which we know will put up costs for everyday Australians and cause thousands of people to drop out? We know it will cost the taxpayer potentially billions of extra dollars overall. Why are they Party doing it? There are two reasons. The first is ideological. The Labor Party have never liked private health insurance. They have always argued against the additional benefits that the Howard-Costello government put in place. Despite what they said publicly before election, we have always known that secretly they have wanted to reduce the number of people covered by it.


The second reason that they are doing it, though, is because the Labor Party—the Rudd-Gillard government—have blown the budget so systemically and so categorically that they are now looking for every single dollar that they can possibly find to create the elusive budget surplus come budget time this year. As I pointed out, overall the impact of these bills on the taxpayers will be a negative one, with them potentially paying billions of dollars extra as people shift back to the private health system.


But the accounting trick—and this is the only thing that the government are interested in—means that in the short term there could be savings, because it will shift costs from the Commonwealth across to the states. The states still have to find the money somewhere. They are raising taxes from the same constituents, whether they be in my electorate or any other electorate. But the federal government will be able to make a short-term cost saving, according to the Treasury figures. These bills are in front of us because they do not like private health insurance and never have and because they are desperate to find extra savings because the budget is in such poor shape. This provides them with a neat little accounting trick in the short term to get them through the grave difficulties that they have at the moment.


Let me summarise the position in relation to these bills. They are based on a broken promise—that is the first point. They implement poor policy that will see premiums increase across the board for everyday Australians on very modest incomes. It will see people fall out of private health insurance and put greater pressure on the public health system. That is the second point. Finally, my third point is that these bills are poor economics. They increase the pressure on the taxpayer overall and create additional financial pressure on state governments that the Commonwealth avoids in the short term. I am firmly against these bills. I believe that all sensible members of this parliament should also vote against these bills.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (17:47):  I rise tonight to address the Fairer Private Health Insurances Bill 2011, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011. I am pained to even call the package by its name. This package of bills is not designed to make things fairer for Australians and nor is it designed to make things better in our national healthcare system. This legislation is designed to cut the healthcare rebate that families and singles are eligible for. That means nothing less than private health insurance becoming more expensive for working families in this nation. That will compound on increases in the cost of living across the board.


We are battling a healthcare crisis in this country. Public waiting lists have been spiralling out of control and now this government wants to cut private healthcare insurance to save a few dollars. The hallmark of this government is economic mismanagement. This is a Labor government that is happy to spend $50 billion on a National Broadband Network that has only 4,000 customers after five years. It is happy to spend $2 billion on its border protection blowout, including cigarettes for detainees. And yet, when it comes to the lives and wellbeing of the people of Australia, this is where the ALP thinks they should be saving money.


Just a couple of months ago, in November, I read a story in the Newcastle Herald by Jacqui Jones entitled 'Hunter surgery schedule blowout'. It is important that I quote this article to the parliament. It read:


Surgery waiting lists have blown out at some Hunter hospitals to almost four times longer than the national average, with waits increasing 20 times over in the past year for some procedures, the latest data shows.


The most recent information on hospitals’ performance will be made publicly available today through the federal government’s MyHospitals website.


It is based on information provided by public health departments to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. 


A Newcastle Herald analysis of data for Hunter hospitals showed blowouts in waiting times for surgery in 2010-11, compared with 2009-10, and waits that were longer than national averages.


At Calvary Mater Newcastle, the median wait for plastic surgery was 93 days in 2010-11, compared with the national average of 24 days.


This was up from a wait of four days in 2009-10, and 22 days nationally.


Waiting times for gall bladder removal and hernia repair increased over the year and were longer than national averages.


At John Hunter Hospital, eye surgery patients waited twice as long as their national counterparts.


Delays were long for cataract extraction, with the 282-day median wait (90 days nationally) in 2010-11 up from 176 days (86 days nationally) in 2009-10.


Orthopaedic patients took longer to get to surgery, including for hip and knee replacements, at John Hunter Hospital than patients booked at hospitals elsewhere in Australia.


At Maitland Hospital, orthopaedic lists blew out to a 234-day median wait (national 64 days) in 2010-11, compared with 169 days (national 62 days) in 2009-10.


Increases were also experienced within the year and beyond Australia-wide trends for gynaecological surgery and haemorrhoid removal at Maitland. 


The waiting times at Kurri Kurri Hospital for ear, nose and throat surgery and at Belmont Hospital for a hysterectomy increased over the year and were longer than national averages.


Here we have in the Hunter people waiting longer than ever before and yet this Labor government wants to force more people onto the public health system, thereby making the situation much worse. We have people in the Hunter waiting up to four times longer for surgery than their interstate counterparts. And yet all of the members from the Hunter—the member for Newcastle, Sharon Grierson; the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon; the member for Charlton, Greg Combet; and the member for Shortland, Jill Hall—are going to push this legislation through. And it looks like they will be joined by Rob Oakeshott, the member for Lyne. They are all just champing at the bit to support the economic mismanagement of this Labor government, which will be to the detriment of people in our region. This really should be a no-brainer. Even the Labor Party should be able to see how destructive this legislation will be. However, I will spell it out, just in case they have not worked it out yet: this legislation will make private health insurance more expensive for 2.4 million Australians. For some of those people it will mean an increase in premiums of 43 per cent. That is a cost of almost 1½ times what they are already paying. Deloitte have done the figures and, under this legislation, 1.6 million Australians are likely to drop their private health cover over the next five years. And, of those who do not drop it altogether, a further 4.3 million will downgrade the level of their coverage. The minister has not even tried to deny this—in fact, she has admitted that people will drop their cover. When coupled with increases in the costs of living, including groceries, rent, power and gas because of this Labor government's reckless carbon tax, yet to come, this is just another attack on families and on their budgets and it is a thing they just cannot afford. According to this Labor government, if you work hard to provide private health care for yourself and your family, you should be punished—you are doing too well for yourself and you are not paying enough.


We only have to take a step back and look at why private health insurance rebates were provided in the first place to understand why the current system works so well. When the Medicare levy surcharge and lifetime health cover were introduced under the previous coalition government, private health insurance coverage increased from 34 per cent in 1996 to 44 per cent in 2007. Today private hospitals treat two in five of all patients in Australia, which accounts for some 3.5 million patients every single year. If those patients do not have private health cover, that is an extra 3.5 million patients for the public health system to cope with—or not cope with, which is more likely the case.


I want to put this into perspective in my own electorate of Paterson. In my electorate there are 46,184 people aged 18 or over with private health insurance, according to the figures published on 1 January 2011. That is around half the adults in my electorate. According to national statistics, 13 per cent of people will drop private health cover under this legislation within just five years. A further 36 per cent of people will downgrade their cover. In Paterson that equates to 6,004 people dropping their private health insurance altogether and 16,626 people downgrading their cover. If just half those people who drop their cover need surgery, that is an extra 3,000 people who are going to be forced into the Hunter health system waiting list—and that is just in Paterson alone; that is not taking into account the electorates of Hunter, Shortland, Charlton, Newcastle or Lyne, which also rely on the Hunter's hospitals. And that does not include those people who have reduced their cover and can no longer go into private hospitals for certain procedures. I know I have just gone through a lot of numbers, but it is important that we understand the real, on-the-ground impacts of this destructive legislation: an extra 3,000 people from Paterson waiting in line for surgery, pushing back other patients and being pushed back themselves, is the real impact.


So it is no surprise to me that, with reckless money-making moves like this one, the Australian public does not trust the Prime Minister or her Labor colleagues when it comes to the economy. In fact, a poll taken last Saturday and published in today's Australianshows that the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, is far more trusted with money matters than the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. He has a nine-point lead on the question of handling the economy, with the Prime Minister having fallen by 14 percentage points since August 2010. Why would the public trust this government on the economy? After all, it is the same government who took a $20 billion surplus and turned it into a $96 billion deficit. This is the same government that takes a solution each and every time and turns it into a problem. There were years that passed without a single boat arrival under the former coalition government—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  Order! The member is straying from the content of the bill. I call you back to the bill.




Mr BALDWIN:
  I am showing a point on economic mismanagement, Madam Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It needs to be relevant to the bill.




Mr BALDWIN:
  With this economic mismanagement we now have 15,000 people illegally arriving by boat, putting further pressure on the health system. Now the ALP want to do the same thing to private health insurance. They want to create a problem where there isn't one.


Of course, we also know that you just cannot trust this government. What we keep getting is more and more examples of this government's dishonesty—a phoney, whatever-it-takes approach by government. After all, it was this Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, who said that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led—and yet we are set for the carbon tax to be introduced from 1 July. It was the same person, when the shadow minister for health, who said in the Weekend Australianin a letter to the editor, in her own writing:


The truth is I never had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate and, contrary to Mr Latham's diaries, do not support such a claim. For all Australians who want to have private health insurance the private health insurance rebate would have remained under a Labor government. I gave an iron-clad guarantee of that during the election. The difference between Tony 'rock-solid, iron-clad' Abbott and me is that, when I make an iron-clad commitment, I actually intend on keeping it.


In a further letter to the editor of the Courier Mailon 23 September 2004 she said:


Your correspondent Russell McGregor should have no concerns that Labor will erode or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an iron-clad guarantee on that on a number of occasions.


That was from Julia Gillard, opposition health spokesperson. In fact, my favourite quote is: 'I grow tired of saying this: Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate,' in a letter to the editor of the Hobart Mercury.


It is just not the Prime Minister, who was then the shadow health minister who gave such guarantees. We only need to look at the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd, who, as Leader of the Opposition in 2007, wrote to Dr Armitage of the Australian Health Insurance and said:


Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor's policy regarding private health insurance. Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made it clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.


Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases. Zero per cent premium adjustment is not Labor policy.


I understand Nicola Roxon's office has also confirmed with you that Federal Labor has no plans to require private health insurance funds to make equivalent payments to public hospitals for patients who elect to be treated as private patients.


I trust this allays your concerns. Federal Labor values its relationship with the private health insurance sector and we look forward to continuing this regardless of the outcome on November 24.


Yours sincerely


Kevin Rudd


Federal Labor Leader


Member for Griffith


Nicola Roxon, then Minister for Health and Ageing, was quoted in the Age on 24 February 2009 as saying:


The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates …


Yet less than three months later, on 12 May 2009, the insurance rebate changes were announced in the budget.


This is a government that says one thing and does another. This is a government that finds a solution and creates a problem—over and over again. We are into 2012 and it is clear that this government neither respects nor values its relationship with the people of Australia who are paying for private health insurance and contributing to support a reduction in pressure on the public health system. All this government seems to want to do, in fact its whole agenda, is to claw back money from working families to prop up its failed economic management position, a position that has created record debt.


This is a desperate move by a desperate government that has squandered the dollars of millions of Australians on wasted programs like the insulation tragedy and the school halls rip-off. I say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, to each and every Labor member in this place and to the Independents: the health of our fellow Australians is far more important than all of the other programs that this government has wasted money on. This government will see, under its stewardship, a blow-out in the waiting lists in the public health system. This government will see, under its stewardship, private hospitals close because of a lack of patients. This government will see, under its stewardship, the health standards of the people of Australia deteriorate because it mismanaged the economy and saw as a sacrifice those hard-working Australians who take out private health insurance and who reduce the pressure on the public system. It should be the government's agenda, as it was under the previous coalition government and as it was stated to be by the previous Labor opposition, to support private health insurance to make it affordable for working families. That is why I call on the Independents to refuse to support this legislation that will hurt the people in their constituencies. I reject these bills as presented to the House.

"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (18:02): Today marks the third time that this government has tried to launch its disgraceful attack on the forgotten families of Macarthur, families who are already doing it tough in these difficult times. This government is shamefully out of touch with the Australian people and with Australian values. The very existence of this bill represents yet another broken promise from Labor. Labor promised, hand on heart, that it would not touch the private health insurance rebate.


I must be having deja vu, because I can vividly recollect a promise to Andrew Wilkie about poker machine reforms, a promise to the Australian people to return the budget to surplus and a promise that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' to borrow a phrase from the Prime Minster. Time after time we have seen repeated betrayals of the people of Australia. This Labor-Greens alliance will say anything to be in government, but, once in government, turn their backs on the people who elected them. They say one thing but do another. This government has a trust and credibility problem with the people of Australia. This bill represents yet another botched and broken election promise that will, without a doubt, result in greater cost of living pressures on families across this nation.


The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011 are a key part of the Prime Minister's ideological arsenal against the freedom of choice in health care. Private health insurance gives people the choice of treating doctor, the choice of when and where they can access health services, the choice of surgery options and the choice to be treated in a private hospital.


Private health insurance does not take away from the public health system, but instead adds significant value to Australia's total healthcare resources. The private health insurance rebate is a policy that has been staunchly defended by the coalition because it is, simply put, a good policy. The 30 per cent rebate has had a direct result in taking pressure off the public health system, all the while adding value to the health system as a whole. Australia's public health system is highly regarded and does a fantastic job with the resources at its disposal. I am confident that, under the leadership of the Liberal New South Wales government of Premier Barry O'Farrell, the New South Wales public health system will see many positive developments over the coming years. It is not feasible to say that the public health system in Australia could survive without the complementary benefits that the private health system provides.


This bill is a shameless measure shifting cost from the Commonwealth to the states' public systems. When the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate was introduced by the Howard government, the national coverage of private health insurance rose from 34 per cent to 44 per cent. The Howard government had the foresight to also introduce the Medicare levy surcharge for those who should be able to afford private health insurance but for whatever reasons had not taken it up. This measure ensured that those who chose not to contribute to their own health care through the private health care system would still contribute to the public health care system. The test used to determine whether a person would be liable to pay the Medicare levy surcharge would include taxable income, reportable fringe benefits, reportable superannuation contributions and total net investment losses. This government is trying to distort these provisions by seeking to apply the same income tests to determine whether families will also lose their rebate. It is a perversion of what the Medicare levy surcharge sought to achieve. This test will not just be used for people who opt out of eligible private health insurance, but apply to people who are currently paying their premiums and benefiting from the 30 per cent rebate. These people will lose out: some will be pushed into a lesser category of the rebate and some will lose their rebate all together. All Australians will face higher premiums because of this disgraceful government's actions.


The private health insurance rebate gives families in Macarthur the incentive to provide for their own healthcare needs and get a little back from the government for doing so. This support, in the form of a 30 per cent rebate on eligible private health insurance policies, contributes back into the health system many times over through private health insurance premiums. For a couple in their mid-30s with two children, basic hospital and extras cover will cost at least $3,000 a year without the rebate. If people are going to be socially responsible and put their discretionary income towards their own healthcare costs, why should we punish them? Their investment in their health and, in turn, in the private health system, contributes to the resources that are available in both the public and private health systems. If this government decides to take away the incentive for people to purchase private health insurance, we risk losing the entire premium, and in turn create added pressure on the public system. This ideological attack on private health insurance may represent a short-term saving, but the longer-term implications on families are far-reaching. 


The immediate financial impacts of this bill will not just be felt by the 2.4 million people on higher incomes who will face immediate increases of their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent and 43 per cent. All Australians with private health insurance will face higher premiums in the future if these changes proceed. Deloitte have predicted that private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be. In addition, Deloitte's analysis of the proposed changes shows that in the first year 175,000 people would be expected to drop their private hospital cover, and a further 583,000 are expected to downgrade their cover. Over five years, Deloitte's modelling forecasts that 1.6 million people will drop their cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. This is in stark contrast to the minister's figures of only 27,000 to drop their cover. Indeed, the government owned insurer, Medibank Private, has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. 


How did the minister get it so wrong? This is yet another example of the government's botched attempts at health reform and lack of thorough planning in policy making. It is a case of this Prime Minister and Labor yet again meddling with a good policy that works, a policy that delivers and a policy that has provided quality health care to Australian families. This bill is already bearing the hallmarks of the Malaysia solution all over again. With each person either dropping or downgrading their cover, there is a flow-on effect of a net reduction of resources within the private healthcare system. Each policy downgrade will place greater pressure on the public health system, all the while punishing those who continue in the private health system. 


The government has not even bothered to disclose the numbers of people expected to downgrade their private health insurance coverage. It is reasonable to expect that many people will seek a cheaper product with fewer procedures covered, which will have second-round effect for public hospitals. This represents $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs for the public sector. In Macarthur 63,828 people are covered by some form of private health insurance, representing 47.8 per cent of voters. Suffice to say, this legislation will affect close to half of my electorate.


At the 2007 election the government promised, hand on heart, that they would not touch the private health insurance rebate. However, soon after elected, they tried to push through this legislation, not once but twice. The Senate soundly rejected it. Now the Prime Minister is relying on her good graces with the Greens to push this bill through and once again betray the trust of families in Macarthur and Australia-wide. I guess it must get easier the more you do it. The government have no foot to stand on when they say they will deliver on a promise. Just look at their track record. They have bungled every program and policy that they have laid their hands on. Now this government is attempting to undermine both the public and private health systems simultaneously. This legislation is nothing more than a noxious housewarming gift for a newly elected NSW government with the monumental task of fixing up more than 15 years of total and utter neglect of the public health system under Labor. 


Allied health services are also expected to bear the brunt of this government's attack on private health insurance. It is expected that 2.8 million people with general treatment cover are going to withdraw and 5.7 million to downgrade over five years. This means fewer people accessing allied health services, which means less income and fewer jobs. Families in Macarthur are already financially stretched to the limit. Many pensioners are at the point where they have had to give up their private health insurance after the recent rise in premiums—and at a time of life where they cannot afford to lose it. The government's proposed changes are just going to make a bad situation worse. 


The coalition has strongly supported giving Australians the choice of affordable private health insurance. The 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance premiums is a proven policy that we have seen works. Families in Macarthur are going to be negatively impacted by this legislation, and many will have no option but to forgo private health insurance and rely on the already stretched public system. This is a bad policy that will do nothing but harm both our public and private health systems and I would urge members of the House to keep faith with their electorates and reject it. So I say this to members opposite: stand up for affordable and accessible private health cover. Stand up for your community, your seniors and your youth. Stand up for a fair go for Aussie families. Stick to the ironclad guarantee that the Prime Minister previously made to the Australian public: 'Under no circumstances will we touch the private health insurance rebate.' As late as August 2010 the Prime Minister also stated, 'Medicare rebates are safe under Labor.' How safe? These bills change all that. No wonder there is a trust and credibility problem with this government.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (18:12):  In rising to address this Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill, I have some difficulty getting past the name of the bill itself. It makes it sound like the bill will make things 'fairer'. But this bill has nothing to do with fairness. In fact, it is the exact opposite of fairness. It is about trying to justify the introduction of what is most certainly not fair. I am reminded of the late master of wit Groucho Marx, who said: 'The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you've got it made.' That is a rather appropriate quote for this bill, I thought, because the bill is anything but honest and it is trying to fake fairness. In reality it is not about fairness at all. It is actually more in line with the views of the other Marx, Karl, and penalising the so-called rich. It is about a desperate bid to create a surplus and it is about robbing the hard-working people of this nation who will do the work to create that surplus, if it ever happens. It has been 21 years since the Labor Party posted a surplus and it must be getting embarrassing for the government every year as they introduce new budgets. We have the Treasurer here trying to say that he is going to get one next year—because he will do anything to create the illusion of a surplus; just making it look like a surplus temporarily will do. But Australian families know that what this government says is only good for a few months at best.


But this time there is not enough smoke, there aren't enough mirrors. So now we see the Treasurer hoping to pull a rabbit out of the hat—a $2.78 billion rabbit. They were running around, rifling through the files, looking up old copies of Hansard, scanning the demographic data, trying to find a sector of the community that is getting ahead, trying to find someone who hopes for a better future and is willing to work hard to achieve it. That was their bunny and they found it: a dead and twice-buried plan to tax those people who work hard for a better life. They have found yet another way to rob the rewards that were earned by someone else. So here we are today, once again standing up to the Labor Party, the party of big tax. The title of this bill purports to be about a private health insurance incentive. That word is important: 'incentive'. The proposed legislation is not about incentive at all. There is no carrot here. This is the stick and stick approach. This government is pulling out the stick to those who pay for private health insurance. Anyone who has the gall to work hard and earn $80,000 or more a year will now have to pay more for their health insurance. That is not an incentive; that is a disincentive. It is a disincentive to earn more and it is a disincentive to purchase private health cover. Just in case this legislation means you cannot afford private health cover anymore, the government has another stick waiting for you—a baseball bat to slug more tax out of you in the form of the Medicare levy. So what we have is a lose-lose situation. This plan was beaten down twice before when there was so much opposition that even this government promised it would not happen again. Yet here it is again today. Prior to the 2007 election, we had Labor's then shadow health minister promising, in a media statement from 26 September 2007:


Federal Labor rejects the Liberal scare campaign around the private health insurance rebates. On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


It goes on to say:


The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.


If this is absolutely untrue, then why is Labor introducing a bill today to do exactly that again? I thought maybe there was a typo in the media release and that the member for Gellibrand meant that it was absolutely correct. But then she was backed up two months later by then federal Labor leader, Kevin Rudd, the future Prime Minister, going to the 2007 election with this promise—this is what the member for Griffith wrote to Dr Michael Armitage of the Australian Health Insurance Association just four days before the 2007 election:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


We even had the current Prime Minister, back when she was shadow Minister for Health and Ageing, saying this to Laurie Oakes:


We will leave the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate undisturbed because we understand it's factored into family incomes—


a very interesting observation from the Prime Minister. Clearly the Australian Labor Party no longer understands Australian families or the fact that they have to factor these costs into their household budgets. So here we are debating a 'fairer' private health insurance incentive bill.


What is fair about this scenario? Consider two young men. Let us call one Bill. He lives and works in Melbourne and earns $79,000. The other—let us call him Ben—lives and works in regional Australia, participating in the resources boom that currently underpins our economy. Bill in Melbourne leads a pretty comfortable life. He has no trade and no tertiary studies behind him. He has spent long periods on unemployment benefits. He currently has a nine-to-five job which pays a good income of $79,000. He rents a large furnished apartment in the CBD for $450 a week. He does not need a car and walks to the MCG to watch his football team play, or to the cricket, and it is a pretty good life.


Now let us look at Ben, the bloke in country Queensland. He spent three years doing an apprenticeship when he supplemented his income to survive by working a casual job on nights and weekends. He has never missed a day of work and currently works long hours to earn $80,000. He has to maintain a work ute to get to job sites and carry his tools. He pays $550 a week in rent and if he wants to watch the Bulldogs play football, he is up for $600 in flights and $600 accommodation before a ball is bounced. Groceries, fuel, even a cup of coffee in his area are much more expensive because a labour shortage and high freight costs are pushing up the price of everything. I am sure Ben cannot wait for the carbon tax because he will cop the worst of the cost increases, being in regional Queensland. He will not be compensated in any way because his income is deemed 'too high'. As a result, Bill puts his feet up in his Melbourne apartment, comfortable in the knowledge that, even though he has a lower salary, he has a much higher disposable income compared with Ben. 


Under this 'fairer' legislation, Ben will also be facing higher costs for private health insurance. He works harder and longer hours. He has less money to spend but this government wants to tax him more, even though he already pays more tax than Bill. How is that fair? This is not an exaggerated case to make a point. This government wants to remove private health insurance incentives entirely from a family earning $249,000 this year. They would have us believe that this family sits around, watching a big plasma television, waiting for a $250,000 cheque to turn up in the mail. They would have us believe a family earning $249,000 or more a year are greedy, rich people who should be robbed with an unfair tax. This family is not just a statistic. It is a family of real human beings with real jobs, real children and real expenses.


For a husband and wife who both work in the mines at Moranbah in your electorate of Capricornia, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, where they live with their four children, to rent an average four-bedroom home they will be paying between $1,800 and $3,200 a week. Some rents are even higher. That translates to between $93,000 and $166,000 just for rent. By the time you take out income tax and rent, our family on $249,000 a year out in Moranbah probably cannot afford to feed the kids, let alone pay fully for private health insurance. This government would have us believe that these people are evil people of 'privilege'—the old class warfare bogey. This government does not even know these people because it stopped connecting with real people a long time ago. This government wants to smack such a family back down to the lowest level because they dared to have a dream—they wanted to get ahead.


I noticed an interesting headline in the Australian on Friday from a family talking about the costs this legislation will impose on them. The headline was a quote from Ms Kylie Richards from Adelaide, who, with her husband, owns a commercial flooring business. She said:


It's ridiculous—the better we do, the more the government takes … Every time we try to get ahead and don't rely on the welfare system, we get a guarantee they'll hit us again.


Ms Richards has summed up beautifully this government's fallback position: none shall get ahead. I can imagine the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport taking a quote from Gandalf. They shall not pass is what he is saying to Australian families. What this government will do with this bill is crucify both the economy and the health system.


According to this government, there are 2.4 million people living a life of privilege in this country, because that is how many people will be affected by this legislation. The result will be thousands—tens of thousands, I would say—of Australians dropping private health insurance because they simply cannot afford it anymore. In my electorate of Dawson, there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of residents who will be worse off. Families that are already under pressure from the escalating costs of living will have to make a saving somewhere else.


The minister has claimed 27,000 individuals would drop their health insurance cover if this bill were passed. But the government owned insurer Medibank Private suggests that figure is more, that in fact 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and a massive 92,500 people will downgrade their private health cover. That is just Medibank Private and what they see happening with their own members.


Taking an independent, industry-wide approach, the Australian Health Insurance Association commissioned Deloitte to assess the impact of this proposal. Their findings were that, should this bill be passed, 1.6 million consumers would drop private hospital cover, a further 4.3 million would downgrade their cover and a further 2.8 million would drop their general cover. Deloitte also has predicted that health insurance premiums would rise by 10 per cent over and above what they would otherwise be. So then everyone will cop it because of this government's bill.


As families and individuals leave private health in droves, this government will be rubbing its hands with glee. On the face of it—fingers crossed, guys!—that will be a massive saving for this year's budget deficit. It may be enough of a saving to create the illusion of a surplus. But the truth is that, for every dollar the government spends on health insurance rebates, the private health insurers are spending $2 on the provision of health services. Those private health services will now have to be provided by the public health system. What this government is hoping to do is throw a 'hospital pass' to the states for the sake of taxing Australian families and squeezing out its first surplus in 22 years.


Being a Queenslander, I find that a frightening proposition. The Labor government in Queensland has plumbed the very depths of incompetence already without having to cope with more pressure on its health service. Private hospitals currently treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia—some 3.5 million patients in the 2009-10 financial year. How will the bungling Queensland Health system—an organisation that the Premier tells us has failed under her watch—cope with their share of the increased workload? Private hospitals currently perform 64 per cent of elective surgeries in Australia. Where will the funding come from for the public health system to cope with such an increased workload?


In creating this 'damned if you do and damned if you don't' situation for families with private health cover, the government is basically kicking an own goal. Even if this white rabbit is combined with enough smoke and mirrors to create the illusion of a surplus, it will be just a matter of time before the mirrors crack and the smoke clears. When it does, Australian families who can no longer afford private health insurance will see nothing but a rotting rabbit carcass that carries the stench of deception, incompetence and betrayal.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:26):  I rise tonight to talk on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011. There are three points that I would like to make loud and clear. The first is that what we are debating tonight is an issue of trust—whether we can trust this government to say one thing before an election and then do that after an election. It is sad to say that this private health insurance piece of legislation that we are debating tonight adds to the list of broken promises. I would also like to discuss its implications on the cost of living, which is increasing on a daily basis for Australian citizens. This piece of legislation, sadly, will once again add to this cost of living. The third point I would like to make is about what this bill will do to cost shifting from the Commonwealth to the states. The state governments are already facing increased health costs. The Labor government on coming into power said that they were going to do something about that, that they were going to stop the blame game, that they were going to fix our health system. But what do we see them doing with this piece of legislation? They are moving the cost of health care away from the Commonwealth and onto the states. Those are the three issues that I would like to garner tonight.


I will start on the basic issue of trust. Truth is a five-letter word and I suggest to the Prime Minister—if it is okay, Madam Deputy Speaker—that she might learn how to spell it and act on it because, as we saw with the carbon tax, one thing was said before the last election and one thing was done after it. To be fair to the Prime Minister, on this occasion she was the member of a cabinet. She was not the Prime Minister but she was a member of the cabinet when the decision was made to say one thing before the 2007 election on the private health insurance rebate and then do another thing afterwards. But it was a precursor of what was to come.


Let us look at the letter that Kevin Rudd wrote to the honourable Dr Michael Armitage. I think it is worth just briefly going through it. It says:


Dear Dr Armitage,


Thankyou for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor’s policy regarding private health insurance.


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.


Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases. Zero per cent premium adjustment is not Labor policy;


I understand Nicola Roxon’s office has also confirmed with you that Federal Labor has no plans to require private health insurance funds to make equivalent payments to public hospitals for patients who elect to be treated as private patients.


I trust this allays your concerns. Federal Labor values its relationship with the private health insurance sector and we look forward to this continuing regardless of the election outcome on November 24.


As we know, Kevin Rudd was elected Prime Minister and Julia Gillard became a cabinet minister of the Rudd government. 




Mr Baldwin:
  And an assassin.




Mr TEHAN:
  And later an assassin, as my good friend the shadow minister for tourism so rightly interjects. As soon as they got in—the alarm bell should have been ringing there and then—the spending got out of control and the budget forecast did not look too good, and what was the first thing they did? They looked at the private health insurance rebate as a way of trying to get the budget back into a state which could give some sort of credibility to the Labor government's very poor efforts in managing the economy. Having been quite prepared immediately before the 2007 election to say one thing and then do completely the opposite afterwards, we should have known that this was a precursor of what the government was prepared to do on the carbon tax before the 2010 election.


Sadly, when it comes to this issue of truth, we have also seen it raise its ugly head when it comes to what happened on Australia Day. It seems very hard—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  Order! The member for Wannon will restrict his remarks to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill.




Mr TEHAN:
  One of the key points which need to be made on this bill is around the issue of trust.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member can make it in the context of the bill.




Mr TEHAN:
  The second point that I would like to make refers to cost of living. This piece of legislation will add to the cost of living in this country. Those on the other side may argue that this is a one-off in adding to the cost of living and therefore it is something that needs to be done. But the truth is that it is not a one-off. We have seen the price of insurance rise incredibly in the last three to six months. People have seen their bills go from $500 to $5,000 in the invoices they have been issued in the last couple of months. We have seen electricity prices rising exponentially, and they are going to get worse, sadly. We have seen the cost of child care rising. The cost of living is biting; it is hitting hard. What is the government's answer? To increase it even further. That is what this bill will do.


The sad thing is that the cost-of-living increase will hit those who can least afford it. It will hit the pensioners who save so that they can take out private health insurance and who want to have the surety of knowing that they can get the medical help they desire later in life. They will be the ones who will hang onto private health insurance. They will be the ones who have to put up with the increases in premiums. Because of the cost increase as a result of this decision, the more mobile, younger and healthier people will decide that they do not see a need to continue to take out private health insurance. This will put pressure on premiums. It will put pressure on those who want to take out full coverage—elderly Australians. Premiums will rise as a result of this decision by this government. Sadly, once again, we are going to see cost-of-living pressures on those who can least afford it as a result of this government's policy.


This is not only going to add to the cost of living. It will also add to the healthcare bills of state governments. When Labor was elected in 2007 it said it was going to stop the blame game when it came to the health sector in Australia. For too long, the Labor Party said, the argy-bargy between the states and the Commonwealth had led to the sector declining, to waiting lists growing and to people having to wait in emergency too long to get the attention that they need. Yet what do we see now? Firstly, we see the great reforms that were promised to the health sector amount to nothing. What was finally agreed did nothing to end the blame game. All it did was see the Commonwealth try to take some power off the states in the way the hospital system was managed without providing any real increases in finances to help the states do their job.


Now what are we seeing? We are seeing the Commonwealth come along and once again shift more costs onto the state government. There is no-one who argues against this fact leading to more pressure on our public health system. The Commonwealth should do the right thing by the states and say: 'We are going to take this decision to try to get our budget back in order. We have spent far too much on things like pink batts and school halls. We have wasted billions of dollars. We need to get our budget back in order. Therefore we are going to cost-shift on you. But we are going to do the right thing and help you do that. We are going to give you some of the cost to help you deal with the increased demand that you are going to see in the public health system.' They have not done that, so the states are going to have to cope with the increase in public hospital waiting lists which will occur as a result of this legislation. They are going to have to deal with the increase in demand in the emergency areas of hospitals which will occur as a result of these changes. And what are the Commonwealth doing to help the states deal with that? Nothing. They are blatantly cost shifting, and they need to own up and say that that is what they are doing. That is how desperate they have become to try to get a budget surplus in May, to try for the first time in over 21 years to get a Labor government budget surplus.


The Australian people will not be fooled by the way that this government is going about it. It is smoke and mirrors, and it is doing nothing to fix the structural imbalances that we currently have in the economy. These need to be fixed so that we can have a reduction in the $132 billion of net debt which will peak this year and so that we can see reductions in the way this government spends its money and in the way that it tries to account for getting its budget into surplus.


There are three points we need to look at. The first is the issue of trust, and I will make one simple point on that issue. I quote Nicola Roxon on 26 September 2007:


Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates.


What happened instead? Only a year or so later we saw a complete reversal of that explicit promise that was made to the Australian people before the 2007 election. That decision was made collectively by then Prime Minister Rudd and then cabinet minister Gillard.


The second thing this legislation will do is add to the already growing list of cost-of-living pressures that this government is putting on the Australian people: insurance costs, electricity costs, childcare costs and private health insurance costs. I could go on and on. The third thing that this bill will do is shift costs from the Commonwealth onto the states, and it will do it despite this government saying that it was determined to stop the blame game and to fix the Australian health system once and for all. It was very clear who was raising money, where the money would be spent and how the services would be delivered so that people could point to where the system was and was not working, rather than having the federal government and state government saying, 'The whole issue depends on the service delivery and the costs and you aren't getting that right.'


That is why I stand here today opposing these changes. They are a breach of trust, they will add to the cost of living and, worse than that, they will shift the cost of delivering health care from the Commonwealth to the states at a time when the states need help in delivering the services they want to deliver. They do not need extra costs being put on their health services.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:41):  I rise tonight to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011. It is a rather Orwellian name, for it is certainly not fairer and it certainly has nothing to do with incentives. If there was one single reason that this bill should be opposed it is the issue of credibility and trust. Even the learned member for Lyne has recently and openly stated that our current Prime Minister, and therefore our government, has a credibility problem.


Let us just have a look at what this Prime Minister and members of this government have said in the past on the issue of private health insurance. Exhibit No. 1 is a press release from Julia Gillard, shadow minister for health, transcript of doorstop interview, state parliament Melbourne, 22 August 2004:


Reporter: Can the Labor Party make a commitment to do with private insurance if they were to be elected?


Ms Gillard: Labor has committed to keeping the 30% private health insurance rebate.


I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's broken promise on keeping the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate contained in the press release dated 22 August 2004.


Leave not granted.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Exhibit No. 2 is the transcript of an interview on the Sunday program on 29 August 2004 between Laurie Oakes and the then shadow health minister and current Prime Minister:


Laurie Oakes: What about the 30 per cent health insurance subsidy?


Julia Gillard: We've said that we will keep the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. That is out there now in the community. It's a payment that's been factored into family budgets, into people who are working and struggling with the bills and the mortgage and the payments for the kids, and also into the family budgets of older Australians who have private health insurance.


It went on:


We will leave the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate undisturbed because we understand it's factored into family incomes.


I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's broken promise of 29 August 2004 in the interview with Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program.


Leave not granted.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Exhibit No. 3 is a transcript of an interview between Tony Jones and Julia Gillard on ABC's Lateline on 12 September 2006. It says:


Tony Jones: … Are you going to look again at the private health care rebate. Is that sacrosanct? 


Julia Gillard: No, the private health insurance rebate will be staying under Labor. We committed to that at the last election. Indeed, we committed to it at the election before. From time to time the Howard Government runs out with a scare campaign here but the private health insurance rebate will stay.


I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's broken promise on keeping the 30 per cent health insurance rebate contained in the transcript of the interview between Tony Jones and Julia Gillard on ABC's Lateline.


Leave not granted. 




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
 Exhibit No. 4 is a media statement dated 26 September 2007 entitled 'Liberal scare campaign on private health insurance rebates—Federal Labor to retain rebates'. It says:


Federal Labor rejects the Liberal scare campaign around the Private Health Insurance rebates.


… … …


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


… … …


The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates.


This is absolutely untrue.


I seek leave to table the Labor government's broken promises on keeping the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate contained in a media release dated 26 September 2007.


Leave not granted. 




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Exhibit No. 5 is a letter from the then federal Labor leader, the member for Griffith, to Dr Michael Armitage, CEO of the Health Insurance Association. It reads:


Dear Dr Armitage,


Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor’s policy regarding private health insurance.


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per rebates for older Australians.


…   …   …


I trust this allays your concerns.


I seek leave to table the letter from the then federal Labor leader to the Australian Health Insurance Association containing the broken promise on keeping the 30 per cent health insurance rebate.


Leave not granted. 




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Exhibit No. 6 is from the Hobart Mercury and is a letter of 2 September 2004 from the current Prime Minister, and then shadow minister for health. It states: 'Tasmanian Liberal deputy leader told two lies in the Mercury when he said that a Labor government would scrap the private health insurance rebate. I grow tired of saying this: Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.'


I seek leave to table the letter in the Hobart Mercury of the current Prime Minister, and then shadow minister for health, dated 2 September 2004, containing this further broken promise that Labor was committed to maintaining the health insurance rebate.


Leave not granted. 




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  What a surprise; they simply do not want to know. Does anyone see a pattern here with the infamous broken promise on the carbon tax? Not only do we have Labor misleading the public on important policy issues but they take the misrepresentation further by accusing those dastardly Liberals of a scare campaign by daring to suggest that Labor cannot be trusted. 


It is not just broken promises on the health insurance rebate and the carbon tax. We have seen this government mislead the member for Denison and leave him hanging out to dry. We have seen them mislead the public on the issue of gay marriage. But I think the most appalling example of this government's misleading conduct is their statement in regard to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. For the Prime Minister to get up in front of a room full of disabled people and their carers at last year's national disability awards and claim that the NDIS will be the defining achievement of this government, when they have not committed one brass razoo and not one single cent to funding for the NDIS was absolutely shameful.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I remind the member for Hughes that we are debating the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and to remain within the parameters of that bill.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  This pattern of repeated misleading conduct not only has destroyed the Prime Minister's credibility but is weakening our entire democracy. What person is ever going to believe another word that this Labor government says. If they told you it was raining outside, you would need to go outside and check for yourself. If this bill is passed, as we go into the next election—based on this government's track record—any commitment, any promise, is not going to be worth the paper it is written on. 


I say to the Independents: there is a heavy responsibility upon you when it comes to voting for this legislation. In years past, the Independents have justified their place in this parliament by sitting here under the motto of 'keeping the bastards honest'. But if the Independents vote with Labor on this bill, they will have simply aided and abetted this government's dishonesty. 


This bill has nothing to do with attempting to improve health insurance. It has nothing to do with creating more hospital beds. It has nothing to do with improving health services. It is all about a short-term revenue grab—a desperate attempt to cook the books to show a wafer-thin surplus in the next financial year. This is despite having run up the four largest budget deficits in Australian history—a combined total of $167 billion. The so-called saving from this bill of $2.8 billion is a further cooking of the books for it does not take into account the $3.8 billion in additional costs that will be generated down the line and generated on state budgets. Make no mistake, this government's inability to manage a budget is the only reason we are debating this bill here today, and today, as every day, they are showing how little they care for the challenging costs of living faced by people in Sydney and the rest of our other major cities and country areas. 


If this bill passes parliament, it will start off a vicious circle which will ultimately punish working families. Firstly, with so many cost-of-living pressures being inflicted by this government—electricity prices, childcare costs and the spectre of the carbon tax predicted to fall on the economy like a sledgehammer—removing this rebate will simply see people either downgrade their existing private health insurance or drop it altogether, thereby pushing more people into the public health system. A Deloitte analysis has shown that in the first year 175,000 people would withdraw from private health insurance cover and a further 583,000 people would downgrade their coverage. The answer is obvious to reasonable Australians: by driving people away from private health insurance, the cost of premiums for those that remain in the system will be forced up. The Deloitte analysis predicts a 10 per cent rise in premiums above what they would otherwise be. With fewer people paying for private health insurance, existing premiums will continue to increase, thereby setting off another round of people either downgrading their private health insurance or dropping it altogether—again, pushing another lot of people away from the private system and into the public health system. 


The report goes on to estimate that, over five years, 1.6 million Australians will drop their cover and a further 4.3 million will downgrade it. Ultimately, the people who will be most hurt by this bill are the Australians earning less than $50,000 that make up 50 per cent of Australians with health insurance. It will lengthen hospital queues. It will cause pain, suffering and hardship. Millions of Australian families that are doing their bit for the economy, even though they are already struggling with cost of living pressures, will be hurt by this bill. No wonder there are no government members left on the other side to defend this broken promise which will penalise Australian families at the time when they can least afford it. 


In my seat of Hughes there are 91,000 people that rely on their private health insurance cover, and many of these 91,000 people will be forced to fork out an additional $935 a year. That has been made clear by the recent Deloitte report. This bill—the so-called Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill—and its associated bills will rip support from families doing the right thing by our public health system. The millions of Australian families that will be hurt by this bill are doing their bit for the country, even though they are already struggling with cost-of-living pressures—and this will only be made worse by the carbon tax. We are again seeing Labor driving the dagger of cost of living into the heart of middle-class working families. Shame on this government for introducing this bill, and shame on every Labor member who votes for it. I call on the Independents to live up to the motto 'keep the bastards honest' and vote against this bill.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (18:55):  I rise to oppose the deceptively entitled Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and two cognate bills. I describe these bills in this way particularly because the content of this legislation is anything but fair. It does not matter how much the government tries to dress these bills up; it will not change the fact that it proposes a severe impact on families, the private health industry and public health services in Brisbane and across the nation. 


In Australia we face many policy challenges in the area of health. As the population and the average life span continues to grow, the demand on our health system will increase quite dramatically. The percentage of health spending in state government budgets increases every single year, yet they seem to make very little progress when the waiting lists grow longer and longer. That is why it is important to ensure that as many people as possible have the capacity to purchase private health insurance to alleviate the pressure on our public health system.


The Howard government recognised this. According to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council 2009-10 annual report to the government, in the 15 years between 1984 and 1998 the percentage of Australians with private health cover had halved to just a little over 30 per cent of the population. To fix this decline in membership, the then government—which I was proud to be a part of—introduced a number of initiatives: in 1997 the one per cent Medicare levy surcharge for high-income earners who had not taken out private health insurance and the 30 per cent premium tax rebate for taxpayers who had taken out some form of private health insurance. These policy measures worked. The take-up of private health insurance has taken off since then—so much so that last year $12.4 billion in benefits was paid to some of the 11.7 million Australians who now hold some form of private health insurance cover. This is approximately 52 per cent of the Australian population. This is also reflected in my electorate of Brisbane where 89,920 persons are covered by some form of private health insurance, and 66,676 of these are voters. This equates to 72.1 per cent of the voting population, which is 20 per cent above the national average. 


This Labor government wants to undo this great work through the suite of bills we have here before us tonight. It is the third time they have come before this chamber. They were rejected twice by the Senate in the last parliament, and yet here we go again. These bills create a three-tier system in the private health insurance rebate, slashing the rebate and increasing the Medicare levy surcharge for Australian taxpayers within certain income categories. The rhetoric coming out of the Labor Party is that somehow this is rectifying a situation where the rich are being subsidised for their private health insurance by those on lower incomes. Yet, under tier 1, the rebate is slashed by 10 per cent for singles earning over $80,000 and couples earning over $160,000 per year. Let us be clear about this: we are talking here about a teacher married to a policeman. These are the hardworking forgotten Australians aspiring to success. Since the announcement of these measures there has been a litany of evidence produced showing the absolutely disastrous impact that they would have on the public hospital system and the private health insurance industry. These changes will do one thing and one thing only: they will force people to drop their private health cover or choose cheaper cover with more procedures excluded, thus creating upward pressure on premiums and forcing more people into an overcrowded, overstretched public health service system. Every dollar of funding provided for the private health insurance rebate actually saves $2 of costs that are then paid by the private health insurers. Private hospitals in this country treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia and in 2009-10 they treated 3.5 million patients. They performed some 64 per cent of elective surgery in Australia.


Treasury projected that following these changes only 25,000 high-income consumers would withdraw their cover across the whole sector. This was then clearly proven to be inaccurate when the government-owned insurer Medibank Private came out and said 37,000 of its members alone would drop their cover and some 92,500 members would downgrade—an enormous number of people. A report into these measures by the highly regarded consultancy firm Deloitte for the Australian Health Insurance Association produces some very, very telling findings. Their analysis relies on the results of a survey by ANOP Research Services of 2,000 holders of private health cover on their intentions and the effect of a slashing of the rebates.


I note that the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, in her second reading speech took aim at the ANOP survey, saying it was wildly inaccurate, but she cannot ignore the fact that she was the health minister then. It was a very simple survey asking people what their intentions were and the importance of the rebate to them. It was really interesting to note that one of the people who designed and interpreted the survey was none other than Mr Rod Cameron, who for many years was an ALP pollster and numbers man. So his expertise and his wonderful work was good enough for the Labor Party to use and to rely on over many years, yet as soon as he produces something that they do not like they do not want to hear about it—they attack the work that he produces.


I will not go through the entirety of the Deloitte assessment. However, I do want to quote a brief passage from the executive summary, which summarises the findings. It states:


Significant numbers of consumers will withdraw from their private hospital cover (1.6 million consumers over five years) or downgrade to lower levels of private health cover (4.3 million consumers over five years) following the proposed policy change.


The Deloitte assessment has some very significant figures here. It also says:


Significant numbers of consumers will also withdraw from their general treatment cover (2.8 million consumers over five years) or downgrade to lower levels of private health cover (5.7 million consumers over five years) following the proposed policy change.


The interesting fact that it also mentions is that private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what would otherwise be expected. So we have a situation whereby premiums will rise and private health cover will become less affordable for consumers—and that is not just those in those tiers. As people withdraw from private health insurance, the burden on publicly provided health services will continue to rise and rise. These findings indicate that the cost of treating consumers in the public hospital system is going to rise substantially above what is currently anticipated by the government. Deloitte estimates that the additional operating costs accumulated over five years will be $3.8 billion—$1.4 billion in the fifth year alone.


These findings are a damning indictment on the measures included in these bills. All because of what? The inability of the ALP to manage Australia's finances responsibly—that is what this is all about. So what do they do? Since the election of the Rudd government in 2007, the billions of dollars of waste and government expenditure have been absolutely scandalous. We know the stories of the pink batt waste, the $900 cheques being paid to deceased persons and the school halls program, just to name a few. The Labor Party is desperate to find a way to deliver the budget surplus and turn around a $37 billion budget deficit. These proposals are nothing more than a lazy financial quick fix and are not based on any sound policy whatsoever.


Whenever the Labor Party finds itself in a mess, they revert to class warfare. We saw it in question time last week when the Prime Minister was asked about private health insurance. They are interested only in creating a class warfare situation and this is, of course, absolute nonsense. The only contribution the Labor Party has to make in this country is to play the politics of envy. In this case, this supposed attack on 'the rich' will end up hurting the low- and middle-income families in my electorate the most.


I will always stand up in this place for the constituents of the electorate of Brisbane. On behalf of the 89,920 people in my electorate who have private health insurance cover, I will oppose these bills.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (19:06):  I rise to speak to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and related bills that are before the House. The intent of the bill is to reduce the private health insurance rebate and increase the Medicare Levy Surcharge for those people who opt out of private health insurance, because it will become prohibitively expensive without the rebate.


It is a fundamental right of all Australians to expect that they will receive quality health care. It is the coalition's view that this is best done by giving people choice in the form of access to affordable health care providers, thereby relieving the pressure on the public health system. It is the coalition's view that access to health care should not be ideologically driven, and it should not be socially engineered. But that is precisely what is happening with this legislation.


There are a few issues here. One is that the Labor government is philosophically opposed to the notion of choice. The second is that the Labor government is scrambling to balance its books before this year's budget and it needs to find the dollars where it can. The third is the impact that this legislation will have on the hard-working people of my community of Longman.


When the coalition government introduced the private health insurance incentives that Australians currently enjoy it increased the ability of many households to choose. In fact, private health insurance coverage increased from 34 per cent of the population to 44 per cent. More Australians have more choice now. Those Australians who do not have private health insurance can access the public system.


But those of us who have gone through the public health system for care have seen firsthand the pressure it is under. There is no denying that much needs to be done to improve the public health system. It is fortunate that we are not holding our breath for delivery on former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's promise to fix the public health system and end the so-called blame game once and for all.


However, imagine what the pressure on the public health system is going to look like if Australians already labouring under soaring cost-of-living pressures decide to jettison their private health insurance because they simply cannot afford it. Some 2.4 million people will be affected by the increased cost of private health insurance. For those in the first income tier, premiums will increase by 14 per cent; for those in the second tier, premiums will increase by 29 per cent; and, for those in the third tier, premiums will rise by a huge 43 per cent. The Labor government claims that the impact these changes will have will be negligible. It claims that only 27,000 people will drop their private health insurance and that this will result in only 8,500 additional hospital admissions.


That is not what Medibank Private is saying and it is not what Deloitte is saying. Medibank Private has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover and a further 92,500 will downgrade. Deloitte's analysis indicates that 175,000 people will dump their private health insurance and 583,000 will downgrade in the first year alone. Over five years, it is expected that 1.6 million people will drop their private health insurance and 4.3 million people will downgrade their cover.


What does this mean for allied health services—physiotherapists, for example? There has been no talk about the impact this legislation will have on ancillary cover, which is so vital to ensuring the continuing viability of the allied health sector. This legislation represents a removal of choice for Australian families. It is ideologically driven by a government which does not support Australians being able to decide what is best for them. And for what possible benefit? Family budgets are under pressure and the public health system is under pressure. These measures are only going to make those pressures worse.


Apart from ideology, the Labor government could have only one other reason for introducing this legislation—it is desperate to claw back some of the money it has squandered in reckless spending on failed programs. To do so, the government is attacking private health insurance. What other explanation can there be for yet another litany of broken promises from this government? On 27 September 2007, just before the 2007 election, the current health minister said that Labor rejected what she called 'the Liberal scare campaign around the private health insurance rebates.' She said:


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


It is crystal clear now—crystal clear that this was just another promise made just before an election and destined for the wastebasket of this Labor government's electoral opportunism.


What is really important to me is the effect that this legislation will have on my community of Longman. As I have said on numerous occasions in this place, life is getting harder for the families in my community and they are doing it really tough. The price of everything is going up—electricity, water, food, fuel, car registration and the public transport that so many working families in my community rely on to access the city where they work. It is getting more and more difficult for the hardworking members of my community to make ends meet.


Yet again, this high-taxing and recklessly spending Labor government is determined to make the lives of ordinary Australians harder. And this legislation will do just that. Many members of my community have contacted me, increasingly angry about the fact that this Labor government is not acting in their best interests. It is destroying confidence, spending recklessly and taxing and taxing and taxing.


But there is another issue here and that is the effect that an exodus from private health insurance will have on health services in my community. The hardworking medical staff at the Caboolture Hospital do a fantastic job, but they need more resources. Demands on local health services are already too high for the infrastructure that is available and demand will only increase with population growth. Waiting times, unrealistic nursing workloads, insufficient funding and the services available to mental health patients are among issues that are raised with me all the time.


During the last election campaign, issues around the Caboolture Hospital were among the greatest concerns expressed by the people of Longman. Just recently, a distressed father of a young baby wrote to me to say that he had had to wait for 12 hours before his child could be seen. The locals in my community deserve to be confident that, when their child has a raging ear infection after hours, they are not going to have to wait most of the night to be seen. When you are taken by ambulance to the hospital with an acute emergency, you should not be 'ramped' or redirected to another hospital across South-East Queensland.


According to the Department of Health and Ageing, the population in my region is expected to reach some 200,000 people. However, at the moment the underresourced Caboolture Hospital has 187 beds available and 21 bays in the emergency department. It is estimated that, to meet the demand of the growing population, 600 beds and 52 emergency bays will be required to service the region by 2026. According to the AMA the Caboolture Hospital is operating, on average, at over 100 per cent occupancy, showing significant overstrain of capacity. A safe occupancy rate is an average of only 85 per cent.


The expansion of the Caboolture Hospital is of fundamental importance to the people of Longman. Everyone in the community wants it to happen—the locals, the medical staff at the hospital. It is one of the keys to growing our region and making it a desirable place to live. But with this legislation, even if the people of Longman were to see a long awaited expansion of the hospital, the increased pressure placed on services because of the increased number of people no longer able to access private health care would negate the benefits of any expansion.


This legislation represents yet another betrayal of the trust of the Australian people. We are getting used to it now with this Labor government, but that does not make it right. The price of private health care will increase for so many families at a time when they are already struggling to balance their books. The exodus from private health care will place additional pressure on an already overburdened public health system. In my community, I know that the many families who have contacted me regarding soaring costs of living will jettison their private health cover because it will be unaffordable for them. The pressure on the Caboolture Hospital will become even worse than it already is, causing even more distress for my community. In conclusion, that is why, as a member of the coalition, I will not be supporting these bills.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (19:15): The fairer private health insurance legislation represents almost $2.8 billion being ripped out of the pockets of Australians who hold private health insurance. At the last election the Labor Party, in their dishonest ads, talked about the Leader of the Opposition taking $1 billion from health when it was actually a $10 billion increase in public hospital funding, but here we have a clear example of the Labor Party ripping out almost $2.8 billion, with their hands in the pockets of ordinary Australian families and individuals who are having a go, who are covering themselves and covering their families with private health insurance. Is this money going to health? No, it is just an inevitable consequence of the fact that the Labor Party have lost control of spending. They have wasted billions of dollars on pink batts and billions of dollars on school halls, and now, unfortunately, we are seeing broken election promises—a consequence of the fact that, as usual with a Labor government, they have lost control of their spending.


We on this side of the House understand that private health insurance plays a key role in reducing waiting lists and keeping pressure off the already struggling public hospital system. It allows people to have a choice of doctor, a choice of specialist, a choice of surgeon, a choice of anaesthetist and a choice of hospital. The coalition have always recognised this and will continue to fight for the role of private health insurance in our health system.


In a sense this is history repeating itself. When Labor were last in power the level of people covered by private health insurance plummeted from 50 per cent of the population to a low of 30 per cent in the mid-1990s. A number of Labor government decisions made during the second term of the Hawke-Keating government, between 1984 and 1986, had the effect of ripping money away from people who had private health insurance. As a result of those decisions Labor took when last in office we saw premiums rise by almost 40 per cent. The consequence was that people dropped out and as younger, fitter, healthier people dropped out the insured pool become more likely to claim and the premiums rose, in a vicious cycle. That required the introduction of the private health insurance rebate, along with lifetime health cover, in 1999, which arrested and reversed that fall in private health cover. In 2004 we came up with the proposal for increased rebates for people over 65 and people over 70 in recognition of the fact that many people on the age pension or part pensions and self-funded retirees were on fixed incomes and holding private health insurance. We needed to do this to make sure that private health insurance in Australia was on a sustainable footing.


Unfortunately, as I said before, Labor have a track record of dismantling private health. For the current Prime Minister's views on private health insurance there is no better guide than The Latham Diaries. That book shows how ideologically opposed to private health insurance the Prime Minister was when she was the Labor Party spokesperson for health. In fact, as we heard in question time today, the current Prime Minister gave an ironclad guarantee when she was shadow minister for health that the Labor Party would maintain the rebates. Her robust defence seemed to be that 'we did break that promise in 2007 but we took it to the 2010 election so then it was okay'. That ignores that the ironclad guarantee had an expiry date of not much more than 15 months into the Rudd government. I will come to that later.


Private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia—3½ million patients in 2009-10. It covers the majority of elective surgery. Around 12 million Australians hold private health insurance—52.9 per cent of the population—and 45.6 per cent have hospital treatment cover. Of these people, any single earning over $83,000 per annum and any couple earning over $166,000 per annum will see their rebates reduced, with those on higher incomes receiving no rebate at all. These changes will mean a return to the old days of people dropping out of private health insurance left, right and centre. Around 2.4 million people will be directly affected by immediate increases in their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent or 43 per cent, depending on their income tier. Deloitte has predicted that up to 1.6 million Australians will drop their cover over the next five years. They have also forecast that up to 4.3 million Australians will downgrade their cover over the next five years and that premiums will increase 10 per cent above what they otherwise would have. We will see an extra 845,000 Australians admitted to public hospitals and an extra $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs for the public hospital system. It is worth noting that the government maintains that only 25,000 people will drop their private health insurance under its modelling compared to the 1.6 million modelled by the Deloitte analysis. There is quite a discrepancy there—the Deloitte analysis is 64 times the government's predictions. Medibank Private, the government owned insurer, claims that 37,000 of their members will drop private health insurance. They are about a third of the market in Australia. Just extrapolating the Medibank Private numbers, this measure will see more than 100,000 Australians drop private health insurance. This shows that the government's claim of only 25,000 is not realistic.


It is not just those on higher incomes who are going to be affected—5.6 million Australians with private health cover have annual household incomes of less than $50,000, and of those 3.4 million have annual household incomes of less than $35,000. Despite Labor's rhetoric, private health cover is not just for the rich. It has always been this way. People on age pensions, part pensions and self-funded retirees all maintain private health insurance. People on fixed incomes and those in low income households will be hurt most by this move. It is the part-pension recipients, self-funded retirees and young people who will be hurt the most from this. Young families who have responsibly taken out private health cover will be hurt. These people have all sacrificed to secure their own health and this government want to impose an extra financial burden when cost-of-living pressures are already so high.


These people may not be hit with a reduction in their rebate but they will be hit by premium rises as a secondary consequence of people dropping their private health cover. This is very simply a broken promise by the Labor government. These broken promises are stacking up, day by day. It is a betrayal of the electorate and a betrayal of the 12 million Australians with private health insurance.


Just four days out from the 2007 federal election, Kevin Rudd wrote to Dr Michael Armitage, the chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, and said, 'Both my shadow minister for health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Labor will maintain lifetime health cover and the Medicate levy surcharge.' That was clear cut and black and white in writing.


It is clear now that this is just a first step for the Labor government. Labor have delivered four budgets since they were elected in 2007 and in every single budget they have proposed to rip money out of private health insurance or to slug people to take out private health insurance. My prediction is that if Labor have the chance, this will be just the first step. There will be many more bills like this where Labor will continue to undermine private health, to wind back the support for private health and to continue their relentless attack on the private health insurance rebates. In every budget delivered by the Labor Party, they have attacked private health insurance. 


This bill has already been rejected by the Senate on two separate occasions, yet the government continue. They just cannot let it go. The Labor Party hate private health care. They pursue this as an ideological argument, without considering or even caring about the consequences. This government cannot manage money. They have wasted billions and billions of taxpayers' money—for example, pink batts; and the school halls, which schools did not want. In health, you need only look to the $650 million GP superclinics program, where there is no proof that a single hospital has seen a reduction in waiting times for patients arriving at the emergency department. Because of this endless waste by this reckless government, they are now looking to dismantle effective measures like the private health insurance rebates to plug the hole in their budget. For those opposite, this is not about the good health of Australians; it is about balancing the bottom line of their budget which they have lost control of.


The effect of this legislation on my electorate of Boothby is going to be very detrimental. There are 96,728 people in Boothby who are covered by private health insurance—72.3 per cent of voters on the roll have private health insurance, 63.3 per cent of voters hold hospital treatment insurance and 71.5 per cent hold general insurance for extras. There are two private hospitals in my electorate which are likely to be affected, Flinders Private Hospital and Griffith private hospital. Glenelg Community Hospital and Ashford Hospital sit outside my electorate, but are frequently used by the residents of Boothby.


Voters in Boothby will take a very dim view of the Labor Party's decision. This is a bad measure for Australia and a bad measure for my electorate. It is such a bad measure that over 2,000 residents in my electorate have petitioned to have the private health insurance rebate retained intact. It is a petition that I will be presenting later this week. The opposition have no choice but to oppose this measure, as we did in 2009 and in 2010.

Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (19:29):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011. As some of my colleagues have already stated, we are debating a betrayal of the Australian people, a betrayal of 11 million Australians who contribute to private health insurance arrangements. Forty-five per cent of households in my electorate of Solomon have private health insurance arrangements. Over 40,000 people are covered by these arrangements—40,000 Territorians who are being betrayed by the Gillard Labor government. This is the very same government that promised at the last election that there would be no carbon tax under the government the Prime Minister led. We all know where that promise ended.


As has been reported in media outlets by many commentators, Australia's healthcare system—and I refer to the balance in the relationship between public and private providers—is envied by many overseas countries. The Treasurer himself is on record with regular reference to how Australia is the envy of the world. It is apparent that our current healthcare system, if media commentators are to be believed, is in fact envied outside our shores. To refer to a turn of phrase distinctive to our vernacular, if it ain't broke then don't fix it. 


Along with nearly 53 per cent of the country or some 12 million other Australians, I pay into private health insurance. My husband and I recognise the importance of having private health insurance. We recognise the importance of choice and we recognise the value of not relying upon and adding to an already overworked and stretched public health system. Further, we recognise that with an ageing population the reliance on health care will increase, as will the pressures on both the public and private providers. Statistics show that in the 2009-10 financial year private hospitals treated some 3.5 million patients across Australia, with those private hospitals responsible for the delivery of 64 per cent of elective surgeries.


Australians in general have an expectation for the delivery of certain services. Health care is one of those areas of expectation. An Ipsos survey this year found 64 per cent of the population believe that the $4.5 billion the government spends on the health rebate is a good use of taxpayer money. At present, 5.6 million Australians who pay private health insurance have an annual household income less than $50,000. Further, 3.4 million Australians with an annual household income of less than $35,000 pay into private health insurance—a further example of the value placed on this commodity by Australian citizens. Astute Australians, mums and dads, singles, the aged—in fact, Australians from all walks of life—all currently pay for private health insurance, yet the current federal Labor government wants to change this. Why? The system is not broke. The Deloitte analysis of the changes proposed by this government, if passed, are expected to see many of those astute Australians I have mentioned who pay into private health insurance funds withdraw from private health or downgrade their current level of cover. The government's own insurer, Medibank Private, predict that potentially 37,000 of their existing members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade their cover, yet the Minister for Health has claimed that some 27,000 people across the entire sector could potentially withdraw from private health care—a considerable discrepancy. How can this government get it so wrong so often?


At present the existing private health rebate is 30 per cent with an increase to 35 per cent and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Proposed changes will see the introduction of three new income tiers. The first tier will see a reduction of the healthcare rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for singles with an annual income of between $80,000 and $93,000 and families with a combined income of between $160,000 and $186,000. Aged Australians between 65 and 69 years will see their rebate reduced from 35 per cent to 25 per cent and for those aged 70 and over the rebate will fall from 40 per cent to 30 per cent. Without looking beyond the first tier, it is quite evident that this government assumes any single or family whose income exceeds the thresholds to be wealthy. I am reliably informed by my constituents that this is not the case.


Many in remote, regional and rural Australia—who already pay additional costs associated with supply and delivery of goods and services; who already pay dearly for childcare facilities, for basic food commodities for fuel; who go without the advantages associated with pricing competition similar to that within urban environments; and who pay mortgages or who pay rent—are far from rich. These average Australians continue to struggle and should not be considered wealthy. Within my own electorate of Solomon, many of the constituents I have spoken to on this issue are angry. I paraphrase: they are sick to death of being bashed by this Labor government on a daily basis for apparently being wealthy. When I say 'constituents', I refer to people from all walks of life, from small business operators to businesses who employ staff to contractors, from police officers to nurses, to public servants and teachers, all hardworking aspirants of this country. All of them sound the same drum and sing the same song. These proposed changes are not about improving our health services but about the inability of the current government to balance its books. Once again, it is the working backbone of the country who will be hurt—those who already give and continue to give towards every tax and levy imposed by a government in crisis. 


This Labor government does not understand that healthcare costs vary from region to region, as do wages, but no consideration has been given to the high cost of living facing Territorians today. Many young families I know will be affected if this legislation is passed, and they are already struggling. Like me, the member for New England believes that this new health tax being imposed by the Gillard Labor government will be very bad for regional hospitals and in fact regional health services. What I do not understand is, if the member for New England believes this legislation will be bad for regional hospitals and regional Australians, why the member for Lyne has not arrived at the same conclusion. Then we have the member for Denison. In his electorate six out of 10 people have private health insurance. Surely, the message to him is quite clear: he must not support this legislation. This legislation will most certainly put pressure on public hospitals. It will absolutely take more money out of people's household budgets. At a time when Australians are already facing extra cost-of-living pressures, Prime Minister Gillard's new health tax is just not sustainable. This government has a history of broken promises. A case in point: in October 2007 the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, the Hon. Dr Michael Armitage, sought clarification from Labor's federal opposition leader in respect to its private health insurance policy. The response to Dr Armitage, signed by the then federal Labor leader, Mr Kevin Rudd, stated:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 percent general rebate and the 35 to 40 percent rebates for older Australians.


The response further included that Labor would maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance. What has happened in the interim? We have a government that finds itself in difficult economic circumstances largely of its own making, a government that started out with money in the bank and an economy strong and vibrant, an economy with stability. Today we see circumstances in which the government has spent billions and billions of taxpayer dollars to the point where we now have the fourth-largest deficit of any Australian government in history.


It is evident from the comments from my constituents that they clearly understand the impetus of why this government now wishes to tinker with the private health system—the envy of many other nations—not for the betterment of the system or as a value-add for the Australian taxpayer but for fiscal reasons. Simply put, the government is desperate to find money to try and fill the black hole which continues to expand. This is bad policy and it is the third time this parliament has considered this legislation. The first was in 2009. It was against a backdrop of commitment by the member for Griffith, the then federal Labor leader, in 2007 when he affirmed:


Federal Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process of approval of premium increases.


These three bills as introduced failed on that occasion. But here we are in 2012 again debating measures to alter the status quo in terms of private health insurance.


As I indicated earlier, many of my constituents are angry. The impact of the potential changes will impact the back pockets of most Australians with increased private health insurance premiums. The changes will impose an enormous compliance burden on the industry and individuals completing their tax returns. Private health insurers will have to make significant changes to their systems to be able to adjust premiums according to incomes. It is still not clear how the rebate will be administered under the new arrangements, especially where a person is not able to accurately predict their income for the current or the future financial year. Deloitte's analysis of the changes show that in the first year 175,000 people will be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 will downgrade. Over five years it is expected that 1.6 million will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. These figures are absolutely alarming.


I would like to go back to the sentiments of my constituents.  The following was sent to me by a constituent whose name is Lee. In her own words she said:


… ""the harder I work the luckier I get"". I want to share my journey in becoming the new ""bashed and hated wealthy"" My husband and I started our working life as bank teller and a refrigeration mechanic. We built a 3 bedroom 1 bathroom house in—


the suburbs of—


Adelaide, which was all we could afford. We raised 2 boys initially on 1 wage. My husband Chris had to take on additional work on weekends just to pay the mortgage and keep food on the table when interest rates reached 16% in the early 80's


We both worked to provide the boys with private school education. Family holidays were camping trips in an old camper trailer and when the boys left home we moved to the NT—


Northern Territory—


and started our own business


The journey of Lee and Chris is similar to that of many others that have worked hard, raised families, and understood the need to provide for themselves in retirement. In Lee's own words:


… this labor government hates us, it hates the fact we have some degree of financial comfort, it hates the fact we have private health insurance, it hates the fact we were prepared to work hard to provide the best education for our children. We are the people that got the hit from the flood levy, we are the people that are now to be hit by the health rebate means test, and next we will be the same people that will be hit by less money for private schools. We are small business people, we employ others, we pay tax, we look after ourselves in retirement, we are the backbone of this country and NOW UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT WE ARE HATED


How concerning is this sentiment? But this is exactly what this Labor government is doing: it is trying to bring back the class war, turning hardworking people that do have aspirations for a better life against those that do not.


In conclusion, this piece of legislation is absolutely not about a health policy. This is about a government trying to rip money out of people's back pockets as a patch-up for the waste and mismanagement that this government has undertaken over the last four years. This is bad policy and I will be voting against this piece of legislation as this bill is not about 'Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives'. This is another Labor broken promise. This is another betrayal of the Australian people.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (19:43):  I rise to oppose the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and the suite of related bills. I do so on the basis that what is proposed means that there is a reduction—and I will not cite all the figures because they have been evident in all the speeches that I have been listening to during the course of the day—and it will impact on the health system. When I first entered parliament during the reform period under the Rudd government—and later in its continuation with the Gillard government—I saw incredible hope and opportunity for the reforms to be effective and for the private sector, through private sector funding, to be a key player in all of this and I saw that the 30 per cent levy would allow people the opportunity of moving between the health services provided within both public hospitals and the private sector. I give an example of St John of God in Perth that has robotic surgery for men who have prostate cancer. The cost of that is significantly high and the difference in price is covered by the private health insurance that is provided through membership and underpinned by the 30 per cent element that assists people to continue with their private health insurance.


The other thing that disappoints me is that A healthier future for all Australians talked about a continuity of care, access to specialist services and the ability to be part of making a choice about the type of healthcare service delivery you would access and the point at which you would access it. The National Partnerships Agreements that have been negotiated make reference to the fact that all Australians should have the opportunity of moving between the choices that exist for them, but they do not always have the capacity to pay. There are private and government hospitals that have differing services and certainly a significant number of the specialists tend to operate within the private health sector.  If you are covered by private health insurance, your movement through the elective surgery waiting lists and surgery is enhanced because you are sometimes advised to take the opportunity to book into a private hospital in order to expedite that service. It means that you do not remain on a waiting list for a substantial period of time.


But the articles that have been appearing in the papers in recent times have made some very interesting points for this debate. The headline in the Australian today was 'Both sides failing the test on health'. It states: 


Labor's policy lacks coherence but this should not let the opposition off the hook. 


The article says:


First, as the public and private systems compete for health professionals, it would increase costs and reduce quality in the public system. Second, it will make the PHI even less affordable for low-income consumers, ensuring that we truly do end up with two healthcare systems: one for the better off, who will be forced to have private cover, and one for those with lower incomes, who will have to rely on the public hospitals.


Again, 'Gillard confident on health rebate' was a headline in the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday, 7 February:


Prime Minister Julia Gillard said yesterday taxpayers should not have to subsidise private health insurance for wealthy people and the government would continue discussions to get the changes passed.


…   …   …


Greens leader Bob Brown yesterday softened his party's resistance … 


""We don't believe people should be penalised because they make the choice to go the public health system,"" he said. We are continuing to talk with the government.


I have been dismayed also by the fact that there have been a number of speakers on that side of the House who referred to a welfare or class system when it comes to the subsidisation of the health rebate, because to me it is not that. I think we have to be serious in considering that we want to encourage people to access the opportunities to reduce the burden on the public hospital system.


One of the continued debates I had when I worked in health, when we used to meet as an executive, concerned the choking of public hospitals with people who could not access the private health sector or access specialists whose time was principally involved with the private health sector. What worries me with this one is that, if these figures about the 1.6 million consumers dropping their health insurance or the number that fall in under each of the tiers are correct, we will see an increase in the number of people accessing the public hospital system. That in itself will increase the requirement for funding to meet those health needs when it could be covered within the private health sector.


In reading through the National Partnership Agreements, there are some provisions for increased funding where there are pressure points within the public health sector under each state and territory's jurisdiction and to negotiate a variation to those actual costs. I suspect that we will see an increase in requests for additional funding by states and territories. With that in mind, today's Hobart Mercury had the headline 'Private insurance bypass—Doctors warn rebate changes will up pressure on public hospitals'. The article states:


Tasmania's public hospitals will be hit with more patients under plans to means test the private health rebate, the Australian Medical Association says. Premiums are tipped to rise by up to $1000 a year for families from 1 July with Gillard government legislation to be voted on in coming days. 


…   …   …


AMA Tasmanian president John Davis said … 


""What we're already seeing is the Royal Hobart Hospital working at capacity at what should be a quiet time of the year.""


If that is the case at a quiet time, then those proposed changes will have a significant impact on hospitals. I was down in Tasmania recently and I was speaking with a senior official from health who indicated that the quantum of money received to provide for their hospitals and for the types of services required for the public of Tasmania is not sufficient. On that basis, I suspect that we will see health ministers coming back to the discussions with the federal minister seeking to increase their share of the Commonwealth funding that would assist in the provision of the health care that we expect and take for granted in this country.


I know that the Minister for Health believes these changes will ensure that those with a greater capacity to pay will make a larger contribution towards the cost of their private health insurance. The government says it will ensure that government support for private health insurance remains fair and sustainable in the future. This is simply not the case. In my electorate of Hasluck, which is geographically and economically diverse, there are many people who are feeling the pressure points of increased costs of living. Those increased costs of living are impacting on their capability and capacity to pay their private health insurance premiums. I have had constituents say to me that they will be dropping the level of contribution they make to private health funds. To me this is a pity because when there is an illness of some magnitude which requires coverage of the full fee, or at least the gap, they will be deprived of that and their out-of-pocket expenses will certainly increase. The extra costs will hit families hard and drive more towards the public system. The public health system is already under strain and this could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Increased living costs will be created not only by hospital costs and the payments needed for anaesthetists and some of the surgical procedures but also by the medications that will be required. Over 1½ million Australians, including thousands in Hasluck, will face significant increases in private health insurance costs. $1,000 might not sound a great deal to many in this chamber, but there will be people who will struggle to find that within their tight economic circumstances, particularly with the other added pressure from the banking sector where there is an increase in home interest rates.


Private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia and perform over 60 per cent of elective surgeries. What happens to the public system when these patients scrap their health insurance? The government owned insurer, Medibank Private, has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. This is considerably more than the 27,000 the minister has claimed will drop their cover throughout the entire sector. To me, this is another example of the Labor Party playing the politics of envy and punishing those who are able to take financial responsibility for their health care instead of having the Liberal Party economic philosophy of reward for effort and providing people with choice and financial opportunity.


Many of the people who have taken out private health insurance in Hasluck are not super-rich as those opposite would have you believe. In the near future, you will hear more political-speak coming out of the Labor Party--things like, 'They are the rich; why should they get subsidies for private health?' This is social engineering coming to the fore yet again. These people are already paying for the services of private health insurance and this takes a significant load off our public health system. We will all have seen articles over a period of time in which health systems and jurisdictions talk about the burden of cost in the delivery of health services. I have had firsthand experience of actually working in the health sector at a senior level and I know the strain many in this system are under. These changes will just make things worse.


The phasing down of the healthcare rebate to nil would see the need for nearly 200,000 hospital bed days to be created. One million extra patients are expected to flood the public health system. The Gillard government is acting out of desperation to balance its books and is doing so at the expense of many hardworking Australians and people in my electorate of Hasluck. Instead of creating hope for the people of Australia that if they work hard and pay their way they will be rewarded, it penalises the people who are paying their way.


Cost of living, as I have said, is a serious issue in my electorate. The so-called luxuries will be jettisoned, and I fear that private health insurance will be one of them. The cost-of-living pressures will only get worse under the carbon tax regime. This wasteful government is introducing another burden. The deceit shown by this government knows no bounds. Every new tax or levy that is introduced chips away at the household budget. People in Hasluck are struggling and this typical tax-and-spend approach to economics is damaging to the social fabric of this country. I would ask the Minister for Health to come to Hasluck and talk in a forum directly to families that will be hit by the amendments to the legislation. Previous governments have rejected these changes, and I call on this government not to dig its heels in and to stop this lunacy.


What makes this worse is that the Prime Minister previously stated in opposition that she would not seek to remove the rebate, yet when it is politically convenient she once again goes back on her word. The former Prime Minister, the Hon. Kevin Rudd, and the former Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, have both gone to great pains previously to say they would never support this move. What has changed? This is the third time the parliament has considered this legislation. It was introduced in the last parliament despite explicit promises at the 2007 election that:


… Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all the existing Private Health Insurance rebates.


That was said in a media release by Nicola Roxon on 26 September 2007.


I call on the Independents to actually stick up for the people in their electorates and vote down these amendments, which will hurt everyday Australians. I think we have the basis of an incredible health reform agenda that is providing a wide range of health outcomes and improvements for Australians, consistent with the objectives of the national partnership agreement and the National Health Reform Agreement. I would rather see the strengthening of those and not their diminution through the impact of this legislation in reducing the rebate that is currently given to all Australians. I oppose this legislation.



The SPEAKER:  Order! It being almost 8 pm, the debate is interrupted.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (15:51):  In continuing on from my remarks prior to question time, I note that this group of bills is another example of the government breaking its word given to the Australian people. I was talking before about some of the concerns we have locally about the pressures that are already on our existing health system and how these measures are going to make that situation worse. In the Courier-Mail last week there was an article about parents of children with ear, nose and throat problems and the concern that they are being told to consider paying for private treatment. This is despite living in one of the more disadvantaged areas of South-East Queensland. The article notes:


Doctors in Logan, south of Brisbane are at a loss to know where to refer children which have ear, nose and throat conditions for public treatment.


The article states that Logan Hospital, which is located in my electorate, has approximately 1,000 children waiting to be seen. What kind of a place are we creating for our children, particularly those from disadvantaged families who cannot afford private health insurance? And this legislation is not going to make that problem better. It is going to make it worse because it is going to push more people into the public sector. Private hospitals currently treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia. Medibank Private has predicted that some 37,000 members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. Over the next five years it is expected that approximately 1.6 million will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. How is the public system, which is already severely strained, going to cope with the increased costs and pressure? At the end of the day, this becomes a blatant, cost-shifting exercise to transfer responsibility from the Commonwealth to the state public health systems.


The Queensland government has long been struggling to provide sufficient support for their health services, and shifting the responsibility onto the existing resources and staff will result in complete disarray and possibly even tragedy. We do not want to see in hospitals an increase in the incidence of people not getting proper treatment or being left in hallways as they wait for beds. These are all things which could possibly be made worse in light of the current proposed legislation. In addition, upward pressure on insurance premiums will force people to reduce their levels of cover.


For example, in an article in the Albert & Logan News, dated 6 October 2010, a mother was quoted because she had spent some nine hours in the emergency room at Logan Hospital after suffering a miscarriage. She was angry and frustrated that nobody had sought to provide her with any assistance during that time. More recently, there was the headline in the Sunday Mail 'Left lying in own blood, patient claims' about failure to get treatment at Logan Hospital. All in all these are current examples of a system under enormous pressure. That pressure is only going to be made worse by pushing people from the private sector into the public sector.


In this debate it is important to note that our doctors, our nurses and associated health workers are going to bear the brunt of people's frustration, angst and anger. Yet these are the very people who already seek to do such a wonderful job in our community. It is well known that they work long hours under constant pressure. We should be doing everything we can to ease those pressures, not make them worse.


The federal Labor government promised that we would not face this legislation but, as we have discussed numerous times, they have broken this promise again and again. This is the third time that this has been debated in this House. Labor always purport to seek to help the most disadvantaged and underprivileged, yet over time we see the reverse. Their very policies actually hurt those that are most disadvantaged and underprivileged, not help them. Given the cost of private health insurance if premiums go up, the many low-income earners who do have their own private health insurance will bear the burden of the increased premiums because of fewer people being insured privately. I would like to highlight this point by quoting from an email that was recently send to me by one of my constituents. The email reads:


We are very concerned about the proposed means testing of the private health rebate. As it is, the funds have all been regularly increasing their costs and causing us to wonder how much longer we can keep up the payments. Although we will not be immediately affected as our income is below the levels reported, we most certainly are aware that there will be a mass exodus from the funds which will force them to increase their costs further in order to compensate, this will have a further flow on effect and will force us out of private health insurance, to which we have contributed for 35 years.


We note that Labor promised not to touch the subsidy before the 2007 election and regard this as another broken promise.


The email went on to say that they found the government's plot to sell the changes to private health insurance, as stopping the poor from subsidising the rich, as both insulting and dishonest. The authors of this email went to the effort of making some comparisons to support their view, and I would like to note some of their observations, an area that I touched on earlier. If you are earning an income of about $30,000 per annum you are paying about $5,000 per annum in tax and Medicare levy. If you are earning about $60,000 a year, you are paying about $12½ thousand and if you are earning about $90,000 a year, you are paying about $22½ thousand. So you can see that as your income increases you are contributing significantly more to general taxation and also through the Medicare levy. When you have a look in detail at the argument that the poor are subsidising the rich, you see that does not hold any water. It is time this government's ideological bent, of saying that the rich need to pay more for this and more for that and that the poor and needy are suffering, was put away. The politics of envy does no good as to the future of this nation whatsoever. We in the opposition oppose these measures for very good reasons, as I have outlined. Whilst the government seeks to promote this as a win-win solution, I see it as nothing more than a lose-lose one for the individuals and families living in my electorate and those around the country. We oppose this legislation.

"Symon, Mike, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (15:59):  I speak in support of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011. Together, these bills will proportionally lower the private health insurance rebate for those in higher income tiers and increase the Medicare levy surcharge for those on higher incomes who elect not to purchase private health insurance. Through these measures, the government is seeking to rebalance a range of policies supporting the private health insurance industry, as promised and taken to the 2010 election—a fact that many people in this chamber just recently have chosen to neglect. These new means-testing arrangements will make the private health insurance rebate fairer.


At the moment, more than 45 per cent of the Australian population is covered by some form of private hospital cover. This figure is at a 10-year high. In total, over 10.4 million Australians have private health insurance. Currently, consumers who purchase private health insurance receive a 30 per cent government rebate on the cost of the premium. This is not means tested. Those aged over 65 receive a 35 per cent rebate on their private health insurance costs and those over 70 receive a 40 per cent rebate. These rebates were introduced under the Howard Liberal government and the expenditure on the rebate has grown substantially over the last decade. In 2001-02, government expenditure on the private insurance rebate totalled $2.1 billion. In the 2010-11 financial year, the total expenditure on this rebate had increased to $4.7 billion. That is more than double the amount from 2001-02.


The 2010 Intergenerational report published on the Department of the Treasury website on 1 February that year states that the private health insurance rebate is the fastest-growing component of the Australian government's health expenditure and is forecast to increase by over 50 per cent in real terms per person over the period 2012-13 to 2022-23. The private health insurance rebate is the fastest-growing element of health expenditure and, if not capped, will cost the taxpayer $100 billion over the next 40 years. The fact that the fastest-growing element of health expenditure is not infrastructure, primary health care or pharmaceuticals but is the subsidising of private health insurance shows why these bills are so important.


In the 2009-10 budget, the government announced it would introduce measures to limit the growing cost of the private health insurance rebate. We tried twice to implement changes to the rebate during the last parliament, but the legislation was rejected both times by the Senate.


These bills create three tiers of support for private health insurance based progressively on the annual income of an individual or a family. For singles, there is no change unless a person earns over $83,000 per annum. Once they go over that, then the rebate reduces from 30 to 20 per cent. Going further up the income scale, once a single person earns over $96,000 per year, there is still a rebate, but it is reduced to 10 per cent.  Once they get to $129,000 per year, the rebate cuts out.


For families and couples, the bills propose that the cut-off amounts be doubled. Therefore, following that figure, the rebate for a family or couple is 20 per cent once their combined income exceeds $166,000 per year. Once that couple or family receives an income of more than $192,000 per year taxable income, the rebate is 10 per cent. There is no rebate beyond $258,000 annual taxable income. If there are children involved, then there is an extra $1500 in the threshold for each tier per child. For example, a family with two dependent children would have to earn a combined taxable income of over $169,000 before they lost the rebate. There is no change to the private health insurance rebate for those individuals earning below $83,000 as singles or $169,000 for two-child families. They retain the full rebate.


Nearly eight million policyholders will retain the full rebate on private health insurance. The important figure to remember, I think, in this debate is that nine out of 10 Australians will not be affected at all. With the average yearly wage for 2011-12 trending to around $68,790, the average wage earner will not be affected by these changes. Those opposite are suggesting that an administration assistant, an apprentice, a retail worker and maybe a teacher not only in my electorate of Deakin but right across the country should be subsidising those who have substantially more income than themselves.


I believe the current expenditure on the private health insurance rebate can and should be better allocated to other ways of supporting our health system. The big problem with private health insurance rebates is that this money, rather than being spent in our hospitals for everyone, goes into the pockets of consumers or purchasers of health insurance to subsidise that product. I think it is an inefficient way of supporting our health system.


The other problem with the rebate is that the more that is spent on private health insurance the bigger the subsidy received. So this rebate gives the biggest benefit to those on the highest incomes rather than the money being delivered directly to the health system. The rebate gives more money to those who are well off and less to those who take out basic policies.


Recent data shows that 45 per cent of the population have private health insurance, but this figure is higher for higher income households—for example, 91.3 per cent of couples earning between $240,000 and $300,000 a year have private health insurance. Those on low incomes have lower rates of health insurance—for example, only 25.6 per cent of singles earning less than $50,000 take out private health insurance. Proportionately more of this rebate, which is now costing $4.7 billion a year, is being paid to higher income households. The question that I have to ask—and I have asked it in this chamber before—is: 'Is welfare for the wealthy a good use of health funding dollars?' My answer is I do not think so. The other impact of this legislation is to increase the Medicare levy surcharge, increasing the penalty for those on higher incomes not taking out private health insurance. When the government lifted income thresholds for the Medicare levy surcharge in 2008 in order to apply indexation, the Liberal Party and the private health insurance industry ran around like headless chooks, warning that thousands of people would abandon their private cover. They said it would increase the number of people not purchasing private health insurance. They said it would increase demand for public hospital services as well as push up premiums for private health insurance. But these arguments have been proven wrong.


I remember speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill of 2008 in the last parliament and making the point that people should take out private health insurance if the product and service is good and relevant to the individual's or family's circumstances. As I have said, time has passed and the evidence is now in. A report by KPMG conducted after the introduction of the higher Medicare levy surcharge found that private hospital activity following the changes to the Medicare levy surcharge actually grew at a faster rate than public hospital activity, which also grew.


The facts are there. The current percentage of those taking out private health insurance is at a 10-year high. Treasury modelling estimates 99.7 per cent of people will keep their private health cover, with only about 27,000 people dropping out because of these proposed changes. This would lead to an increase of approximately 8,500 additional public hospital admissions over two years, which is an increase of around 0.1 per cent. This is a very small number indeed and is nothing like the fearmongering predictions that we hear so often from those opposite. These bills will reduce government subsidies for high-income earners and increase the penalty if they opt not to take out insurance. This ensures that most, but not all, high-income earners will still opt to stay in. Indexation will ensure that, over time, the tiers are raised as national incomes rise.


It is important to note that nearly eight million policy holders will not feel any difference at all. There will be no effect on the cost of hospital or general treatment policies because well over 99 per cent of people who have cover will retain their cover. Treasury analysis advises that the combination of reducing the subsidy while increasing the Medicare levy for those on higher incomes will ensure that policyholders retain their private health insurance. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association said that it:


… supports changes to the Medicare levy surcharge and private health insurance (PHI) rebates based on income. The Association has, for many years, known that the PHI rebate is not an effective mechanism to attract and retain members in the health funds. Not only is the mechanism itself ineffective, it is also an extremely inefficient use of taxpayer dollars …


These bills will help Australia get the best value for its health dollar as there is an urgent need to manage this rebate, which is the fastest growing health cost in the nation. I commend these bills to the House.

Mrs GASH
 (Gilmore) (16:10):  You have got to hand it to the Labor Party. There seems to be no end to their creativity in spinning a good yarn. This bill seeks to cut $2.8 billion in private health subsidies, inevitably forcing more people onto the already strained public hospital waiting lists. And they title their bill the 'Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill', surely an oxymoron. Cutting health insurance rebates can only result in forcing more people onto the Medicare levy, resulting in longer hospital queues in Nowra and Milton hospitals. It is the only logical conclusion to draw. Private industry warned against this when Labor first tried to raise the subject under their former leader a couple of years ago. For example, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons on 12 May 2009 said the budget measure which cut rebates would 'inevitably drive some Australians out of the private health system, placing even greater strain on Australia's public hospitals'. The Australian Medical Association, on the same day, said:


…  if you don't keep your private health insurance, you'll be slugged with an increased Medicare Levy surcharge. They get you both ways.


I could not agree more, and this bill confirms exactly what the two major medical associations were warning us about.


This government has never been a fan of private health insurance, despite the success in easing the pressure off the perpetually struggling public hospital system. This bill is just the latest step in Labor's campaign of dogma. Certainly no lessons were learned through its previous experience in 2009 or through industry advice saying, 'Don't do it,' or, most importantly of all, the chaotic health and hospital systems, which we are still experiencing.


When I was reading the explanatory memorandum to the bill, I could not help thinking that the $1.7 billion in cost overruns and waste remediation for the pink batts fiasco could have paid for the subsidy cuts the government is now proposing. When you add the other amounts that have been wasted, there should have been no need to go down this path at all. No wonder Australians, especially in Gilmore, are angry. They cannot see the justification for this to happen. The government has shown no remorse for generating so much waste through its own incompetence, yet it has no hesitation in slugging the taxpayer when it wants. Gilmore has one of the lowest socioeconomic demographics in Australia and I am astounded the government continues to deny the impact this policy will have on the public hospital system in regions like Gilmore. Many families make significant sacrifices so they can take out private health cover, yet here we are again, under this government, penalising those who would benefit most. There is no gain to be had, only pain.


Then, as if to compound this stupidity, the government want to impose another tax by increasing the Medicare levy on some of the soon-to-be-disenfranchised health insurance subscribers. This latest variation will see a three-tier system of subsidies, starting at $80,000-odd per annum for a single subscriber. The first tier get a 10 per cent cut to their subsidy and their Medicare levy will not go up—at least, not yet. The next tier get a 20 per cent cut but their levy goes up. The third tier get no subsidy and their levy goes up even more. Any incentive is deleted.


I note that Treasury estimates that around 25,000 individuals are predicted to opt out, and in some circles that appears to be a conservative guess. In the Senate hearing earlier this year, Medibank Private admitted no research was done as to the likely impact, but they did some internal modelling. That is another way of saying 'an educated guess'. The upshot is that the government does not really know what the impact will be but is keeping its fingers crossed. I have no doubt that this will be just the tip of the iceberg as other cost pressures encouraged by the government start to sink in. With unemployment predicted to rise by another 100,000 in the next 12 months and daily living expenses just going through the roof, it does not take a genius to predict that many households will be cutting a lot of their spending. In fact, they already have, with cost-of-living pressures and, still to come, the carbon tax. This latest venture will only add to that pressure. So, in a way, Labor will get its wish to destroy private health insurance, not through careful planning but through a combination of incompetence, ineptitude and dogma.


But this latest move by the government is hardly a surprise. They were opposed to the scheme when the coalition introduced it and, with the Greens calling the shots, they are determined to remove it completely. I am amused by the inclusion of the word 'fairer' in the title of the bill. This is not a recent innovation, because they tried this on with their Fair Work Act, which is anything but fair. I think that has been demonstrated well and truly. Perhaps they will now turn to their latest slogan: 'a painful adjustment.'


Next, instead of eradicating the subsidy in one fell swoop, as they said they would, this is going to be the death of a thousand cuts. Nobody should be under the illusion that this bill tells us where it will stop; it is just the next step in a series of steps, because the government have not recanted their determination to get rid of this scheme. It might just take a little longer.


I recall a press release issued by the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, on 26 September 2007, when she was occupying the shadow portfolio. I seek leave to table the press release.


Leave not granted. 




Mrs GASH:
  I am not surprised leave has not been granted, because this press release actually states the truth. The shadow minister was unequivocal in her assurances. In fact, it was a promise. In part, this is what she said:


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


… Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge and other components of the existing private health insurance incentive scheme.


It is now abundantly clear that the words were carefully crafted. The shadow minister did not say that they would not change the qualifying criteria, which they are now attempting to do—another broken promise. It seems to me that Labor, to quote Nicola Roxon's own words from the very same press release, will do anything and say anything to get elected. They were not going to cut the private health insurance rebates—at least, that is what they tried to imply. That was before they were elected. Now Labor have been elected, $2.8 billion worth of cuts are going to be made—another lie, another broken promise. 


If that is not enough, in a letter to Dr Michael Armitage, the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, the then federal Labor leader, Kevin Rudd, in a letter dated 20 November 2007, wrote:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.


Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases.


I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the House that this statement came from the former Labor leader, Mr Rudd.


By their words, they stand condemned. What utter deceit. The government cannot be trusted to tell the truth and they cannot be trusted to do the right thing. And they certainly cannot be relied upon to get things right. The more the Prime Minister talks about going forward, the more we are slipping backwards.


 According to a report in the Australian Financial Review, dated Wednesday, 17 August last year, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council showed that Australia had reached its highest rate of private hospital insurance participation in more than 10 years: in the three months to June 2011, 87,381 people signed up for private health cover. That is what the rebate sought to do when it was introduced. It was an incentive to reduce reliance on the public hospital system by encouraging people to take out private health insurance. It has been an outstanding success, yet this government wants to sabotage that success and trap us in a public hospital system that is groaning under demands that are not being met.


Labor's promise to take over the hospital system has fallen by the wayside and has been diluted to an agreement to share funding—and then only for future growth. How will that work? Another broken promise, but I think it is more a case of Labor confusing their ambitions with their capabilities. This has been the recent pattern of the Prime Minister, making sugary promises on the run and not following through. How many so-called policy announcements have languished after the initial press statement? Making a shallow statement, disguised as a policy announcement is easy. Labor have done it hundreds of times. The challenge for Labor is following through, and that is where they have been found wanting.


Deloitte released a report titled Economic impact assessment of the proposed reforms to private health insurance. I wonder whether the word 'reforms' accurately describes what this government is trying to do, because this proposal is a retrograde step. Deloitte describes the reaction to these proposed changes as significant, not in a good way but with a negative consequence. This is what Deloitte concluded:


In time, it is expected that the cost of servicing increased demand for public hospital services will outweigh the savings to government from the means testing of the rebate.


On this basis, how can anyone in their right mind support this legislation? And that statement comes from an independent and credible body, external to the political process.


 I am not surprised that the Independents have indicated their reluctance to support the changes, as has been reported in the Fin Review. At the back of all this, I have to wonder about this strategy to force people back into public hospitals being pursued at the same time as the government is building superclinics to ease the existing strain on public hospitals. Is it in fact a sly ploy to get people into the yet-to-be-constructed superclinics? And what of the government's plan to ease the demand on public hospital waiting lists by utilising private hospitals? How is this going to work?


This legislation has to be viewed in the context of the health reform announcement, made on 2 August last year. Key changes will not be implemented until at least 2014-15, seven years after Labor first promised to fix public hospitals. They also promised that, if needed, they would hold a referendum to take them over. The core promise of Labor's health reforms was that the Commonwealth would become the dominant funder of 60 per cent of hospital costs. That promise has since been scrapped. Its substitute, the supposed increase to 50 per cent growth funding of hospital services will not occur until 2017. That is at least two elections away and with no explanation as to how it is to be funded. A definition of an efficient price of hospital services has yet to be determined, and further negotiations may even be required on the scope of services eligible for Commonwealth funding.


Kevin Rudd said that, on health, the buck would stop with him. Julia Gillard says that the states will be in charge. Julia Gillard has broken Labor's promise on elective surgery guarantees. Patients in category 1 who had waited the clinically recommended time were promised that they would have their surgery in five days. Patients in category 2 would have surgery in 15 days and patients in category 3 would have surgery in 45 days. What are the chances?


The new national elective surgery targets will not be fully implemented until 2016, with reward funding now paid in advance to state governments and no guarantees for patients. The national emergency access target for patients to be admitted or discharged within four hours has been watered down from 95 per cent of emergency department patients to 90 per cent, and will not be fully implemented until 2015. Labor will spend hundreds of millions of dollars this year establishing the National Health Performance Authority, the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, Medicare Locals and the National Funding Authority. None of this is good news for Gilmore. The superclinic in Shoalhaven, promised by Labor to be up and running by Christmas last year, is not due to commence for perhaps another two years, and even that has a revised forecast that is optimistic. Shoalhaven Hospital is struggling and Milton-Ulladulla Hospital is virtually a second-level operation where some of the services have been cut.


This legislation is a square peg in a round hole. It is a retrograde step. It breaks more promises and it will only compound an already difficult situation. It is not something we need and it is certainly not something we deserve. I cannot for the life of me see any sense in this, and I can see even less in a government that is determined to have its own way despite the cost to the community. I do not support this legislation and I do not trust a government with a proven track record of cunning, deceit and rank stupidity. The Australian people deserve better.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (16:24):  In my remarks today on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 it is my intention to talk a little bit about the historical context in which we find ourselves, particularly with regard to matters of promises, which many other speakers have talked about, and health reform, even though I would say that this bill has nothing at all to do with health reform; this is the budgetary bill.


When we think back to the 2007 election campaign—and I think almost all members in the chamber fought that election campaign—we remember clearly what took place. Some of the things that the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd—whether that title will apply to him again in the next few weeks I do not know—talked about was the end of the blame game, how there was going to be resolution of the conflict between the states and the Commonwealth, how everybody would start to get along better, how there would be great strides forward on health care and how, as was promised, if there was no resolution then there would be a Commonwealth takeover of public hospitals. That was very much part of the 2007 campaign, and it obviously gave the current government and the former prime minister a great deal of momentum. When you go to the front door of anyone's house and say, generically, 'What are your issues?' the default issues are without doubt health and education. Everyone says, 'Let's fix the health system.' So when that imagery was created by the Labor Party before the 2007 election—ending the blame game and fixing up the health system—everybody wanted to believe it, and I think it worked very well for Labor.


Within that context, an aspect of that campaign was the then Leader of the Opposition, Kevin Rudd—now former Prime Minister and current foreign minister—using a 'younger John Howard' image. As part of that, Mr Rudd and his then shadow health minister, Julia Gillard, were very careful in their addressing of concerns within the health industry and the private health industry. That leads us, as others have alluded, to the letter written by the former federal Labor leader and member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, dated 20 November 2007, just shortly before the election. In this letter he was very clear on the matter of retaining the existing private health insurance rebate.


We talked in that election campaign about the fact that Labor was out to get the private health insurance rebate. They were going to make changes to it and we knew the consequences of that. At the time the Howard government was elected in 1996, we were in the situation where the proportion of Australians that were a part of the private health system was down to something like 33 or 34 per cent. Through the measures the Howard government put together that was elevated to something like 45 per cent, which took pressure off the public hospital system. In Cowan, some 75 per cent of residents in my electorate are covered under the private health insurance arrangements.


However, as I said, it was very clear that the image, the claim or, you might say, the promise that was put out there by Labor before that 2007 election campaign was that there would be no change. As a result the private health industry was fairly quiet on the matter and it did not choose to highlight any further concerns to the people of Australia, and that was another aspect that helped the Labor Party win government in 2007. This matter was addressed quite significantly in question time today, and the point was made by the current Prime Minister that the promises that were made about the private health insurance rebate were pre-2007 election, the point being that promise was made two elections ago. I note as well that the member for Dickson very clearly made the point when we approached the 2010 campaign that comments were on the record which indicated to Australians that there would be no changes to the arrangements for the private health insurance rebate. So the reality is—and I will move further into this bill soon—that the view and the perspective that was given to the Australian people was that their health insurance rebate was not going to be touched. How truly wrong that was.


It is important for me to say that the former minister for health is on the record as saying: 


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor—


this was before the 2007 election—


has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


As I have said, the letter from the Hon. Kevin Rudd to the Chief Executive Officer of the Health Insurance Association, Dr Michael Armitage, again very clearly states that federal Labor was committed to the private health insurance rebates. Unfortunately, as is so often the case in the last four-plus years, what is promised before an election bears little relationship to what takes place after the election. Yet we cannot blame the Greens for any of this of course! The socialist to communist fringe of Australian politics have always been complete and utter socialists. Their view of the world is that anyone who has done well in their life must only have done so due to the sweat of somebody else. So they are fully behind the redistribution of wealth and there are plenty in the government who probably subscribe to a similar view.


When we look at private health insurance circumstances we know that there are 10.2 million Australians who currently have private health insurance for hospital treatment. As I said before, 75 per cent of my electorate of Cowan—some 95,000 voters, citizens over 18, and their families—all believe that they want to make sacrifices in their lives in order to be able to afford private health insurance so that they will have choice in the future. A lot of people might say, and obviously it is also the government's view, that anyone on more than $80,000 a year and any family on more than $180,000 a year must be wealthy. But that is not the whole story, and I will go through that a little bit further. It is certainly the case that 75 per cent of my constituents are within the private health insurance arrangements. In fact, back in August last year we received letters from almost 2,000 of our local residents asking for the retention of the current private health insurance rebate. Residents such as Ken Roberts, Sarah Harris, Lee Davis and Barbara Brown, to name four of those almost 2,000, simply cannot understand why the Labor government is out to cut the private health insurance rebate. They see it as an attack on the hard-working and aspirational people of this country.


In just the last day or so I received an email from my constituent Mark Paulton. I will read into the record what he says:


We are a modest family of 3 with an income just over a gross income of around 180k pa. This is modest really when in context of Perth and the mining boom as you can appreciate.


Since labour have been in power I have seen appreciation for the working family dwindle and really encouragement now goes to those who aren't striving to better their income levels and raise themselves without support of the state. For example here are things that labour has introduced that has directly affected me and my family due this government thinking that a family earning over $150,000 is classed as a millionaire in their view:


1. Means testing of a family Tax Benefit A and B, Child Care Benefit and Baby Bonus … Loss of around $3500 pa


2. Flood Levy introduced … $1000


3. Means Test of Rudds stimulus package so not applicable to our income level … $1000


4. Carbon Tax Introduced $2500pa


5. No change to recent income tax threshold in line with inflation … $1000pa


6. Changes to Medicare and Obstricians fees for using their services … $2500


And now


… The loss and means test of the PHI rebate …$1000pa.


Consideration of not just the PHI rebate means test, it should be considered with all the other changes this government has done and this extra change not only is a burden in its own right, it's compounded by the fact that one has been levied on just purely because we are perceived to be millionaires. The total of the above is around $12,500 in changes that makes us worse off since labour came to office.


Is it any wonder that retailers are feeling it tough as well.


When you have 75 per cent of the people in Cowan concerned about this sort of issue, is it any wonder then that so many people in my electorate are concerned? When Deloittes did the analysis on the impact of the legislation it showed that they expected 175,000 people to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 to downgrade their cover. The AMA shares that sort of viewpoint as well. The health insurance sector predicts that another 730,000 are likely to downgrade their hospital cover and 775,000 are likely to drop from ancillary altogether. Even the government's own Medibank Private has estimated that 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade their cover. That is thousands more than the government estimates will abandon private health insurance due to this bill—due to these measures that the government is trying to introduce today. One private insurance company is saying that they alone will lose more people to private health insurance than the government estimates will happen across the whole country. I ask everyone in this place: who do they think is accurate on these matters?


One of the specific points that has been made about private health insurance and these plans to take the rebate away from so many people relates to the pool base for private health insurance. The reality is that with each person that drops out of private health insurance the pool base gets smaller and smaller. Even if Medibank Private is the only insurer that loses people—which is not necessarily going to be the case—37,000 people will no longer be part of that pool base. All those people that the government claims it is trying to protect will also see their insurance premiums rise as the health insurance companies will have to try to make ends meet whilst continuing to provide services from a reduced number of insurance policyholders.


This legislation does represent a huge knock for those hardworking Australians who want to share the cost of the provision of their own health services—those people who believe that society does not owe them and that they should pay their own way where they can. They are just asking for that little bit of help so that they can take pressure off the public hospital system. I do not think it is too much to ask, particularly for those that pay the majority of the income tax in this country, that they should get that little bit of support. These are people that have been making sure that they are doing the right thing for this country as well as looking after themselves first and foremost and it is not wrong for them to get just that little bit of support. We reject this bill, we reject the premise behind it and we call on the government to get its act together and balance the budget in the right way by cutting its spending. (Time expired)

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (16:39): I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and the two cognate bills that are before the House. This is not the first time that these bills have been seen in this place. The same set of bills has been defeated by the Senate on two separate occasions, but this Labor government is now at it again for a third time. This of course is no surprise: if we have learnt one thing about the Labor government it is that it will never let a little thing like a mandate, or the will of the people, get in the way of it fulfilling its own agenda.


These bills aim to reduce the incentives for Australians to take up private health insurance by slashing the 30 per cent rebate and increasing the Medicare levy surcharge for those without insurance, according to income thresholds. Those earning over $80,001 will have to either receive a reduced rate of 20 per cent or pay a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge. People earning over $93,001 will either receive a rebate of just 10 per cent or pay a 1.25 per cent surcharge, whilst those who earn over $124,001 will no longer receive any private health insurance rebate and will face a Medicare levy surcharge of 1.5 per cent.


This government has selective amnesia when it comes to this issue. In 2007, then Leader of the Opposition Rudd gave assurances to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Health Insurance Association, the Hon. Michael Armitage, that federal Labor would not make any changes to the private health insurance rebate.


A young professional in the seat of Macquarie earning $95,000 per year with a $1,500 per annum health insurance policy will see his rebate slashed from 30 per cent to 10 per cent or in real dollar terms from about $450 to $150. That equates to this person being $300 a year worse off. If they do not have private health insurance, their Medicare levy surcharge will rise from $950 to $1,187.50 and they will be $237.50 a year worse off. Put simply, they are damned if they do and damned if they don't. This is another example of Labor trying to hurt everyday Australians—young families, senior citizens and small business owners who are already struggling to make ends meet as the cost of electricity and other vital items continues to rise. If passed, these bills will add to the ever-increasing cost-of-living burden being felt by people across the electorate of Macquarie.


When in government the coalition implemented incentives which saw a 10 per cent increase in the number of Australians who use private health insurance. Thanks to these incentives we now see around 45 per cent of Australians using one form or another of private health cover. Increased patronage of private health insurance is a vital part of ensuring greater access to health services for everyone.


Public hospitals all over the nation struggle to keep up with the demand. This is not a reflection on the hardworking doctors and nurses who work in public hospitals and are valued members of our community but a reflection on the demand that is currently placed on our health system. Private health insurance assists public hospitals by giving those who can afford it the opportunity to receive private care, which assists by easing pressure on hospital waiting lists. Reducing the rebate will increase the cost burden of private health insurance on mums, dads and self-funded retirees who are already struggling with price hikes. This will leave many with no choice but to drop their private health insurance altogether, whilst forcing others to downgrade to cheaper policies. This was highlighted by a telephone survey conducted by ANOP Research. They found that, if this bill was passed, 11 per cent of those surveyed would drop their hospital cover and a further 24 per cent would downgrade it. This would not only provide them with less cover but in turn place a great deal of pressure on our public hospitals and other health services.


The government's own figures show that around 27,000 people would be forced to drop their private health cover. This would result in an extra 8,500 public hospital admissions, as those previously covered by private health insurance returned to the public hospital system. These figures tell us that the Labor government fails to understand the impact that this bill will have on these 27,000 individuals across the nation—families, students and self-funded retirees who through no fault of their own will be worse off. During Senate estimates hearings, the leading insurer Medibank Private said that according to its own internal modelling about 37,000 of its members would be expected to drop their cover with an additional 92,000 expected to downgrade their policies if this bill were to pass. Medibank's figures suggest that under this bill 10,000 more Australians will be forced to drop private health insurance than the government has suggested. However, Medibank is talking about only their customer base, whilst the government is talking about the entire nation.


To see how the government's national figures stack up, look at the Deloitte report entitled Economic impact assessment of the proposed reforms to private health insurance, commissioned by the Australian Health Insurance Association. This report estimates that, over the first year, 175,000 people will drop their private health insurance and 538,000 people will have to downgrade their policies. We have the government saying 27,000 and a report by Deloitte claiming 175,000. So who can we trust? Who is more believable? The government that brought us the pink batts disaster, the 'building the entertainment revolution' through the set-top box scheme, the ludicrous cash-for-clunkers idea and, for an encore, wants to bring in a carbon tax? Or a company like Deloitte which, since its foundation in 1845 has been regarded as one of the world's largest companies when it comes to professional services?


The Deloitte report also found that this bill, which has been rejected twice by the Senate over five years, will cause the number of those dropping their cover to increase to 1.6 million consumers, while a further 4.3 million will downgrade their policies. Additionally, 2.8 million Australians would drop their general cover, which includes ancillary services such as dental. It found that because of this severe impact on the health insurance market, private health insurance premiums would rise significantly. The rise would be a staggering 10 per cent more than would otherwise be expected, making private health insurance even more unaffordable for those struggling against surging cost-of-living pressures. The report went on to show that this would have a significant impact on the public health system, with public hospitals having to treat a significantly higher number of patients as people withdrew from private health cover.


We need to be very clear about this. What the Labor government is proposing here is bad health policy. This government has a long record of failing to understand what the public wants, and this policy shows that nothing has changed. The impact that this proposal will have on the residents of Macquarie is significant. An average family in which the father works as an accountant and the mother as a schoolteacher, earning wages above the threshold, with a basic private health package costing $2,500 a year, will see their rebate reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent, costing them an extra $250 a year. This is at a time when cost-of-living pressures are high and many among us are calling out for greater access to health services.


By bringing the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and the two related bills back before the parliament, this Labor government is once again showing that it is not listening to what Australians are saying. In both May and November of 2009 the parliament clearly told Labor that we did not want it destroying our health system. We must now again say that in 2012 nothing has changed. This bill needs to be opposed. The last thing we need is more hurt from this Labor government.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:48):  I rise today to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and related bills—the government's latest broken promise and latest attack on aspirational Australians. This is an issue that goes to the very heart of my electorate of Higgins. My electorate is full to the brim with aspiration.


When I stood here for the first time in this place just over two years ago, I referred to the thread that binds the people of Higgins together, that thread being aspiration—whether it be young couples renting for the moment but desperate to own their own homes; whether it be families wanting the best for their children, scrimping and saving to provide them with the best opportunities in life; whether it be small business people, rolling up their sleeves, taking a chance and creating jobs; or whether it be older residents who have worked hard throughout their lives, whose accomplishments prove what can happen when you dare to pursue your ambitions.


Yet this government does not believe in aspiration. It does not believe, as we do, that the best path to our collective prosperity involves giving individuals, families and businesses the freedom, opportunity and encouragement to build and secure their own futures. It does not believe in self-reliance. It is ideologically opposed to encouraging people to work hard, to save and to contribute to their own health care.


This bill is all about penalising individuals and families. It goes to the heart of cost-of-living pressures that families and individuals are already increasingly facing. This bill will increase the cost of private health insurance while at the same time do nothing to decrease the pressure on the public health system. Far from it: the changes that the government seeks to make today will increase the pressure on the public health system.


Seventy-seven per cent of my electorate have private health insurance. That is around 83,258 people, based on the current ABS statistics. Each of those people will be affected, either because their rebate will be taken away in full, because it will be decreased or because their premiums will ultimately rise because of the significant number of people who will drop out of the private health system. Even the remaining 27 per cent of my electorate who do not currently have private health insurance will be affected, because the public health system will come under increasing pressure.


It is instructive to look at the number of people who will be directly impacted when tier 1 of the government's legislation kicks in. In my electorate of Higgins, about 21 per cent of singles and seven per cent of couples will be directly impacted. I think it is telling that the lights have gone out in this chamber, because this legislation is a demonstration of how the lights have gone out on this government and how this government have ultimately been incredibly deceptive in the comments they have made about the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate across the years. It is useful to look back at what this government have said about the 30 per cent rebate—a rebate that was brought into effect by the coalition government, by the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge, to ensure that we could have affordable and sustainable health care for all. It was to provide Australians with choice, to encourage people to be self-reliant.


Let us go back and look at what the current Prime Minister, who was then shadow minister, said about the private health insurance rebate. She said that she would give an ironclad guarantee that there would be no change to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. She said that she was so sick of saying it that she would ensure that there would be 'an ironclad guarantee' that there would be no change. All of us in this place know exactly what the Prime Minister's promises are worth. Only days before the last election, the Prime Minister made another promise—that there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. She broke that promise to the Australian people and she broke her promise as shadow minister for health not to rip away the private health insurance rebate. 


But it was not just the Prime Minister who made this assurance to the people of Australia. At the election in 2007, the shadow minister for health, the member for Gellibrand, explicitly stated that federal Labor had:


… made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates.


In the media statement released during the campaign, she stated:


The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.


That is what she said: 'This is absolutely untrue.' She went on to say:


The Howard government will do anything and say anything to get elected.


Doesn't that take the cake? It turned out that it was the shadow minister for health who would say anything or do anything. This is a very interesting statement from the member for Gellibrand. It has to be one of the most duplicitous statements ever made by a shadow minister with respect to a government policy, ranking just after the Prime Minister's famous remark—her famous broken promise—about a carbon tax.


It went on. Kevin Rudd, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, also made some incredibly explicit promises in relation to the private health insurance rebate. He said, in a letter, which I have here today:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year—


This is in 2007—


 that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge. Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for full approval of premium increases.


The Labor government have again broken their promise. In fact, before they went to the 2010 election, they brought forward changes in the 2009 budget which saw a broken promise on private health insurance—a private health insurance broken promise which will affect every single Australian and, most particularly, all of those Australians who currently hold private health insurance. It will affect not just those whom the government claim will be directly affected—those on higher incomes—but every single person who holds private health insurance, because their premiums will rise as people drop out of private health insurance. 


The government have said that we should not be worried about the people who drop out of private health insurance. They say that it is a minuscule number. They say that, for their savings of upwards of $1.9 billion—which they now say is over $2 billion—very few people will drop out of private health insurance. This does not stand up to scrutiny. Private health insurers have conducted their own research and asked Deloitte to provide a report on the number of people who would be anticipated to drop out of private health insurance as a result of the proposed changes. The report said that, over five years, up to 1.6 million Australians will drop their cover, which is pretty radically different from Treasury's estimate of around 25,000 people. Not only that but, according to this report, up to 4.3 million Australians will downgrade their cover over five years. This will see an increase in premiums—the cost of health insurance—of upwards of 10 per cent. This means that the cost of health care in Australia will increase. 


Australians who are battling cost-of-living pressures right now ask themselves: 'Why? Why is this government so committed to ripping away choice for Australians? Why are they committed to raising the cost of private health insurance?' The government claim this is because they need to find savings. But let us look at the government's record. They have the worst economic record of any government in recent history. They have delivered in their four budgets deficits that add up to $167 billion, which of course means that Australians for generations to come will be paying off the subsequent debt that the government are racking up. Already we know that the cost of the government's borrowings will impact Australians—every man, woman and child—by $6,000. This is a government with a terrible record; a government that has needed to increase the gross debt ceiling from $75 billion to $250 billion. 


Warnings abound in our national papers every day that this government is on the path to economic destruction through its waste and mismanagement. It must stop. While this government says it needs to rip out around $2.4 billion from the private health insurance rebate, it has wasted more than $1 billion on pink batts and more than $1.5 billion on trying to correct the mistakes made under that program. This government has managed billion-dollar blowouts in mismanaged programs such as border protection. There has been a blowout of over $1 billion in that policy alone. This government has also wasted billions of dollars on the Julia Gillard memorial school hall projects. A number of school halls and infrastructure projects have not been managed well and there has been an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars. While the government has presided over such waste and mismanagement, it claims that it needs to rip money out of private health insurance. 


The only reason this government is pursuing this action is that, ideologically, it is opposed to private health insurance. It is opposed to people saving and providing for their own futures and it is against choice in health care. It is now on its the third attempt to dismantle the private health insurance industry in this country. I stand against this, as do the people of Higgins. The people in my electorate of Higgins are vitally opposed to these measures and I will continue to fight for private health insurance that will allow Australians to directly participate. This government should hang its head in shame for taking one policy to the 2007 election and then the 2010 election, but then breaking that promise. This government cannot be trusted to maintain its promises; it cannot be trusted to maintain the health care of all Australians. This legislation should not stand.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (17:03):  I am pleased to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill and related bills. The House is debating a simple, clear-cut issue—should the Australian tax system encourage all Australians, or as many who are able, to provide for their own medical expenses through taking out health insurance, or should it instead, as this government proposes, put private health insurance and choice of medical provider even further out of the reach of many Australians? Regrettably, that will be the effect of the fundamentally misconceived provisions in the bills the House is debating this afternoon.


When it comes to private health insurance, Labor has form. Labor is relentlessly hostile to private health insurance. Labor is hostile to private hospitals. Labor is hostile to the notion of Australians seeking to rely on their own resources, seeking to make provision for themselves and their families rather than relying solely and exclusively on the public system. This bill is redolent of ideological hostility towards private health insurance and towards self-provision, which is at the absolute core of Labor's approach. That is why this bill is designed to make it harder for Australians to help themselves and their families. This bill is designed to make it more expensive to take out private health insurance; it is designed to penalise many of those who seek to provide for themselves rather than be a burden on the public purse.


Let us remind ourselves of the principal provisions in the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill. Firstly, the current private health insurance rebate, which for most people is set at 30 per cent of expenditures and for older people somewhat higher, will be reduced for those who are above certain income levels. If you are a single and your income level is more than $124,000, the rebate will be reduced to zero; if you fall into certain income levels below that, the rebate will be reduced by lesser amounts. The second major provision in this bill increases the current Medicare levy surcharge on your tax bill which applies if you do not have private health insurance. Today that stands at one percentage point; in the new world, should this bill pass the House, that rate will increase to 1.25 per cent for a single person with an income above $93,000 and 1.5 per cent for a single person with an income above $124,000. We have had some highly illogical and internally inconsistent arguments in support of this measure. Just today in the House the Prime Minister drew a comparison between a highly paid businessmen earning $500,000 a year and an apprentice earning much less, and argued that, in the absence of the measures contained in this bill, there is an unsavoury degree of cross-subsidy on the part of the apprentice to the businessman, who has the benefit of the private health insurance rebate. A brief look at the numbers indicates what a ludicrous claim that is. In the case of the businessman cited by the Prime Minister, the tax on $500,000 is $206,050, prior to the application of the rebate. If we assume a typical level of private health insurance premium then that tax bill will be reduced by a mere $720. By contrast, somebody earning $50,000 will have a tax bill of $10,200. So the suggestion that, in some way, the person paying $206,050 a year in tax is freeloading on the person paying $10,200 in tax, which was essentially the argument put by the Prime Minister in the House, is self-evidently not worth considering when you take even the briefest look at the actual numbers.


I want to make three points in the time I have available. Firstly, the measures inherent in this bill fundamentally attack the provisions of the private health insurance rebate and are an appalling abandonment of what was apparently previously an ironclad commitment. Secondly, for many years we have seen from the Labor side of politics a consistent mismanagement of policy in the area of private health insurance, founded on their implacable ideological hostility to the private health insurance industry. Thirdly, the ill-designed and ill-thought-through measures in this bill will seriously damage choice and equity in health care in Australia.


On the first point, I remind the House, as a number of other speakers have done, of commitments that were made in the lead-up to the 2007 election by a number of eminent members of the Labor Party. The member for Gellibrand had this to say: 'On many occasions for many months federal Labor have made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.' Then it was a commitment; now, apparently, that commitment is out the window and completely meaningless.


What did then opposition leader Kevin Rudd have to say just before the 2007 election? In a written commitment, a letter to the industry body, he had this to say: 'Both my shadow minister for health Nicola Roxon and I have made clear on many occasions this year that federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent rebate and 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.' This is a shameful abandonment of a commitment previously given by the Labor Party.


My second point is that the policy area of private health insurance is one which has been subject to consistent mismanagement over many years by Labor during its times in government, and by contrast the coalition has shown a sure hand in seeking to maximise the number of people who take out private health insurance and thereby contribute themselves towards the cost burden of the health system, which would otherwise fall entirely on the public purse. When Medicare was introduced in 1984, a decline began in the percentage of the population covered by private health insurance. By 1998, only 30.4 per cent of the population was covered by private health insurance. I need hardly add the obvious point that this left the vast majority of Australians drawing on the publicly funded system, putting it under substantial pressure.


The Howard government, I am pleased to say, unlike the approach of the present government, tackled this pressing policy problem with measures that were well designed and which achieved their desired outcome. The desired outcome of course was to increase the proportion of Australians with private health insurance cover—that is, to increase the proportion of people who were taking upon themselves the burden of funding their own health needs rather than simply leaving it to the public purse.


The measures introduced by the Howard government involved a mixture of carrot and stick. The carrot of course was the introduction of the tax rebate, which is now under savage attack in the legislation before the House today. The stick of course was that if you did not take out private health insurance above certain income thresholds, you were required to pay the one per cent Medicare levy surcharge. Those measures were extremely successful. By 2007, private health insurance coverage had climbed to 44.6 per cent of the population. In my own electorate of Bradfield, 85 per cent of households have private health insurance. In other words, a very substantial proportion of the people in my electorate of Bradfield have taken the decision to incur, out of their household budget, expenditure against their future health needs because they want to make sure that they are doing what they can to provide for their own health needs and the costs of those health needs rather than simply leaving it to the public purse to support their health needs. I commend them for doing that.


Let me turn therefore to my third point and perhaps the one which is most important, as the House considers this package of measures. What will be the impact of this legislation on the policy objective of choice and equity in the Australian healthcare system? I am sorry to say the effect of these measures will be very damaging. Some 2.4 million Australians are directly affected and they face an immediate increase in premiums, depending upon which tier they fall within, of between 14 per cent and 43 per cent. In turn, it is likely that there will be a material reduction in the percentage of Australians who hold private health insurance. Conversely, there may also be people reducing the tier of insurance they hold. Private health insurance premiums are likely to rise and the inevitable consequence will be more pressure on the public health system and more pressure on the public purse which funds that public health system.


Analysis by Deloittes, which has been cited by a number of speakers in the House this afternoon, predicts that some 1.6 million consumers are likely to withdraw from private health insurance cover, a number which is very, very different from the panglossian assumption in the work done by the Treasury that a mere 25,000 people will give up coverage. The further issue which presents itself is that the dollars which are purportedly saved out of this exercise must be offset against the extra cost which the government and in turn taxpayers will be required to bear towards the cost of the public health system. According to research conducted by Econtech and other parties in 2004, for every dollar of public funding going into the private health insurance rebate $2 was saved—that is to say, $2 towards the cost of the health system that was met by private health insurers, rather than being required to be paid out of the public purse.


Many of the arguments that have been made by the government in favour of this measure do not bear up to close scrutiny. It is claimed to be a savings measure, but in real terms it is in fact a tax increase, because Australians above a certain income tax threshold who do not take out private health insurance will now face a further increase in their income tax rate, which could be as high as one per cent or 1.5 per cent. This in turn creates what might be described as a price shield for private health insurance premiums, as the eminent economist Henry Ergas has argued in the Australian newspaper today, and the consequence of that is that there will be an upward force on private health insurance premiums which would not have existed in the absence of the measures contained in this bill. The consequence in turn is that private health insurance will become increasingly unaffordable for a proportion of Australians. 


When you step back and look at the overall impact of these measures, it is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that what the Labor Party is doing here is pushing us towards a two-tier health system in Australia, where the poor or the less well off are in the public system and the more affluent are being pushed into a private health insurance funded private system. That seems a very curious approach for the Labor Party to be taking. It is a profound attack on the principles of both economies of scale and equity that the public health system is supposed to deliver and it is one of the many curiosities of this deeply ill-conceived piece of legislation, which attacks fundamentally Australians who seek to provide for themselves.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (17:18):  I rise to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge-Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011 before the House. The government's proposed changes, which will means test the private health insurance rebate, is a retrograde step that is vehemently opposed by the coalition. Means testing the rebate will drive up premiums, force millions of Australians to downgrade their private health care with many abandoning it all together and increase the pressure on an already stretched public health system. What is more, it is a fundamental breach of another Labor promise. From Kevin Rudd to Julia Gillard to Labor's last Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, the government repeatedly stated its commitment to maintaining the private health insurance rebate in its current form. In September 2007, Nicola Roxon said:


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates … The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.


Then again in February 2009, Nicola Roxon said: 


… the government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates.


We now know the truth. Whatever modicum of trust was left after Labor's successive backflips on the carbon tax, offshore processing and mandatory precommitment for pokies, it must surely have evaporated after this latest government reversal. How can Labor honestly be trusted on anything? In contrast, the coalition has been consistent in our commitment to not means testing the private health insurance rebate. It goes right to the heart of an individual's freedom to choose and for what many consider to be an act of personal responsibility. We as Liberals want a robust private system in health just as in education, and we want this private system sitting side by side with a viable and effective public system. This was well put by Margaret Thatcher when she, as Prime Minister, said of private health insurance in the United Kingdom:


I, along with something like 5 million other people, insure to enable me to go to hospital on the day I want, at the time I want, and with a doctor I want. For me, that is absolutely vital … Like most people, I pay my dues to the National Health Service; I do not add to the queue, and if I said ""Look, because I cannot come when you want me, I must come when I want to"" you would accuse me of jumping the queue. I exercise my right as a free citizen to spend my own money in my own way, so that I can go in on the day, at the time, with the doctor I choose and get out fast.""


So that was Margaret Thatcher and this thinking could equally apply to the Liberals' approach to private health insurance in this country. There you have it: the doyenne of British conservatism, whose record in limiting the excesses of the state are revered the world over, explaining why she and five million of her fellow Britons had private health insurance. So wouldn't Margaret Thatcher be surprised to learn that we in Australia, where our public system is even more effective than that of the UK or the United States, have around 12 million Australians with private health insurance—a remarkable 52.9 per cent of the population. In an electorate like mine, Kooyong, the number is even higher, with 74½ per cent of its people having private health insurance. This includes nearly 25,000 people who are single. In my electorate of Kooyong this means that more than 100,000 residents are covered by private health insurance. These changes will take money out of the pockets of people in Balwyn, Hawthorn, Kew, Camberwell, Deepdene and Canterbury. It means less money for them to meet the rising costs of living because this money will have to now go, if they choose, into keeping their private health insurance.


Significantly, as my colleague and friend the member for Dickson and shadow minister for health said in a very valuable contribution in this House last week, a remarkable 5.6 million people with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $50,000 and 3.4 million Australians with private health insurance have an annual household income of less than $35,000. Never let it be said that this is a rebate for the rich. These are aspirational Australians, some of whom do it very tough but take out private health insurance because they have made a considered choice. This is how they want to spend their money. This is the epitome of personal freedom. So too when it comes to the private health insurers in Australia themselves: a number of them are not-for-profit organisations whose bottom line is not to expand their margins but to achieve more affordable health care that delivers a better service for the consumer.


We in this House should also not forget that private hospitals do much of the heavy lifting in our healthcare system. They look after 40 per cent of all patients in Australia. In 2009-10 this equated to 3½ million patients, and for elective surgery the numbers are even higher with nearly two in every three cases taking place in private hospitals. These are remarkable numbers and reflect the fact that the Australian people have been voting with their feet for private health insurance.


Indeed, it was the Howard government's policies which facilitated this very high take-up that we now enjoy. In 1997 John Howard introduced a one per cent Medicare levy surcharge on taxable income, penalising those income earners who did not take up private health insurance; 1999 saw the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate; the year 2000 saw Lifetime Health cover and from 2005 the more elderly people in our community received greater rebates for taking up private health insurance. At every step of this reform process undertaken by the Howard government you could see the take-up rates dramatically improve. For example, in the 12 months after the introduction of the 30 per cent rebate in January 1999, the percentage of Australians with private hospital health cover jumped from 30.6 per cent to 43 per cent and in the years afterwards it jumped to the level we now enjoy at around 52.9 per cent.


What is so concerning to members on this side of the House is the large number of people that will be negatively and directly impacted by this government's legislation. Around 2.4 million people will see immediate rises in their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent or 43 per cent depending on their income levels. According to the Australian Health Insurance Association, over 800,000 more Australians will be admitted to public hospitals. In their analysis, the top-tier consultancy Deloittes has said that 175,000 Australians will withdraw their private health cover in the first year and 583,000 Australians will downgrade their cover. Over a five-year period those numbers will dramatically rise to 1.6 million people who will withdraw their private cover and 4.3 million people who will downgrade their cover. Even the state-owned Medibank Private has come out publicly and stated that 37,000 of its members will remove their private cover and 92½ thousand of their members will downgrade their cover.


I have no doubt that the government's decision to means-test public health insurance will be deeply unpopular with the Australian people. The public understands that this is not about the future costs of the program. The rebate as a proportion of the total healthcare spend, public and private, has stayed constant at 3½ per cent for the last decade. The public understand that this is not about improving the state of our public healthcare system, for they have heard all that before—the hospital fix that Kevin Rudd promised but which never arrived and the superclinics that were promised but never built. But they do know that this government is under enormous budgetary stress as a result of its own fiscal mismanagement.


This is just a mad dash for cash. They need to scramble for a surplus and in doing so will hit Australian families once again. The problem is that in doing so the consequences of these changes will be profound. Healthy and young people will make up thousands of the thousands of people who give up their private cover, reducing the cross-subsidy that is a hallmark of insurance schemes. Premiums will rise, membership will fall and the overall pressure on our public health system will become even more pronounced.


Be under no illusions. This is bad policy from a bad government and it will come at a bad time for Australian families. This legislation before the House to put a means test on private health insurance in this country must be opposed by all clear-thinking members who are interested not just in the good health of our country's balance sheet but also in the physical health and wellbeing of all Australians.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (17:33):  I also rise to speak against the passage of the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, which I believe will be a dagger through the heart of the private health insurance industry. I commend the member for Kooyong, who was just speaking, for his remarks, and I associate myself with his comments. There are three reasons I am against this bill before us. First, it is based on a broken promise. Second, it is bad policy that will cause premiums to go up for all Australians. And, third, it is bad economics; it will just lead to greater cost-shifting to the states and longer public hospital waiting lists.


Let me go to the first point—the broken promise. This bill is just another breach of faith from this Labor government. It is another broken promise. We had a firm commitment—in words, in writing—from this government that it would not be amending the private health insurance rebate scheme. The Labor Party made this very, very clear, and it did so time and time again. Perhaps nothing is more clear on this than the letter Mr Kevin Rudd, who at the time was the federal Labor leader, wrote to the chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association in late 2007. He wrote:




Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.



There are many other occasions on which this very firm commitment not to amend the private health insurance rebate was made. But what do we have before us? We have a further breach of faith from this government against an explicit commitment it had made.


The second reason I am against this bill is that it is poor policy that will push premiums up for everyday Australians. Madam Deputy Speaker, as you may be aware, an estimated 12 million Australians now have private health insurance. That constitutes over half the Australian population, or 52.9 per cent. Of those, about 10.3 million have hospital treatment cover. The people who take out private health insurance are not, overall, just the wealthiest in Australian society—not by any stretch of the imagination. To give you a few figures to prove this point: 5.6 million people who have private health insurance have a household income of less than $50,000 per annum and 3.4 million have a household income of less than $35,000 per annum. This is not an individual's income; this is a collective household income. It is a broad cross-section of Australian society that is taking out private health insurance. This is a good thing. It is a good thing that a broad cross-section of society takes out private health insurance. It is a good thing that so many people take out private health insurance, because the more people who take out private health insurance the less pressure there is on the public system. As we know there are extensive waiting lists on the public system, there are stresses and there are pressures on it. The more we can take off the public health system the better it is for everybody.


It has not always been the case that we have had such a high proportion of people who take out private health insurance. Far from it. If you go back to the Hawke and Keating governments people were dropping out and the private health insurance system was at quite a critical point. From memory, I believe at that time the percentage of those with private health insurance was down to about 33 per cent of the population. When Howard and Costello came to government in 1996 they saw this problem and tried to rectify it. Indeed, they put in a number of steps over the course of their government to lift the proportion of people who took out private health insurance, and they had a remarkable effect. An estimated 75 per cent more people took out private health insurance as a result of the measures that the Howard-Costello government put in place. That high proportion has been maintained all the way through to this present time. But now we are again at a critical stage. We are at a moment where the tides may turn once again, and turn in a negative direction.


What will be the impact of the proposed changes contained within the bill before us? As we know, some 2.4 million people will be directly affected. They will face immediate increases in their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent or 43 per cent, depending on their income tier. That is a huge percentage increase in their premiums. This is at a time when many people, even people who are relatively well off, with incomes of $100,000 or $150,000, still have mortgages to pay and when electricity bills, groceries, water bills, child care et cetera are all going up. But the increases will not be limited to those 2.4 million people who are on higher incomes. Rather, the impacts will be felt by everybody who has private health insurance—every single one of those 12 million people.


Deloitte, who have done some analysis of the bill before us, believe that, as a result of the changes proposed, premiums across the board will go up by 10 per cent above what they would ordinarily go up by. Ordinarily we see premiums go up five, six or seven per cent per annum. Here we are talking about potentially a 17 per cent increase in premiums. The government's own private health insurer, Medibank Private, predicts that 37,000 of their members will drop cover because of the increase in premiums. They predict that 95,000 of their members will downgrade their cover because of the increase in premiums that will come about as a result of this bill. That is just one insurance company. That does not include Bupa, Australian Unity or all the other private health insurance companies. That is just one private health insurance company, the government's own, which estimates that 37,000 people with drop out and 95,000 people will downgrade.


Deloitte believe that in the short term 175,000 people could withdraw from private hospital cover and over 500,000 people will downgrade. In the medium term, the five-year horizon, they estimate that 1.6 million people will drop out and 4.3 million people will downgrade. If these figures are anywhere close to being accurate, and I believe they will be, we will be seriously winding back the clock. People will be dropping out again in droves and premiums will skyrocket. This will just put more pressure on the public hospital system, which it does not need at present. More pressure on the public hospital system also means more pressure on taxpayers, who have to pay for the public hospital system.


On that particular point, we have some modelling suggesting that every dollar of funding provided to the private health insurance rebate saves $2 for the government. So, overall, the analysis based on the bill in front of us is that $3.8 billion extra will be required to fund the public hospital system as a result of these particular changes.


In my own electorate over 84,000 people have private health insurance. These are not wealthy people; they are everyday, middle-income Australians. They take out private health insurance not because they are particularly well-off but because they like the convenience, the choice and some of the peace of mind associated with it. Another significant reason for it in my electorate is that they want to have access to Knox Private Hospital, which is for most residents in my electorate the closest and most convenient hospital for them to attend. It is easy for them, and their family members, to get there. Under the changes proposed, many people may have to look further afield in order to access the hospital of their choice, because they may not be able to afford the premiums, should they go up as we expect they will.


Why are the Labor Party doing this, given that it is based on a broken promise and it is poor policy, which we know will put up costs for everyday Australians and cause thousands of people to drop out? We know it will cost the taxpayer potentially billions of extra dollars overall. Why are they Party doing it? There are two reasons. The first is ideological. The Labor Party have never liked private health insurance. They have always argued against the additional benefits that the Howard-Costello government put in place. Despite what they said publicly before election, we have always known that secretly they have wanted to reduce the number of people covered by it.


The second reason that they are doing it, though, is because the Labor Party—the Rudd-Gillard government—have blown the budget so systemically and so categorically that they are now looking for every single dollar that they can possibly find to create the elusive budget surplus come budget time this year. As I pointed out, overall the impact of these bills on the taxpayers will be a negative one, with them potentially paying billions of dollars extra as people shift back to the private health system.


But the accounting trick—and this is the only thing that the government are interested in—means that in the short term there could be savings, because it will shift costs from the Commonwealth across to the states. The states still have to find the money somewhere. They are raising taxes from the same constituents, whether they be in my electorate or any other electorate. But the federal government will be able to make a short-term cost saving, according to the Treasury figures. These bills are in front of us because they do not like private health insurance and never have and because they are desperate to find extra savings because the budget is in such poor shape. This provides them with a neat little accounting trick in the short term to get them through the grave difficulties that they have at the moment.


Let me summarise the position in relation to these bills. They are based on a broken promise—that is the first point. They implement poor policy that will see premiums increase across the board for everyday Australians on very modest incomes. It will see people fall out of private health insurance and put greater pressure on the public health system. That is the second point. Finally, my third point is that these bills are poor economics. They increase the pressure on the taxpayer overall and create additional financial pressure on state governments that the Commonwealth avoids in the short term. I am firmly against these bills. I believe that all sensible members of this parliament should also vote against these bills.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (17:47):  I rise tonight to address the Fairer Private Health Insurances Bill 2011, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011. I am pained to even call the package by its name. This package of bills is not designed to make things fairer for Australians and nor is it designed to make things better in our national healthcare system. This legislation is designed to cut the healthcare rebate that families and singles are eligible for. That means nothing less than private health insurance becoming more expensive for working families in this nation. That will compound on increases in the cost of living across the board.


We are battling a healthcare crisis in this country. Public waiting lists have been spiralling out of control and now this government wants to cut private healthcare insurance to save a few dollars. The hallmark of this government is economic mismanagement. This is a Labor government that is happy to spend $50 billion on a National Broadband Network that has only 4,000 customers after five years. It is happy to spend $2 billion on its border protection blowout, including cigarettes for detainees. And yet, when it comes to the lives and wellbeing of the people of Australia, this is where the ALP thinks they should be saving money.


Just a couple of months ago, in November, I read a story in the Newcastle Herald by Jacqui Jones entitled 'Hunter surgery schedule blowout'. It is important that I quote this article to the parliament. It read:


Surgery waiting lists have blown out at some Hunter hospitals to almost four times longer than the national average, with waits increasing 20 times over in the past year for some procedures, the latest data shows.


The most recent information on hospitals’ performance will be made publicly available today through the federal government’s MyHospitals website.


It is based on information provided by public health departments to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. 


A Newcastle Herald analysis of data for Hunter hospitals showed blowouts in waiting times for surgery in 2010-11, compared with 2009-10, and waits that were longer than national averages.


At Calvary Mater Newcastle, the median wait for plastic surgery was 93 days in 2010-11, compared with the national average of 24 days.


This was up from a wait of four days in 2009-10, and 22 days nationally.


Waiting times for gall bladder removal and hernia repair increased over the year and were longer than national averages.


At John Hunter Hospital, eye surgery patients waited twice as long as their national counterparts.


Delays were long for cataract extraction, with the 282-day median wait (90 days nationally) in 2010-11 up from 176 days (86 days nationally) in 2009-10.


Orthopaedic patients took longer to get to surgery, including for hip and knee replacements, at John Hunter Hospital than patients booked at hospitals elsewhere in Australia.


At Maitland Hospital, orthopaedic lists blew out to a 234-day median wait (national 64 days) in 2010-11, compared with 169 days (national 62 days) in 2009-10.


Increases were also experienced within the year and beyond Australia-wide trends for gynaecological surgery and haemorrhoid removal at Maitland. 


The waiting times at Kurri Kurri Hospital for ear, nose and throat surgery and at Belmont Hospital for a hysterectomy increased over the year and were longer than national averages.


Here we have in the Hunter people waiting longer than ever before and yet this Labor government wants to force more people onto the public health system, thereby making the situation much worse. We have people in the Hunter waiting up to four times longer for surgery than their interstate counterparts. And yet all of the members from the Hunter—the member for Newcastle, Sharon Grierson; the member for Hunter, Joel Fitzgibbon; the member for Charlton, Greg Combet; and the member for Shortland, Jill Hall—are going to push this legislation through. And it looks like they will be joined by Rob Oakeshott, the member for Lyne. They are all just champing at the bit to support the economic mismanagement of this Labor government, which will be to the detriment of people in our region. This really should be a no-brainer. Even the Labor Party should be able to see how destructive this legislation will be. However, I will spell it out, just in case they have not worked it out yet: this legislation will make private health insurance more expensive for 2.4 million Australians. For some of those people it will mean an increase in premiums of 43 per cent. That is a cost of almost 1½ times what they are already paying. Deloitte have done the figures and, under this legislation, 1.6 million Australians are likely to drop their private health cover over the next five years. And, of those who do not drop it altogether, a further 4.3 million will downgrade the level of their coverage. The minister has not even tried to deny this—in fact, she has admitted that people will drop their cover. When coupled with increases in the costs of living, including groceries, rent, power and gas because of this Labor government's reckless carbon tax, yet to come, this is just another attack on families and on their budgets and it is a thing they just cannot afford. According to this Labor government, if you work hard to provide private health care for yourself and your family, you should be punished—you are doing too well for yourself and you are not paying enough.


We only have to take a step back and look at why private health insurance rebates were provided in the first place to understand why the current system works so well. When the Medicare levy surcharge and lifetime health cover were introduced under the previous coalition government, private health insurance coverage increased from 34 per cent in 1996 to 44 per cent in 2007. Today private hospitals treat two in five of all patients in Australia, which accounts for some 3.5 million patients every single year. If those patients do not have private health cover, that is an extra 3.5 million patients for the public health system to cope with—or not cope with, which is more likely the case.


I want to put this into perspective in my own electorate of Paterson. In my electorate there are 46,184 people aged 18 or over with private health insurance, according to the figures published on 1 January 2011. That is around half the adults in my electorate. According to national statistics, 13 per cent of people will drop private health cover under this legislation within just five years. A further 36 per cent of people will downgrade their cover. In Paterson that equates to 6,004 people dropping their private health insurance altogether and 16,626 people downgrading their cover. If just half those people who drop their cover need surgery, that is an extra 3,000 people who are going to be forced into the Hunter health system waiting list—and that is just in Paterson alone; that is not taking into account the electorates of Hunter, Shortland, Charlton, Newcastle or Lyne, which also rely on the Hunter's hospitals. And that does not include those people who have reduced their cover and can no longer go into private hospitals for certain procedures. I know I have just gone through a lot of numbers, but it is important that we understand the real, on-the-ground impacts of this destructive legislation: an extra 3,000 people from Paterson waiting in line for surgery, pushing back other patients and being pushed back themselves, is the real impact.


So it is no surprise to me that, with reckless money-making moves like this one, the Australian public does not trust the Prime Minister or her Labor colleagues when it comes to the economy. In fact, a poll taken last Saturday and published in today's Australianshows that the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, is far more trusted with money matters than the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. He has a nine-point lead on the question of handling the economy, with the Prime Minister having fallen by 14 percentage points since August 2010. Why would the public trust this government on the economy? After all, it is the same government who took a $20 billion surplus and turned it into a $96 billion deficit. This is the same government that takes a solution each and every time and turns it into a problem. There were years that passed without a single boat arrival under the former coalition government—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  Order! The member is straying from the content of the bill. I call you back to the bill.




Mr BALDWIN:
  I am showing a point on economic mismanagement, Madam Deputy Speaker.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It needs to be relevant to the bill.




Mr BALDWIN:
  With this economic mismanagement we now have 15,000 people illegally arriving by boat, putting further pressure on the health system. Now the ALP want to do the same thing to private health insurance. They want to create a problem where there isn't one.


Of course, we also know that you just cannot trust this government. What we keep getting is more and more examples of this government's dishonesty—a phoney, whatever-it-takes approach by government. After all, it was this Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, who said that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led—and yet we are set for the carbon tax to be introduced from 1 July. It was the same person, when the shadow minister for health, who said in the Weekend Australianin a letter to the editor, in her own writing:


The truth is I never had a secret plan to scrap the private health insurance rebate and, contrary to Mr Latham's diaries, do not support such a claim. For all Australians who want to have private health insurance the private health insurance rebate would have remained under a Labor government. I gave an iron-clad guarantee of that during the election. The difference between Tony 'rock-solid, iron-clad' Abbott and me is that, when I make an iron-clad commitment, I actually intend on keeping it.


In a further letter to the editor of the Courier Mailon 23 September 2004 she said:


Your correspondent Russell McGregor should have no concerns that Labor will erode or abolish the 30 per cent government rebate for private health insurance. Labor is committed to the maintenance of this rebate and I have given an iron-clad guarantee on that on a number of occasions.


That was from Julia Gillard, opposition health spokesperson. In fact, my favourite quote is: 'I grow tired of saying this: Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate,' in a letter to the editor of the Hobart Mercury.


It is just not the Prime Minister, who was then the shadow health minister who gave such guarantees. We only need to look at the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd, who, as Leader of the Opposition in 2007, wrote to Dr Armitage of the Australian Health Insurance and said:


Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor's policy regarding private health insurance. Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made it clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.


Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases. Zero per cent premium adjustment is not Labor policy.


I understand Nicola Roxon's office has also confirmed with you that Federal Labor has no plans to require private health insurance funds to make equivalent payments to public hospitals for patients who elect to be treated as private patients.


I trust this allays your concerns. Federal Labor values its relationship with the private health insurance sector and we look forward to continuing this regardless of the outcome on November 24.


Yours sincerely


Kevin Rudd


Federal Labor Leader


Member for Griffith


Nicola Roxon, then Minister for Health and Ageing, was quoted in the Age on 24 February 2009 as saying:


The Government is firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates …


Yet less than three months later, on 12 May 2009, the insurance rebate changes were announced in the budget.


This is a government that says one thing and does another. This is a government that finds a solution and creates a problem—over and over again. We are into 2012 and it is clear that this government neither respects nor values its relationship with the people of Australia who are paying for private health insurance and contributing to support a reduction in pressure on the public health system. All this government seems to want to do, in fact its whole agenda, is to claw back money from working families to prop up its failed economic management position, a position that has created record debt.


This is a desperate move by a desperate government that has squandered the dollars of millions of Australians on wasted programs like the insulation tragedy and the school halls rip-off. I say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, to each and every Labor member in this place and to the Independents: the health of our fellow Australians is far more important than all of the other programs that this government has wasted money on. This government will see, under its stewardship, a blow-out in the waiting lists in the public health system. This government will see, under its stewardship, private hospitals close because of a lack of patients. This government will see, under its stewardship, the health standards of the people of Australia deteriorate because it mismanaged the economy and saw as a sacrifice those hard-working Australians who take out private health insurance and who reduce the pressure on the public system. It should be the government's agenda, as it was under the previous coalition government and as it was stated to be by the previous Labor opposition, to support private health insurance to make it affordable for working families. That is why I call on the Independents to refuse to support this legislation that will hurt the people in their constituencies. I reject these bills as presented to the House.

"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (18:02): Today marks the third time that this government has tried to launch its disgraceful attack on the forgotten families of Macarthur, families who are already doing it tough in these difficult times. This government is shamefully out of touch with the Australian people and with Australian values. The very existence of this bill represents yet another broken promise from Labor. Labor promised, hand on heart, that it would not touch the private health insurance rebate.


I must be having deja vu, because I can vividly recollect a promise to Andrew Wilkie about poker machine reforms, a promise to the Australian people to return the budget to surplus and a promise that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' to borrow a phrase from the Prime Minster. Time after time we have seen repeated betrayals of the people of Australia. This Labor-Greens alliance will say anything to be in government, but, once in government, turn their backs on the people who elected them. They say one thing but do another. This government has a trust and credibility problem with the people of Australia. This bill represents yet another botched and broken election promise that will, without a doubt, result in greater cost of living pressures on families across this nation.


The Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011, the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2011 and the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 2011 are a key part of the Prime Minister's ideological arsenal against the freedom of choice in health care. Private health insurance gives people the choice of treating doctor, the choice of when and where they can access health services, the choice of surgery options and the choice to be treated in a private hospital.


Private health insurance does not take away from the public health system, but instead adds significant value to Australia's total healthcare resources. The private health insurance rebate is a policy that has been staunchly defended by the coalition because it is, simply put, a good policy. The 30 per cent rebate has had a direct result in taking pressure off the public health system, all the while adding value to the health system as a whole. Australia's public health system is highly regarded and does a fantastic job with the resources at its disposal. I am confident that, under the leadership of the Liberal New South Wales government of Premier Barry O'Farrell, the New South Wales public health system will see many positive developments over the coming years. It is not feasible to say that the public health system in Australia could survive without the complementary benefits that the private health system provides.


This bill is a shameless measure shifting cost from the Commonwealth to the states' public systems. When the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate was introduced by the Howard government, the national coverage of private health insurance rose from 34 per cent to 44 per cent. The Howard government had the foresight to also introduce the Medicare levy surcharge for those who should be able to afford private health insurance but for whatever reasons had not taken it up. This measure ensured that those who chose not to contribute to their own health care through the private health care system would still contribute to the public health care system. The test used to determine whether a person would be liable to pay the Medicare levy surcharge would include taxable income, reportable fringe benefits, reportable superannuation contributions and total net investment losses. This government is trying to distort these provisions by seeking to apply the same income tests to determine whether families will also lose their rebate. It is a perversion of what the Medicare levy surcharge sought to achieve. This test will not just be used for people who opt out of eligible private health insurance, but apply to people who are currently paying their premiums and benefiting from the 30 per cent rebate. These people will lose out: some will be pushed into a lesser category of the rebate and some will lose their rebate all together. All Australians will face higher premiums because of this disgraceful government's actions.


The private health insurance rebate gives families in Macarthur the incentive to provide for their own healthcare needs and get a little back from the government for doing so. This support, in the form of a 30 per cent rebate on eligible private health insurance policies, contributes back into the health system many times over through private health insurance premiums. For a couple in their mid-30s with two children, basic hospital and extras cover will cost at least $3,000 a year without the rebate. If people are going to be socially responsible and put their discretionary income towards their own healthcare costs, why should we punish them? Their investment in their health and, in turn, in the private health system, contributes to the resources that are available in both the public and private health systems. If this government decides to take away the incentive for people to purchase private health insurance, we risk losing the entire premium, and in turn create added pressure on the public system. This ideological attack on private health insurance may represent a short-term saving, but the longer-term implications on families are far-reaching. 


The immediate financial impacts of this bill will not just be felt by the 2.4 million people on higher incomes who will face immediate increases of their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent and 43 per cent. All Australians with private health insurance will face higher premiums in the future if these changes proceed. Deloitte have predicted that private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what they would otherwise be. In addition, Deloitte's analysis of the proposed changes shows that in the first year 175,000 people would be expected to drop their private hospital cover, and a further 583,000 are expected to downgrade their cover. Over five years, Deloitte's modelling forecasts that 1.6 million people will drop their cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. This is in stark contrast to the minister's figures of only 27,000 to drop their cover. Indeed, the government owned insurer, Medibank Private, has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. 


How did the minister get it so wrong? This is yet another example of the government's botched attempts at health reform and lack of thorough planning in policy making. It is a case of this Prime Minister and Labor yet again meddling with a good policy that works, a policy that delivers and a policy that has provided quality health care to Australian families. This bill is already bearing the hallmarks of the Malaysia solution all over again. With each person either dropping or downgrading their cover, there is a flow-on effect of a net reduction of resources within the private healthcare system. Each policy downgrade will place greater pressure on the public health system, all the while punishing those who continue in the private health system. 


The government has not even bothered to disclose the numbers of people expected to downgrade their private health insurance coverage. It is reasonable to expect that many people will seek a cheaper product with fewer procedures covered, which will have second-round effect for public hospitals. This represents $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs for the public sector. In Macarthur 63,828 people are covered by some form of private health insurance, representing 47.8 per cent of voters. Suffice to say, this legislation will affect close to half of my electorate.


At the 2007 election the government promised, hand on heart, that they would not touch the private health insurance rebate. However, soon after elected, they tried to push through this legislation, not once but twice. The Senate soundly rejected it. Now the Prime Minister is relying on her good graces with the Greens to push this bill through and once again betray the trust of families in Macarthur and Australia-wide. I guess it must get easier the more you do it. The government have no foot to stand on when they say they will deliver on a promise. Just look at their track record. They have bungled every program and policy that they have laid their hands on. Now this government is attempting to undermine both the public and private health systems simultaneously. This legislation is nothing more than a noxious housewarming gift for a newly elected NSW government with the monumental task of fixing up more than 15 years of total and utter neglect of the public health system under Labor. 


Allied health services are also expected to bear the brunt of this government's attack on private health insurance. It is expected that 2.8 million people with general treatment cover are going to withdraw and 5.7 million to downgrade over five years. This means fewer people accessing allied health services, which means less income and fewer jobs. Families in Macarthur are already financially stretched to the limit. Many pensioners are at the point where they have had to give up their private health insurance after the recent rise in premiums—and at a time of life where they cannot afford to lose it. The government's proposed changes are just going to make a bad situation worse. 


The coalition has strongly supported giving Australians the choice of affordable private health insurance. The 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance premiums is a proven policy that we have seen works. Families in Macarthur are going to be negatively impacted by this legislation, and many will have no option but to forgo private health insurance and rely on the already stretched public system. This is a bad policy that will do nothing but harm both our public and private health systems and I would urge members of the House to keep faith with their electorates and reject it. So I say this to members opposite: stand up for affordable and accessible private health cover. Stand up for your community, your seniors and your youth. Stand up for a fair go for Aussie families. Stick to the ironclad guarantee that the Prime Minister previously made to the Australian public: 'Under no circumstances will we touch the private health insurance rebate.' As late as August 2010 the Prime Minister also stated, 'Medicare rebates are safe under Labor.' How safe? These bills change all that. No wonder there is a trust and credibility problem with this government.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2012-02-13,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (18:12):  In rising to address this Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill, I have some difficulty getting past the name of the bill itself. It makes it sound like the bill will make things 'fairer'. But this bill has nothing to do with fairness. In fact, it is the exact opposite of fairness. It is about trying to justify the introduction of what is most certainly not fair. I am reminded of the late master of wit Groucho Marx, who said: 'The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you've got it made.' That is a rather appropriate quote for this bill, I thought, because the bill is anything but honest and it is trying to fake fairness. In reality it is not about fairness at all. It is actually more in line with the views of the other Marx, Karl, and penalising the so-called rich. It is about a desperate bid to create a surplus and it is about robbing the hard-working people of this nation who will do the work to create that surplus, if it ever happens. It has been 21 years since the Labor Party posted a surplus and it must be getting embarrassing for the government every year as they introduce new budgets. We have the Treasurer here trying to say that he is going to get one next year—because he will do anything to create the illusion of a surplus; just making it look like a surplus temporarily will do. But Australian families know that what this government says is only good for a few months at best.


But this time there is not enough smoke, there aren't enough mirrors. So now we see the Treasurer hoping to pull a rabbit out of the hat—a $2.78 billion rabbit. They were running around, rifling through the files, looking up old copies of Hansard, scanning the demographic data, trying to find a sector of the community that is getting ahead, trying to find someone who hopes for a better future and is willing to work hard to achieve it. That was their bunny and they found it: a dead and twice-buried plan to tax those people who work hard for a better life. They have found yet another way to rob the rewards that were earned by someone else. So here we are today, once again standing up to the Labor Party, the party of big tax. The title of this bill purports to be about a private health insurance incentive. That word is important: 'incentive'. The proposed legislation is not about incentive at all. There is no carrot here. This is the stick and stick approach. This government is pulling out the stick to those who pay for private health insurance. Anyone who has the gall to work hard and earn $80,000 or more a year will now have to pay more for their health insurance. That is not an incentive; that is a disincentive. It is a disincentive to earn more and it is a disincentive to purchase private health cover. Just in case this legislation means you cannot afford private health cover anymore, the government has another stick waiting for you—a baseball bat to slug more tax out of you in the form of the Medicare levy. So what we have is a lose-lose situation. This plan was beaten down twice before when there was so much opposition that even this government promised it would not happen again. Yet here it is again today. Prior to the 2007 election, we had Labor's then shadow health minister promising, in a media statement from 26 September 2007:


Federal Labor rejects the Liberal scare campaign around the private health insurance rebates. On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


It goes on to say:


The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates. This is absolutely untrue.


If this is absolutely untrue, then why is Labor introducing a bill today to do exactly that again? I thought maybe there was a typo in the media release and that the member for Gellibrand meant that it was absolutely correct. But then she was backed up two months later by then federal Labor leader, Kevin Rudd, the future Prime Minister, going to the 2007 election with this promise—this is what the member for Griffith wrote to Dr Michael Armitage of the Australian Health Insurance Association just four days before the 2007 election:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


We even had the current Prime Minister, back when she was shadow Minister for Health and Ageing, saying this to Laurie Oakes:


We will leave the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate undisturbed because we understand it's factored into family incomes—


a very interesting observation from the Prime Minister. Clearly the Australian Labor Party no longer understands Australian families or the fact that they have to factor these costs into their household budgets. So here we are debating a 'fairer' private health insurance incentive bill.


What is fair about this scenario? Consider two young men. Let us call one Bill. He lives and works in Melbourne and earns $79,000. The other—let us call him Ben—lives and works in regional Australia, participating in the resources boom that currently underpins our economy. Bill in Melbourne leads a pretty comfortable life. He has no trade and no tertiary studies behind him. He has spent long periods on unemployment benefits. He currently has a nine-to-five job which pays a good income of $79,000. He rents a large furnished apartment in the CBD for $450 a week. He does not need a car and walks to the MCG to watch his football team play, or to the cricket, and it is a pretty good life.


Now let us look at Ben, the bloke in country Queensland. He spent three years doing an apprenticeship when he supplemented his income to survive by working a casual job on nights and weekends. He has never missed a day of work and currently works long hours to earn $80,000. He has to maintain a work ute to get to job sites and carry his tools. He pays $550 a week in rent and if he wants to watch the Bulldogs play football, he is up for $600 in flights and $600 accommodation before a ball is bounced. Groceries, fuel, even a cup of coffee in his area are much more expensive because a labour shortage and high freight costs are pushing up the price of everything. I am sure Ben cannot wait for the carbon tax because he will cop the worst of the cost increases, being in regional Queensland. He will not be compensated in any way because his income is deemed 'too high'. As a result, Bill puts his feet up in his Melbourne apartment, comfortable in the knowledge that, even though he has a lower salary, he has a much higher disposable income compared with Ben. 


Under this 'fairer' legislation, Ben will also be facing higher costs for private health insurance. He works harder and longer hours. He has less money to spend but this government wants to tax him more, even though he already pays more tax than Bill. How is that fair? This is not an exaggerated case to make a point. This government wants to remove private health insurance incentives entirely from a family earning $249,000 this year. They would have us believe that this family sits around, watching a big plasma television, waiting for a $250,000 cheque to turn up in the mail. They would have us believe a family earning $249,000 or more a year are greedy, rich people who should be robbed with an unfair tax. This family is not just a statistic. It is a family of real human beings with real jobs, real children and real expenses.


For a husband and wife who both work in the mines at Moranbah in your electorate of Capricornia, Madam Deputy Speaker Livermore, where they live with their four children, to rent an average four-bedroom home they will be paying between $1,800 and $3,200 a week. Some rents are even higher. That translates to between $93,000 and $166,000 just for rent. By the time you take out income tax and rent, our family on $249,000 a year out in Moranbah probably cannot afford to feed the kids, let alone pay fully for private health insurance. This government would have us believe that these people are evil people of 'privilege'—the old class warfare bogey. This government does not even know these people because it stopped connecting with real people a long time ago. This government wants to smack such a family back down to the lowest level because they dared to have a dream—they wanted to get ahead.


I noticed an interesting headline in the Australian on Friday from a family talking about the costs this legislation will impose on them. The headline was a quote from Ms Kylie Richards from Adelaide, who, with her husband, owns a commercial flooring business. She said:


It's ridiculous—the better we do, the more the government takes … Every time we try to get ahead and don't rely on the welfare system, we get a guarantee they'll hit us again.


Ms Richards has summed up beautifully this government's fallback position: none shall get ahead. I can imagine the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport taking a quote from Gandalf. They shall not pass is what he is saying to Australian families. What this government will do with this bill is crucify both the economy and the health system.


According to this government, there are 2.4 million people living a life of privilege in this country, because that is how many people will be affected by this legislation. The result will be thousands—tens of thousands, I would say—of Australians dropping private health insurance because they simply cannot afford it anymore. In my electorate of Dawson, there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of residents who will be worse off. Families that are already under pressure from the escalating costs of living will have to make a saving somewhere else.


The minister has claimed 27,000 individuals would drop their health insurance cover if this bill were passed. But the government owned insurer Medibank Private suggests that figure is more, that in fact 37,000 of their members alone will drop their cover and a massive 92,500 people will downgrade their private health cover. That is just Medibank Private and what they see happening with their own members.


Taking an independent, industry-wide approach, the Australian Health Insurance Association commissioned Deloitte to assess the impact of this proposal. Their findings were that, should this bill be passed, 1.6 million consumers would drop private hospital cover, a further 4.3 million would downgrade their cover and a further 2.8 million would drop their general cover. Deloitte also has predicted that health insurance premiums would rise by 10 per cent over and above what they would otherwise be. So then everyone will cop it because of this government's bill.


As families and individuals leave private health in droves, this government will be rubbing its hands with glee. On the face of it—fingers crossed, guys!—that will be a massive saving for this year's budget deficit. It may be enough of a saving to create the illusion of a surplus. But the truth is that, for every dollar the government spends on health insurance rebates, the private health insurers are spending $2 on the provision of health services. Those private health services will now have to be provided by the public health system. What this government is hoping to do is throw a 'hospital pass' to the states for the sake of taxing Australian families and squeezing out its first surplus in 22 years.


Being a Queenslander, I find that a frightening proposition. The Labor government in Queensland has plumbed the very depths of incompetence already without having to cope with more pressure on its health service. Private hospitals currently treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia—some 3.5 million patients in the 2009-10 financial year. How will the bungling Queensland Health system—an organisation that the Premier tells us has failed under her watch—cope with their share of the increased workload? Private hospitals currently perform 64 per cent of elective surgeries in Australia. Where will the funding come from for the public health system to cope with such an increased workload?


In creating this 'damned if you do and damned if you don't' situation for families with private health cover, the government is basically kicking an own goal. Even if this white rabbit is combined with enough smoke and mirrors to create the illusion of a surplus, it will be just a matter of time before the mirrors crack and the smoke clears. When it does, Australian families who can no longer afford private health insurance will see nothing but a rotting rabbit carcass that carries the stench of deception, incompetence and betrayal.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:26):  I rise tonight to talk on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011. There are three points that I would like to make loud and clear. The first is that what we are debating tonight is an issue of trust—whether we can trust this government to say one thing before an election and then do that after an election. It is sad to say that this private health insurance piece of legislation that we are debating tonight adds to the list of broken promises. I would also like to discuss its implications on the cost of living, which is increasing on a daily basis for Australian citizens. This piece of legislation, sadly, will once again add to this cost of living. The third point I would like to make is about what this bill will do to cost shifting from the Commonwealth to the states. The state governments are already facing increased health costs. The Labor government on coming into power said that they were going to do something about that, that they were going to stop the blame game, that they were going to fix our health system. But what do we see them doing with this piece of legislation? They are moving the cost of health care away from the Commonwealth and onto the states. Those are the three issues that I would like to garner tonight.


I will start on the basic issue of trust. Truth is a five-letter word and I suggest to the Prime Minister—if it is okay, Madam Deputy Speaker—that she might learn how to spell it and act on it because, as we saw with the carbon tax, one thing was said before the last election and one thing was done after it. To be fair to the Prime Minister, on this occasion she was the member of a cabinet. She was not the Prime Minister but she was a member of the cabinet when the decision was made to say one thing before the 2007 election on the private health insurance rebate and then do another thing afterwards. But it was a precursor of what was to come.


Let us look at the letter that Kevin Rudd wrote to the honourable Dr Michael Armitage. I think it is worth just briefly going through it. It says:


Dear Dr Armitage,


Thankyou for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor’s policy regarding private health insurance.


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


Federal Labor will also maintain Lifetime Health Cover and the Medicare Levy Surcharge.


Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process for approval of premium increases. Zero per cent premium adjustment is not Labor policy;


I understand Nicola Roxon’s office has also confirmed with you that Federal Labor has no plans to require private health insurance funds to make equivalent payments to public hospitals for patients who elect to be treated as private patients.


I trust this allays your concerns. Federal Labor values its relationship with the private health insurance sector and we look forward to this continuing regardless of the election outcome on November 24.


As we know, Kevin Rudd was elected Prime Minister and Julia Gillard became a cabinet minister of the Rudd government. 




Mr Baldwin:
  And an assassin.




Mr TEHAN:
  And later an assassin, as my good friend the shadow minister for tourism so rightly interjects. As soon as they got in—the alarm bell should have been ringing there and then—the spending got out of control and the budget forecast did not look too good, and what was the first thing they did? They looked at the private health insurance rebate as a way of trying to get the budget back into a state which could give some sort of credibility to the Labor government's very poor efforts in managing the economy. Having been quite prepared immediately before the 2007 election to say one thing and then do completely the opposite afterwards, we should have known that this was a precursor of what the government was prepared to do on the carbon tax before the 2010 election.


Sadly, when it comes to this issue of truth, we have also seen it raise its ugly head when it comes to what happened on Australia Day. It seems very hard—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms K Livermore
):  Order! The member for Wannon will restrict his remarks to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill.




Mr TEHAN:
  One of the key points which need to be made on this bill is around the issue of trust.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member can make it in the context of the bill.




Mr TEHAN:
  The second point that I would like to make refers to cost of living. This piece of legislation will add to the cost of living in this country. Those on the other side may argue that this is a one-off in adding to the cost of living and therefore it is something that needs to be done. But the truth is that it is not a one-off. We have seen the price of insurance rise incredibly in the last three to six months. People have seen their bills go from $500 to $5,000 in the invoices they have been issued in the last couple of months. We have seen electricity prices rising exponentially, and they are going to get worse, sadly. We have seen the cost of child care rising. The cost of living is biting; it is hitting hard. What is the government's answer? To increase it even further. That is what this bill will do.


The sad thing is that the cost-of-living increase will hit those who can least afford it. It will hit the pensioners who save so that they can take out private health insurance and who want to have the surety of knowing that they can get the medical help they desire later in life. They will be the ones who will hang onto private health insurance. They will be the ones who have to put up with the increases in premiums. Because of the cost increase as a result of this decision, the more mobile, younger and healthier people will decide that they do not see a need to continue to take out private health insurance. This will put pressure on premiums. It will put pressure on those who want to take out full coverage—elderly Australians. Premiums will rise as a result of this decision by this government. Sadly, once again, we are going to see cost-of-living pressures on those who can least afford it as a result of this government's policy.


This is not only going to add to the cost of living. It will also add to the healthcare bills of state governments. When Labor was elected in 2007 it said it was going to stop the blame game when it came to the health sector in Australia. For too long, the Labor Party said, the argy-bargy between the states and the Commonwealth had led to the sector declining, to waiting lists growing and to people having to wait in emergency too long to get the attention that they need. Yet what do we see now? Firstly, we see the great reforms that were promised to the health sector amount to nothing. What was finally agreed did nothing to end the blame game. All it did was see the Commonwealth try to take some power off the states in the way the hospital system was managed without providing any real increases in finances to help the states do their job.


Now what are we seeing? We are seeing the Commonwealth come along and once again shift more costs onto the state government. There is no-one who argues against this fact leading to more pressure on our public health system. The Commonwealth should do the right thing by the states and say: 'We are going to take this decision to try to get our budget back in order. We have spent far too much on things like pink batts and school halls. We have wasted billions of dollars. We need to get our budget back in order. Therefore we are going to cost-shift on you. But we are going to do the right thing and help you do that. We are going to give you some of the cost to help you deal with the increased demand that you are going to see in the public health system.' They have not done that, so the states are going to have to cope with the increase in public hospital waiting lists which will occur as a result of this legislation. They are going to have to deal with the increase in demand in the emergency areas of hospitals which will occur as a result of these changes. And what are the Commonwealth doing to help the states deal with that? Nothing. They are blatantly cost shifting, and they need to own up and say that that is what they are doing. That is how desperate they have become to try to get a budget surplus in May, to try for the first time in over 21 years to get a Labor government budget surplus.


The Australian people will not be fooled by the way that this government is going about it. It is smoke and mirrors, and it is doing nothing to fix the structural imbalances that we currently have in the economy. These need to be fixed so that we can have a reduction in the $132 billion of net debt which will peak this year and so that we can see reductions in the way this government spends its money and in the way that it tries to account for getting its budget into surplus.


There are three points we need to look at. The first is the issue of trust, and I will make one simple point on that issue. I quote Nicola Roxon on 26 September 2007:


Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing private health insurance rebates.


What happened instead? Only a year or so later we saw a complete reversal of that explicit promise that was made to the Australian people before the 2007 election. That decision was made collectively by then Prime Minister Rudd and then cabinet minister Gillard.


The second thing this legislation will do is add to the already growing list of cost-of-living pressures that this government is putting on the Australian people: insurance costs, electricity costs, childcare costs and private health insurance costs. I could go on and on. The third thing that this bill will do is shift costs from the Commonwealth onto the states, and it will do it despite this government saying that it was determined to stop the blame game and to fix the Australian health system once and for all. It was very clear who was raising money, where the money would be spent and how the services would be delivered so that people could point to where the system was and was not working, rather than having the federal government and state government saying, 'The whole issue depends on the service delivery and the costs and you aren't getting that right.'


That is why I stand here today opposing these changes. They are a breach of trust, they will add to the cost of living and, worse than that, they will shift the cost of delivering health care from the Commonwealth to the states at a time when the states need help in delivering the services they want to deliver. They do not need extra costs being put on their health services.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:41):  I rise tonight to speak on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011. It is a rather Orwellian name, for it is certainly not fairer and it certainly has nothing to do with incentives. If there was one single reason that this bill should be opposed it is the issue of credibility and trust. Even the learned member for Lyne has recently and openly stated that our current Prime Minister, and therefore our government, has a credibility problem.


Let us just have a look at what this Prime Minister and members of this government have said in the past on the issue of private health insurance. Exhibit No. 1 is a press release from Julia Gillard, shadow minister for health, transcript of doorstop interview, state parliament Melbourne, 22 August 2004:


Reporter: Can the Labor Party make a commitment to do with private insurance if they were to be elected?


Ms Gillard: Labor has committed to keeping the 30% private health insurance rebate.


I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's broken promise on keeping the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate contained in the press release dated 22 August 2004.


Leave not granted.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Exhibit No. 2 is the transcript of an interview on the Sunday program on 29 August 2004 between Laurie Oakes and the then shadow health minister and current Prime Minister:


Laurie Oakes: What about the 30 per cent health insurance subsidy?


Julia Gillard: We've said that we will keep the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. That is out there now in the community. It's a payment that's been factored into family budgets, into people who are working and struggling with the bills and the mortgage and the payments for the kids, and also into the family budgets of older Australians who have private health insurance.


It went on:


We will leave the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate undisturbed because we understand it's factored into family incomes.


I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's broken promise of 29 August 2004 in the interview with Laurie Oakes on the Sunday program.


Leave not granted.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Exhibit No. 3 is a transcript of an interview between Tony Jones and Julia Gillard on ABC's Lateline on 12 September 2006. It says:


Tony Jones: … Are you going to look again at the private health care rebate. Is that sacrosanct? 


Julia Gillard: No, the private health insurance rebate will be staying under Labor. We committed to that at the last election. Indeed, we committed to it at the election before. From time to time the Howard Government runs out with a scare campaign here but the private health insurance rebate will stay.


I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's broken promise on keeping the 30 per cent health insurance rebate contained in the transcript of the interview between Tony Jones and Julia Gillard on ABC's Lateline.


Leave not granted. 




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
 Exhibit No. 4 is a media statement dated 26 September 2007 entitled 'Liberal scare campaign on private health insurance rebates—Federal Labor to retain rebates'. It says:


Federal Labor rejects the Liberal scare campaign around the Private Health Insurance rebates.


… … …


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


… … …


The Liberals continue to try to scare people into thinking Labor will take away the rebates.


This is absolutely untrue.


I seek leave to table the Labor government's broken promises on keeping the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate contained in a media release dated 26 September 2007.


Leave not granted. 




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Exhibit No. 5 is a letter from the then federal Labor leader, the member for Griffith, to Dr Michael Armitage, CEO of the Health Insurance Association. It reads:


Dear Dr Armitage,


Thank you for your letter of 29 October 2007 seeking clarification on Federal Labor’s policy regarding private health insurance.


Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per rebates for older Australians.


…   …   …


I trust this allays your concerns.


I seek leave to table the letter from the then federal Labor leader to the Australian Health Insurance Association containing the broken promise on keeping the 30 per cent health insurance rebate.


Leave not granted. 




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  Exhibit No. 6 is from the Hobart Mercury and is a letter of 2 September 2004 from the current Prime Minister, and then shadow minister for health. It states: 'Tasmanian Liberal deputy leader told two lies in the Mercury when he said that a Labor government would scrap the private health insurance rebate. I grow tired of saying this: Labor is committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate.'


I seek leave to table the letter in the Hobart Mercury of the current Prime Minister, and then shadow minister for health, dated 2 September 2004, containing this further broken promise that Labor was committed to maintaining the health insurance rebate.


Leave not granted. 




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  What a surprise; they simply do not want to know. Does anyone see a pattern here with the infamous broken promise on the carbon tax? Not only do we have Labor misleading the public on important policy issues but they take the misrepresentation further by accusing those dastardly Liberals of a scare campaign by daring to suggest that Labor cannot be trusted. 


It is not just broken promises on the health insurance rebate and the carbon tax. We have seen this government mislead the member for Denison and leave him hanging out to dry. We have seen them mislead the public on the issue of gay marriage. But I think the most appalling example of this government's misleading conduct is their statement in regard to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. For the Prime Minister to get up in front of a room full of disabled people and their carers at last year's national disability awards and claim that the NDIS will be the defining achievement of this government, when they have not committed one brass razoo and not one single cent to funding for the NDIS was absolutely shameful.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  I remind the member for Hughes that we are debating the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and to remain within the parameters of that bill.




Mr CRAIG KELLY:
  This pattern of repeated misleading conduct not only has destroyed the Prime Minister's credibility but is weakening our entire democracy. What person is ever going to believe another word that this Labor government says. If they told you it was raining outside, you would need to go outside and check for yourself. If this bill is passed, as we go into the next election—based on this government's track record—any commitment, any promise, is not going to be worth the paper it is written on. 


I say to the Independents: there is a heavy responsibility upon you when it comes to voting for this legislation. In years past, the Independents have justified their place in this parliament by sitting here under the motto of 'keeping the bastards honest'. But if the Independents vote with Labor on this bill, they will have simply aided and abetted this government's dishonesty. 


This bill has nothing to do with attempting to improve health insurance. It has nothing to do with creating more hospital beds. It has nothing to do with improving health services. It is all about a short-term revenue grab—a desperate attempt to cook the books to show a wafer-thin surplus in the next financial year. This is despite having run up the four largest budget deficits in Australian history—a combined total of $167 billion. The so-called saving from this bill of $2.8 billion is a further cooking of the books for it does not take into account the $3.8 billion in additional costs that will be generated down the line and generated on state budgets. Make no mistake, this government's inability to manage a budget is the only reason we are debating this bill here today, and today, as every day, they are showing how little they care for the challenging costs of living faced by people in Sydney and the rest of our other major cities and country areas. 


If this bill passes parliament, it will start off a vicious circle which will ultimately punish working families. Firstly, with so many cost-of-living pressures being inflicted by this government—electricity prices, childcare costs and the spectre of the carbon tax predicted to fall on the economy like a sledgehammer—removing this rebate will simply see people either downgrade their existing private health insurance or drop it altogether, thereby pushing more people into the public health system. A Deloitte analysis has shown that in the first year 175,000 people would withdraw from private health insurance cover and a further 583,000 people would downgrade their coverage. The answer is obvious to reasonable Australians: by driving people away from private health insurance, the cost of premiums for those that remain in the system will be forced up. The Deloitte analysis predicts a 10 per cent rise in premiums above what they would otherwise be. With fewer people paying for private health insurance, existing premiums will continue to increase, thereby setting off another round of people either downgrading their private health insurance or dropping it altogether—again, pushing another lot of people away from the private system and into the public health system. 


The report goes on to estimate that, over five years, 1.6 million Australians will drop their cover and a further 4.3 million will downgrade it. Ultimately, the people who will be most hurt by this bill are the Australians earning less than $50,000 that make up 50 per cent of Australians with health insurance. It will lengthen hospital queues. It will cause pain, suffering and hardship. Millions of Australian families that are doing their bit for the economy, even though they are already struggling with cost of living pressures, will be hurt by this bill. No wonder there are no government members left on the other side to defend this broken promise which will penalise Australian families at the time when they can least afford it. 


In my seat of Hughes there are 91,000 people that rely on their private health insurance cover, and many of these 91,000 people will be forced to fork out an additional $935 a year. That has been made clear by the recent Deloitte report. This bill—the so-called Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill—and its associated bills will rip support from families doing the right thing by our public health system. The millions of Australian families that will be hurt by this bill are doing their bit for the country, even though they are already struggling with cost-of-living pressures—and this will only be made worse by the carbon tax. We are again seeing Labor driving the dagger of cost of living into the heart of middle-class working families. Shame on this government for introducing this bill, and shame on every Labor member who votes for it. I call on the Independents to live up to the motto 'keep the bastards honest' and vote against this bill.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (18:55):  I rise to oppose the deceptively entitled Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and two cognate bills. I describe these bills in this way particularly because the content of this legislation is anything but fair. It does not matter how much the government tries to dress these bills up; it will not change the fact that it proposes a severe impact on families, the private health industry and public health services in Brisbane and across the nation. 


In Australia we face many policy challenges in the area of health. As the population and the average life span continues to grow, the demand on our health system will increase quite dramatically. The percentage of health spending in state government budgets increases every single year, yet they seem to make very little progress when the waiting lists grow longer and longer. That is why it is important to ensure that as many people as possible have the capacity to purchase private health insurance to alleviate the pressure on our public health system.


The Howard government recognised this. According to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council 2009-10 annual report to the government, in the 15 years between 1984 and 1998 the percentage of Australians with private health cover had halved to just a little over 30 per cent of the population. To fix this decline in membership, the then government—which I was proud to be a part of—introduced a number of initiatives: in 1997 the one per cent Medicare levy surcharge for high-income earners who had not taken out private health insurance and the 30 per cent premium tax rebate for taxpayers who had taken out some form of private health insurance. These policy measures worked. The take-up of private health insurance has taken off since then—so much so that last year $12.4 billion in benefits was paid to some of the 11.7 million Australians who now hold some form of private health insurance cover. This is approximately 52 per cent of the Australian population. This is also reflected in my electorate of Brisbane where 89,920 persons are covered by some form of private health insurance, and 66,676 of these are voters. This equates to 72.1 per cent of the voting population, which is 20 per cent above the national average. 


This Labor government wants to undo this great work through the suite of bills we have here before us tonight. It is the third time they have come before this chamber. They were rejected twice by the Senate in the last parliament, and yet here we go again. These bills create a three-tier system in the private health insurance rebate, slashing the rebate and increasing the Medicare levy surcharge for Australian taxpayers within certain income categories. The rhetoric coming out of the Labor Party is that somehow this is rectifying a situation where the rich are being subsidised for their private health insurance by those on lower incomes. Yet, under tier 1, the rebate is slashed by 10 per cent for singles earning over $80,000 and couples earning over $160,000 per year. Let us be clear about this: we are talking here about a teacher married to a policeman. These are the hardworking forgotten Australians aspiring to success. Since the announcement of these measures there has been a litany of evidence produced showing the absolutely disastrous impact that they would have on the public hospital system and the private health insurance industry. These changes will do one thing and one thing only: they will force people to drop their private health cover or choose cheaper cover with more procedures excluded, thus creating upward pressure on premiums and forcing more people into an overcrowded, overstretched public health service system. Every dollar of funding provided for the private health insurance rebate actually saves $2 of costs that are then paid by the private health insurers. Private hospitals in this country treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia and in 2009-10 they treated 3.5 million patients. They performed some 64 per cent of elective surgery in Australia.


Treasury projected that following these changes only 25,000 high-income consumers would withdraw their cover across the whole sector. This was then clearly proven to be inaccurate when the government-owned insurer Medibank Private came out and said 37,000 of its members alone would drop their cover and some 92,500 members would downgrade—an enormous number of people. A report into these measures by the highly regarded consultancy firm Deloitte for the Australian Health Insurance Association produces some very, very telling findings. Their analysis relies on the results of a survey by ANOP Research Services of 2,000 holders of private health cover on their intentions and the effect of a slashing of the rebates.


I note that the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, in her second reading speech took aim at the ANOP survey, saying it was wildly inaccurate, but she cannot ignore the fact that she was the health minister then. It was a very simple survey asking people what their intentions were and the importance of the rebate to them. It was really interesting to note that one of the people who designed and interpreted the survey was none other than Mr Rod Cameron, who for many years was an ALP pollster and numbers man. So his expertise and his wonderful work was good enough for the Labor Party to use and to rely on over many years, yet as soon as he produces something that they do not like they do not want to hear about it—they attack the work that he produces.


I will not go through the entirety of the Deloitte assessment. However, I do want to quote a brief passage from the executive summary, which summarises the findings. It states:


Significant numbers of consumers will withdraw from their private hospital cover (1.6 million consumers over five years) or downgrade to lower levels of private health cover (4.3 million consumers over five years) following the proposed policy change.


The Deloitte assessment has some very significant figures here. It also says:


Significant numbers of consumers will also withdraw from their general treatment cover (2.8 million consumers over five years) or downgrade to lower levels of private health cover (5.7 million consumers over five years) following the proposed policy change.


The interesting fact that it also mentions is that private health insurance premiums will rise 10 per cent above what would otherwise be expected. So we have a situation whereby premiums will rise and private health cover will become less affordable for consumers—and that is not just those in those tiers. As people withdraw from private health insurance, the burden on publicly provided health services will continue to rise and rise. These findings indicate that the cost of treating consumers in the public hospital system is going to rise substantially above what is currently anticipated by the government. Deloitte estimates that the additional operating costs accumulated over five years will be $3.8 billion—$1.4 billion in the fifth year alone.


These findings are a damning indictment on the measures included in these bills. All because of what? The inability of the ALP to manage Australia's finances responsibly—that is what this is all about. So what do they do? Since the election of the Rudd government in 2007, the billions of dollars of waste and government expenditure have been absolutely scandalous. We know the stories of the pink batt waste, the $900 cheques being paid to deceased persons and the school halls program, just to name a few. The Labor Party is desperate to find a way to deliver the budget surplus and turn around a $37 billion budget deficit. These proposals are nothing more than a lazy financial quick fix and are not based on any sound policy whatsoever.


Whenever the Labor Party finds itself in a mess, they revert to class warfare. We saw it in question time last week when the Prime Minister was asked about private health insurance. They are interested only in creating a class warfare situation and this is, of course, absolute nonsense. The only contribution the Labor Party has to make in this country is to play the politics of envy. In this case, this supposed attack on 'the rich' will end up hurting the low- and middle-income families in my electorate the most.


I will always stand up in this place for the constituents of the electorate of Brisbane. On behalf of the 89,920 people in my electorate who have private health insurance cover, I will oppose these bills.

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (19:06):  I rise to speak to the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and related bills that are before the House. The intent of the bill is to reduce the private health insurance rebate and increase the Medicare Levy Surcharge for those people who opt out of private health insurance, because it will become prohibitively expensive without the rebate.


It is a fundamental right of all Australians to expect that they will receive quality health care. It is the coalition's view that this is best done by giving people choice in the form of access to affordable health care providers, thereby relieving the pressure on the public health system. It is the coalition's view that access to health care should not be ideologically driven, and it should not be socially engineered. But that is precisely what is happening with this legislation.


There are a few issues here. One is that the Labor government is philosophically opposed to the notion of choice. The second is that the Labor government is scrambling to balance its books before this year's budget and it needs to find the dollars where it can. The third is the impact that this legislation will have on the hard-working people of my community of Longman.


When the coalition government introduced the private health insurance incentives that Australians currently enjoy it increased the ability of many households to choose. In fact, private health insurance coverage increased from 34 per cent of the population to 44 per cent. More Australians have more choice now. Those Australians who do not have private health insurance can access the public system.


But those of us who have gone through the public health system for care have seen firsthand the pressure it is under. There is no denying that much needs to be done to improve the public health system. It is fortunate that we are not holding our breath for delivery on former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's promise to fix the public health system and end the so-called blame game once and for all.


However, imagine what the pressure on the public health system is going to look like if Australians already labouring under soaring cost-of-living pressures decide to jettison their private health insurance because they simply cannot afford it. Some 2.4 million people will be affected by the increased cost of private health insurance. For those in the first income tier, premiums will increase by 14 per cent; for those in the second tier, premiums will increase by 29 per cent; and, for those in the third tier, premiums will rise by a huge 43 per cent. The Labor government claims that the impact these changes will have will be negligible. It claims that only 27,000 people will drop their private health insurance and that this will result in only 8,500 additional hospital admissions.


That is not what Medibank Private is saying and it is not what Deloitte is saying. Medibank Private has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover and a further 92,500 will downgrade. Deloitte's analysis indicates that 175,000 people will dump their private health insurance and 583,000 will downgrade in the first year alone. Over five years, it is expected that 1.6 million people will drop their private health insurance and 4.3 million people will downgrade their cover.


What does this mean for allied health services—physiotherapists, for example? There has been no talk about the impact this legislation will have on ancillary cover, which is so vital to ensuring the continuing viability of the allied health sector. This legislation represents a removal of choice for Australian families. It is ideologically driven by a government which does not support Australians being able to decide what is best for them. And for what possible benefit? Family budgets are under pressure and the public health system is under pressure. These measures are only going to make those pressures worse.


Apart from ideology, the Labor government could have only one other reason for introducing this legislation—it is desperate to claw back some of the money it has squandered in reckless spending on failed programs. To do so, the government is attacking private health insurance. What other explanation can there be for yet another litany of broken promises from this government? On 27 September 2007, just before the 2007 election, the current health minister said that Labor rejected what she called 'the Liberal scare campaign around the private health insurance rebates.' She said:


On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians.


It is crystal clear now—crystal clear that this was just another promise made just before an election and destined for the wastebasket of this Labor government's electoral opportunism.


What is really important to me is the effect that this legislation will have on my community of Longman. As I have said on numerous occasions in this place, life is getting harder for the families in my community and they are doing it really tough. The price of everything is going up—electricity, water, food, fuel, car registration and the public transport that so many working families in my community rely on to access the city where they work. It is getting more and more difficult for the hardworking members of my community to make ends meet.


Yet again, this high-taxing and recklessly spending Labor government is determined to make the lives of ordinary Australians harder. And this legislation will do just that. Many members of my community have contacted me, increasingly angry about the fact that this Labor government is not acting in their best interests. It is destroying confidence, spending recklessly and taxing and taxing and taxing.


But there is another issue here and that is the effect that an exodus from private health insurance will have on health services in my community. The hardworking medical staff at the Caboolture Hospital do a fantastic job, but they need more resources. Demands on local health services are already too high for the infrastructure that is available and demand will only increase with population growth. Waiting times, unrealistic nursing workloads, insufficient funding and the services available to mental health patients are among issues that are raised with me all the time.


During the last election campaign, issues around the Caboolture Hospital were among the greatest concerns expressed by the people of Longman. Just recently, a distressed father of a young baby wrote to me to say that he had had to wait for 12 hours before his child could be seen. The locals in my community deserve to be confident that, when their child has a raging ear infection after hours, they are not going to have to wait most of the night to be seen. When you are taken by ambulance to the hospital with an acute emergency, you should not be 'ramped' or redirected to another hospital across South-East Queensland.


According to the Department of Health and Ageing, the population in my region is expected to reach some 200,000 people. However, at the moment the underresourced Caboolture Hospital has 187 beds available and 21 bays in the emergency department. It is estimated that, to meet the demand of the growing population, 600 beds and 52 emergency bays will be required to service the region by 2026. According to the AMA the Caboolture Hospital is operating, on average, at over 100 per cent occupancy, showing significant overstrain of capacity. A safe occupancy rate is an average of only 85 per cent.


The expansion of the Caboolture Hospital is of fundamental importance to the people of Longman. Everyone in the community wants it to happen—the locals, the medical staff at the hospital. It is one of the keys to growing our region and making it a desirable place to live. But with this legislation, even if the people of Longman were to see a long awaited expansion of the hospital, the increased pressure placed on services because of the increased number of people no longer able to access private health care would negate the benefits of any expansion.


This legislation represents yet another betrayal of the trust of the Australian people. We are getting used to it now with this Labor government, but that does not make it right. The price of private health care will increase for so many families at a time when they are already struggling to balance their books. The exodus from private health care will place additional pressure on an already overburdened public health system. In my community, I know that the many families who have contacted me regarding soaring costs of living will jettison their private health cover because it will be unaffordable for them. The pressure on the Caboolture Hospital will become even worse than it already is, causing even more distress for my community. In conclusion, that is why, as a member of the coalition, I will not be supporting these bills.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (19:15): The fairer private health insurance legislation represents almost $2.8 billion being ripped out of the pockets of Australians who hold private health insurance. At the last election the Labor Party, in their dishonest ads, talked about the Leader of the Opposition taking $1 billion from health when it was actually a $10 billion increase in public hospital funding, but here we have a clear example of the Labor Party ripping out almost $2.8 billion, with their hands in the pockets of ordinary Australian families and individuals who are having a go, who are covering themselves and covering their families with private health insurance. Is this money going to health? No, it is just an inevitable consequence of the fact that the Labor Party have lost control of spending. They have wasted billions of dollars on pink batts and billions of dollars on school halls, and now, unfortunately, we are seeing broken election promises—a consequence of the fact that, as usual with a Labor government, they have lost control of their spending.


We on this side of the House understand that private health insurance plays a key role in reducing waiting lists and keeping pressure off the already struggling public hospital system. It allows people to have a choice of doctor, a choice of specialist, a choice of surgeon, a choice of anaesthetist and a choice of hospital. The coalition have always recognised this and will continue to fight for the role of private health insurance in our health system.


In a sense this is history repeating itself. When Labor were last in power the level of people covered by private health insurance plummeted from 50 per cent of the population to a low of 30 per cent in the mid-1990s. A number of Labor government decisions made during the second term of the Hawke-Keating government, between 1984 and 1986, had the effect of ripping money away from people who had private health insurance. As a result of those decisions Labor took when last in office we saw premiums rise by almost 40 per cent. The consequence was that people dropped out and as younger, fitter, healthier people dropped out the insured pool become more likely to claim and the premiums rose, in a vicious cycle. That required the introduction of the private health insurance rebate, along with lifetime health cover, in 1999, which arrested and reversed that fall in private health cover. In 2004 we came up with the proposal for increased rebates for people over 65 and people over 70 in recognition of the fact that many people on the age pension or part pensions and self-funded retirees were on fixed incomes and holding private health insurance. We needed to do this to make sure that private health insurance in Australia was on a sustainable footing.


Unfortunately, as I said before, Labor have a track record of dismantling private health. For the current Prime Minister's views on private health insurance there is no better guide than The Latham Diaries. That book shows how ideologically opposed to private health insurance the Prime Minister was when she was the Labor Party spokesperson for health. In fact, as we heard in question time today, the current Prime Minister gave an ironclad guarantee when she was shadow minister for health that the Labor Party would maintain the rebates. Her robust defence seemed to be that 'we did break that promise in 2007 but we took it to the 2010 election so then it was okay'. That ignores that the ironclad guarantee had an expiry date of not much more than 15 months into the Rudd government. I will come to that later.


Private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia—3½ million patients in 2009-10. It covers the majority of elective surgery. Around 12 million Australians hold private health insurance—52.9 per cent of the population—and 45.6 per cent have hospital treatment cover. Of these people, any single earning over $83,000 per annum and any couple earning over $166,000 per annum will see their rebates reduced, with those on higher incomes receiving no rebate at all. These changes will mean a return to the old days of people dropping out of private health insurance left, right and centre. Around 2.4 million people will be directly affected by immediate increases in their premiums of 14 per cent, 29 per cent or 43 per cent, depending on their income tier. Deloitte has predicted that up to 1.6 million Australians will drop their cover over the next five years. They have also forecast that up to 4.3 million Australians will downgrade their cover over the next five years and that premiums will increase 10 per cent above what they otherwise would have. We will see an extra 845,000 Australians admitted to public hospitals and an extra $3.8 billion in additional recurrent costs for the public hospital system. It is worth noting that the government maintains that only 25,000 people will drop their private health insurance under its modelling compared to the 1.6 million modelled by the Deloitte analysis. There is quite a discrepancy there—the Deloitte analysis is 64 times the government's predictions. Medibank Private, the government owned insurer, claims that 37,000 of their members will drop private health insurance. They are about a third of the market in Australia. Just extrapolating the Medibank Private numbers, this measure will see more than 100,000 Australians drop private health insurance. This shows that the government's claim of only 25,000 is not realistic.


It is not just those on higher incomes who are going to be affected—5.6 million Australians with private health cover have annual household incomes of less than $50,000, and of those 3.4 million have annual household incomes of less than $35,000. Despite Labor's rhetoric, private health cover is not just for the rich. It has always been this way. People on age pensions, part pensions and self-funded retirees all maintain private health insurance. People on fixed incomes and those in low income households will be hurt most by this move. It is the part-pension recipients, self-funded retirees and young people who will be hurt the most from this. Young families who have responsibly taken out private health cover will be hurt. These people have all sacrificed to secure their own health and this government want to impose an extra financial burden when cost-of-living pressures are already so high.


These people may not be hit with a reduction in their rebate but they will be hit by premium rises as a secondary consequence of people dropping their private health cover. This is very simply a broken promise by the Labor government. These broken promises are stacking up, day by day. It is a betrayal of the electorate and a betrayal of the 12 million Australians with private health insurance.


Just four days out from the 2007 federal election, Kevin Rudd wrote to Dr Michael Armitage, the chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, and said, 'Both my shadow minister for health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Labor will maintain lifetime health cover and the Medicate levy surcharge.' That was clear cut and black and white in writing.


It is clear now that this is just a first step for the Labor government. Labor have delivered four budgets since they were elected in 2007 and in every single budget they have proposed to rip money out of private health insurance or to slug people to take out private health insurance. My prediction is that if Labor have the chance, this will be just the first step. There will be many more bills like this where Labor will continue to undermine private health, to wind back the support for private health and to continue their relentless attack on the private health insurance rebates. In every budget delivered by the Labor Party, they have attacked private health insurance. 


This bill has already been rejected by the Senate on two separate occasions, yet the government continue. They just cannot let it go. The Labor Party hate private health care. They pursue this as an ideological argument, without considering or even caring about the consequences. This government cannot manage money. They have wasted billions and billions of taxpayers' money—for example, pink batts; and the school halls, which schools did not want. In health, you need only look to the $650 million GP superclinics program, where there is no proof that a single hospital has seen a reduction in waiting times for patients arriving at the emergency department. Because of this endless waste by this reckless government, they are now looking to dismantle effective measures like the private health insurance rebates to plug the hole in their budget. For those opposite, this is not about the good health of Australians; it is about balancing the bottom line of their budget which they have lost control of.


The effect of this legislation on my electorate of Boothby is going to be very detrimental. There are 96,728 people in Boothby who are covered by private health insurance—72.3 per cent of voters on the roll have private health insurance, 63.3 per cent of voters hold hospital treatment insurance and 71.5 per cent hold general insurance for extras. There are two private hospitals in my electorate which are likely to be affected, Flinders Private Hospital and Griffith private hospital. Glenelg Community Hospital and Ashford Hospital sit outside my electorate, but are frequently used by the residents of Boothby.


Voters in Boothby will take a very dim view of the Labor Party's decision. This is a bad measure for Australia and a bad measure for my electorate. It is such a bad measure that over 2,000 residents in my electorate have petitioned to have the private health insurance rebate retained intact. It is a petition that I will be presenting later this week. The opposition have no choice but to oppose this measure, as we did in 2009 and in 2010.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2012-02-13,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (19:29):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011. As some of my colleagues have already stated, we are debating a betrayal of the Australian people, a betrayal of 11 million Australians who contribute to private health insurance arrangements. Forty-five per cent of households in my electorate of Solomon have private health insurance arrangements. Over 40,000 people are covered by these arrangements—40,000 Territorians who are being betrayed by the Gillard Labor government. This is the very same government that promised at the last election that there would be no carbon tax under the government the Prime Minister led. We all know where that promise ended.


As has been reported in media outlets by many commentators, Australia's healthcare system—and I refer to the balance in the relationship between public and private providers—is envied by many overseas countries. The Treasurer himself is on record with regular reference to how Australia is the envy of the world. It is apparent that our current healthcare system, if media commentators are to be believed, is in fact envied outside our shores. To refer to a turn of phrase distinctive to our vernacular, if it ain't broke then don't fix it. 


Along with nearly 53 per cent of the country or some 12 million other Australians, I pay into private health insurance. My husband and I recognise the importance of having private health insurance. We recognise the importance of choice and we recognise the value of not relying upon and adding to an already overworked and stretched public health system. Further, we recognise that with an ageing population the reliance on health care will increase, as will the pressures on both the public and private providers. Statistics show that in the 2009-10 financial year private hospitals treated some 3.5 million patients across Australia, with those private hospitals responsible for the delivery of 64 per cent of elective surgeries.


Australians in general have an expectation for the delivery of certain services. Health care is one of those areas of expectation. An Ipsos survey this year found 64 per cent of the population believe that the $4.5 billion the government spends on the health rebate is a good use of taxpayer money. At present, 5.6 million Australians who pay private health insurance have an annual household income less than $50,000. Further, 3.4 million Australians with an annual household income of less than $35,000 pay into private health insurance—a further example of the value placed on this commodity by Australian citizens. Astute Australians, mums and dads, singles, the aged—in fact, Australians from all walks of life—all currently pay for private health insurance, yet the current federal Labor government wants to change this. Why? The system is not broke. The Deloitte analysis of the changes proposed by this government, if passed, are expected to see many of those astute Australians I have mentioned who pay into private health insurance funds withdraw from private health or downgrade their current level of cover. The government's own insurer, Medibank Private, predict that potentially 37,000 of their existing members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade their cover, yet the Minister for Health has claimed that some 27,000 people across the entire sector could potentially withdraw from private health care—a considerable discrepancy. How can this government get it so wrong so often?


At present the existing private health rebate is 30 per cent with an increase to 35 per cent and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. Proposed changes will see the introduction of three new income tiers. The first tier will see a reduction of the healthcare rebate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent for singles with an annual income of between $80,000 and $93,000 and families with a combined income of between $160,000 and $186,000. Aged Australians between 65 and 69 years will see their rebate reduced from 35 per cent to 25 per cent and for those aged 70 and over the rebate will fall from 40 per cent to 30 per cent. Without looking beyond the first tier, it is quite evident that this government assumes any single or family whose income exceeds the thresholds to be wealthy. I am reliably informed by my constituents that this is not the case.


Many in remote, regional and rural Australia—who already pay additional costs associated with supply and delivery of goods and services; who already pay dearly for childcare facilities, for basic food commodities for fuel; who go without the advantages associated with pricing competition similar to that within urban environments; and who pay mortgages or who pay rent—are far from rich. These average Australians continue to struggle and should not be considered wealthy. Within my own electorate of Solomon, many of the constituents I have spoken to on this issue are angry. I paraphrase: they are sick to death of being bashed by this Labor government on a daily basis for apparently being wealthy. When I say 'constituents', I refer to people from all walks of life, from small business operators to businesses who employ staff to contractors, from police officers to nurses, to public servants and teachers, all hardworking aspirants of this country. All of them sound the same drum and sing the same song. These proposed changes are not about improving our health services but about the inability of the current government to balance its books. Once again, it is the working backbone of the country who will be hurt—those who already give and continue to give towards every tax and levy imposed by a government in crisis. 


This Labor government does not understand that healthcare costs vary from region to region, as do wages, but no consideration has been given to the high cost of living facing Territorians today. Many young families I know will be affected if this legislation is passed, and they are already struggling. Like me, the member for New England believes that this new health tax being imposed by the Gillard Labor government will be very bad for regional hospitals and in fact regional health services. What I do not understand is, if the member for New England believes this legislation will be bad for regional hospitals and regional Australians, why the member for Lyne has not arrived at the same conclusion. Then we have the member for Denison. In his electorate six out of 10 people have private health insurance. Surely, the message to him is quite clear: he must not support this legislation. This legislation will most certainly put pressure on public hospitals. It will absolutely take more money out of people's household budgets. At a time when Australians are already facing extra cost-of-living pressures, Prime Minister Gillard's new health tax is just not sustainable. This government has a history of broken promises. A case in point: in October 2007 the Chief Executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, the Hon. Dr Michael Armitage, sought clarification from Labor's federal opposition leader in respect to its private health insurance policy. The response to Dr Armitage, signed by the then federal Labor leader, Mr Kevin Rudd, stated:


Both my Shadow Minister for Health Nicola Roxon, and I have made clear on many occasions this year that Federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 percent general rebate and the 35 to 40 percent rebates for older Australians.


The response further included that Labor would maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance. What has happened in the interim? We have a government that finds itself in difficult economic circumstances largely of its own making, a government that started out with money in the bank and an economy strong and vibrant, an economy with stability. Today we see circumstances in which the government has spent billions and billions of taxpayer dollars to the point where we now have the fourth-largest deficit of any Australian government in history.


It is evident from the comments from my constituents that they clearly understand the impetus of why this government now wishes to tinker with the private health system—the envy of many other nations—not for the betterment of the system or as a value-add for the Australian taxpayer but for fiscal reasons. Simply put, the government is desperate to find money to try and fill the black hole which continues to expand. This is bad policy and it is the third time this parliament has considered this legislation. The first was in 2009. It was against a backdrop of commitment by the member for Griffith, the then federal Labor leader, in 2007 when he affirmed:


Federal Labor will maintain the existing framework for regulating private health insurance, including the process of approval of premium increases.


These three bills as introduced failed on that occasion. But here we are in 2012 again debating measures to alter the status quo in terms of private health insurance.


As I indicated earlier, many of my constituents are angry. The impact of the potential changes will impact the back pockets of most Australians with increased private health insurance premiums. The changes will impose an enormous compliance burden on the industry and individuals completing their tax returns. Private health insurers will have to make significant changes to their systems to be able to adjust premiums according to incomes. It is still not clear how the rebate will be administered under the new arrangements, especially where a person is not able to accurately predict their income for the current or the future financial year. Deloitte's analysis of the changes show that in the first year 175,000 people will be expected to withdraw from private hospital cover and a further 583,000 will downgrade. Over five years it is expected that 1.6 million will drop cover and 4.3 million will downgrade. These figures are absolutely alarming.


I would like to go back to the sentiments of my constituents.  The following was sent to me by a constituent whose name is Lee. In her own words she said:


… ""the harder I work the luckier I get"". I want to share my journey in becoming the new ""bashed and hated wealthy"" My husband and I started our working life as bank teller and a refrigeration mechanic. We built a 3 bedroom 1 bathroom house in—


the suburbs of—


Adelaide, which was all we could afford. We raised 2 boys initially on 1 wage. My husband Chris had to take on additional work on weekends just to pay the mortgage and keep food on the table when interest rates reached 16% in the early 80's


We both worked to provide the boys with private school education. Family holidays were camping trips in an old camper trailer and when the boys left home we moved to the NT—


Northern Territory—


and started our own business


The journey of Lee and Chris is similar to that of many others that have worked hard, raised families, and understood the need to provide for themselves in retirement. In Lee's own words:


… this labor government hates us, it hates the fact we have some degree of financial comfort, it hates the fact we have private health insurance, it hates the fact we were prepared to work hard to provide the best education for our children. We are the people that got the hit from the flood levy, we are the people that are now to be hit by the health rebate means test, and next we will be the same people that will be hit by less money for private schools. We are small business people, we employ others, we pay tax, we look after ourselves in retirement, we are the backbone of this country and NOW UNDER THIS GOVERNMENT WE ARE HATED


How concerning is this sentiment? But this is exactly what this Labor government is doing: it is trying to bring back the class war, turning hardworking people that do have aspirations for a better life against those that do not.


In conclusion, this piece of legislation is absolutely not about a health policy. This is about a government trying to rip money out of people's back pockets as a patch-up for the waste and mismanagement that this government has undertaken over the last four years. This is bad policy and I will be voting against this piece of legislation as this bill is not about 'Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives'. This is another Labor broken promise. This is another betrayal of the Australian people.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (19:43):  I rise to oppose the Fairer Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 2011 and the suite of related bills. I do so on the basis that what is proposed means that there is a reduction—and I will not cite all the figures because they have been evident in all the speeches that I have been listening to during the course of the day—and it will impact on the health system. When I first entered parliament during the reform period under the Rudd government—and later in its continuation with the Gillard government—I saw incredible hope and opportunity for the reforms to be effective and for the private sector, through private sector funding, to be a key player in all of this and I saw that the 30 per cent levy would allow people the opportunity of moving between the health services provided within both public hospitals and the private sector. I give an example of St John of God in Perth that has robotic surgery for men who have prostate cancer. The cost of that is significantly high and the difference in price is covered by the private health insurance that is provided through membership and underpinned by the 30 per cent element that assists people to continue with their private health insurance.


The other thing that disappoints me is that A healthier future for all Australians talked about a continuity of care, access to specialist services and the ability to be part of making a choice about the type of healthcare service delivery you would access and the point at which you would access it. The National Partnerships Agreements that have been negotiated make reference to the fact that all Australians should have the opportunity of moving between the choices that exist for them, but they do not always have the capacity to pay. There are private and government hospitals that have differing services and certainly a significant number of the specialists tend to operate within the private health sector.  If you are covered by private health insurance, your movement through the elective surgery waiting lists and surgery is enhanced because you are sometimes advised to take the opportunity to book into a private hospital in order to expedite that service. It means that you do not remain on a waiting list for a substantial period of time.


But the articles that have been appearing in the papers in recent times have made some very interesting points for this debate. The headline in the Australian today was 'Both sides failing the test on health'. It states: 


Labor's policy lacks coherence but this should not let the opposition off the hook. 


The article says:


First, as the public and private systems compete for health professionals, it would increase costs and reduce quality in the public system. Second, it will make the PHI even less affordable for low-income consumers, ensuring that we truly do end up with two healthcare systems: one for the better off, who will be forced to have private cover, and one for those with lower incomes, who will have to rely on the public hospitals.


Again, 'Gillard confident on health rebate' was a headline in the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday, 7 February:


Prime Minister Julia Gillard said yesterday taxpayers should not have to subsidise private health insurance for wealthy people and the government would continue discussions to get the changes passed.

Greens leader Bob Brown yesterday softened his party's resistance … 


""We don't believe people should be penalised because they make the choice to go the public health system,"" he said. We are continuing to talk with the government.


I have been dismayed also by the fact that there have been a number of speakers on that side of the House who referred to a welfare or class system when it comes to the subsidisation of the health rebate, because to me it is not that. I think we have to be serious in considering that we want to encourage people to access the opportunities to reduce the burden on the public hospital system.


One of the continued debates I had when I worked in health, when we used to meet as an executive, concerned the choking of public hospitals with people who could not access the private health sector or access specialists whose time was principally involved with the private health sector. What worries me with this one is that, if these figures about the 1.6 million consumers dropping their health insurance or the number that fall in under each of the tiers are correct, we will see an increase in the number of people accessing the public hospital system. That in itself will increase the requirement for funding to meet those health needs when it could be covered within the private health sector.


In reading through the National Partnership Agreements, there are some provisions for increased funding where there are pressure points within the public health sector under each state and territory's jurisdiction and to negotiate a variation to those actual costs. I suspect that we will see an increase in requests for additional funding by states and territories. With that in mind, today's Hobart Mercury had the headline 'Private insurance bypass—Doctors warn rebate changes will up pressure on public hospitals'. The article states:


Tasmania's public hospitals will be hit with more patients under plans to means test the private health rebate, the Australian Medical Association says. Premiums are tipped to rise by up to $1000 a year for families from 1 July with Gillard government legislation to be voted on in coming days. 


…   …   …


AMA Tasmanian president John Davis said … 


""What we're already seeing is the Royal Hobart Hospital working at capacity at what should be a quiet time of the year.""


If that is the case at a quiet time, then those proposed changes will have a significant impact on hospitals. I was down in Tasmania recently and I was speaking with a senior official from health who indicated that the quantum of money received to provide for their hospitals and for the types of services required for the public of Tasmania is not sufficient. On that basis, I suspect that we will see health ministers coming back to the discussions with the federal minister seeking to increase their share of the Commonwealth funding that would assist in the provision of the health care that we expect and take for granted in this country.


I know that the Minister for Health believes these changes will ensure that those with a greater capacity to pay will make a larger contribution towards the cost of their private health insurance. The government says it will ensure that government support for private health insurance remains fair and sustainable in the future. This is simply not the case. In my electorate of Hasluck, which is geographically and economically diverse, there are many people who are feeling the pressure points of increased costs of living. Those increased costs of living are impacting on their capability and capacity to pay their private health insurance premiums. I have had constituents say to me that they will be dropping the level of contribution they make to private health funds. To me this is a pity because when there is an illness of some magnitude which requires coverage of the full fee, or at least the gap, they will be deprived of that and their out-of-pocket expenses will certainly increase. The extra costs will hit families hard and drive more towards the public system. The public health system is already under strain and this could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Increased living costs will be created not only by hospital costs and the payments needed for anaesthetists and some of the surgical procedures but also by the medications that will be required. Over 1½ million Australians, including thousands in Hasluck, will face significant increases in private health insurance costs. $1,000 might not sound a great deal to many in this chamber, but there will be people who will struggle to find that within their tight economic circumstances, particularly with the other added pressure from the banking sector where there is an increase in home interest rates.


Private hospitals treat 40 per cent of all patients in Australia and perform over 60 per cent of elective surgeries. What happens to the public system when these patients scrap their health insurance? The government owned insurer, Medibank Private, has predicted that 37,000 of its members alone will drop their cover and 92,500 will downgrade. This is considerably more than the 27,000 the minister has claimed will drop their cover throughout the entire sector. To me, this is another example of the Labor Party playing the politics of envy and punishing those who are able to take financial responsibility for their health care instead of having the Liberal Party economic philosophy of reward for effort and providing people with choice and financial opportunity.


Many of the people who have taken out private health insurance in Hasluck are not super-rich as those opposite would have you believe. In the near future, you will hear more political-speak coming out of the Labor Party--things like, 'They are the rich; why should they get subsidies for private health?' This is social engineering coming to the fore yet again. These people are already paying for the services of private health insurance and this takes a significant load off our public health system. We will all have seen articles over a period of time in which health systems and jurisdictions talk about the burden of cost in the delivery of health services. I have had firsthand experience of actually working in the health sector at a senior level and I know the strain many in this system are under. These changes will just make things worse.


The phasing down of the healthcare rebate to nil would see the need for nearly 200,000 hospital bed days to be created. One million extra patients are expected to flood the public health system. The Gillard government is acting out of desperation to balance its books and is doing so at the expense of many hardworking Australians and people in my electorate of Hasluck. Instead of creating hope for the people of Australia that if they work hard and pay their way they will be rewarded, it penalises the people who are paying their way.


Cost of living, as I have said, is a serious issue in my electorate. The so-called luxuries will be jettisoned, and I fear that private health insurance will be one of them. The cost-of-living pressures will only get worse under the carbon tax regime. This wasteful government is introducing another burden. The deceit shown by this government knows no bounds. Every new tax or levy that is introduced chips away at the household budget. People in Hasluck are struggling and this typical tax-and-spend approach to economics is damaging to the social fabric of this country. I would ask the Minister for Health to come to Hasluck and talk in a forum directly to families that will be hit by the amendments to the legislation. Previous governments have rejected these changes, and I call on this government not to dig its heels in and to stop this lunacy.


What makes this worse is that the Prime Minister previously stated in opposition that she would not seek to remove the rebate, yet when it is politically convenient she once again goes back on her word. The former Prime Minister, the Hon. Kevin Rudd, and the former Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, have both gone to great pains previously to say they would never support this move. What has changed? This is the third time the parliament has considered this legislation. It was introduced in the last parliament despite explicit promises at the 2007 election that:


… Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all the existing Private Health Insurance rebates.


That was said in a media release by Nicola Roxon on 26 September 2007.


I call on the Independents to actually stick up for the people in their electorates and vote down these amendments, which will hurt everyday Australians. I think we have the basis of an incredible health reform agenda that is providing a wide range of health outcomes and improvements for Australians, consistent with the objectives of the national partnership agreement and the National Health Reform Agreement. I would rather see the strengthening of those and not their diminution through the impact of this legislation in reducing the rebate that is currently given to all Australians. I oppose this legislation.



The SPEAKER:  Order! It being almost 8 pm, the debate is interrupted.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (19:58):  on indulgence—I wish to add to an answer I gave in question time today. In question time today I answered a question from the member for O'Connor concerning native title. In my answer I indicated that the Western Australian Premier had not personally raised with me matters related to native title compensation. The Premier wrote to me on 14 April last year regarding financial assistance for native title compensation and settlements. I wrote to the Premier on 23 May last year noting that in 2001 the Howard government made an offer to the states and territories in relation to native title compensation, but a shared costs arrangement was not agreed to. This exchange of correspondence was reported in the Australian newspaper on 6 January this year. As I stated earlier today, despite my quite frequent contact with the Premier of Western Australia, the Premier has not taken the opportunity to raise this matter with me personally, and by that I mean face to face.

Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (19:59):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that as National Asbestos Awareness Week is formally recognised, it makes earnest representation to the Government to continue to call on Canada to ratify the listing of chrysotile asbestos in the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent;


(2) recognises the proactive actions of the Australian Government in mitigating the possible spread of asbestos related diseases through continuing bans on the production and use of asbestos as well as strict controls on the removal and disposal of existing material;


(3) commends the Australian Government on a number of measures that have been put into place to manage and compensate the victims of asbestos related diseases which include:


(a) the recent ratification of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Asbestos Convention, as one of the first ILO Conventions to be ratified by the Commonwealth Government since 2006;


(b) Australian leadership on a strong closing declaration by 66 countries at the 2011 Conference of the Rotterdam Convention, which expressed deep concern that the listing of chrysotile asbestos had been prevented by a small number of parties and resolved to move forward to list chrysotile asbestos in Annex III;


(c) the $5 million grant made to support the Asbestos Disease Research Institute Bernie Banton Centre;


(d) funding for the new Australian Mesothelioma Registry, which was launched in 2010 to gather more detailed and accurate information on mesothelioma and asbestos-related diseases;


(e) support for the harmonisation of health and safety legislation which will provide, for the first time, a uniform framework for the minimisation of exposure, the removal of asbestos, and the management asbestos materials in the workplace;


(f) the establishment of the Asbestos Management Review in late 2010 to recommend strategies for the development of a national strategic plan to improve asbestos awareness, management and removal;


(g) the loan agreement with the NSW Government to ensure asbestos victims and their families continue to receive payments through the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund; and


(h) the $1.5 million Comcare Asbestos Innovation Fund which sponsors programs and research to prevent and better manage asbestos exposure, as well as improve treatment for asbestos-disease sufferers;


(4) notes the unwelcome inheritance that asbestos has left on the Australian community, which sees Australian citizens suffering one of the highest rates of asbestos-related diseases in the world, with the effects of asbestos mining still being suffered by many, mostly Indigenous and past employees of James Hardie's operation at Baryulgil in the electoral division of Page, and the poor health and mortality they and their families suffer;


(5) extends its profound sympathies to all individuals suffering asbestos-related diseases as well as their friends and families and the friends and families of those who have passed away as a result of asbestos-related diseases;


(6) notes the current and potential damage that imported asbestos is creating to the people in the Asia Pacific region where, despite these well documented health risks, it remains an attractive commodity due to its low cost compared to other comparable building material;


(7) calls upon the Canadian Government to recognise the potentially catastrophic health and social implications of Canada's production and sale of asbestos and products containing asbestos to these lower socio-economic markets; and


(8) supports the Australian Government in using strong diplomatic efforts to convince the Canadian Government to cease both production and trade in asbestos.


I first gave notice of this motion during National Asbestos Awareness Week, but because of the way in which the business of the House is conducted it has only just now come up for debate. I am pleased that it is now before the House and that people from all sides are listed to speak on it.


The mining of asbestos is akin to subjecting workers to a possible death sentence, as is the export of asbestos. It is something that I simply cannot understand, with the knowledge that we have, as I cannot understand why some countries continue to mine and export it. Canada and Russia are on the list of supporters of the asbestos trade. There is actually a town called Asbestos in Canada and a town called Asbest in Russia, the latter being something I have previously raised in this House.


It is hard to know where to start, because so much needs to be done and so much needs to be said. There is the matter of the large amounts of asbestos we have in our public and private buildings and indeed in our own homes. Home renovators are more at risk than ever because so many people are now doing home renovations; it is a popular and good thing to do, but some people would not even be aware they are dealing with asbestos. Domestic residences or premises are also largely unregulated, although there are some regulations in that area.


At a national level all types of asbestos are banned for use in Australia. Further, since 2003 it has been illegal to import, store, supply, sell or use such materials. The management of asbestos and related issues is a matter for each jurisdiction in our federal system. There are health and safety aspects and workplace issues within respective jurisdictions. There are laws at state and territory levels about the handling and removal of asbestos and strict penalties for noncompliance. However, there are some gaps across all jurisdictions.


The New South Wales Ombudsman prepared a report entitled Responding to the asbestos problem: the need for significant reform in New South Wales, dated November 2010. The report stated:


… there is no single government agency responsible for coordinating the management and containment of asbestos … there are gaps in asbestos legislation and funding to deal with these issues is inadequate.


The report further pointed out that local government was the first point of contact for the community and said that many lacked knowledge and understanding of their role in the regulation of asbestos. I can understand that, but we all have to come to grips with this massive problem that really is of epidemic proportions. I want to say that I am not targeting a particular state or territory jurisdiction. It is just that New South Wales is the state I live in and the one that I read most about.


I would also like to add that when Councillor Jenny Dowell, the Mayor of Lismore City Council, saw that I had this matter listed for debate she sent me an email saying that it was 'excellent' that I had done so. She said:


Local government is at the forefront of managing approvals for the removal and disposal of asbestos. From time to time we are faced with illegal dumping et cetera but the biggest impact is that of disease and death for workers and the thousands of home renovators.


That was the point at which I started. I further note that the Ombudsman's report stated that it looked at 152 council websites and found no consistency in the information provided to the public. Again, I can understand that this is a difficult area.


My motion lists a whole range of things. Firstly, and importantly, it notes the occurrence of National Asbestos Week, which has now passed but which was current when I gave notice of the motion. It recognises the proactive actions of the Australian government in this area and commends the Australian government for a number of really good measures that have been put in place. We are tackling this nationally. It also needs to be done at state level. Some of the occupational health legislation can help in that area. There is also the international aspect, because we know that asbestos is mined in various places. We know that its use is still huge in the Asia-Pacific region, which is our region, and that asbestos is exported.


I would like to commend the Parliamentary Group on Asbestos Related Disease that was set up in this place. A lot of members on all sides take part in that, including ministers and shadow ministers. We all attend because we know that this is something we really have to grapple with. I commend Senator Lisa Singh for setting up that group and also the honourable member for McMillan, who supports this group. When he spoke on the night on which the group met he thanked Senator Singh—giving credit where credit was due, in that it was her initiative. The guest speaker was journalist/writer Matt Peacock, who is a leading light in bringing to public attention the dangers of asbestos. Decades ago he published material on this matter, including on the problems associated with asbestos at the James Hardie mine in Baryulgil, in my seat of Page. There was considerable trauma and disease, and that is ongoing, because asbestos problems are not something that disappear overnight. As recently as 8 November 2011 Matt Peacock reported a telling and deadly documentary on Foreign Correspondent about India's use and importation of asbestos from Canada. So my motion lays out some of the good action that has been taken and will continue to be taken. It really speaks for itself. We are also working to get a lot of areas in order. There was a loan agreement with New South Wales—and I pay tribute to the honourable member for Charlton, who did a lot to bring that to the public's attention and who helped to make that happen; there were funds for the Asbestos Disease Research Institute; and there was the ratification of the ILO Convention concerning Safety in the Use of Asbestos and the leadership regarding the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade.


I support a worldwide ban on asbestos—full stop. It is just something that needs to be left in the ground. I note that in some countries where they say it is asbestos free, if there is a one per cent inclusion of asbestos in it, they can still have that branding on it. Some of the things that we need to continue to do are to raise awareness of asbestos hazards, build alliances with like-minded countries and pursue further restriction on asbestos by listing chrysotile asbestos in annex III of the Rotterdam convention. We also need to build capacity in developing countries, assist with developing domestic asbestos management regimes with the removal and lobby countries which oppose or do not actively support asbestos removal to change their positions.



At the ALP National Conference, where I was a delegate, we did a number of things to change the platform. We said we wanted Australia to continue to lead international calls for a global treaty to ban the use of and trade in asbestos. We will host an international conference in 2012, the Global Alliance Against the Asbestos Hazard, in collaboration with the ILO and other like-minded organisations, to build support for international action on asbestos. We also hope that AusAID can help develop an aid program which supports better education about the risks posed by asbestos.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-02-13,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (20:10):  I second the motion.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The House notes the interest of the member for Corangamite as well.




Mr CHESTER:
  It is a pleasure to join the debate this evening. I commend the member for Page for her motion on National Asbestos Awareness Week and also for her advocacy work in issues associated with safety surrounding the handling of asbestos products and the possible spread of asbestos related disease. I recently had the opportunity to witness the member's advocacy work firsthand when she was in Sale as the Chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, which was looking into opportunities to expand the Sale RAAF base. She took the opportunity to question the officials from the Department of Defence about ensuring that whatever work was going to take place there would be safe in protecting of the workers and subcontractors on the site as well as the service personnel there. She has a very real commitment and I admire her passion and determination in this particular area.


The motion is quite an extensive one, as the previous speaker indicated. I will focus my comments tonight on the key points as they affect Gippslanders. As a bit of a personal perspective, from my dealings with people in my community and also with my own family, the issue of asbestos related disease is very real for many people in Gippsland. From my own experience, my father was a plumber, and he often used to tell the story about how, as a young bloke and an apprentice, he and his mates would bundle up the loose product and throw it at each other. It was a bit of fun after work, I think, for the boys, the young apprentices, on the job, not knowing of course the risks that they were exposing themselves to. My own father died of lung cancer four years ago, and I cannot help wondering whether some of that was related to his exposure. It did not help that a lot of young boys in those days smoked a lot. We now know the risks associated with smoking and with exposure to asbestos, and it could not have helped those young fellows.


At an industry level, the exposure to asbestos is a key concern for workers rights across the Gippsland and La Trobe Valley area. We have many people who are currently employed, or who were previously employed, in heavy industries, particularly associated with the power sector. We are fortunate in Gippsland to have a group known as the Gippsland Asbestos Related Disease Support Group, which I will refer to more extensively in a few moments time.


With these factors in mind, I have no hesitation in supporting the motion as put to the House tonight by the member for Page, nor in supporting the Parliamentary Group on Asbestos Related Disease, which the previous speaker also referred to and whose launch coincided with National Asbestos Awareness Week. I congratulate Senator Lisa Singh and my neighbour in Gippsland, the member for McMillan, Russell Broadbent, for co-chairing that group. The group is designed to raise awareness of asbestos related disease, and on the evening of its formation Mr Broadbent commented that Australia has one of the highest rates of asbestos related disease in the world, with nearly 10,000 recorded cases of mesothelioma since records began in the 1980s. He also indicated at the time that there is an increasing rate of diagnosis in women, as we begin to experience what they are describing as a third wave of sufferers from the home renovation era, which the member for Page also referred to. I quote one thing that Russell Broadbent said on the night:


Too many lives have been affected by asbestos related disease and together we must work together to address the asbestos-related issues. PGARD aims to be a conduit between the local community and the parliament on asbestos related issues.


I congratulate Senator Singh, Mr Broadbent and the member for Page for taking that bipartisan approach to what is a very serious issue in our community.


The scale of the problem facing Australia and the rest of the world should not be underestimated. The motion before the House recognises that Australian citizens suffer one of the highest rates of asbestos related disease in the world, and the widespread use of these products has been described to me by people in my electorate as something of a ticking time bomb on industrial sites and in residential homes throughout the nation. Even tonight, as I was watching the ABC evening news, there was reference to asbestos being found today on the foreshore at Kingston. In this case it was bonded material, and the authorities are very confident that it can be disposed of effectively and efficiently, but it indicates that this is an ongoing issue that we are going to be dealing with for many years to come.


The biggest risk, and the member for Page referred to it, is the home renovation sector, and in particular the ignorance of the potential threat that is out there. I am concerned that many Australians will be putting their own health at risk and the health of their families, their neighbours and their work colleagues if they are unaware of the potential risk posed by asbestos in the workplace or at home. We have made some massive improvements in the past decade and beyond in the identification of asbestos in the workplace. The OH&S laws that have been brought into place have been useful in that regard, but it is in the home environment that I think the biggest risk lies for us. If a home was built or renovated in the years leading up to 1985 it is most likely that it will contain asbestos somewhere. I understand that if it is left undisturbed it does not normally pose any health risk to anyone, and apart from monitoring it and perhaps painting it to make sure it remains in a stable condition there is no cause for homeowners to be alarmed. But where it does pose a significant health risk is in circumstances where it is disturbed during renovations or in demolition of houses where the asbestos fibres can be released into the air and inhaled. That can lead to asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma.


When I was a young fellow my father was one who used to occasionally take on contracts to demolish homes. As young boys we would go out there and join in the demolition. It was great fun getting the sledgehammer into the walls, the AC sheeting and everything else. I am sure that we should have been wearing more safety equipment than the gloves and the pair of old boots that we were issued with for the job. It is these sort of things where, through ignorance, well-meaning people who do not understand the risks they are taking have perhaps participated in jobs—in my case a bit of home demolition work, but I am sure in other cases it will be people doing renovation in the future—where they do not really know what they are dealing with.


It is good that we have come a long way since those days, but I want to go back to what I referred to a little earlier about the work of a group in my electorate called the Gippsland Asbestos Related Disease Group. I am not sure that every community is as fortunate as we are in Gippsland to have a group like this working on a daily basis to raise awareness and to help educate the public about the potential risks that are out there. GARDS, as it is known, plays a very important role in my community: firstly, in raising awareness of the risk of exposure to asbestos, but also in advocating on behalf of the sufferers. The work includes GARDS volunteers offering a telephone support service and drop-in service at their office. It organises meetings where guest presenters come along and let people know what the potential risks are and providing information on support services that are out there. The advocacy work is perhaps focused more on improving health support services and compensation arrangements to asbestos sufferers and their families.


I have recently had the opportunity to meet with the chief executive of GARDS, a lady by the name of Vicki Hamilton, who was here in Canberra for the launch of the parliamentary group. She works tirelessly to represent the interests of the sufferers in my community and their families. As we all recognise, the asbestos diseases are particularly insidious and they really do have an impact on the entire family. So it is important that the work of GARDS recognises the impact it does have on families. Vicki is a lady who has enormous compassion for the people she is working with and working for, but she is also determined to make a difference and reduce the incidence of further outbreaks of asbestos related diseases. She is a very strong advocate and a fierce champion. It is fair to say you would not want to mess with a lady like Vicki Hamilton. When she gets something in her mind that she is going to do, she does it to the best of her ability. We are fortunate to have her working on the asbestos related diseases support group in Gippsland.


The important point to note as we debate the motion tonight is that there is a concern that the rate of malignant mesothelioma is expected to rise from 2012 to 2020. It is also worth reinforcing, in the opportunity I have here tonight, to anyone who may be listening, that there is no safe exposure to asbestos fibres. Part of the role that we have here in this parliamentary group, and also the role that Vicki Hamilton has in my electorate with the Gippsland group, is in educating people. There are a lot of home renovators out there at the moment. They are mainly men and it is fair to say that blokes are not always the best in looking after their own health. They perhaps have an attitude that it will not happen to them or a bit of a crash or crash-through approach to home renovation job. So it is important that the education campaign that does roll out is understood by everyone—and I mean everyone—so the wives, girlfriends and children might also encourage their loved ones to take the appropriate precautions.


There are a couple of points to remember. One is that if you do not know what the product is you are dealing with in the home environment you should always assume that it does have some element of asbestos in it and take the appropriate precautions. It is also worth reminding people that they can get a licensed person to dispose of the product or seek advice from groups like the asbestos related disease support group in my electorate, which has developed things like the 'Asbestos in the home removal kit'. That is another very positive step that other communities could take. It is an innovation from the Gippsland group which has been very well received in my community. But the best advice of all is that, if you are not confident in doing the job safely yourself, call in the experts. They come in at about the price of any other qualified tradesperson, but what price do you put on your family's health and on your own health.


Safe disposal is a very key point and there are many cases still occurring in our community of dumping of asbestos products. It is outrageous to think that someone would expose others in the community to a risk like that, but there are many cases of that. I am looking forward to continuing to work with my colleague the member for McMillan and others like the member for Page and Senator Singh to make sure we do whatever we can in this place to reduce the incidence of asbestos related diseases in the community.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (20:20):  I am pleased to follow the member for Gippsland and join the member for Page in speaking on this motion tonight noting Asbestos Awareness Week. I would also pay tribute to a couple of activists on this issue from my own electorate of Throsby in New South Wales, in particular our local branch member Jim David, who spoke very passionately on this matter at a branch meeting that I attended a few weeks ago and urged me to raise this matter in parliament. I do so willingly. Shirley Sheed, who is a local activist from Port Kembla and a very strong activist in the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia has been putting her time and energy behind this issue for many, many decades.


The battle for justice for victims of asbestos diseases is very important to me personally, and I have been engaged in it for many years as well. Like many Australians and many people in this place, I have lost friends to the horrible disease of mesothelioma and have family members who suffer from asbestos related diseases. I am proud to have followed in the footsteps of those before me in the Australian union movement who have been campaigning on asbestos since the 1960s. As I have already noted in this place, in 2005 I had the great honour to go to work with the ACTU as part of their legal team in negotiating with James Hardie and their representatives in the campaign and ultimate settlement to bring some justice to the sufferers who have asbestos related diseases. Campaigning for justice against James Hardie, a company that sought to abdicate both their responsibilities in relation to asbestos products and their social responsibilities, was a defining experience in my life. I met many great Australians, including Bernie Banton and his wife and many other brave Australians who campaigned hard to get justice for themselves while they were suffering from those terrible diseases.


Tonight I want to talk briefly about the point that is raised in paragraph (7) of the member for Page's motion. It is about the international situation, and Canada in particular. It is a great shame that, while asbestos is virtually banned for use in Canada, that country continues to trade in white asbestos to India and indeed accounts for about 95 per cent of the international trade in asbestos products. In doing this, Canada relies on the fact that asbestos use is legal in India. What we know about the export of asbestos from Canada and other countries is that the products are being exported not to the First World but rather to developing countries, countries that can least afford the health impacts of asbestos related diseases now and for many decades into the future. 


The member for Gippsland mentioned the threat that is posed to home renovators. You do not have to walk far in my suburb to see houses, sheds, garages, fences and roofs made out of asbestos and asbestos products. I have a great fear that the long tail of asbestos related diseases will be with us for some time to come. I echo the concerns and sentiments of the member for Gippsland and the member for Page in this regard. Accordingly, I think it is a great shame that the Canadian government continues to support the asbestos industry, because we know that each day that the export of asbestos related products goes on prolongs the suffering and the disease that is created when those products are put into the economy and into people's suburbs.


It is a catastrophic situation for the people of India. The true costs of asbestos are being hidden from the people of India. If the hidden medical costs were properly taken into account, there is no way that asbestos would continue to be seen and used as a cheap building material. For these reasons, I am proud to add my voice in support of this motion and to urge all other members in this place to support it and to get behind the recently formed Parliamentary Group on Asbestos Related Disease, to raise awareness and advocacy and urge further action, parliamentary and otherwise, to fight the scourge that is asbestos and asbestos related disease. I commend the motion to the House.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (20:25):  I rise tonight to support this motion on Asbestos Awareness Week, to congratulate the member for Page for putting it together and to support the comments from the members for Gippsland and Throsby. This is a rather long motion, but there are a few clauses which I think need to be highlighted. One is clause (2), which says that the House: 


… recognises the proactive actions of the Australian Government in mitigating the possible spread of asbestos related diseases through continuing bans on the production and use of asbestos as well as strict controls on the removal and disposal of existing material;


Those bans actually came in in 1991, when we had a complete ban on the use of asbestos in Australia. The only thing I can say to that is that it is a bit disappointing that it took so many years to do. The dangers of asbestos were known decades before 1991, yet asbestos continued to be used throughout the seventies and eighties, which means that no doubt in years to come we will continue to see a lot of people suffering from asbestos related diseases. The bans should have been brought in decades earlier, when we knew the problems that we had.


The other part of a motion that I think needs commenting on is paragraph (3)(e), which says that the Australian government supports: 


… harmonisation of health and safety legislation which will provide, for the first time, a uniform framework for the minimisation of exposure, the removal of asbestos, and the management of asbestos materials in the workplace;


As other members have commented, there is a lot of home renovation going on. A lot of people are working on renovating old houses, and it is very important that steps are taken and safety standards are put into place to make sure that these people are not exposed to asbestos.


Asbestos diseases have been found to take 20 years to develop and they affect people from all walks of life. It is not only people who were directly exposed to industries and workplaces where there was a lot of asbestos; many people who have had no contact with industry or with building sites have still succumbed to asbestos related diseases. Clause (5) of the motion states that the government:


… extends its profound sympathies to all individuals suffering asbestos-related diseases as well as their friends and families and the friends and families of those who have passed away as a result of asbestos-related diseases;


It is tragic that we have lost so many people so far to asbestos related diseases, but unfortunately it appears that for the next 20 years we are still going to have this problem going on. Therefore it is important that the government continues to support research in this field and treatment and care for people who have suffered.


In my electorate of Hughes, Newbridge Heights Public School recently had an issue with asbestos from a fire that occurred 14 years ago at the school. A lot of the building rubble from the fire was actually buried on the school grounds. We should thank one of the local residents, a parent called Linda Lambourne, who was vigilant in exposing this and bringing it to the school's attention that asbestos had been found in the schoolyard. Hopefully the remediation work being undertaken on that will make sure there are no problems at Newbridge Heights.


We should learn from the mistakes and the time that it took us to bring in proper regulations to regulate asbestos, especially in view of the many other types of pollution we have in our environment today, particularly air pollution and the particulate matters known as PM10 and PM2.5. It was interesting that a recent national environment protection of ambient air quality study in Australia noted:


Overall, the results of health reviews show that there were significant health effects at current levels of air pollution in Australian cities. These findings indicate that the current standards are not meeting the requirements of adequate protection of human health. There is evidence that these standards should be revised to minimise the impact of air pollution on the health of the Australian population. The finding is strongly supported by all stakeholders throughout the consultation process.


I was very surprised to discover that currently in Australia we have no compliance standards for the particulate matter PM2.5 and we have no annual average standards for PM10. These are things we need to look at, especially in areas of Western Sydney. We need to make sure that everything we are doing in government is to give the best quality air to our residents and to bring Australian standards up to international standards for particulate matter. We do not want to see a repeat of the mistakes we have made in the past with the time it has taken to bring in thorough regulations on asbestos. (Time expired)

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (20:30):  I commend the member for Page for bringing this motion before the House. I also acknowledge the contributions made by all of the other speakers so far. It is good to see that this motion does have cross-party support.


In 2005, a memorial was unveiled at Pitman Park in the City of Salisbury in memory of the people who suffered or died from asbestos related illnesses. It was established by the Asbestos Victims Association of South Australia. Each year in November, a memorial service is held at the site and as part of the service a white wooden cross is placed in the ground adjacent to the memorial with the name of each of the people who have died because of asbestos since the Asbestos Victims Association began keeping records. Each year I attend the service; each year there are more white crosses in the ground.


In most cases, those who died did so from work related illness or family members who were indirectly exposed to the deadly asbestos fibres from the work clothes being brought home. Sadly, thousands more will die in the coming years even though, since 31 December 2003, it has been illegal in Australia to use, reuse or sell any products containing any form of asbestos. For many, it was too late. The fibres were in their bodies and they now face a slow and painful death from an insidious disease. What makes the issue more controversial is that asbestos continued to be used for well over 100 years after its dangers were first exposed. The owners of asbestos mines and those who manufactured asbestos products were not merely negligent—they knowingly promoted a dangerous product.


Thanks to the efforts of so many people around the world, the use of asbestos has now been banned in many countries. However, the asbestos fight is only the tip of the iceberg. Firstly, asbestos continues to be used in disadvantaged countries where people are poorly educated. Secondly, the asbestos story applies to many other commonly used products where manufacturers are aware of the risks but the evidence is inconclusive. From tobacco companies to chemical companies, and manufacturers of IT equipment, serious concerns have been raised about the long-term use of other commonly used products. At least with tobacco, the health warnings are very clear and for most people it is a matter of choice with the full knowledge of the risk.


The worldwide asbestos campaign is about the responsibilities of governments and regulators. It is about the ethics of industry. It is about justice and injustice. As with the life of the legendary cricketer Basil D'Oliveira, whom we debated in the House earlier today, where the more profound impact of his life was not on cricket but on the issue of racial discrimination, the asbestos campaign is about the exploitation of human life for greed and profit.


In respect to that, I join in the comments of other speakers that I too am astounded at the Canadian government's decision to refuse to allow the addition of chrysotile asbestos fibres to the Rotterdam Convention. Chrysotile asbestos, otherwise known as white asbestos, is a major export product of that country. Whilst I could understand a private company wanting to pursue its operations, I cannot understand a government being part of the export of that product. This is a point made in the newsletter of the Asbestos Victims Association of South Australia—that very same Canadian government that is agreeing to export this product is simultaneously removing asbestos from its 1928 parliamentary building. The convention is a multilateral treaty to promote shared responsibilities in relation to the importation of hazardous chemicals. Canada is the only G8 country objecting to the listing. I believe that this government ought to do what it can to encourage Canada to support the listing.


Lastly, I pay tribute and commend the work of Terry Miller, Kat Burge, Pam Sandys and Tony Henstridge who are the volunteers who man and support the Asbestos Victims Association in South Australia. Their tireless work in support of the victims, the victims' families, their advocacy against the use of asbestos and their community education and awareness campaigns are an absolute credit to them. From my experience of working with them and seeing what they do, their work is truly invaluable, and I thank them for it.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (20:35):  I rise to speak to the motion in front of the House tonight. The motion is:


That this House:


(1) notes that as National Asbestos Awareness Week is formally recognised, it makes earnest representation to the Government to continue to call on Canada to ratify the listing of chrysotile asbestos in the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent;


(2) recognises the proactive actions of the Australian Government in mitigating the possible spread of asbestos related diseases through continuing bans on the production and use of asbestos as well as strict controls on the removal and disposal of existing material;


(3) commends the Australian Government on a number of measures that have been put into place to manage and compensate the victims of asbestos related diseases which include:


(a) the recent ratification of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Asbestos Convention, as one of the first ILO Conventions to be ratified by the Commonwealth Government since 2006;


(b) Australian leadership on a strong closing declaration by 66 countries at the 2011 Conference of the Rotterdam Convention, which expressed deep concern that the listing of chrysotile asbestos had been prevented by a small number of parties and resolved to move forward to list chrysotile asbestos in Annex III;


(c) the $5 million grant made to support the Asbestos Disease Research Institute Bernie Banton Centre;


(d) funding for the new Australian Mesothelioma Registry, which was launched in 2010 to gather more detailed and accurate information on mesothelioma and asbestos-related diseases;


(e) support for the harmonisation of health and safety legislation which will provide, for the first time, a uniform framework for the minimisation of exposure, the removal of asbestos, and the management asbestos materials in the workplace;


(f) the establishment of the Asbestos Management Review in late 2010 to recommend strategies for the development of a national strategic plan to improve asbestos awareness, management and removal;


(g) the loan agreement with the NSW Government to ensure asbestos victims and their families continue to receive payments through the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund; and


(h) the $1.5 million Comcare Asbestos Innovation Fund which sponsors programs and research to prevent and better manage asbestos exposure, as well as improve treatment for asbestos-disease sufferers;


(4) notes the unwelcome inheritance that asbestos has left on the Australian community, which sees Australian citizens suffering one of the highest rates of asbestos-related diseases in the world, with the effects of asbestos mining still being suffered by many, mostly Indigenous and past employees of James Hardie's operation at Baryulgil in the electoral division of Page, and the poor health and mortality they and their families suffer;


(5) extends its profound sympathies to all individuals suffering asbestos-related diseases as well as their friends and families and the friends and families of those who have passed away as a result of asbestos-related diseases;


(6) notes the current and potential damage that imported asbestos is creating to the people in the Asia Pacific region where, despite these well documented health risks, it remains an attractive commodity due to its low cost compared to other comparable building material;


(7) calls upon the Canadian Government to recognise the potentially catastrophic health and social implications of Canada's production and sale of asbestos and products containing asbestos to these lower socio-economic markets; and


(8) supports the Australian Government in using strong diplomatic efforts to convince the Canadian Government to cease both production and trade in asbestos.


The one aspect of this motion I will just touch on tonight is the issue of our bilateral relationship with Canada. I note the special relationship we have with Canada. We cooperate very well with Canada in multilateral forums and we have a strong economic and trade relationship. Canada is Australia's 21st largest merchandise trading partner, with the two-way trade totalling $3 billion in 2010. We also have a mutual investment relationship. 


So, in supporting the call for the Australian government to make strong diplomatic efforts to convince the Canadian government, I also call on the government to make sure it does this in a way which reflects the very strong relationship we have with Canada. They are our ally. We have a very good relationship which dates back many years. I therefore think that we should use science, facts and our experience with asbestos in Australia to convince them of the path we think we should go down. That is the type of diplomatic activity we should use. Canada has been a longstanding friend and ally of our country and I think that if we go to them with a very sound argument—one based on the science and the health facts arising from our experience here in Australia—down the track we will be able to get Canada to understand where we are coming from.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (20:40):  I also would like to thank the member for Page for moving this motion and for reminding us all how important it is that the Australian government continues to call on Canada to ratify the listing of chrysotile asbestos in the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade. We in Australia know asbestos very well. In the 15 years after World War II, 52 per cent of all houses built in the state of New South Wales were made of fibro. In my electorate, where building was intense at that time in Wentworthville, Pendle Hill and Toongabbie, there are some local government areas where 90 per cent of the houses are made from fibro. 


Australia suffers one of the highest rates of incidence of mesothelioma—the worst of the asbestos related diseases—in the world, with estimates of 13,000 cases by 2020 and a further 40,000 to 45,000 cases of asbestos related cancer. This is a dreadful disease which hangs around in the community and shows itself some 40, 50 or 60 years after exposure to the fibres.


Many in my community think of India as part of the family—their mums and their dads and their cousins still live there. So to think that a country like India, which is growing so fast, is continuing to use this product and that it is being exported there from a country where you could not even give it away—Canada—is truly shocking. The use of asbestos in India has increased by more than 300 per cent in the last couple of decades. A very wise man, Dr. Sanjay Chaturvedi, said it quite well when he said:


… the burden of industrial pollution reaches the developing world much faster than the fruits of industrial growth.


There can be no doubt that, as the global demand for asbestos decreased, there were companies which aggressively sought out countries where the building boom was on but where the health and worker safety regulations were still developing. Such countries will face a future very similar to ours. We in the world who have handled asbestos for many years should know better. We should not doubt how profoundly appalling some of the behaviour of asbestos producers has been in the past and how appalling it continues to be.


The world has known about the dangers of asbestos for many, many years. It was known by the Greeks, and Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder noticed that women who wove asbestos into cloth commonly displayed a sickness of the lungs. The first modern registered death from asbestos exposure was in 1899—40 years before James Hardie opened its plant in my electorate. It was a 33-year-old man who died from asbestos related disease. He had worked in an asbestos textile factory for 14 years and, of the nine other people who worked with him, he was, when he died, the only one to have survived until then. In 1906, the French made recommendations that asbestos workplaces should be ventilated. In 1916, Prudential Insurance in the US decided that they would no longer give life insurance to asbestos workers. In 1917 and 1918, there was more research in the US and James Hardie set up their plant—without appropriate worker safety practices. The first diagnosis of asbestosis was in 1924, following the death of a 33-year-old woman who had been working with asbestos since she was 13. A subsequent study showed that 25 per cent of asbestos workers in England had lung disease. The first workers compensation claim for asbestos was in 1927, involving  a foreman in a textile plant in Massachusetts. By the thirties, when James Hardie opened its plant in Australia, a significant amount of scientific knowledge had been accumulated about asbestos-related disease. The US made asbestosis a work compensatable disease in 1941—many years ago, and yet we still have Canada selling this material to developing countries. The first Australian case of mesothelioma was a miner from Wittenoom—in 1962. Later research identified over 658 cases leading up to 1979. James Hardie put a warning on its product in 1978 and stopped producing it in 1982 but continued to sell its stockpile until 1987—appalling behaviour. I commend the motion to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-02-13,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (20:46):  Awareness weeks are part and parcel of the national health calendar, and that is a good thing. They bring what is often much-needed publicity to what in many cases were once little known or thought about ailments and illnesses. By highlighting the causes, symptoms and where possible cures of certain conditions, the general public, media outlets, parliaments and most importantly sufferers and their families can come to know more about some of the health-related afflictions which beset our modern world. Importantly, understanding illnesses and appreciating just what people affected by them are going through goes a long way towards improving health services to combat them. That is what these awareness weeks are all about.


These days, one of the most important awareness weeks is that pertaining to asbestos. In Australia, bans continue on the production and use of asbestos and strict controls are in place for the removal and disposal of existing material. This is how it must be. A $5 million Commonwealth grant has been allocated to support the Asbestos Disease Research Institute Bernie Banton Centre. This is appropriate and commendable. Funding has also been provided for the new Australian Mesothelioma Registry, launched in 2010 to compile more accurate and detailed information on mesothelioma and asbestos-related diseases. This takes in support for the harmonisation of health and safety legislation which for the first time will put in place a uniform framework for the minimisation of exposure, the removal of asbestos and the management of asbestos materials in the workplace.


There are also the provisions of the loan agreement with the New South Wales government to ensure asbestos victims and their families continue to receive payments through the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund. This fund is unfortunately going to be increasingly necessary into the future. As well, there is the $1.5 million Comcare Asbestos Innovation Fund, which sponsors programs and research to prevent and better manage asbestos exposure, as well as improve treatment for asbestos-disease sufferers.


Ongoing research is vitally important. All too sadly, Australia suffers one of the highest rates of asbestos-related diseases in the world, with the effects of asbestos mining still being suffered by many. More is the pity that in the Asia-Pacific region where, despite what we know here in Australia and as is well documented worldwide, asbestos remains an attractive commodity because of its low cost compared to other comparable building materials. According to the Victorian government's Better Health channel, Australia has one of the highest rates of mesothelioma in the world. This is due to the high rate of asbestos use and mining over many decades.


Since the early 1980s more than 10,000 individuals have succumbed to mesothelioma after being exposed to asbestos and, according to cancer experts, an additional 25,000 Australians are expected to die over the next forty years from this painful and crippling disease. To put it into perspective, in 2007 nearly 600 people were diagnosed with mesothelioma in Australia. Of these new cases, 81 per cent were men. The figures also showed that, as suspected, deaths occurred most often in the age range encompassing those individuals who were 75 to 79 years old. More than 70 per cent of the mesothelioma deaths were among men and women over the age of 65. National trends from 1997 to 2007 show that deaths from mesothelioma steadily increased. Experts suggest that the number of deaths from mesothelioma will peak somewhere between 2014 and 2021, depending on the models used.


Mesothelioma is a rare and often fatal cancer of the mesothelium, the membrane which covers most of the body's internal organs. Mesothelioma can develop decades after exposure to asbestos. Where it cannot be surgically removed, this condition is incurable. In some cases just a whiff of asbestos dust can prove ultimately fatal. Symptoms or signs of mesothelioma may not appear until 20 to 50 years, or more, after exposure to asbestos. Studies show that the Australians most at risk of developing mesothelioma include trades such as carpenters, construction workers, electrical engineers, insulation installers, miners, plumbers and shipbuilders.


At Batlow in my Riverina electorate not only did a devastating hailstorm on 9 November last year wipe out the apple crop and strip trees to the extent they will take years to recover but also a major processor now faces asbestos-related damage to a warehouse. This has real and lasting financial implications for this town, for which apples are almost its sole economic means. Hopefully assistance will be forthcoming to Batlow as it tries to build a future after being hit with more setbacks than could be deemed fair. I commend the motion to the House.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (21:30):  Today I wanted to participate in a debate in another chamber on a motion moved by the member for Fowler on the Sabian Mandaeans but, because of a diplomatic visitor, I was unable to be present in the chamber to participate in the debate. I wanted to note my support for his raising this issue. It is not the first time that he has done so. In fact, I spoke on a motion in very similar terms on 30 May last year. 


At that time I noted that I had had a long association with the Sabian Mandaeans, the Assyrians, the Chaldeans and other Aramaic speakers generally. They were not necessarily constituents of mine but I was particularly interested in the plight of many of the original Christians and also the followers of John the Baptist—the Sabian Mandaeans. Having played such a significant role in those countries in the Middle East, it was tremendously disappointing to see them under pressure at particular points in time and suffering as a result of persecution. I noted in my previous speech that I had had meetings with the Middle East Council of Churches, particularly in Jordan. I had been told, in a very concerned way, that they were very worried about what was happening to Christians in many Middle Eastern countries. It would be a disaster if we came to a point where Christians, where all that early history and engagement occurred, were no longer able to reside in those parts of the world. 


So it was with a deal of pleasure that I noticed again that the member for Fowler recognised the historic connections and contributions of the Mandaeans and others in that region, their ongoing plight and the systemic loss of culture, heritage and language. He condemned the acts of violence and persecution and encouraged the preservation and continued prosperity of the heritage and culture of the Sabian Mandaeans and other indigenous people of Iraq.


Some 50 per cent of Mandaeans have either died or left Iraq since 2003. Mandaeans have repeatedly called for the evacuation of their entire people. The community now numbers about 3,500 people, down from 60,000 people in 2003. Religion and ethnicity go hand in hand in Iraq. Unfortunately, that is also reflected in the constitution. It is a situation where only minorities like the Mandaeans, included in the subgroup of Christians and other groups, lack certain privileges that one might expect. There is nothing in the way of representation. We have seen situations in which there are recorded killings, including of women and children. There have been 46 kidnappings and 10 reported threats—21 between January 2007 and January 2008. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq, as reported in 2010, eight members of the community have been killed or injured due to politically or ethnically motivated attacks. 


Some 6,000 Sabian Mandaeans now live in Sydney. I guess that is one of the reasons that this matter has been raised by some of my colleagues. Let me make one point which I disagreed with on the last occasion, which was the linking of Australia's part in the coalition of the willing with prompting us to be involved in this matter. The member, in his motion, states:


… Australia … has a moral responsibility to compassionately support and protect the indigenous minorities …


When I was Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, I was able to provide within the refugee program many places to settle Sabian Mandaeans in Australia. I think they have been wonderful settlers. I notice that the honourable member has been raising with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship matters relating to the Sabian Mandaeans. I hope that, in response to his representations, this government will be able to be as generous as the former government was in assisting the Sabian Mandaeans, who need further assistance.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (10:30):  Congratulations on your appointment, Deputy Speaker Leigh. Last week, it was two years since I delivered my maiden speech in the parliament. I committed then as I commit again now to represent the concerns, both big and small, of the people of Higgins. After conducting 11 community forums, countless mobile office meetings and an electorate-wide survey, it has become abundantly clear to me that there is a very specific issue that resonates deeply with the people of Higgins. This issue will only worsen over time as our population grows and our community becomes more densely populated. It is an issue that requires urgent action. I am referring to the ever-increasing traffic congestion in the inner Melbourne region and in particular at the bottlenecks where road and rail connect. There is little doubt that traffic congestion caused by level crossings is a major source of frustration for many of my constituents, with some even phoning my office while they are sitting in their car, which they are often forced to do for anywhere between 15 and 40 minutes.


While it is always dangerous to single out the worst, there can be little doubt that the crossings that connect with the Dandenong rail line are some of the worst in the state. I have written to the federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport to draw his attention to the Victorian government's recent submission to Infrastructure Australia requesting funds to commence grade separation along this line. The submission highlights the fact that the Dandenong rail line is a critical infrastructure arterial, delivering $92 billion to the Victorian economy, which represents about half of the state's GDP and nine per cent of national GDP.


In addition to this, the Dandenong rail line can move 12,500 passengers in a single peak-hour period on a combination of 15 metro trains and two V/Line trains. The Dandenong line services some of Melbourne's largest growth corridors in Pakenham and Cranbourne and is a key component of the Victorian public transport system. The railway line is already at or above full capacity, resulting in the constant closure of level crossings. Within my electorate of Higgins there are three crossings in close proximity to each other, Koornang Road, Carnegie; Murrumbeena Road, Murrumbeena; and Poath Road, Murrumbeena. The impact of their frequent and lengthy closures is severely impacting upon pedestrian and car traffic and road freight, with negative consequences for local businesses, schools, shops and community life.


At one of my mobile office meetings, one mother told me that she will not be taking her child to her choice of childcare facility because it is over the railway line and this simple journey would take her more than 40 minutes in traffic, rendering it completely impractical. She told me that as a result she will not be returning to work in the near future. And there are countless other stories just like this.


But these are not the only infrastructure problems in my electorate. There are other desperately needed grade separations required at Toorak Road and Glenferrie Road. This is something that I will continue to campaign for, as these major intersections should be of high priority. We need to have a functional rail and road system. Fixing these infrastructure problems is critical to increasing our nation's productivity.


On 16 November, I sat down with the state Minister for Transport and Roads, Terry Mulder, with a map of Higgins to tell him where investment was required. It is now up to the federal minister for infrastructure to heed the call. I call upon the federal government to support the Victorian government's submission and work in a bipartisan way on this critical infrastructure.

"Coulton, Mark, MP",Nats,2012-02-13,"



Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (11:00):  I rise to speak to this motion on local government. There are some parts of the motion of the member for Lyne for which I have full sympathy. I spoke of the need for recognition of local government and the need for a regular funding stream to local government in my maiden speech in this place in February 2008. Local government has been meeting to discuss constitutional recognition and a conference relating to that was held in Melbourne last year. My concern is for regional local government—local government in rural areas. If we look at a funding stream and just bundle all of local government in together, I believe that regional local government will still be the poor cousins. What has happened over many years is cost shifting down to local government so that local government in rural and regional areas are responsible for many things that large metropolitan local councils are not.


I was the Mayor of Gwydir Shire Council before I came to this place, and not only were we responsible for the basics of local government—the three Rs: the roads, rates and rubbish—but also we were responsible for aged care and child care, we owned two medical centres, we employed an early family intervention worker, we were the RTA agency and we were the Centrelink agency. That is a whole range of responsibilities that, in larger areas, local government would not have to deal with. We were even involved in landcare type issues. We also had responsibility for a large network of very poor quality roads servicing highly productive areas. 


While I agree that we need a regular funding stream, I think that we need to look at this not as a flat rate. If we receive this funding as a percentage of GST or if it is allocated on a per capita basis, once again the City of Sydney Council, Brisbane City Council, Hornsby Shire Council, Blacktown City Council and so on will be flush with cash. They have large rating bases and many people stacked up several storeys high but have nowhere near the responsibility of regional councils. I believe that we have got a way to go with this, but what I have been saying to the councils in my area is not to rush into something that is once again going to leave regional local government the poor cousin. Indeed, Gwydir Shire Council and Moree Plains Shire Council have formed the Australian Rural Roads Group to lobby on behalf of high-production agricultural councils and to speak of the benefit of local roads. Everything that we purchase on the supermarket shelf starts its life on a local road. Indeed, the economic capacity of this country is being impacted because these rural businesses—many of them are multimillion dollar businesses—cannot meet contractual agreements because of the poor state of the roads. We have seen a focus on metropolitan areas and the large arterial roads, and they are important, but the local roads are equally important. When assessing a government's commitment to country roads, a fund for the Pacific Highway really should not be taken into account. It plays a different role compared to the local roads. While I agree with the sentiment of the member for Lyne, I cannot agree to the detail or the intent of this motion. I will continue to lobby in support of a decent go for funding and recognition of local government in Australia.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (11:05):  I thank the chamber and the previous speaker for rolling on. There is another function on nearby, the fourth anniversary of the apology, and it is a very important day. The point of this motion is very much to recognise some of the points picked up by the previous speaker regarding the local road network in Australia. It is failing. In frank terms, it is buggered. It does need a completely new funding model to address some of the realities faced by local councils right throughout Australia, particularly for the growing burden of a failing road network.


For one council in my region the figures are compelling. They have a road backlog of over $250 million. Based on current Australian design standards, building a kilometre of local road costs about $1 million. To not go backwards any further they have to somehow put in $27 million a year—that is to remain with a backlog of $250 million. They have a rate base of around $10 million to $15 million. The maths simply does not add up. In New South Wales these are rate pegged councils and their capacity to do it themselves simply does not exist. We are beyond the point of simply blaming dodgy councils or dodgy councillors. We are beyond the point where we can continue to accept the argument that it is our money because of states' rights. In my view the money raised through taxes and rates at all levels of government is the people's money and we are not doing our job and not fulfilling our obligations if people are paying rates and taxes and not getting a return in quality services, such as local roads.


I would agree with another point the previous speaker made. The separation of highways—for example, the Pacific Highway was mentioned—is an important separation that needs to be made. I would also agree, taking it to the next step, that regional roads need to be separated. Both the highway network and the regional road network can receive an awful lot of money through Commonwealth and state revenues. It is that next tier down, the local road network, that has failed. I am not just using that as scare language. I think the various engineers associations that work with the road networks have been making that call for many years now. In a region such as mine, not only has the funding model led to failure of the local road network but we have once again over the last month just been through another flood, which increases the speed of the damage. That is on the back of a flood last year and natural disaster relief funding for those roads has yet to come through. So it is a flood upon a flood, damage upon damage and a bill upon a bill in circumstances where there is already an enormous backlog and a failed funding model.


The GST review is on. John Brumby and Nick Greiner are good men and I would hope they are not just going to serve up a no-change model. I think there is an opportunity over the next couple of months to really consider all options in light of the circumstances that Australia faces. This motion is trying to get the local road network on the agenda, if not via direct funding to local councils then by somehow changing the funding model so that we can start to address what is a failed network. I urge the Treasurer, the GST review committee and government members to put in some thought and reflection on that and not allow this GST review to just say that horizontal fiscal equalisation is the way to go, that there should be no change because of the current parliament and away we go.


There is an urgent need on the ground. I repeat that the network has failed. Unless there is a substantial change in funding models from the Commonwealth then this is going to create all sorts of productivity problems for the nation. I am not in the camp that says a Pape case in the High Court rules it out. I am watching closely to see another case, the Williams case, to see whether it does. I think we should buy some time on constitutional recognition and make it a financial issue and address it.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (11:11):  I support the general thrust of the member for Lyne's motion. While I would not specifically single out the GST as the revenue source, it is clear that local government does indeed need access to growth funding. Local government rates keep going up and up and that is hurting families. It is clear that there needs to be a better way of funding councils to deliver the local infrastructure that is vitally needed in the community.


There are limited options for councils to raise revenue. I have some detailed experience, having been a local government councillor for the better part of six years. About 83 per cent of the revenue that councils have to play with across the nation is their own sourced revenue. Rates make up about 37 per cent of that, and that is a direct slug on many families out there. We have charges for goods and services, and increasingly councils are moving towards a user-pays system for basic services. For example, a person dumping a ute load of rubbish at the tip is now charged for doing that. This is what councils are moving to, and 29 per cent of their revenue comes from those charges. Other charges, such as fines and developer contributions, make up around 14 per cent of their revenue. Again, that is a hit on the community. It is indirect in some cases, such as developer contributions, which flow through to the cost of owning a new home. These are the sources that councils currently get their finance from. Every time that new infrastructure, or even maintenance of existing structure, is required they look to ratchet up those fees.


I say you cannot just do that. I remember being in a private council meeting where we were looking at the budget numbers and the list of infrastructure that was needed. It turned out that there needed to be a 13 per cent rate rise to fund only what was required. Rates were going up to about $2½ thousand per household. My reaction was, 'When do we hit the limit here?' It gets to the stage where you cannot charge the community any more. You will get a situation where people just cannot afford to live in their own homes. There were blank stares and nobody knew the answer to that question, because infrastructure costs keep going up and up. In Queensland, 88 per cent of council funding comes from own sourced revenue. That is a direct result of the state government pulling out. They had subsidies in place for water and sewerage infrastructure. But they removed those subsidies, so now that burden falls on homeowners. There is a lot of uncertainty for councils as a result, because they just do not know in situations like that, where the states pull out. That really stuffs up forward budgeting. About 8½ per cent of funding to local government comes from the federal government and about 8½ per cent comes from the states, but that goes up and down. There needs to be some certainty.


With regard to the constitutional recognition issue, I disagree with the motion before the House. Constitutional recognition is vitally important. The Pape case showed that there was great uncertainty about direct federal funding to local government. In fact, George Williams, renowned legal expert, says that there is no constitutional validity for it. That is ultimately deserved and it will stop situations like that which we had in Queensland, where the Beattie government, with the support of the current Premier, Anna Bligh, and the then local government minister, Andrew Fraser, rode roughshod over local communities and amalgamated councils left, right and centre, where there was no community of interest for those councils. There is no better reason than that than to have constitutional recognition. So, to sum up, there needs to be growth funding— (Time expired)

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Ms BURKE
 (Chisholm—Deputy Speaker) (11:16):  I am feeling a sense of deja vu this week, firstly, being back in my role as the Deputy Speaker from the last parliament and, secondly, completely with respect to the motion before the House. 


One of the first committee inquiries that I was involved in in this place was a cost-shifting inquiry into local government. We handed down a phenomenal report in October 2003 entitled Rates and taxes: a fair share for responsible local government. Now, in 2012, we are again having the same debate, we are arguing the same issues and we are looking at the same things. The committee that handed down this report worked incredibly hard. We went to every state and territory and to every local government that we could. The inquiry received more submissions than any other inquiry I have ever been involved in—even more than the inquiry on the clean energy bills, which I have just done. 


We raised a level of expectation that we would resolve something, and of course, tragically, we did not. I think it is one of the failures of the committee system. We went out, asked people to give us ideas with which to produce something, and here we are dealing with a motion to do with what the report looked at originally—cost-shifting. At the time, the federal Liberal government was looking at the issue of Labor states pushing things back onto local councils, but of course we found that everybody was pushing back onto local councils. It was across the board: local council was pushing back onto states and the states were pushing back onto the feds and everybody, in turn, was pushing back onto the poor taxpayers.


The report, at page 115, summed it up for most people:


Following a meeting of the Local Government and Planning Ministers’ Council in July 2003, the President of MAV—


Municipal Association of Victoria—


was quoted as saying:


Unless we see a reappraisal of the current tax base of local governments, councils will need to continue to go out to ratepayers cap in hand on an annual basis. 


… The MAV would investigate several options, including a suggestion that part of the State Government’s GST funds be set aside for councils.


That was the original suggestion in the first Howard GST bill. He actually came out and said that they wanted to propose that the states resume responsibility for providing financial assistance grants to local government from 1 July 2000. So the feds would get out of this space all together, the GST would go to the states and the states would then have responsibility for passing everything on to local government, overtaking what we now know as the FAGs system. Payments would be made under the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, with heads of government signed at the 1990 Premiers Conference. 


But under the agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats to modify the goods and services tax and implement a package of other proposals, the government agreed to retain responsibility for assisting local government, and that was a good thing, otherwise local government would have been ripped off at the time. There was not going to be any more money; there was actually going to be less. The Dems got a bit of a caning at the time for introducing and doing this, but they actually saved local government from getting less than their fair share. 


I am not saying that this motion is not important and I am not saying that my committee inquiry was not important, because we now know—and we have known for years—that the push-back is onto ratepayers and is onto local government. And, as all the other speakers have said, one of the things we looked at is: what is the responsibility of local government? It is, 'How long is a piece of string?' Each council does something different. Look at Brisbane City Council. Look at the ACT government, which acts as the local council. Look at shire councils around the place which run ports and airfields. In my community they run nursing homes and childcare centres. What are they responsible for? The difficulty is that they become responsible for whatever the community wants or demands. They become the last man standing and they fill the void. This happens in rural settings in particular, where it is harder to say to your community that you are not going to fund that youth worker this week because the state government has pulled out the funding or that you are not going to fill that pothole because you did not get any federal money to do that. So local council becomes the meat in the sandwich.


The main aim of this inquiry and this report was to say that the three levels of government need to get together and work better together. They need to understand what each is doing, what each is raising, and then work it through, as opposed to just buck-shifting. Councils also need to learn to say no to ratepayers, state governments and the federal government. They need to say it is not their responsibility and they are not going to fill that void. That is really hard. I have said to my local councillors that their job is a lot harder than mine. Everybody knows who they are. When a bin is not picked up, it is their fault. But if something happens at a federal level nobody is going to find and abuse their federal member of parliament. So local councils do find it difficult to say no. I think it is a really difficult thing, but we need to get the three levels of government together and resolve this now so that we do not keep going around in circles.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-02-13,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:21):  I endorse the remarks made by previous speakers on this extremely important topic, especially the member for Parkes and the member for Dawson, who have considerable experience in local government. I also acknowledge the remarks made by the member for Chisholm. Indeed, everything falls back on local government to provide absolutely everything in their community. As the member for Parkes so correctly pointed out, it is not just about roads, rates and rubbish anymore; it is everything from childcare centres to counselling services. You name it, local government has to provide it. That is why recognition of local government in the Constitution is so important. We have seen all too often where federal government money intended to go to local government ends up going through the bureaucracy of state governments and so little of it trickles down the line to where it is most needed.


When it comes to roads, that is where local government does provide such a great service, but they do it with such little funding these days and there is only a limited revenue base for local governments to get their money from. In my local government area the Wagga Wagga City Council has just imposed parking fees at the local airport in an endeavour to raise more funds. Tumut Shire Council is desperately seeking funding at the moment for Gocup Road. Prior to the 2010 election the coalition committed $11 million of funding to this state road. Gocup Road provides a vital service in the Snowy Mountains area for tourism but more importantly for Visy Industries, a multi-billion-dollar industry providing many hundreds of jobs for the Tumut shire. This road, which is very winding and very narrow, has to support not just heavy haulage B-double trucks and semitrailers but also school buses. It is not a good mix and it is going to end in tragedy if something is not done to help Gocup Road. The new mayor of Tumut Shire Council, Councillor John Larter, and his very hardworking general manager, Bob Stewart, have asked me to lobby the government to provide much-needed funding for Gocup Road. I have written to the Minister for Local Government and Regional Development, Simon Crean, to seek a meeting as an avenue to provide funding for this vital piece of infrastructure, which is so important to the Riverina and Tumut shire. It has been said that there is no argument for recognition of local government in the Constitution. In the Pape v Commissioner of Taxation matter it was determined that:


… the Commonwealth does not possess the power to fund whatever bodies and activities it desires. It may only directly expend federal money in areas where the Commonwealth can demonstrate that it has a specific power under the Australian Constitution to do so.


The Commonwealth does not have any general power under the Constitution to regulate or fund local government.


That is why it is so important that local government be recognised in the Constitution. The Commonwealth, as the overarching government in this nation, has to be able to provide money directly to local government so that money can go to the areas where it is so desperately needed. Road funding is one of those all-important areas.


In New South Wales the percentage of own-source revenue in 2005-06 was 84 per cent, so you can see how limited local government is in providing its own revenue when there are so many demands to provide avenues of community help and assistance. Particularly in New South Wales, where rates are capped, there are very limited opportunities for local governments to be able to provide the sorts of infrastructure that people demand and expect of their local shire councils. Roads, as the member for Parkes pointed out, are the lifeblood of this nation. Every grocery item that ends up in a metropolitan supermarket starts its life on a local government road in regional Australia. It is high time that local councils were able to access more money from the federal government to provide that infrastructure.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:26):  I thank the chamber for the opportunity to be able to speak briefly on this motion moved by the member for Lyne. I know there is keen interest among all of us in our local governments, and many members of the House were formerly members of local governments across the nation, as the member for Dawson was. Over the years, many constituents in my electorate have brought up this issue and the subject of taxes and the GST. They have often said to me that, when the GST was implemented back in 2001, their understanding was that it would result in the elimination of stamp duties and a whole range of other taxes across the board by the states. They relay all this to me: they voted in a GST back then because they were told it would cause the abolition of all the state taxes that were dogging them in their private and public lives at the time. People believed that would be the case in the post-2001 period—that is, with the introduction of the GST many taxes were going to be taken off, including the stamp duties in the states—and they feel that they did not get that deal and that they were perhaps dudded or conned. That is the feeling of the constituency out there; that is what I am hearing.


When we look at the GST and we look at what the proceeds could or should be used for, I always go back to that deal that the members of the community in my electorate thought they were signing up for originally and the fulfilment of that deal. As far as I am concerned, that deal has not yet been fulfilled. People expected stamp duties and a whole range of state taxes to have been abolished and they are still waiting for it a decade on. That is the impression out there in the real world. I think we should see how that particular deal the former government spoke about back in 2000 and 2001 can be honoured. Only after it has been honoured would I look to other things that could be done with the proceeds of the goods and services tax.


I do not have an objection to funds raised by the Commonwealth going directly to local governments, and we see that happening across the country more and more. For example, recently in my own electorate, in the suburb of Glenelg in the local government area of the City of Holdfast Bay, we saw a brand new bridge built. Nearly $3.5 million came directly from the federal government to Holdfast Bay to partially fund the replacement of a bridge that had concrete cancer. Mayor Ken Rolland—a very good mayor who does an extremely good job in Holdfast Bay—was running to local and state governments, everywhere, to get the funding for the bridge, but he could not secure it. We then tried to get funding through the federal government, and can I say that I was very pleased to be able to secure the money for the bridge in the Holdfast Bay council area. The old King Street Bridge has now been renamed the Michael Herbert Bridge. I was very pleased to be with the mayor not that long ago to conduct the opening of this wonderful bridge, which carries about 10,000 vehicles every day. This is an example of direct funding from the federal government to a local government. 


As I said, I do not have an objection to Commonwealth funding or any funds being raised by the Commonwealth going directly to local governments; but, at the same time, I cannot support this motion as it would delay or further diminish the likelihood of the deal that was struck between the previous government and the public being honoured. It so happens that that deal included more taxes than stamp duty. Some have been abolished, to be fair; but the matter is not settled. It seems that representatives from the community, including the business community, are not content with the situation as it stands. They, too, acknowledge that there is more work to be done towards the fulfilment of the original promise of displacing all state taxes with the GST. 


The tax summit that was convened by the government in October 2011 bore witness to this perspective by everyone who submitted or contributed to it. The tax summit concluded on a desire to reform state based taxation with the states and to develop agreement across the country on a system of taxation which diminishes the economic drag of taxation— (Time expired)

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:00):  On behalf of the opposition it is my pleasure to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill, and I indicate at the outset that the coalition will be supporting this legislation. Like all tax law amendment bills it deals with a number of substantive taxation issues, which I am going to run through fairly briefly. Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, you can probably tell I am losing my voice, albeit slowly, but I hope it lasts the rest of the week. I have picked up whatever it is my three-year-old son, Angus, has. I think you would agree it would be less than efficient for me to lose my voice on something we all agree on at the start of a sitting week.


This bill deals with some changes to superannuation, some changes to capital gains tax and some changes to GST. It adds to the deductible gift recipient list and, finally, as is nearly always the case, it corrects some unintended errors and makes some tidying up provisions within the tax law generally. Very briefly, as we know this legislation was introduced late last year on 23 November by the then Assistant Treasurer, Mr Shorten. He outlined in some detail in the second reading speech the changes and the reasons for those changes with respect to superannuation.


Schedule 1 will allow certain superannuation fund members with lost super to more easily consolidate their funds through the use of an electronic portability form. It is outlined both in the second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum how that will operate, and we regard this as a sensible initiative. Schedule 2 in three parts deals with capital gains tax. The essence of those changes is to allow entities in a restructure to use share-of-interest sale facilities without failing a requirement of certain capital gains tax rollovers. Also, as is pointed out, it provides capital gains tax demerger relief and there is also a provision to expand capital gains tax rollover to entities changing their incorporation.


With respect to the goods and services tax, the bill outlines two things with respect to GST. It implements some aspects of the Treasury review of the GST of financial supply provisions. It is pointed out that some of the changes can be dealt with in this bill and some can be dealt with by way of regulation. I understand that my friend and colleague the member for Blair, who follows these tax law amendment bills, I am sure, will be across this issue in some detail. Also in a separate section the bill clarifies the GST treatment of new residential premises. Without going into all the details it is another case where, I think, the member for Blair will confirm legislation is required to confirm the original intent of the GST legislation, in this case, following a court decision.


Finally, schedule 5 adds the Rhodes Trust to the deductible gift recipient list. Of course the Rhodes Trust raises funds to augment the existing Rhodes Scholarship program at Oxford. I also noticed from the then Assistant Treasurer's second reading speech that there is also a name change to another organisation. As I said at the start, schedule 6 deals with some miscellaneous amendments to correct some unintended errors with some technical corrections. On behalf of the opposition I commend the bill to House. As I said at the outset, we will be supporting this bill through both houses.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:05):  I speak in support of this TLAB legislation, the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011. This bill, like all bills that amend the tax laws in an omnibus way, does it by way of schedule. I want to focus particularly on schedule 1, which is the portability of superannuation and the implications there. By way of an example, I will describe my own electorate and how changes being made to superannuation will have an impact there.


Firstly, I will briefly go through the other aspects of the bill. Schedule 2 is part of the 2010-11 budget, where we announced that we were amending the capital gains tax provisions to make it easier for businesses to restructure. There are a number of provisions here. This amendment talks about certain business structures and broadening access to CGT rollovers. This is consistent with our commitment to streamline business to make it more flexible so that it can operate in a way that is not governed by regulation and the tax laws do not impinge in an adverse way. It extends the CGT rollover for the conversion of a body to an incorporated company—and that often happens. It is often the case that businesses change the way they are structured. That is a sensible provision. It broadens the range of CGT rollovers where entities can use a share or interest sale facility for foreign residents in a restructure and allows the CGT demerger relief for demerger groups that include corporations sole or complying superannuation entities which cannot access the relief. It is a sensible arrangement and really is good public policy.


Schedule 3 provides for the CGT financial supply provisions. It increases the first limb of the financial acquisition threshold from $50,000 to $150,000. The purpose of that is to follow recommendations that were made in the Treasury's review of the CGT financial supply provisions to make sure that we can take businesses out of the system. It means that we are excluding financial suppliers consisting of borrowings made through the provisions of a deposit account by Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions from the current concession for borrowings; and allows the taxpayer who accounts on a cash basis to treat an acquisition made under a hire  purchase agreement as though they did an account on a cash basis.


The next provision I want to deal with is the CGT treatment for new residential purposes. This corrects an error made, I think in a court, in the case Commissioner of Taxation v Gloxinia Investments. This decision found that a sale of certain residential premises to owner-occupier investors was actually an input tax—which is a strange way of thinking about it—rather than taxable. I had a bit of a look at that. I do not profess to be an expert on tax, but I thought it was a very strange decision. The schedule amends what we call the GST act—or, to use its full title, A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999—providing that a wholesale supply of residential premises is disregarded in certain circumstances for the purposes of determining whether a subsequent supply of a premise is the supply of new residential premise and thus taxable. There are additional changes that are made, but I will not go through them now.


The listing of deductible gift recipient status is also covered. A number of people on both sides of the political aisle have had the benefit of Rhodes scholarships. I understand the Leader of the Opposition was one. My good friend—and I was his campaign director—former Queensland Treasurer the Hon. David Hamill was also a Rhodes scholar. So we are listing here the Rhodes Trust in Australia to allow Australians who donate to the appeal to claim a deduction for the donation. There are some other miscellaneous changes, which I will not go into.


Schedule 1 is what I really want to focus on, because it is part of the package of superannuation that will make a difference, particularly in my electorate. As we know, a lot of people lose their super. By that, I do not mean that they put it away under the bed and cannot find it; they actually lose their super because they chop and change the businesses they work for. Then they forget they have it or they do not know about it and it is not pressing on their minds. The Australian Taxation Office runs a system that makes it easier and simpler for superannuation members and retirement savings account holders to consolidate their benefits. This scheme will introduce an electronic portability form that will make it easier for account holders and fund members to report funds as lost.


Just to show how significant lost superannuation is, at 30 June 2010 there were about 5.8 million lost superannuation accounts in Australia, with an accumulated balance of $18.8 billion. The then Assistant Treasurer in his second reading speech on this bill, on 23 November 2011, made the point that by 30 June 2011—a year later—that balance had increased to $20.2 billion. We just cannot keep going like that; that is money that belongs to Australians and that will help them in their retirement.


In my electorate alone, which covers the majority of Ipswich and the Somerset region, there is about $80 million waiting to be found by residents. That is according to the Australian Taxation Office. There are about 21,500 accounts that are, effectively, lost. I urge all residents in my electorate to use the SuperSeeker hotline during business hours—132 865—or go to the ATO superannuation website, www.ato.gov.au/super, because this is money that can be used. We are talking about lots of money. The average amount of lost super is about $3,500, invested over a 20-year period that would equate to about $12,500 that could be spent in retirement. That is a lot of money that could go towards a holiday after many years of work; that could go towards the purchase of a new car that someone might need in their retirement—it might be the last good car they actually buy; or that might be extra money spent for grandkids. It is a lot of money. So helping people find their lost superannuation is an important thing.


We on this side are very committed to making sure that people live in dignity and have financial security in retirement. That is why we are increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr NEUMANN:
  I notice that those opposite have, of course, not supported that. That is a sad thing, because we are talking about a 30-year-old person having $108,000 more in superannuation when they retire. Just for the benefit of the member for Moncrieff, who is in the chamber, 43,500 people in my electorate will benefit from the increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine percent to 12 percent. I daresay that a similar number of people in his electorate will benefit. It is tragic that he did not support that legislation.


In March 2011, there was $1.36 trillion invested in superannuation. The market fluctuates, we know, but over the long term superannuation has delivered a very healthy return for investors and for Australians. That is a creation of a federal Labor government, because it is only we on this side of the chamber who are committed to doing that.


Increasing compulsory superannuation will benefit the retirement savings of all Australians. We think that is a particularly important thing, just as we think about the reforms associated with that legislation, like benefiting the 10,700 small businesses in my electorate that will benefit from the cut in the company tax rate. So there are a lot of important things that we are doing: superannuation, in terms of low-income earners—23,600 residents in Blair will get extra superannuation contributions. This government is adding to the superannuation nest eggs of people in my community as well as across the country. Schedule 1 of this legislation is about making sure that the people of Blair, and the people of Australia, get the benefit of the portability of superannuation, making sure they do not lose their superannuation, making sure they live their retirement with dignity and respect.


We are committed, on this side of the chamber, to high-skilled, good wages. And we are committed on this side of the chamber to small business. We are committed by reducing the company tax rate. We are committed by investing in infrastructure, in skills and in training. We have done that; those opposite have not.


It is almost a road to Damascus conversion experience from those opposite—actually now supporting good pieces of legislation, reforming the tax system and reforming superannuation. And if, like Saint Paul on the road to Damascus, this is when they have seen the light, we are very pleased and we support the legislation.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (16:15):  I am pleased to rise in particular to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011—and follow the member for Blair, who I see racing from the chamber now! Can I just say, it was entertaining, to say the least, to hear the member for Blair provide as part of his contribution on this debate some attempt to draw a linkage between the so-called vision of this Labor government and what it means for the retirement incomes of Australia's working people.


Madam Deputy Speaker, at first blush, if you only listen to the member for Blair's contribution in isolation, you might think he had a point to make. You might actually think that Labor was concerned, through an increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, in providing for retirement of Australians into the future. The problem is, though, that this government's exceptionally poor track record does not match the rhetoric. The problem is that the bill before the House certainly contains beneficial initiatives—and that is why the coalition is supporting this bill—but the simple reality is that the rhetoric we heard from the member for Blair is not matched by action. Whilst it is crucial that there are opportunities for people to find and recover lost superannuation—and, to the extent that schedule 1 of the bill deals with that, that is beneficial; and that is the reason why, once again, the coalition is supporting government policy that is good government policy. Contrary to frequent assertions by Labor members that this is a coalition that only ever says no, the truth is that that not the case, and that this is just another example of the way in which that coalition supports. The reason why we are accused of saying no too frequently is simply that this is a government that bowls up such bad policy on such a continuing and frequent basis. But I am pleased to say, in a spirit of bipartisanship, that on this occasion we can all be united in our love for the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011.


But I will deal specifically with the issue of providing for retirement. The member for Blair went to some length in crowing about the Labor Party's track record. I have to say, Madam Deputy Speaker, that when you actually consider the key drivers of the manner in which a person is able to live their retirement in a comfortable way, there are two factors at play. One is of course the accumulation of wealth over time, in a lump sum form, that sits in a superannuation fund. There is no doubt about that: it is a crucial factor. But, just as importantly, the cost of living, and the extent to which that impacts on the lump sum necessary at the commencement of someone's retirement, is equally of value. And it has been this Labor Party that has driven up the cost of living at a level that, frankly, is almost unprecedented.


It has been the policies of this government that have driven up the expenses that Australians have to pay in terms of just their ordinary lifestyles and going about paying for those ordinary things that we all consume, be it groceries, be it utilities, be it medical insurance. On each of these factors this is a government that has betrayed the confidence of Australia's so-called 'working families', as the Labor Party commonly refers to them, but more broadly than that, the community as a whole. We know that the price of utilities, to give but one example, has risen in excess of 10 per cent in the past 12 to 18 months. And it is further forecast, as of 1 July under the carbon tax, to go up an additional 10 per cent. The reason that is crucial—bringing it back to the subject matter of the debate—is that those expenses go to the core of how much someone must provision for their retirement. And the faster the cost of living increases, the more you need to provide for your retirement. That is just an inescapable reality, and the reason why this government is so big on rhetoric but so poor when it comes to follow-through. The rest of this bill is fairly pedestrian. Part 1 of schedule 2 deals with capital gains tax in business restructures and part 2 of schedule 2 deals with capital gains tax demerger relief. Part 3 of schedule 2 deals with restructures in terms of their impact on capital gains tax for Indigenous corporations. Schedule 3 deals with GST financial supply provisions. That perhaps has some impact on a number of my constituents on the Gold Coast. Under schedule 3 the first limb of the financial acquisition threshold will increase from $50,000 to $150,000, effectively increasing the dollar value of input tax credits available for acquisitions related to the making of financial supplies—a good initiative and one that the coalition supports. That is the reason we are supporting this bill.


Schedule 4, which deals with GST treatment of new residential premises, also has an impact in some respects on a number of operations that are undertaken in my electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast. It effectively seeks to ensure that sales or long-term leases of new residential premises by a registered entity are taxable supplies subject to the GST at the time of sale and that sales or long-term leases of residential premises other than new residential premises are input taxed supplies and therefore not subject to the GST at the time or sale under the goods and services tax legislation. Effectively this serves to clarify the intent of the law after the recent Federal Court decision in Commissioner of Taxation v Gloxinia Investments (Trustee), in which it was found that the sale of new residential premises using a developmental lease arrangement should be treated as input taxed—that is, not be subject to the GST. These outcomes are contrary to the general policy intent in relation to the taxation of property under the GST act. That is why the changes are provided for in this legislation.


The member for Blair and others have spoken about the Rhodes Trust being added to the deductible gift recipient list. We know that DGR status, as it is commonly referred to, is an important tool that helps to drive donations in some of these charitable trusts. It is a way to ensure the gift becomes a tax deductible gift. For that reason the application of DGR status to the Rhodes Trust is obviously going to be beneficial, given it is great enabler for many young Australians to travel and study at Oxford University. Schedule 6 deals with a grab bag of various amendments to tax laws.


I am pleased to associate myself with the bill. It is a bill that will clarify a number of matters in relation to taxation. At the outset I addressed very directly some of the spurious assertions that were made by the member for Blair and corrected the record with respect to the fact that there is another side to that coin about providing for Australians' retirement incomes, and that is to control the cost of living.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (16:23): I am looking forward to speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No.9) Bill 2011. I have said in this place before that I quite like tax laws amendment bills. Some of my constituents have now found me out and approached me in the street and questioned my character over that, but I do admit it. Quite often in these bills that deal with so many aspects of other areas of policy in some ways you find the character of a government—you find the small details that put in place aspects of broader policy and you are reminded of policies that were implemented a year before that require a change to tax law. In this case, you find very real indications of the government's commitment to retirement income, to simplifying things for business and to clarifying and simplifying the law across a range of areas.


Before I get to the fun bit, which is the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No.9) Bill 2011, I do have to respond to the member for Moncrieff's opening remarks. I find it quite extraordinary that anybody would question the Labor government's commitment to retirement incomes. After all, it was Labor that fought so hard through those very difficult reform years back in the eighties and nineties to make super available to the general population and then to increase it to nine per cent. That was not a simple reform. It was perhaps one of the hardest reforms we have seen a government undertake for many years. It is the Labor government now that is committed to increasing super contributions to 12 per cent. I note the remarks by the member for Moncrieff about the cost of living. To say that working with an inflation rate in the band recommended by the Reserve Bank is the most outrageous increase in the cost of living in human memory, or he said something similar, is quite an extraordinary statement. Perhaps he should have a closer look at the real economic figures and pay a little less attention to his fantasy life.


There is a third element to retirement incomes and that, of course, is jobs. Perhaps it is the most important one because, without a job, you do not have much of a chance of accumulating retirement income at all. We have seen an opposition that has not supported this government's very strong commitment to retaining jobs and growing jobs. Through the global economic crisis, when this government put forward a stimulus package specifically designed to ensure that as many Australians as possible kept their jobs while the rest of the world were shedding theirs, we did not see support from the opposition. We have not seen support from the opposition for programs that strengthen the car industry in Australia, an incredibly important area of the Australian economy that not just keeps many tens of thousands of people employed but provides the skill base that flows through other manufacturing sectors. Similarly we have not seen support from the opposition for the aluminium industry, an extremely important part of our economy. So I would suggest to the member for Moncrieff that perhaps he could rethink some of his comments. I doubt that he will. I think that, again, the fantasy world he lives in is a far more interesting one for members of the opposition than reality. It was an unfortunate and rather misleading contribution.


Now back to the fun bit: the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011, which is so interesting that they even have the date in it twice. They always do and I cannot quite figure that one out, but I am sure the guys from Treasury will one day explain to me why all the tax laws have the date twice. There are six schedules in this bill. Schedule 1 is about portability of superannuation. We heard one of the earlier speakers talk at length about this. It is a particularly interesting area. At the moment, we all know that there are many Australians who have lost touch with their superannuation or their superannuation has lost touch with them—one way or the other. In other words, there is money out there that belongs to them but is, essentially, out of their grasp. The government has already created some easier pathways for people to find their super through the lost super website. In my electorate we have already been out with mobile offices all over the electorate, encouraging people to come in and logon and try to find their lost super. If you ever have tried to consolidate your superannuation, if you are a normal person in the street who does not follow these things closely, it becomes quite a complicated process.


Schedule 1 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997—two fine bills—to enable certain superannuation fund members to electronically request the consolidation of their superannuation benefits through the ATO. It is referred to as the electronic portability form. Essentially it means that it will be much easier, through a phone call to the ATO and then logging on to an ATO website, to have their lost superannuation funds consolidated through the ATO.


It is quite a clever little device. It makes it much simpler and easier for lost superannuation fund members to consolidate their benefits. Essentially, that helps people to reduce the fees they pay on multiple accounts and to maximise their retirement benefits. Again, this is a seemingly quite simple improvement but it is one that reflects a longstanding commitment of this government to the development of the retirement incomes of everyday Australians. This measure was supported by both the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia.


Schedule 2 makes improvement to the capital gains tax law to make it easier for businesses to restructure. Under current law, taxpayers can obtain the capital gains tax rollover for a capital gain or loss that arises from their interest in a company or a trust because of the demerger of an entity from the group of which the company or trust is the head entity. However, this is not available where the head entity is a corporation sole or complying superannuation entity and schedule 2.2 of the bill makes the situation more consistent, making the rollover available for both of those types of bodies. It removes barriers to business restructures of a certain type by broadening access to various CGT rollovers. The changes are absolutely consistent with the government's long-term objective of promoting flexibility for business. Once again, this is a small change that reflects an attitude in a broad policy area that this government has been working on now for nearly four years.


Schedule 3 concerns the GST financial supply provisions. It reduces compliance costs for small businesses by increasing the financial acquisitions threshold from $50,000 to $150,000. If a small business makes a financial acquisition below this amount it falls outside the financial supply regime and can claim input tax credits for its financial supplies. Increasing the threshold takes more small businesses outside of the financial supply regime. Many small businesses in my area will think that a very fine thing. The bill implements three of the seven recommendations agreed to by the government arising out of the Treasury's review of the GST financial supply provisions.


Something interesting that this bill does is amend the GST treatment of hire purchase, again something that is going to benefit a large number of small businesses in my electorate and around the country. There are two current credit arrangements, hire purchase and chattel mortgage. They have very similar credit arrangements. But they have very important differences which carry through to their tax treatment. In both cases, essentially the purchaser obtains the use of the asset upfront in return for a series of payments made in instalments. In hire purchase, ownership does not transfer until the final payment. In chattel mortgage, ownership transfers upfront.


All else being equal, hire purchase is usually preferred over chattel mortgage. Chattel mortgage has an increased risk for the lender because the title has already changed hands and if there is a default repossession is difficult and may not be possible. Hire purchase is far less costly to implement in terms of legal fees and stamp duties. You would normally expect to see, particularly in the small business area, hire purchase being used to a far greater extent than chattel mortgage. That is not the case in Australia since the introduction of the GST. In fact, since the GST was introduced chattel mortgage has largely replaced the use of hire purchase in small businesses, even though chattel mortgage is more expensive, more complex and involves greater risk for the finance company.


The reason for that is because the GST operates differently for the two systems, particularly if the small business runs its accounts on a cash basis. Small businesses with an annual GST turnover of less than $2 million can account for GST on a cash basis, whereas larger business must account on an accrual basis. Cash accounting is simpler and reduces compliance costs, which is why small businesses like it. But the tax effect is that the larger firms account for their GST liability and input tax credits for hire purchase agreements upfront whereas small businesses that account for GST with cash account for it when each payment is made.


Under this amendment, the treatment of GST for small businesses that account on a cash basis becomes the same as that for larger companies. That will result in a significant cash flow benefit for small businesses compared to the current situation. Again, that is something that appears to be quite a small change but it will reduce the compliance costs, the administrative burden and the risk for many businesses in Australia—quite a nice little change.


Schedule 4 involves the GST treatment of new residential premises. The amendments will essentially reverse the effect of the court case involving Gloxinia Investments, which found that, where a particular combination of strata titles and leases were involved, newly constructed residential premises were not subject to GST. The bill reaffirms the policy intent that newly constructed homes should be subject to GST and will also protect the revenue that funds government services that assist the whole of the community. The measure will ensure that GST is payable on the full value added to newly constructed residential premises by developers and builders. This is achieved by ensuring that GST is applied to the retail sale of new residential premises to homeowners and investors, as well as the wholesale supply of the premises to the developer or builder. Schedule 5 I am only going to speak about very briefly. It involves tax deductible recipients. Under the current law, taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for certain gifts to organisations with deductible gift recipient status. This amendment lists donations to the Rhodes Trust Australia appeal to be claimed as a tax deduction. This is a fairly routine amendment, unless you happen to be the Rhodes Trust Australia or you happen to want to donate to them. It is a very good outcome for the Rhodes Trust.


There are a number of miscellaneous amendments in schedule 6 that I will not go into. They are mainly quite administrative—too administrative even for a person who loves tax or amendments. Again, it is a rather nice little collection of amendments that reduce complexity for small business, clarify tax law and have benefits for cash-flow management for small business. I commend the bill to the House.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (16:36):  Before I address the issues before us I will pick up on a couple of the issues raised by my good friend the member for Parramatta. The member for Parramatta spoke briefly about cost-of-living pressures. I am on record as saying that my electorate of Wright is one of the weathervanes of the nation. I have no linkages into the resources sector whatsoever, so my hypothesis is that it is only a matter of time before the pain we feel at the moment flows through to the rest of the market. I reassure my colleagues that the cost-of-living pressures that are out there at the moment are absolutely horrendous, and for this government to be dismissive of the idea that those pressures exist in my electorate is uncalled for.


The member for Parramatta went on to criticise the coalition for not giving support to the car industry or the aluminium sector. Today I had the opportunity to read a couple of documents. I was trying to get my head around this whole car industry manufacturing process. I read some comments from a Holden executive. He had some scathing comments, saying that up to a third of his workforce struggled to roll up to work, for one reason or another. He said his ability to respond to that was hampered by union intervention. He went on to speak about the lack of efficiency in the car industry. That is one argument, but I will put that aside for a moment. I do acknowledge the impact of the increase in the Australian dollar on the industry. That has an impact on anyone who is trying to export products out of this country.



We have a car manufacturing industry which is non-productive, so the government is throwing some subsidies at it to try and get them over the line. In addition, the government is then going to put its hand in its other pocket for the car industry—between 2012 and 2020, carbon credit payments to the car industry alone will be in the vicinity of $450 million. Notwithstanding that, in 2012, in the year that the carbon tax is introduced, for Alcoa, which has two sites, that payment will be $40 million, and it will increase exponentially as the carbon price of $23 per tonne increases. I thought I would put that on the table. I would be quite happy to take it up with the member for Parramatta at a later stage. It just bewilders me when we talk about supporting an industry on the one hand and then the government puts its hand into the pocket of the same organisation and calls it support.


The Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011 makes the following changes to the taxation laws. It allows certain superannuation fund members to electronically request consolidation of their super funds through the Australian Taxation Office. It allows entities in a restructure to use shares or interest sales facilities without failing a requirement of certain capital gains tax rollovers. It provides capital gains tax demerger relief. It expands capital gains tax rollovers to entities changing their incorporation. It implements aspects of the Treasury's review of the GST financial supply provision. Additionally, it clarifies the GST treatment of new residential premises, adds the Rhodes Trust to the deductible gift recipients list and, finally, makes other minor and technical changes.


In Schedule 1 it allows certain superannuation fund members with lost super to more easily consolidate their funds through the use of one or more electronic portable forms. The form is submitted electronically at the ATO, which can then verify the status of lost money and the eligibility of the nominated receiving account. The coalition believes this to be a sensible initiative to streamline the process of re-uniting lost super funds with their owners. There would not be too many people in this room who, before either entering politics or working in the government, did not have some other forms of employment. In particular, our youth below the age of 25 change their jobs often. It used to be that we had five major career changes in our life. People below the age of 25 are already up to their third career change. They are not staying in the workforce as long as our fathers did. As a result this measure makes it easier for those people who have chopped and changed jobs to get access to their superannuation.


While we are on the issue of superannuation: the member for Blair spoke about the increase of super contributions from nine to 12 per cent. The government take the position that this is a wonderful initiative that they are putting in place. When I speak to my businesses they are horrified because they cannot see where the relief from the federal government is coming from to assist them with the increase in super from nine to 12 per cent. Yes, there is a one per cent reduction in their company tax rate from 30 to 29 per cent but, even when questioned in estimates, the Real Estate Institute of Australia indicated that the three per cent increase in superannuation contribution by the businessperson, by the small mum and dad, was not going to be covered by the one per cent. You cannot have your cake and eat it too. You cannot call this a Labor initiative and say that you are out there helping business when really, at face value, you are again putting your hands into the pockets of businesspeople, mums and dads, who are trying to employ people and you are asking them to pay for the increased contribution.


Part 2 of the schedule is about the share sales facilities. These are entities used in dealing with foreign interests during the sale or restructuring of a company. The foreign interest holds ownership and transfers to the share sales facility, which deals with the holdings during the sale or the restructure and then returns the cash or the new assets for the foreign interest holder. The share sales facility is primarily used to avoid complex foreign tax laws and unintended taxation consequences in restructuring companies. The existing owners are given significant capital gains rollover relief where a structure results in those owners holding substantially the same interest in the new entity. However, where there is a sale facility that is required to be used, the CGT rollover is not available to the foreign interest holders because the actual sale or the restructure was completed by the facility rather than by the foreign interest holder. This has acted as an impediment to restructuring and what would otherwise have been of benefit to the company and its shareholders. The change in this bill will allow foreign interest holders, who are otherwise eligible for capital gains rollover, to relief. With the restructure of the company, where the share sale facility has been used to effect the actual restructure, the law will treat the share sale facility to track the actual ownership before and after the restructure.


Under the capital gains tax demerger relief in schedule 2, part II, taxpayers can choose to obtain a capital gains tax rollover for a capital gain or capital loss that arises in their interest as a company or trust, because of the demerger of an entity from the group of companies. This is not a bad one. Basically, when you speak about a merger, you have two entities that may have separate assets but for argument's sake may have a combined balance sheet. When those companies decide to demerger it allows ease for the capturing of the capital gain. It is not susceptible at that point. The main part of the business that is retaining the assets does not have a huge bill as part of their operational cost. That one does make sense.


Schedule 2, part III, 'Capital gains tax business restructures', will allow the Indigenous bodies to incorporate under the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 without immediate capital gains tax consequences for the body members. As part of the Economics Committee we last year toddled up to the north of Queensland and caught up with a number of Aboriginal communities. It is hard to get them all in the one spot at the one time. They have different asset groups. This bill did not come as a result of that trip but I can assure you that this part of the legislation will assist those communities in trying to be more of a united front with reference to how they present themselves as a community. There is resistance in the north for that to happen at this point in time. There are some significant assets held by different communities and under the current taxation rulings transferring assets from one body to another does include some capital gain. This gives the capacity to merge those assets without any unintended consequences.


Schedule 3, the GST financial supply provision, increases the first limb of the financial acquisition threshold from $50,000 to $150,000. This increases the dollar value of the tax input credits available for acquisitions related to the making of financial supplies. The schedule includes financial supplies consisting of borrowings that are made through a provision of the deposit account from an ADI and the current concession for borrowing. The schedule allows taxpayers who account on a cash basis to claim input tax credits for acquisitions made under a hire purchase agreement upfront. This removes the distortion that currently exists between hire purchase and other forms of financing. Predominantly it is just the difference between a chattel mortgage and an HP. One of them provides you with access to draw back down after your first payment—your GST credit. Small businesses often use that as cash flow to pump back through the business. It is a bit of a false economy because you are virtually still financing your business on borrowed coin, and there is a cost associated with it. I assumed they looked at this because of title or the ownership of a lease—whether it be a truck or any type of unit such as that. If title is with the business holder then there is the capacity for depreciation to be claimed back immediately. If it is with HP or a lease, title remains with the financier and those incentives are not available.


Schedule 4, the GST treatment of new residential premises, seeks to ensure that the sales of long-term leases of new residential premises by a registered entity are a taxable supply, subject to the GST at the time of sale. For that sale—or long-term lease for residential premises, other than new residential premises—input tax applies and it is therefore not subject to GST at the time of the sale under the goods and services tax. The changes clarify the intent of the law after the full Federal Court's decision in Commissioner of Taxation versus Gloxinia Investments (Trustee), which found that the sale of the new residential premises using a development lease arrangement should be treated as input tax. This is not subject to GST. These outcomes are contrary to the general policy intent in relation to the taxation of property under the GST Act.


Schedule 5 speaks about the adding of the Rhodes Trust to the list of deductible gift recipients. The Rhodes Trust raises funds to augment the existing Rhodes Scholarship Program at Oxford. All monies are used to provide scholarships to Australians to study at Oxford University. The member for Parramatta also said that basically any donation that is given to that trust becomes tax deductable under the bill, and that is a good thing. Schedule 6 is just a rats and mice one—miscellaneous amendments to the tax laws.


The bill makes technical corrections and other minor and miscellaneous amendments to the taxation laws. The coalition sees no serious issues with this legislation and does not intend to oppose it. I believe the provisions of the bill are to be applied as of 1 July 2012, and I am pleased to associate myself with the bill.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:51):  It is my pleasure to rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011. I am reliably informed by the office of the Assistant Treasurer that I now hold the record amongst government backbenchers for speeches on TLABs, a record that I suspect only I in this place would be proud to hold.


The bill before the House is non-controversial. As previous members have noted, it contains six schedules enabling superannuation fund members to request the consolidation of their benefits; amending CGT provisions to make it easier for businesses to restructure; implementing a number of the recommendations out of Treasury's review of the GST financial supply provisions; ensuring that sales or long-term leases of new residential premises are taxable supplies and that sales or long-term leases of existing residential premises are input tax supplies; adding the Rhodes Trust to the tax act; and making a number of what the previous speaker described as 'rats and mice' amendments.


Despite this, the coalition referred the bill to the House of Representatives Economics Committee. It was our not unpleasant duty to inquire into the bill—an inquiry which ultimately produced a report supported by coalition and Labor members. But it did raise in my mind the question as to why the coalition thought it was worth the House Economics Committee spending time on this rather than, for example, conducting inquiries into other questions such as the strong status of the Australian economy relative to other nations, boosting innovation in Australia and the importance of good economic management over fear mongering.


I would like to place on record the coalition's somewhat odd behaviour now when it comes to referring legislation to the House Economics Committee. As the chair, the member for Parramatta, told the main chamber earlier today, the House has discharged a reference of the appropriations bills—a particularly bizarre reference given that one would think that a government needs to appropriate money to conduct its business. It was in fact difficult for us to see how you would even begin to conduct an inquiry into the appropriations bills—but that was what those opposite wanted us to do. Naturally, the House Economics Committee have refused that reference. It is again just an indication of the general disarray of those opposite when it comes to economic management.


Over the weekend Laurie Oakes wrote in his column that the reason that there have been so many estimates as to how large the opposition's budget black hole is is that the member for North Sydney does not trust his colleagues. So, in order to work out which of them is leaking, he gave each of them verbally a different number for the size of the opposition's black hole—a cunning trick. He laid carefully a trap for his colleagues to fall into and then waited to see which number would emerge in the public domain. A number did very clearly emerge in the public domain. The opposition finance spokesperson came straight out and said, 'The number is $70 billion.' It explains something many of us have been wondering about, which was why the member for Goldstein was so confident about his $70 billion estimate and why the member for North Sydney was saying, 'It could be in a range; it could be $50 billion, $60 billion of $70 billion.' That is because the member for Goldstein had a precise figure which he was given not realising the trap he was about to fall into.


While those opposite are busy laying traps for their colleagues to fall into, we on this side of the House are focused on good economic management. We have a resilient economy with three-quarters of a million jobs created since Labor came to office. We are putting in place record investments in roads, doubling the road budget. We are increasing the rail budget tenfold and investing more in urban public transport than every federal government since Federation. At the same time we are putting in place a price on carbon pollution—an essential economic reform if we are to modernise our economy and create the green jobs of the future.


The choice is not between a carbon price and no carbon price. All those who look at the problem seriously know that the choice is between a carbon price now and a carbon price later, which will be more costly because the changes will be more gut-wrenching. Those opposite are in disarray when it comes to returning the budget to surplus and they are in disarray on just about every fundamental economic question one can point to. Former Liberal boss John Hewson has said the opposition leader is 'one of the most negative people I know' on economic and political issues.


Those opposite supported a recommendation that we have an independent parliamentary budget office. The member for Higgins was on the committee which unanimously recommended a parliamentary budget office, as was Senator Joyce. But, when it came to the House and the opposition realised the magnitude of the fiscal task which lay before them, they opposed a parliamentary budget office. They now say that they will not put their costings to be independently verified by a parliamentary budget office but will again use private accountants—private accountants who were, in the 2010 election, fined for their behaviour in looking into the opposition's costings.


We speak about a $70 billion black hole in the costings of those opposite but really we should be speaking about $70 billion of hidden cuts. That $70 billion is equivalent to stopping Medicare payments for four years and stopping the age pension for two years; it means cutting deeply into hospital spending and education and not investing in the future. In my electorate of Fraser it is already clear that one of the ways in which the opposition seeks to meet their massive fiscal target is to cut 12,000 jobs. The member for North Sydney has proudly spoken about making 12,000 Canberra public servants redundant. None of my constituents would have pride in that. Those opposite have said that they want to get rid of the Department of Climate Change. The member for North Sydney told Q&A last Monday that he does not know what public servants in the Department of Health and Ageing do. I might suggest he ask his leader who was, after all, the Minister for Health and Ageing under the Howard government when the Department of Health and Ageing employed about as many people as it does today.


On this side of the House, we are committed to keeping taxes as low as possible. Taxation as a proportion of the economy is lower now than it was under John Howard. The tax to GDP ratio was 23.7 per cent when Labor came to office; now it is 21.2 per cent. Our jobless rate has risen due to the global financial crisis but it has risen by only 0.7 per cent since Labor came to power. Compare that to a rise of 3.1 per cent in Britain and 3.6 per cent in the United States. The opposition's approach to the economic debate is all care and no responsibility. Those opposite would have thrown us into deep debt when the global financial crisis struck. We on this side of the House saved 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses from going to the wall. When it comes to taxes, we have put in place income tax cuts and we are delivering pension rises and tax cuts under the clean energy future package from 1 July this year. Under those opposite the only people who would get tax cuts are the big miners and the big polluters. When it comes to the surplus, we will return the budget to surplus in fiscal year 2012-13. Those opposite have a dozen positions on the surplus. They have no consistency on their economic message.


Finally, Deputy Speaker—and may I congratulate you on your ascension to the role—I want to address an issue raised by the member for Wright over the cost of living. We in this country have a metric for the cost of living. It is not the amount of hot air that comes out of the Leader of the Opposition's mouth; it is the inflation rate. The inflation rate now is lower than when Labor came to office. The inflation rate is stable under Labor and we are proud on this side of the House to have ensured price stability. Many things have in fact fallen in price over the last year. Among the categories of things for which prices are cheaper than they were a year ago are bread, milk, shoes, appliances, pharmaceuticals, cars, computers and toys.




Mr Buchholz:
  Thank God for that. I can go back to my electorate and tell them that.




Dr LEIGH:
  Do go back and tell your electorate, member for Wright. I would be very happy if you were to have an honest discussion with your electors about the cost of living—not the fearmongering that we have seen so often from your side of politics but some direct, fact based discussion. I know those opposite do not like dealing in facts. They would prefer to speak about towns being wiped off the map—




Mr Buchholz:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, my point of order goes to relevance. We are seven minutes in and not once have I heard the member who is your gun—the government's gun—on the TLAB actually address TLAB No.9. You have got to get close to it soon.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Symon
):  The member for Fraser will address his remarks to the bill.




Dr LEIGH:
  I shall, and I hope you do not take the reflection on the chair that the member for Wright has issued there.


This is a fundamental piece of economic legislation that underpins the Gillard government's commitment to a strong economy. Under us income taxes are lower than when we came to office. Inflation is lower than when we came to office. Interest rates are lower than when we came to office. A family with a $300,000 mortgage is saving $3,000 a year thanks to lower interest rates under the Gillard government. I commend the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) 2011 Bill to the House. It a small piece to be sure but an important piece of the long-term economic reform that we on this side of the House are putting into place.


Let me conclude with the words of a constituent who came and saw me in the mobile office that I attended on Saturday at the National Multicultural Festival. He said to me: 'When you look out across all the people at this festival probably almost none of us will still be here in 80 years time, but our children and grandchildren will be here and the reforms we are putting into place are ensuring that their prosperity is upheld. Yes, they are good for the current generations but they are recognising that in politics we do what we can for the future. We are not here just to scaremonger.' He said: 'You should see through what Mr Abbott is proposing. You should see out his negativity and you should see him out of politics, because what is important is the future prosperity of all Australians.' I commend the bill to the House.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:04):  It is a pleasure to follow my friend the member for Fraser in this important debate about tax. It is also a debate about the legislation that is necessary to manage our economy, to balance our budget and to ensure not only that we have the revenue stream to ensure that government activity is sustained now and into the future but that our tax system regulates economic and personal activity in a way that is in the national interest. With that in mind, and adding that the minister is in the chamber, which is always a certain sign that the debate is going to wrap up at any time soon, I will restrict my comments to something that is very close to my heart, which is the issue of superannuation. The first schedule to this bill goes to the issue of superannuation and assisting people who have money in superannuation accounts to consolidate those funds.


It is a part of a Labor project. It was Labor that brought occupational superannuation into this parliament through the Hawke-Keating government in the late 1980s. It was Labor that saw the establishment of industry funds as the mainstay of workers' superannuation savings in this country. It is Labor that has ensured that we have a direct employee say in the management of those superannuation funds because we believe quite simply in worker capital. We believe that, if workers are putting literally hundreds of thousands of dollars into a savings vehicle for their retirement, then they should have some say in the management of those savings.


It is Labor that saw the shift in the superannuation employer contribution to employee superannuation from three per cent to nine per cent. And it will be Labor, against the fierce opposition of the member for Wright, and those who he sits in the chamber with, who will see the move in occupational superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This is all a part of Labor's project to ensure that, when workers retire, they have the dignity of a nest egg, a retirement egg.


Schedule 1 to this piece of legislation goes to that long-term project. It will enable the Australian Taxation Office to operate a scheme that will make it easier and simpler for lost superannuation fund members and retirement savings account holders to consolidate their benefits. We are not talking about small beer here. There is approximately $12.9 billion in lost superannuation that is unclaimed or is in unallocated superannuation accounts in this country today. It is $12.9 billion that belongs to somebody but is not yet allocated.


These measures are yet another step in the Labor project of ensuring that when workers earn their superannuation it goes into a well-managed fund and, when it goes into a well-managed fund, it ends up in their retirement savings account. It does this by amending the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 to enable certain superannuation fund members to simply electronically request the consolidation of their superannuation benefits through the Australian Taxation Office.


The scheme is going to be referred to as the Electronic Portability Form. The Electronic Portability Form will make it simpler and easier for lost superannuation fund members to consolidate their benefits. This, in turn, will reduce the fees paid on multiple accounts and will maximise members' retirement benefits. The Electronic Portability Form will allow lost superannuation fund members to electronically request the transfer of their benefits to their active accounts through a portal on the ATO website.


This means a lot to ordinary working families in my electorate of Throsby in the Illawarra and Southern Highlands. It means a lot to them because we have quite a high incidence of casual, part-time and seasonal workers. They are people who do not have the traditional pattern of employment where they will work from the beginning of their employment life until the day that they retire with one employer. It is quite likely that workers in my electorate may during the course of any one year have three or four employers, which is a series of employers throughout the course of a year or a series of employers at any one point in time. As they move from employer to employer and from job to job and, indeed, often from home to home, their superannuation accounts could get lost in that process.


I commend the minister for bringing this bill before the House, and I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the matter. As I said, it is a part of an important Labor project. At the heart of that important Labor project is this simple idea: if somebody works their entire life then they are entitled to a dignified retirement, not one that is reliant upon a pension and the vagaries of government decision making in relation to that pension. They are entitled to retire on the savings income that they have earned for their entire life. This bill is going to do its bit to ensure that $12.9 billion finds its rightful owners. I commend the bill to the House.

):


I thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011. I wish to acknowledge those members whose contributions I have witnessed in the time that I have been here in the chamber—in particular, the members for Parramatta, Fraser and Throsby. I also acknowledge the contribution of the member for Wright. I thank him for his support of the bill and also for livening up the debate—even if that was with some rather misguided comments.





Schedule 1 of the bill allows regulations to prescribe the operating details of a scheme that allows the ATO to assist lost superannuation fund members to electronically consolidate their benefits. Lost members will be able to visit the ATO website, fill in a form online and submit it electronically to the ATO. The ATO will conduct verification processes and, if they are successful, they will send the form to the fund which reported the member as lost. This process will make it simpler and easier for people to claim their lost super. By consolidating their accounts, members will reduce the fees that they pay on multiple accounts and maximise their benefits on retirement.





Schedule 2 broadens access to certain CGT rollovers to make it easier for businesses to restructure. These changes provide greater flexibility for entities that convert from a body to an incorporated company, entities that use a share or sale interest facility for foreign interest holders in a restructure, and demerger groups that include corporations sole or complying superannuation entities.





Schedule 3 implements three of the recommendations agreed to by the government arising out of the Treasury's review of the GST financial supply provisions. The remaining measures require amendments to the GST regulations. This schedule amends the GST law to increase the first limb of the financial acquisition threshold from $50,000 to $150,000
,
 to exclude financial supplies consisting of a borrowing made through the provision of deposit accounts by an Australian authorised deposit-taking institution from the current concession for borrowings and to allow taxpayers who account on a cash basis to claim input tax credits for acquisitions made under hire purchase agreements upfront. The amendments will reduce compliance costs for businesses by reducing the number of businesses that are prevented from claiming input tax credits on acquisitions that relate to making financial supplies, removing the distortion between hire purchase and other forms of financing for cash based taxpayers, and ensuring that hire purchase agreements are treated the same regardless of whether taxpayers account on a cash basis or a non-cash basis. The amendments will also better target the borrowing exemptions to reflect the policy intent by no longer providing access to input tax credits for expenses related to borrowings in the form of deposit accounts provided by Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions.





The amendments in schedule 4 deal with the new residential premises provision and will ensure GST is payable on the full value added to newly constructed residential premises by developers and builders. This is achieved by ensuring GST is applied to the retail sale of new residential premises to home owners and investors as well as the wholesale supply of the premises to the developer or builder.




Schedule 5 amends the deductible gift recipient provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. Schedule 5 adds one new organisation to the act—namely, the Rhodes Trust in 
Australia. Making this organisation a DGR will assist it to attract public support for its activities. This schedule also recognises the name change of Playgroup Australia Inc. to Playgroup Australia Ltd. Finally, schedule 6 covers miscellaneous and technical amendments to the tax laws. These amendments are part of the government's commitment to the care and maintenance of the tax law and include some legislative issues raised by the public through the Tax Issues Entry System, or TIES for short. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:00):  On behalf of the opposition it is my pleasure to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill, and I indicate at the outset that the coalition will be supporting this legislation. Like all tax law amendment bills it deals with a number of substantive taxation issues, which I am going to run through fairly briefly. Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, you can probably tell I am losing my voice, albeit slowly, but I hope it lasts the rest of the week. I have picked up whatever it is my three-year-old son, Angus, has. I think you would agree it would be less than efficient for me to lose my voice on something we all agree on at the start of a sitting week.


This bill deals with some changes to superannuation, some changes to capital gains tax and some changes to GST. It adds to the deductible gift recipient list and, finally, as is nearly always the case, it corrects some unintended errors and makes some tidying up provisions within the tax law generally. Very briefly, as we know this legislation was introduced late last year on 23 November by the then Assistant Treasurer, Mr Shorten. He outlined in some detail in the second reading speech the changes and the reasons for those changes with respect to superannuation.


Schedule 1 will allow certain superannuation fund members with lost super to more easily consolidate their funds through the use of an electronic portability form. It is outlined both in the second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum how that will operate, and we regard this as a sensible initiative. Schedule 2 in three parts deals with capital gains tax. The essence of those changes is to allow entities in a restructure to use share-of-interest sale facilities without failing a requirement of certain capital gains tax rollovers. Also, as is pointed out, it provides capital gains tax demerger relief and there is also a provision to expand capital gains tax rollover to entities changing their incorporation.


With respect to the goods and services tax, the bill outlines two things with respect to GST. It implements some aspects of the Treasury review of the GST of financial supply provisions. It is pointed out that some of the changes can be dealt with in this bill and some can be dealt with by way of regulation. I understand that my friend and colleague the member for Blair, who follows these tax law amendment bills, I am sure, will be across this issue in some detail. Also in a separate section the bill clarifies the GST treatment of new residential premises. Without going into all the details it is another case where, I think, the member for Blair will confirm legislation is required to confirm the original intent of the GST legislation, in this case, following a court decision.


Finally, schedule 5 adds the Rhodes Trust to the deductible gift recipient list. Of course the Rhodes Trust raises funds to augment the existing Rhodes Scholarship program at Oxford. I also noticed from the then Assistant Treasurer's second reading speech that there is also a name change to another organisation. As I said at the start, schedule 6 deals with some miscellaneous amendments to correct some unintended errors with some technical corrections. On behalf of the opposition I commend the bill to House. As I said at the outset, we will be supporting this bill through both houses.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:05):  I speak in support of this TLAB legislation, the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011. This bill, like all bills that amend the tax laws in an omnibus way, does it by way of schedule. I want to focus particularly on schedule 1, which is the portability of superannuation and the implications there. By way of an example, I will describe my own electorate and how changes being made to superannuation will have an impact there.


Firstly, I will briefly go through the other aspects of the bill. Schedule 2 is part of the 2010-11 budget, where we announced that we were amending the capital gains tax provisions to make it easier for businesses to restructure. There are a number of provisions here. This amendment talks about certain business structures and broadening access to CGT rollovers. This is consistent with our commitment to streamline business to make it more flexible so that it can operate in a way that is not governed by regulation and the tax laws do not impinge in an adverse way. It extends the CGT rollover for the conversion of a body to an incorporated company—and that often happens. It is often the case that businesses change the way they are structured. That is a sensible provision. It broadens the range of CGT rollovers where entities can use a share or interest sale facility for foreign residents in a restructure and allows the CGT demerger relief for demerger groups that include corporations sole or complying superannuation entities which cannot access the relief. It is a sensible arrangement and really is good public policy.


Schedule 3 provides for the CGT financial supply provisions. It increases the first limb of the financial acquisition threshold from $50,000 to $150,000. The purpose of that is to follow recommendations that were made in the Treasury's review of the CGT financial supply provisions to make sure that we can take businesses out of the system. It means that we are excluding financial suppliers consisting of borrowings made through the provisions of a deposit account by Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions from the current concession for borrowings; and allows the taxpayer who accounts on a cash basis to treat an acquisition made under a hire  purchase agreement as though they did an account on a cash basis.


The next provision I want to deal with is the CGT treatment for new residential purposes. This corrects an error made, I think in a court, in the case Commissioner of Taxation v Gloxinia Investments. This decision found that a sale of certain residential premises to owner-occupier investors was actually an input tax—which is a strange way of thinking about it—rather than taxable. I had a bit of a look at that. I do not profess to be an expert on tax, but I thought it was a very strange decision. The schedule amends what we call the GST act—or, to use its full title, A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999—providing that a wholesale supply of residential premises is disregarded in certain circumstances for the purposes of determining whether a subsequent supply of a premise is the supply of new residential premise and thus taxable. There are additional changes that are made, but I will not go through them now.


The listing of deductible gift recipient status is also covered. A number of people on both sides of the political aisle have had the benefit of Rhodes scholarships. I understand the Leader of the Opposition was one. My good friend—and I was his campaign director—former Queensland Treasurer the Hon. David Hamill was also a Rhodes scholar. So we are listing here the Rhodes Trust in Australia to allow Australians who donate to the appeal to claim a deduction for the donation. There are some other miscellaneous changes, which I will not go into.


Schedule 1 is what I really want to focus on, because it is part of the package of superannuation that will make a difference, particularly in my electorate. As we know, a lot of people lose their super. By that, I do not mean that they put it away under the bed and cannot find it; they actually lose their super because they chop and change the businesses they work for. Then they forget they have it or they do not know about it and it is not pressing on their minds. The Australian Taxation Office runs a system that makes it easier and simpler for superannuation members and retirement savings account holders to consolidate their benefits. This scheme will introduce an electronic portability form that will make it easier for account holders and fund members to report funds as lost.


Just to show how significant lost superannuation is, at 30 June 2010 there were about 5.8 million lost superannuation accounts in Australia, with an accumulated balance of $18.8 billion. The then Assistant Treasurer in his second reading speech on this bill, on 23 November 2011, made the point that by 30 June 2011—a year later—that balance had increased to $20.2 billion. We just cannot keep going like that; that is money that belongs to Australians and that will help them in their retirement.


In my electorate alone, which covers the majority of Ipswich and the Somerset region, there is about $80 million waiting to be found by residents. That is according to the Australian Taxation Office. There are about 21,500 accounts that are, effectively, lost. I urge all residents in my electorate to use the SuperSeeker hotline during business hours—132 865—or go to the ATO superannuation website, www.ato.gov.au/super, because this is money that can be used. We are talking about lots of money. The average amount of lost super is about $3,500, invested over a 20-year period that would equate to about $12,500 that could be spent in retirement. That is a lot of money that could go towards a holiday after many years of work; that could go towards the purchase of a new car that someone might need in their retirement—it might be the last good car they actually buy; or that might be extra money spent for grandkids. It is a lot of money. So helping people find their lost superannuation is an important thing.


We on this side are very committed to making sure that people live in dignity and have financial security in retirement. That is why we are increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr NEUMANN:
  I notice that those opposite have, of course, not supported that. That is a sad thing, because we are talking about a 30-year-old person having $108,000 more in superannuation when they retire. Just for the benefit of the member for Moncrieff, who is in the chamber, 43,500 people in my electorate will benefit from the increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine percent to 12 percent. I daresay that a similar number of people in his electorate will benefit. It is tragic that he did not support that legislation.


In March 2011, there was $1.36 trillion invested in superannuation. The market fluctuates, we know, but over the long term superannuation has delivered a very healthy return for investors and for Australians. That is a creation of a federal Labor government, because it is only we on this side of the chamber who are committed to doing that.


Increasing compulsory superannuation will benefit the retirement savings of all Australians. We think that is a particularly important thing, just as we think about the reforms associated with that legislation, like benefiting the 10,700 small businesses in my electorate that will benefit from the cut in the company tax rate. So there are a lot of important things that we are doing: superannuation, in terms of low-income earners—23,600 residents in Blair will get extra superannuation contributions. This government is adding to the superannuation nest eggs of people in my community as well as across the country. Schedule 1 of this legislation is about making sure that the people of Blair, and the people of Australia, get the benefit of the portability of superannuation, making sure they do not lose their superannuation, making sure they live their retirement with dignity and respect.


We are committed, on this side of the chamber, to high-skilled, good wages. And we are committed on this side of the chamber to small business. We are committed by reducing the company tax rate. We are committed by investing in infrastructure, in skills and in training. We have done that; those opposite have not.


It is almost a road to Damascus conversion experience from those opposite—actually now supporting good pieces of legislation, reforming the tax system and reforming superannuation. And if, like Saint Paul on the road to Damascus, this is when they have seen the light, we are very pleased and we support the legislation.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (16:15):  I am pleased to rise in particular to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011—and follow the member for Blair, who I see racing from the chamber now! Can I just say, it was entertaining, to say the least, to hear the member for Blair provide as part of his contribution on this debate some attempt to draw a linkage between the so-called vision of this Labor government and what it means for the retirement incomes of Australia's working people.


Madam Deputy Speaker, at first blush, if you only listen to the member for Blair's contribution in isolation, you might think he had a point to make. You might actually think that Labor was concerned, through an increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, in providing for retirement of Australians into the future. The problem is, though, that this government's exceptionally poor track record does not match the rhetoric. The problem is that the bill before the House certainly contains beneficial initiatives—and that is why the coalition is supporting this bill—but the simple reality is that the rhetoric we heard from the member for Blair is not matched by action. Whilst it is crucial that there are opportunities for people to find and recover lost superannuation—and, to the extent that schedule 1 of the bill deals with that, that is beneficial; and that is the reason why, once again, the coalition is supporting government policy that is good government policy. Contrary to frequent assertions by Labor members that this is a coalition that only ever says no, the truth is that that not the case, and that this is just another example of the way in which that coalition supports. The reason why we are accused of saying no too frequently is simply that this is a government that bowls up such bad policy on such a continuing and frequent basis. But I am pleased to say, in a spirit of bipartisanship, that on this occasion we can all be united in our love for the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011.


But I will deal specifically with the issue of providing for retirement. The member for Blair went to some length in crowing about the Labor Party's track record. I have to say, Madam Deputy Speaker, that when you actually consider the key drivers of the manner in which a person is able to live their retirement in a comfortable way, there are two factors at play. One is of course the accumulation of wealth over time, in a lump sum form, that sits in a superannuation fund. There is no doubt about that: it is a crucial factor. But, just as importantly, the cost of living, and the extent to which that impacts on the lump sum necessary at the commencement of someone's retirement, is equally of value. And it has been this Labor Party that has driven up the cost of living at a level that, frankly, is almost unprecedented.


It has been the policies of this government that have driven up the expenses that Australians have to pay in terms of just their ordinary lifestyles and going about paying for those ordinary things that we all consume, be it groceries, be it utilities, be it medical insurance. On each of these factors this is a government that has betrayed the confidence of Australia's so-called 'working families', as the Labor Party commonly refers to them, but more broadly than that, the community as a whole. We know that the price of utilities, to give but one example, has risen in excess of 10 per cent in the past 12 to 18 months. And it is further forecast, as of 1 July under the carbon tax, to go up an additional 10 per cent. The reason that is crucial—bringing it back to the subject matter of the debate—is that those expenses go to the core of how much someone must provision for their retirement. And the faster the cost of living increases, the more you need to provide for your retirement. That is just an inescapable reality, and the reason why this government is so big on rhetoric but so poor when it comes to follow-through. The rest of this bill is fairly pedestrian. Part 1 of schedule 2 deals with capital gains tax in business restructures and part 2 of schedule 2 deals with capital gains tax demerger relief. Part 3 of schedule 2 deals with restructures in terms of their impact on capital gains tax for Indigenous corporations. Schedule 3 deals with GST financial supply provisions. That perhaps has some impact on a number of my constituents on the Gold Coast. Under schedule 3 the first limb of the financial acquisition threshold will increase from $50,000 to $150,000, effectively increasing the dollar value of input tax credits available for acquisitions related to the making of financial supplies—a good initiative and one that the coalition supports. That is the reason we are supporting this bill.


Schedule 4, which deals with GST treatment of new residential premises, also has an impact in some respects on a number of operations that are undertaken in my electorate of Moncrieff on the Gold Coast. It effectively seeks to ensure that sales or long-term leases of new residential premises by a registered entity are taxable supplies subject to the GST at the time of sale and that sales or long-term leases of residential premises other than new residential premises are input taxed supplies and therefore not subject to the GST at the time or sale under the goods and services tax legislation. Effectively this serves to clarify the intent of the law after the recent Federal Court decision in Commissioner of Taxation v Gloxinia Investments (Trustee), in which it was found that the sale of new residential premises using a developmental lease arrangement should be treated as input taxed—that is, not be subject to the GST. These outcomes are contrary to the general policy intent in relation to the taxation of property under the GST act. That is why the changes are provided for in this legislation.


The member for Blair and others have spoken about the Rhodes Trust being added to the deductible gift recipient list. We know that DGR status, as it is commonly referred to, is an important tool that helps to drive donations in some of these charitable trusts. It is a way to ensure the gift becomes a tax deductible gift. For that reason the application of DGR status to the Rhodes Trust is obviously going to be beneficial, given it is great enabler for many young Australians to travel and study at Oxford University. Schedule 6 deals with a grab bag of various amendments to tax laws.


I am pleased to associate myself with the bill. It is a bill that will clarify a number of matters in relation to taxation. At the outset I addressed very directly some of the spurious assertions that were made by the member for Blair and corrected the record with respect to the fact that there is another side to that coin about providing for Australians' retirement incomes, and that is to control the cost of living.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (16:23): I am looking forward to speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No.9) Bill 2011. I have said in this place before that I quite like tax laws amendment bills. Some of my constituents have now found me out and approached me in the street and questioned my character over that, but I do admit it. Quite often in these bills that deal with so many aspects of other areas of policy in some ways you find the character of a government—you find the small details that put in place aspects of broader policy and you are reminded of policies that were implemented a year before that require a change to tax law. In this case, you find very real indications of the government's commitment to retirement income, to simplifying things for business and to clarifying and simplifying the law across a range of areas.


Before I get to the fun bit, which is the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No.9) Bill 2011, I do have to respond to the member for Moncrieff's opening remarks. I find it quite extraordinary that anybody would question the Labor government's commitment to retirement incomes. After all, it was Labor that fought so hard through those very difficult reform years back in the eighties and nineties to make super available to the general population and then to increase it to nine per cent. That was not a simple reform. It was perhaps one of the hardest reforms we have seen a government undertake for many years. It is the Labor government now that is committed to increasing super contributions to 12 per cent. I note the remarks by the member for Moncrieff about the cost of living. To say that working with an inflation rate in the band recommended by the Reserve Bank is the most outrageous increase in the cost of living in human memory, or he said something similar, is quite an extraordinary statement. Perhaps he should have a closer look at the real economic figures and pay a little less attention to his fantasy life.


There is a third element to retirement incomes and that, of course, is jobs. Perhaps it is the most important one because, without a job, you do not have much of a chance of accumulating retirement income at all. We have seen an opposition that has not supported this government's very strong commitment to retaining jobs and growing jobs. Through the global economic crisis, when this government put forward a stimulus package specifically designed to ensure that as many Australians as possible kept their jobs while the rest of the world were shedding theirs, we did not see support from the opposition. We have not seen support from the opposition for programs that strengthen the car industry in Australia, an incredibly important area of the Australian economy that not just keeps many tens of thousands of people employed but provides the skill base that flows through other manufacturing sectors. Similarly we have not seen support from the opposition for the aluminium industry, an extremely important part of our economy. So I would suggest to the member for Moncrieff that perhaps he could rethink some of his comments. I doubt that he will. I think that, again, the fantasy world he lives in is a far more interesting one for members of the opposition than reality. It was an unfortunate and rather misleading contribution.


Now back to the fun bit: the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011, which is so interesting that they even have the date in it twice. They always do and I cannot quite figure that one out, but I am sure the guys from Treasury will one day explain to me why all the tax laws have the date twice. There are six schedules in this bill. Schedule 1 is about portability of superannuation. We heard one of the earlier speakers talk at length about this. It is a particularly interesting area. At the moment, we all know that there are many Australians who have lost touch with their superannuation or their superannuation has lost touch with them—one way or the other. In other words, there is money out there that belongs to them but is, essentially, out of their grasp. The government has already created some easier pathways for people to find their super through the lost super website. In my electorate we have already been out with mobile offices all over the electorate, encouraging people to come in and logon and try to find their lost super. If you ever have tried to consolidate your superannuation, if you are a normal person in the street who does not follow these things closely, it becomes quite a complicated process.


Schedule 1 amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997—two fine bills—to enable certain superannuation fund members to electronically request the consolidation of their superannuation benefits through the ATO. It is referred to as the electronic portability form. Essentially it means that it will be much easier, through a phone call to the ATO and then logging on to an ATO website, to have their lost superannuation funds consolidated through the ATO.


It is quite a clever little device. It makes it much simpler and easier for lost superannuation fund members to consolidate their benefits. Essentially, that helps people to reduce the fees they pay on multiple accounts and to maximise their retirement benefits. Again, this is a seemingly quite simple improvement but it is one that reflects a longstanding commitment of this government to the development of the retirement incomes of everyday Australians. This measure was supported by both the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia.


Schedule 2 makes improvement to the capital gains tax law to make it easier for businesses to restructure. Under current law, taxpayers can obtain the capital gains tax rollover for a capital gain or loss that arises from their interest in a company or a trust because of the demerger of an entity from the group of which the company or trust is the head entity. However, this is not available where the head entity is a corporation sole or complying superannuation entity and schedule 2.2 of the bill makes the situation more consistent, making the rollover available for both of those types of bodies. It removes barriers to business restructures of a certain type by broadening access to various CGT rollovers. The changes are absolutely consistent with the government's long-term objective of promoting flexibility for business. Once again, this is a small change that reflects an attitude in a broad policy area that this government has been working on now for nearly four years.


Schedule 3 concerns the GST financial supply provisions. It reduces compliance costs for small businesses by increasing the financial acquisitions threshold from $50,000 to $150,000. If a small business makes a financial acquisition below this amount it falls outside the financial supply regime and can claim input tax credits for its financial supplies. Increasing the threshold takes more small businesses outside of the financial supply regime. Many small businesses in my area will think that a very fine thing. The bill implements three of the seven recommendations agreed to by the government arising out of the Treasury's review of the GST financial supply provisions.


Something interesting that this bill does is amend the GST treatment of hire purchase, again something that is going to benefit a large number of small businesses in my electorate and around the country. There are two current credit arrangements, hire purchase and chattel mortgage. They have very similar credit arrangements. But they have very important differences which carry through to their tax treatment. In both cases, essentially the purchaser obtains the use of the asset upfront in return for a series of payments made in instalments. In hire purchase, ownership does not transfer until the final payment. In chattel mortgage, ownership transfers upfront.


All else being equal, hire purchase is usually preferred over chattel mortgage. Chattel mortgage has an increased risk for the lender because the title has already changed hands and if there is a default repossession is difficult and may not be possible. Hire purchase is far less costly to implement in terms of legal fees and stamp duties. You would normally expect to see, particularly in the small business area, hire purchase being used to a far greater extent than chattel mortgage. That is not the case in Australia since the introduction of the GST. In fact, since the GST was introduced chattel mortgage has largely replaced the use of hire purchase in small businesses, even though chattel mortgage is more expensive, more complex and involves greater risk for the finance company.


The reason for that is because the GST operates differently for the two systems, particularly if the small business runs its accounts on a cash basis. Small businesses with an annual GST turnover of less than $2 million can account for GST on a cash basis, whereas larger business must account on an accrual basis. Cash accounting is simpler and reduces compliance costs, which is why small businesses like it. But the tax effect is that the larger firms account for their GST liability and input tax credits for hire purchase agreements upfront whereas small businesses that account for GST with cash account for it when each payment is made.


Under this amendment, the treatment of GST for small businesses that account on a cash basis becomes the same as that for larger companies. That will result in a significant cash flow benefit for small businesses compared to the current situation. Again, that is something that appears to be quite a small change but it will reduce the compliance costs, the administrative burden and the risk for many businesses in Australia—quite a nice little change.


Schedule 4 involves the GST treatment of new residential premises. The amendments will essentially reverse the effect of the court case involving Gloxinia Investments, which found that, where a particular combination of strata titles and leases were involved, newly constructed residential premises were not subject to GST. The bill reaffirms the policy intent that newly constructed homes should be subject to GST and will also protect the revenue that funds government services that assist the whole of the community. The measure will ensure that GST is payable on the full value added to newly constructed residential premises by developers and builders. This is achieved by ensuring that GST is applied to the retail sale of new residential premises to homeowners and investors, as well as the wholesale supply of the premises to the developer or builder. Schedule 5 I am only going to speak about very briefly. It involves tax deductible recipients. Under the current law, taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for certain gifts to organisations with deductible gift recipient status. This amendment lists donations to the Rhodes Trust Australia appeal to be claimed as a tax deduction. This is a fairly routine amendment, unless you happen to be the Rhodes Trust Australia or you happen to want to donate to them. It is a very good outcome for the Rhodes Trust.


There are a number of miscellaneous amendments in schedule 6 that I will not go into. They are mainly quite administrative—too administrative even for a person who loves tax or amendments. Again, it is a rather nice little collection of amendments that reduce complexity for small business, clarify tax law and have benefits for cash-flow management for small business. I commend the bill to the House.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (16:36):  Before I address the issues before us I will pick up on a couple of the issues raised by my good friend the member for Parramatta. The member for Parramatta spoke briefly about cost-of-living pressures. I am on record as saying that my electorate of Wright is one of the weathervanes of the nation. I have no linkages into the resources sector whatsoever, so my hypothesis is that it is only a matter of time before the pain we feel at the moment flows through to the rest of the market. I reassure my colleagues that the cost-of-living pressures that are out there at the moment are absolutely horrendous, and for this government to be dismissive of the idea that those pressures exist in my electorate is uncalled for.


The member for Parramatta went on to criticise the coalition for not giving support to the car industry or the aluminium sector. Today I had the opportunity to read a couple of documents. I was trying to get my head around this whole car industry manufacturing process. I read some comments from a Holden executive. He had some scathing comments, saying that up to a third of his workforce struggled to roll up to work, for one reason or another. He said his ability to respond to that was hampered by union intervention. He went on to speak about the lack of efficiency in the car industry. That is one argument, but I will put that aside for a moment. I do acknowledge the impact of the increase in the Australian dollar on the industry. That has an impact on anyone who is trying to export products out of this country.



We have a car manufacturing industry which is non-productive, so the government is throwing some subsidies at it to try and get them over the line. In addition, the government is then going to put its hand in its other pocket for the car industry—between 2012 and 2020, carbon credit payments to the car industry alone will be in the vicinity of $450 million. Notwithstanding that, in 2012, in the year that the carbon tax is introduced, for Alcoa, which has two sites, that payment will be $40 million, and it will increase exponentially as the carbon price of $23 per tonne increases. I thought I would put that on the table. I would be quite happy to take it up with the member for Parramatta at a later stage. It just bewilders me when we talk about supporting an industry on the one hand and then the government puts its hand into the pocket of the same organisation and calls it support.


The Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011 makes the following changes to the taxation laws. It allows certain superannuation fund members to electronically request consolidation of their super funds through the Australian Taxation Office. It allows entities in a restructure to use shares or interest sales facilities without failing a requirement of certain capital gains tax rollovers. It provides capital gains tax demerger relief. It expands capital gains tax rollovers to entities changing their incorporation. It implements aspects of the Treasury's review of the GST financial supply provision. Additionally, it clarifies the GST treatment of new residential premises, adds the Rhodes Trust to the deductible gift recipients list and, finally, makes other minor and technical changes.


In Schedule 1 it allows certain superannuation fund members with lost super to more easily consolidate their funds through the use of one or more electronic portable forms. The form is submitted electronically at the ATO, which can then verify the status of lost money and the eligibility of the nominated receiving account. The coalition believes this to be a sensible initiative to streamline the process of re-uniting lost super funds with their owners. There would not be too many people in this room who, before either entering politics or working in the government, did not have some other forms of employment. In particular, our youth below the age of 25 change their jobs often. It used to be that we had five major career changes in our life. People below the age of 25 are already up to their third career change. They are not staying in the workforce as long as our fathers did. As a result this measure makes it easier for those people who have chopped and changed jobs to get access to their superannuation.


While we are on the issue of superannuation: the member for Blair spoke about the increase of super contributions from nine to 12 per cent. The government take the position that this is a wonderful initiative that they are putting in place. When I speak to my businesses they are horrified because they cannot see where the relief from the federal government is coming from to assist them with the increase in super from nine to 12 per cent. Yes, there is a one per cent reduction in their company tax rate from 30 to 29 per cent but, even when questioned in estimates, the Real Estate Institute of Australia indicated that the three per cent increase in superannuation contribution by the businessperson, by the small mum and dad, was not going to be covered by the one per cent. You cannot have your cake and eat it too. You cannot call this a Labor initiative and say that you are out there helping business when really, at face value, you are again putting your hands into the pockets of businesspeople, mums and dads, who are trying to employ people and you are asking them to pay for the increased contribution.


Part 2 of the schedule is about the share sales facilities. These are entities used in dealing with foreign interests during the sale or restructuring of a company. The foreign interest holds ownership and transfers to the share sales facility, which deals with the holdings during the sale or the restructure and then returns the cash or the new assets for the foreign interest holder. The share sales facility is primarily used to avoid complex foreign tax laws and unintended taxation consequences in restructuring companies. The existing owners are given significant capital gains rollover relief where a structure results in those owners holding substantially the same interest in the new entity. However, where there is a sale facility that is required to be used, the CGT rollover is not available to the foreign interest holders because the actual sale or the restructure was completed by the facility rather than by the foreign interest holder. This has acted as an impediment to restructuring and what would otherwise have been of benefit to the company and its shareholders. The change in this bill will allow foreign interest holders, who are otherwise eligible for capital gains rollover, to relief. With the restructure of the company, where the share sale facility has been used to effect the actual restructure, the law will treat the share sale facility to track the actual ownership before and after the restructure.


Under the capital gains tax demerger relief in schedule 2, part II, taxpayers can choose to obtain a capital gains tax rollover for a capital gain or capital loss that arises in their interest as a company or trust, because of the demerger of an entity from the group of companies. This is not a bad one. Basically, when you speak about a merger, you have two entities that may have separate assets but for argument's sake may have a combined balance sheet. When those companies decide to demerger it allows ease for the capturing of the capital gain. It is not susceptible at that point. The main part of the business that is retaining the assets does not have a huge bill as part of their operational cost. That one does make sense.


Schedule 2, part III, 'Capital gains tax business restructures', will allow the Indigenous bodies to incorporate under the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 without immediate capital gains tax consequences for the body members. As part of the Economics Committee we last year toddled up to the north of Queensland and caught up with a number of Aboriginal communities. It is hard to get them all in the one spot at the one time. They have different asset groups. This bill did not come as a result of that trip but I can assure you that this part of the legislation will assist those communities in trying to be more of a united front with reference to how they present themselves as a community. There is resistance in the north for that to happen at this point in time. There are some significant assets held by different communities and under the current taxation rulings transferring assets from one body to another does include some capital gain. This gives the capacity to merge those assets without any unintended consequences.


Schedule 3, the GST financial supply provision, increases the first limb of the financial acquisition threshold from $50,000 to $150,000. This increases the dollar value of the tax input credits available for acquisitions related to the making of financial supplies. The schedule includes financial supplies consisting of borrowings that are made through a provision of the deposit account from an ADI and the current concession for borrowing. The schedule allows taxpayers who account on a cash basis to claim input tax credits for acquisitions made under a hire purchase agreement upfront. This removes the distortion that currently exists between hire purchase and other forms of financing. Predominantly it is just the difference between a chattel mortgage and an HP. One of them provides you with access to draw back down after your first payment—your GST credit. Small businesses often use that as cash flow to pump back through the business. It is a bit of a false economy because you are virtually still financing your business on borrowed coin, and there is a cost associated with it. I assumed they looked at this because of title or the ownership of a lease—whether it be a truck or any type of unit such as that. If title is with the business holder then there is the capacity for depreciation to be claimed back immediately. If it is with HP or a lease, title remains with the financier and those incentives are not available.


Schedule 4, the GST treatment of new residential premises, seeks to ensure that the sales of long-term leases of new residential premises by a registered entity are a taxable supply, subject to the GST at the time of sale. For that sale—or long-term lease for residential premises, other than new residential premises—input tax applies and it is therefore not subject to GST at the time of the sale under the goods and services tax. The changes clarify the intent of the law after the full Federal Court's decision in Commissioner of Taxation versus Gloxinia Investments (Trustee), which found that the sale of the new residential premises using a development lease arrangement should be treated as input tax. This is not subject to GST. These outcomes are contrary to the general policy intent in relation to the taxation of property under the GST Act.


Schedule 5 speaks about the adding of the Rhodes Trust to the list of deductible gift recipients. The Rhodes Trust raises funds to augment the existing Rhodes Scholarship Program at Oxford. All monies are used to provide scholarships to Australians to study at Oxford University. The member for Parramatta also said that basically any donation that is given to that trust becomes tax deductable under the bill, and that is a good thing. Schedule 6 is just a rats and mice one—miscellaneous amendments to the tax laws.


The bill makes technical corrections and other minor and miscellaneous amendments to the taxation laws. The coalition sees no serious issues with this legislation and does not intend to oppose it. I believe the provisions of the bill are to be applied as of 1 July 2012, and I am pleased to associate myself with the bill.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:51):  It is my pleasure to rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011. I am reliably informed by the office of the Assistant Treasurer that I now hold the record amongst government backbenchers for speeches on TLABs, a record that I suspect only I in this place would be proud to hold.


The bill before the House is non-controversial. As previous members have noted, it contains six schedules enabling superannuation fund members to request the consolidation of their benefits; amending CGT provisions to make it easier for businesses to restructure; implementing a number of the recommendations out of Treasury's review of the GST financial supply provisions; ensuring that sales or long-term leases of new residential premises are taxable supplies and that sales or long-term leases of existing residential premises are input tax supplies; adding the Rhodes Trust to the tax act; and making a number of what the previous speaker described as 'rats and mice' amendments.


Despite this, the coalition referred the bill to the House of Representatives Economics Committee. It was our not unpleasant duty to inquire into the bill—an inquiry which ultimately produced a report supported by coalition and Labor members. But it did raise in my mind the question as to why the coalition thought it was worth the House Economics Committee spending time on this rather than, for example, conducting inquiries into other questions such as the strong status of the Australian economy relative to other nations, boosting innovation in Australia and the importance of good economic management over fear mongering.


I would like to place on record the coalition's somewhat odd behaviour now when it comes to referring legislation to the House Economics Committee. As the chair, the member for Parramatta, told the main chamber earlier today, the House has discharged a reference of the appropriations bills—a particularly bizarre reference given that one would think that a government needs to appropriate money to conduct its business. It was in fact difficult for us to see how you would even begin to conduct an inquiry into the appropriations bills—but that was what those opposite wanted us to do. Naturally, the House Economics Committee have refused that reference. It is again just an indication of the general disarray of those opposite when it comes to economic management.


Over the weekend Laurie Oakes wrote in his column that the reason that there have been so many estimates as to how large the opposition's budget black hole is is that the member for North Sydney does not trust his colleagues. So, in order to work out which of them is leaking, he gave each of them verbally a different number for the size of the opposition's black hole—a cunning trick. He laid carefully a trap for his colleagues to fall into and then waited to see which number would emerge in the public domain. A number did very clearly emerge in the public domain. The opposition finance spokesperson came straight out and said, 'The number is $70 billion.' It explains something many of us have been wondering about, which was why the member for Goldstein was so confident about his $70 billion estimate and why the member for North Sydney was saying, 'It could be in a range; it could be $50 billion, $60 billion of $70 billion.' That is because the member for Goldstein had a precise figure which he was given not realising the trap he was about to fall into.


While those opposite are busy laying traps for their colleagues to fall into, we on this side of the House are focused on good economic management. We have a resilient economy with three-quarters of a million jobs created since Labor came to office. We are putting in place record investments in roads, doubling the road budget. We are increasing the rail budget tenfold and investing more in urban public transport than every federal government since Federation. At the same time we are putting in place a price on carbon pollution—an essential economic reform if we are to modernise our economy and create the green jobs of the future.


The choice is not between a carbon price and no carbon price. All those who look at the problem seriously know that the choice is between a carbon price now and a carbon price later, which will be more costly because the changes will be more gut-wrenching. Those opposite are in disarray when it comes to returning the budget to surplus and they are in disarray on just about every fundamental economic question one can point to. Former Liberal boss John Hewson has said the opposition leader is 'one of the most negative people I know' on economic and political issues.


Those opposite supported a recommendation that we have an independent parliamentary budget office. The member for Higgins was on the committee which unanimously recommended a parliamentary budget office, as was Senator Joyce. But, when it came to the House and the opposition realised the magnitude of the fiscal task which lay before them, they opposed a parliamentary budget office. They now say that they will not put their costings to be independently verified by a parliamentary budget office but will again use private accountants—private accountants who were, in the 2010 election, fined for their behaviour in looking into the opposition's costings.


We speak about a $70 billion black hole in the costings of those opposite but really we should be speaking about $70 billion of hidden cuts. That $70 billion is equivalent to stopping Medicare payments for four years and stopping the age pension for two years; it means cutting deeply into hospital spending and education and not investing in the future. In my electorate of Fraser it is already clear that one of the ways in which the opposition seeks to meet their massive fiscal target is to cut 12,000 jobs. The member for North Sydney has proudly spoken about making 12,000 Canberra public servants redundant. None of my constituents would have pride in that. Those opposite have said that they want to get rid of the Department of Climate Change. The member for North Sydney told Q&A last Monday that he does not know what public servants in the Department of Health and Ageing do. I might suggest he ask his leader who was, after all, the Minister for Health and Ageing under the Howard government when the Department of Health and Ageing employed about as many people as it does today.


On this side of the House, we are committed to keeping taxes as low as possible. Taxation as a proportion of the economy is lower now than it was under John Howard. The tax to GDP ratio was 23.7 per cent when Labor came to office; now it is 21.2 per cent. Our jobless rate has risen due to the global financial crisis but it has risen by only 0.7 per cent since Labor came to power. Compare that to a rise of 3.1 per cent in Britain and 3.6 per cent in the United States. The opposition's approach to the economic debate is all care and no responsibility. Those opposite would have thrown us into deep debt when the global financial crisis struck. We on this side of the House saved 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses from going to the wall. When it comes to taxes, we have put in place income tax cuts and we are delivering pension rises and tax cuts under the clean energy future package from 1 July this year. Under those opposite the only people who would get tax cuts are the big miners and the big polluters. When it comes to the surplus, we will return the budget to surplus in fiscal year 2012-13. Those opposite have a dozen positions on the surplus. They have no consistency on their economic message.


Finally, Deputy Speaker—and may I congratulate you on your ascension to the role—I want to address an issue raised by the member for Wright over the cost of living. We in this country have a metric for the cost of living. It is not the amount of hot air that comes out of the Leader of the Opposition's mouth; it is the inflation rate. The inflation rate now is lower than when Labor came to office. The inflation rate is stable under Labor and we are proud on this side of the House to have ensured price stability. Many things have in fact fallen in price over the last year. Among the categories of things for which prices are cheaper than they were a year ago are bread, milk, shoes, appliances, pharmaceuticals, cars, computers and toys.




Mr Buchholz:
  Thank God for that. I can go back to my electorate and tell them that.




Dr LEIGH:
  Do go back and tell your electorate, member for Wright. I would be very happy if you were to have an honest discussion with your electors about the cost of living—not the fearmongering that we have seen so often from your side of politics but some direct, fact based discussion. I know those opposite do not like dealing in facts. They would prefer to speak about towns being wiped off the map—




Mr Buchholz:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, my point of order goes to relevance. We are seven minutes in and not once have I heard the member who is your gun—the government's gun—on the TLAB actually address TLAB No.9. You have got to get close to it soon.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Symon
):  The member for Fraser will address his remarks to the bill.




Dr LEIGH:
  I shall, and I hope you do not take the reflection on the chair that the member for Wright has issued there.


This is a fundamental piece of economic legislation that underpins the Gillard government's commitment to a strong economy. Under us income taxes are lower than when we came to office. Inflation is lower than when we came to office. Interest rates are lower than when we came to office. A family with a $300,000 mortgage is saving $3,000 a year thanks to lower interest rates under the Gillard government. I commend the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) 2011 Bill to the House. It a small piece to be sure but an important piece of the long-term economic reform that we on this side of the House are putting into place.


Let me conclude with the words of a constituent who came and saw me in the mobile office that I attended on Saturday at the National Multicultural Festival. He said to me: 'When you look out across all the people at this festival probably almost none of us will still be here in 80 years time, but our children and grandchildren will be here and the reforms we are putting into place are ensuring that their prosperity is upheld. Yes, they are good for the current generations but they are recognising that in politics we do what we can for the future. We are not here just to scaremonger.' He said: 'You should see through what Mr Abbott is proposing. You should see out his negativity and you should see him out of politics, because what is important is the future prosperity of all Australians.' I commend the bill to the House.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:04):  It is a pleasure to follow my friend the member for Fraser in this important debate about tax. It is also a debate about the legislation that is necessary to manage our economy, to balance our budget and to ensure not only that we have the revenue stream to ensure that government activity is sustained now and into the future but that our tax system regulates economic and personal activity in a way that is in the national interest. With that in mind, and adding that the minister is in the chamber, which is always a certain sign that the debate is going to wrap up at any time soon, I will restrict my comments to something that is very close to my heart, which is the issue of superannuation. The first schedule to this bill goes to the issue of superannuation and assisting people who have money in superannuation accounts to consolidate those funds.


It is a part of a Labor project. It was Labor that brought occupational superannuation into this parliament through the Hawke-Keating government in the late 1980s. It was Labor that saw the establishment of industry funds as the mainstay of workers' superannuation savings in this country. It is Labor that has ensured that we have a direct employee say in the management of those superannuation funds because we believe quite simply in worker capital. We believe that, if workers are putting literally hundreds of thousands of dollars into a savings vehicle for their retirement, then they should have some say in the management of those savings.


It is Labor that saw the shift in the superannuation employer contribution to employee superannuation from three per cent to nine per cent. And it will be Labor, against the fierce opposition of the member for Wright, and those who he sits in the chamber with, who will see the move in occupational superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This is all a part of Labor's project to ensure that, when workers retire, they have the dignity of a nest egg, a retirement egg.


Schedule 1 to this piece of legislation goes to that long-term project. It will enable the Australian Taxation Office to operate a scheme that will make it easier and simpler for lost superannuation fund members and retirement savings account holders to consolidate their benefits. We are not talking about small beer here. There is approximately $12.9 billion in lost superannuation that is unclaimed or is in unallocated superannuation accounts in this country today. It is $12.9 billion that belongs to somebody but is not yet allocated.


These measures are yet another step in the Labor project of ensuring that when workers earn their superannuation it goes into a well-managed fund and, when it goes into a well-managed fund, it ends up in their retirement savings account. It does this by amending the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 and the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 to enable certain superannuation fund members to simply electronically request the consolidation of their superannuation benefits through the Australian Taxation Office.


The scheme is going to be referred to as the Electronic Portability Form. The Electronic Portability Form will make it simpler and easier for lost superannuation fund members to consolidate their benefits. This, in turn, will reduce the fees paid on multiple accounts and will maximise members' retirement benefits. The Electronic Portability Form will allow lost superannuation fund members to electronically request the transfer of their benefits to their active accounts through a portal on the ATO website.


This means a lot to ordinary working families in my electorate of Throsby in the Illawarra and Southern Highlands. It means a lot to them because we have quite a high incidence of casual, part-time and seasonal workers. They are people who do not have the traditional pattern of employment where they will work from the beginning of their employment life until the day that they retire with one employer. It is quite likely that workers in my electorate may during the course of any one year have three or four employers, which is a series of employers throughout the course of a year or a series of employers at any one point in time. As they move from employer to employer and from job to job and, indeed, often from home to home, their superannuation accounts could get lost in that process.


I commend the minister for bringing this bill before the House, and I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the matter. As I said, it is a part of an important Labor project. At the heart of that important Labor project is this simple idea: if somebody works their entire life then they are entitled to a dignified retirement, not one that is reliant upon a pension and the vagaries of government decision making in relation to that pension. They are entitled to retire on the savings income that they have earned for their entire life. This bill is going to do its bit to ensure that $12.9 billion finds its rightful owners. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BRADBURY

 (
Lindsay
—
Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer
) (
17:10
):


I thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 9) Bill 2011. I wish to acknowledge those members whose contributions I have witnessed in the time that I have been here in the chamber—in particular, the members for Parramatta, Fraser and Throsby. I also acknowledge the contribution of the member for Wright. I thank him for his support of the bill and also for livening up the debate—even if that was with some rather misguided comments.





Schedule 1 of the bill allows regulations to prescribe the operating details of a scheme that allows the ATO to assist lost superannuation fund members to electronically consolidate their benefits. Lost members will be able to visit the ATO website, fill in a form online and submit it electronically to the ATO. The ATO will conduct verification processes and, if they are successful, they will send the form to the fund which reported the member as lost. This process will make it simpler and easier for people to claim their lost super. By consolidating their accounts, members will reduce the fees that they pay on multiple accounts and maximise their benefits on retirement.





Schedule 2 broadens access to certain CGT rollovers to make it easier for businesses to restructure. These changes provide greater flexibility for entities that convert from a body to an incorporated company, entities that use a share or sale interest facility for foreign interest holders in a restructure, and demerger groups that include corporations sole or complying superannuation entities.





Schedule 3 implements three of the recommendations agreed to by the government arising out of the Treasury's review of the GST financial supply provisions. The remaining measures require amendments to the GST regulations. This schedule amends the GST law to increase the first limb of the financial acquisition threshold from $50,000 to $150,000
,
 to exclude financial supplies consisting of a borrowing made through the provision of deposit accounts by an Australian authorised deposit-taking institution from the current concession for borrowings and to allow taxpayers who account on a cash basis to claim input tax credits for acquisitions made under hire purchase agreements upfront. The amendments will reduce compliance costs for businesses by reducing the number of businesses that are prevented from claiming input tax credits on acquisitions that relate to making financial supplies, removing the distortion between hire purchase and other forms of financing for cash based taxpayers, and ensuring that hire purchase agreements are treated the same regardless of whether taxpayers account on a cash basis or a non-cash basis. The amendments will also better target the borrowing exemptions to reflect the policy intent by no longer providing access to input tax credits for expenses related to borrowings in the form of deposit accounts provided by Australian authorised deposit-taking institutions.





The amendments in schedule 4 deal with the new residential premises provision and will ensure GST is payable on the full value added to newly constructed residential premises by developers and builders. This is achieved by ensuring GST is applied to the retail sale of new residential premises to home owners and investors as well as the wholesale supply of the premises to the developer or builder.




Schedule 5 amends the deductible gift recipient provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. Schedule 5 adds one new organisation to the act—namely, the Rhodes Trust in 
Australia. Making this organisation a DGR will assist it to attract public support for its activities. This schedule also recognises the name change of Playgroup Australia Inc. to Playgroup Australia Ltd. Finally, schedule 6 covers miscellaneous and technical amendments to the tax laws.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (17:16):  I had the privilege this morning of meeting with the national Stolen Generations Alliance, who had a breakfast at which two speakers left an indelible impression on the hearts and minds of those who were in attendance. Both were taken as young children from their mothers and adopted. One ended up in Wales, the other in London. Both, throughout their lives, realised there was something different about them because they could not see any other cultural grouping that looked anything like theirs. Throughout that period, both came to the realisation that there would come a point in their lives when they would need to backtrack and have a look at where their families were. Both described their experiences of talking to their adopted families, the support they did and did not receive and of making the journey back to Australia. 


Levon, when he came back, discovered where his biological parents were and where his brothers and sisters were. His reunion was much more challenging because there was a difference—or, as he described it, a brick wall—although he has been slowly working through those challenges. Leonie, on the other hand, was fortunate that she had a sister who left a letter on her Link-Up file with all the details of who her mother, father, brothers and sisters were and a point of contact, should she ever inquire. So when she came back to Australia she was able to make contact and re-establish the linkages with her family. She struggled, but she also appreciates the fact that she is now reunited with them.


When the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered the apology in the House, as I have said previously in this chamber, he created a healing process that was absolutely critical to this nation. It was an acknowledgement of decisions and policies that had good intent, but their unintended consequences were greater and more far-reaching in the pain and grief that they caused. I had the privilege of meeting with the boys from Kinchela Boys Home in New South Wales and heard some of their stories. When you sit and listen to the emptiness they describe in their lives within the institution, you are left with a sense of what would have been their opportunities and pathways had they been with their families and not been institutionalised or not experienced the pain that they did.


In all of the stories that I have heard or read or that have been provided to me by elders and those who have been affected by the stolen generations, including my own mother, where bitterness prevailed it is replaced by forgiveness. There is a knowledge that there was recognition by the Prime Minister and the Australian parliament that the events that occurred to them were made known to Australian society. When I travelled overseas to Europe one of the things that came up constantly was people who would say that they were pleased. When I was in the Emirates I had comments that they respected the fact that there was an acknowledgement of the first nations people. I assume that is only because of the travel and business arrangements that prevail between countries, but it was certainly acknowledged in that context.


I want to read the charter of the Ngunawal elders. This morning I was given, with some pride, the stories of the Ngunawal people who were affected by the stolen generation and who were taken. One of the things I have always respected about our people, or our mob, is that we have a tremendous capacity to forgive when challenges have beset us. We have seen those challenges as points in time but we have always negotiated and moved on from where we have been. The charter says this:


Our Unity is a journey of healing. We have taken the first big step and along the path people will join with us (and leave) but everyone is welcome.


In welcoming people, we know the following to be true:


That our Elders have our respect. We are honoured by their giving respect back. We acknowledge them for assuming responsibility as leaders in our community.


We need to come together to create our future – one in which everyone has a place where they can feel proud, have dignity, and feel they belong.


That communication is everything and we do this in a supportive way to know more about each other, our history and our culture. These knowledges we make are ours together, although it belongs not only to us, but it’s also for our kids and grandkids too. And it is for them that we do this work now.


It takes courage to do work for the greater good. We need to learn how to solve problems, include not isolate, to listen with our hearts and speak from our souls.


In being courageous we are a direct link back to the Dreamtime. This is the essence of Aboriginality, as is our relationship to land.


In this Journey we strive for Unity. We do this by empowering people, creating confidence, self-esteem and room for difference so we can work and laugh together, moving forward all the while.


We, each and every one of us, want this; not only for ourselves and our families. We want this, too, for people who need it the most.


The Stolen Generations Alliance today brought together members of the stolen generation to talk about the future and to look at the opportunities that lie ahead in this great country of ours. They talked and shared the experience of the pain. But that pain is not an inhibitor to the way they want to see the knowledge of the past, and also the knowledge of the future and the directions we take, as equally that of all Australians in concert with the people of the first nations. It is about the way in which we create the opportunities.


In their statement, the Stolen Generations Working Partnership, they talk about the priority issues, the things that they want to see change so that we never have the past repeated on any group for any reason, and about respect, dignity and understanding. I would love to see universities around this country adopt 20 members of the stolen generation so that they are able to be part of the processes of lifelong learning, to be engaged in some of the forums and discussions that will occur around Indigenous affairs and to be able to tell a chapter within the history of Australia from a point of engagement, where people can seek to understand, ask questions and have answers. I must say that I enjoy a privileged position in this House because I do have members of this parliament from all parties at different times come and ask me questions about our people, our mob. They will say sometimes, 'Can I ask you a politically incorrect question?' But to me no question is politically incorrect if you are seeking to enhance your knowledge and to increase your understanding. I think in that sense there is a beauty in having members of the stolen generation working and being part of university life, because our greatest knowledge acquisition, other than the early years of our lives, certainly comes through the tertiary institutions which so many Australians attend, including overseas students. What a rich, living, cultural history they would participate and share in.


For the members of the stolen generation, in talking about accessing services equally across all areas consistently, I would certainly support the Closing the Gap measures because they do address the very issues that the stolen generation have continually raised. One of the challenges in Closing the Gap is that it is not uniform across the nation; it is not uniform in terms of urban, rural and remote areas. Nevertheless, there is a focus on some very critical areas, but we have still have much to do. They talk about the greater awareness needed across government and non-government agencies. The former Prime Minister said, 'If we are not finding solutions to the problems then maybe there is a better way that we need to do business.' Certainly the stolen generation have put forward the proposition on several occasions that they want to be equal partners. They want to be there to help shape the future, the services and the access to what is offered to all Australians, not just through Indigenous moneys, because, as a society, in government we provide for all regardless of their location. We should ensure that there is continuity and access to government services. I deliberately use the term 'government services' because 'mainstream services' has, I think, a connotation around it, whereas any service provided by a government is provided to the citizens of that nation and that country and certainly within the jurisdictions.


They have been very strong in helping to heal those whose pain and grief is still problematic. If you want to read a piece of research that is significant and really highlights that intergenerational impact, I commend to members a report written by the Western Australian Institute of Child Health Research, under the leadership of Professor Fiona Stanley. The WA Aboriginal Child Health Survey went beyond something like 4,000 families. The last chapter of that social and emotional wellbeing publication deals with the impact on children of members of the stolen generation, and it highlights the aspect of mental illnesses and the debilitating impact that caring for somebody from the stolen generation has had on them and their likelihood of success in other areas. I know that, when we produced that chapter and provided it to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth agency at the time asked for empirical data and evidence that our findings had some substance to them. But the report certainly showed that, when you look after somebody who has been traumatised or who has been significantly hurt, where there is both an emotional and a psychological scar both within the mind and on the heart, there are some subsequent flow-on effects from that.


I would hope that, as governments prevail for at least the next decade, we set some long-term vision around how we can reach all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families. When we think that there are only 700,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, we break them into family units and that reduces the number. But, if we take the concept that 25 per cent of Aboriginal families are in working environments where the income is sustained through jobs, it means that we really have to focus on only 75 per cent. When you consider that number in the context of government services, we should alleviate those pressure points around education, justice, health and other government services, including housing. I want to acknowledge all of those members of the stolen generation. The National Stolen Generations Alliance supports the implementation of the recommendations from the Bringing them home report. The report's introduction in part states:


For individuals, their removal as children and the abuse they experienced at the hands of the authorities or their delegates have permanently scarred their lives. The harm continues in later generations, affecting their children and grandchildren.


It then goes on to say:


In no sense has the Inquiry been ‘raking over the past’ for its own sake. The truth is that the past is very much with us today, in the continuing devastation of the lives of Indigenous Australians. That devastation cannot be addressed unless the whole community listens with an open heart and mind to the stories of what has happened in the past and, having listened and understood, commits itself to reconciliation.


Walking and working together and in unity mend what was the past but build for a future that strengthens our nation.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (17:31):  It was William Faulkner who said: 'The past is never dead. It's not even past.' Today, we are so reminded of how apt that line is in considering the national apology. The national apology to the stolen generations on 13 February 2008 saw the Australian parliament acknowledge the pain and suffering caused by previous policies and finally say, 'We are sorry'. It is an honour for me to follow in this debate the member for Hasluck, somebody who I have a great admiration for on this issue and many others. I count myself among those in this place who has been fortunate to have benefited from his wisdom, and I hope to learn more from him during our times here.


Today is a day to remember but it is also a day to acknowledge the need for continued action to close the gaps. Today the minister launched a testimonies website, www.stolengenerationstestimonies.com. It is a moving website on which Australians can see many of the stories of people from the stolen generations—an important way of ensuring that what is past continues to be remembered for a portion of our history. I want to acknowledge today the work of the National Stolen Generations Alliance and the National Sorry Day Committee in doing so much to recognise the stolen generations.


One of the things that I would like to speak about today is the important role that education can play in closing the gaps in Australia. When I was an academic at the ANU, one of the projects I worked on was looking at the Indigenous test score gap in Australia. My co-author, Xiaodong Gong, and I found that, when Indigenous children reach school, they are on average a year behind their non-Indigenous peers but that by the end of primary school, the gap has widened to two years. That is in some sense a depressing message, because we can see Indigenous children falling behind their non-Indigenous counterparts. But, on the other hand, it is an optimistic message because schools, frankly, are easier to fix than the complexities of family background.


When I was up in Cape York as part of the House Economics Committee's inquiry, we heard much about the work that is being done in Cape York to improve schools, to take the best of what is occurring elsewhere in the world. One witness, Phyllis Yunkaporta, from Noel Pearson's Cape York Aboriginal Australian Academy, told the committee:


I guess in time we have to have expectations for our children to be educated in a way where they have to balance both worlds—the Western world and the traditional way. Of course we want them to hang onto the traditional way because that is where they are going to be identifying themselves for the future. And with them having to venture out into the mainstream, we want them to compete. It is a competitive world out there. We want our black little kids to start taking on the world.


I commend to the House Noel Pearson's Quarterly Essay on education, 'Radical hope', which speaks so articulately on the importance of high standards and the importance of combining good literacy and numeracy education with high-quality cultural education as well. It is also an essay which speaks very carefully to the balance between teacher quality and curriculum, an important balance to get right in Indigenous communities, as in non-Indigenous communities.


Another form of educational investment that can help close the gaps is in the area of higher education. It was my pleasure on 7 November last year to represent the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations in presenting Indigenous higher education staff scholarships. Among the recipients of those scholarships were Ann-Maree Hammond, from the University of Southern Queensland; Luke Halvorsen, from the Wollotuka Institute at the University of Newcastle; Catherine Taylor and Wayne Applebee, from the University of Canberra; James Charles and Elizabeth Cameron, from the University of Newcastle; Cheree Dean, from Charles Sturt University; and Jonelle Green, from La Trobe University. It was terrific for me to hear their stories and how they are helping to transform Australian higher education for the better.


On the evening, there were also awards presented to elders for their outstanding contribution to the higher education of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Awards were presented to Aunty Ruth Hegarty, from the Australian Catholic University; Aunty Rosmund Miriam Graham, from Griffith University; Aunty Joan Vickery, from Monash University and the University of Melbourne; and Ms Rose Guywanga and Reverend Dr Dinyini Gondarra, from Charles Darwin University. Waymamba Gaykamangu, a retired lecturer from Charles Darwin University, was also presented with a 2010 Elders award. All of these awards are part of ensuring that Indigenous higher education is as good as it can be.


We are speaking today about Sorry Day, but I want to end with a message of optimism. One of the great things about this country is our Indigenous heritage. For me as a non-Indigenous Australian, it is a great source of pride to live in a country which has a people with the oldest continuing link to the land. We need to speak about the wrongs that have been done but we also need to speak about how great it is for us as Australians all to participate in part of that culture.


There are many Indigenous constituents of whom I am enormously proud. Peter Radoll, Director of the Tjabal Indigenous Higher Education Centre of the Australian National University, is a font of great stories about Indigenous success at the ANU. Julie Tongs, the director of the Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Centre, in Narrabundah, has done extraordinary work to improve the health of Indigenous people in the ACT. Mr Duncan Smith, the Wiradjuri artist who I understand carved an artwork that was presented this morning, is an amazing role model to Indigenous youth in the ACT and somebody from whom I have learned a great deal in the time that I have known him. Matilda House is a wonderful Indigenous woman who is there at so many functions in the ACT, reminding us of the importance of welcoming to country. That is a reminder which I particularly see opening the eyes of overseas visitors, who are sometimes hearing about the tradition of welcoming to country for the first time and, in the case of some US visitors, will turn around afterwards and say, 'Why don't we do more of that back home?'


So it is a day to say sorry but it is also a day to look forward with optimism to an Australia that closes the gaps and engenders a great sense of pride in our extraordinary Indigenous heritage.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-02-13,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:39):  Four years ago today, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered his famous 'sorry speech'. His fourth sentence underlined a determination felt by many:


The time has now come for the nation to turn a new page in Australia's history by righting the wrongs of the past and so moving forward with confidence to the future.


A little later in his speech, Mr Rudd spoke of:


A future where all Australians, whatever their origins, are truly equal partners, with equal opportunities and with an equal stake in shaping the next chapter in the history of this great country, Australia.


While we acknowledge the momentous nature of that particular day, of most importance is what has happened to better the lives of Aboriginal people since then. Acknowledgements in this parliament are one thing but they will be seen only as empty platitudes if measures of real worth are not delivered to back up the words. Aboriginal Australians are like everybody else when it comes to the aspects of life that matter most. Above all else, they need good health services, a decent education and a roof over their heads. Staying healthy is the key to a quality life; education opens up opportunities which would otherwise not be available; and reliable, affordable housing is paramount.


The life expectancy of Aboriginal males was estimated to be 59.4 years over the period from 1996 to 2001, while the life expectancy of Aboriginal females was estimated to be 64.8 years. When compared to the life expectancy of the general Australian population, that is a life expectancy inequality gap of about 17 years in that same five-year period. The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that an Aboriginal male born in the period from 2005 to 2007 could expect to live to the age of 67.2 years, or about 11½ years less than a non-Aboriginal male at that time, who could expect to live to 78.7 years. In the same period, an Aboriginal female could be expected to live to 72.9 years on average, which is almost 10 years less than a non-Aboriginal woman, who could expect to live to 82.6 years.


The infant mortality rate among the Aboriginal population is, sadly, all too high. Babies born to Aboriginal women are far more likely to die in their first year than those born to non-Aboriginal women. Between 2006 and 2008, the infant mortality rate for babies born to Aboriginal women was as high as 14 babies out of 1,000 births in the Northern Territory. In contrast, the rate for the total Australian population was 4.1 deaths per 1,000 births in 2008. Despite the 'sorry' acknowledgement, infant mortality among the Aboriginal population is, tragically, still too high.


Heart and related conditions are 1.3 times more common for Aboriginal people than for non-Aboriginal people. High blood pressure, the most commonly reported condition, is 1½ times more common. Diabetes is around 3½ times more common among Aboriginal people than among other Australians. In the period from 2002 to 2006, deaths from chronic kidney disease were seven times more common for Aboriginal males and 11 times more common for Aboriginal females than for non-Aboriginal Australians living in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. Aboriginal statistics for other illnesses and diseases are far higher than for the rest of society.


Educational attainment among Aboriginal youth is, happily, improving, but far more needs to be done. The Northern Territory government's own education budget papers have targeted attendance rates at around 32 per cent for Aboriginal primary school students attending school regularly. Clearly, this is a terribly low target figure.


This government constantly talks about closing the gap. However, in some key areas very little has changed. Mr Rudd said in 2008:


I therefore propose a joint policy commission, to be led by the Leader of the Opposition and me, with a mandate to develop and implement—to begin with—an effective housing strategy for remote communities over the next five years.


That is a noble aim and ambition. However, it is a fact that Aboriginal people in many areas, including Tumut and Brungle in my electorate of the Riverina, are in desperate need of better housing. On 2 December 2011, in company with the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, Senator Nigel Scullion, I visited Aboriginal centres in the irrigation zones of the Riverina electorate. One of those places that we visited was Tirkandi Inaburra, which means 'To learn to dream' in the Wiradjuri language. Tirkandi Inaburra is a cultural and development centre located between Darlington Point and Coleambally on a 780-hectare rural property. It is a centre offering Aboriginal boys aged between 12 and 15 years a culturally based residential program teaching them confidence, self-respect and resilience, and hopefully reducing contact with the criminal justice system. For three to six months the students engage in learning in educational, sporting, recreational and life and living skills and cultural activities which have all have been designed to incrementally develop each participant's skills and abilities. The centre, as I say, is between Coleambally and Darlington Point and is making a wonderful adjustment and change to these young boys' lives. At present, Tirkandi Inaburra is the only centre in Australia which provides such a wonderful opportunity to Aboriginal males. It is only boys who live in communities located between the Lachlan and Murray and between Balranald and the western side of the Blue Mountains who are eligible to apply to come to the centre.


More centres such as this, for both boys and girls, is what we should be promising our Aboriginal students to reach the goal of a higher percentage of graduates by 2020. As Senator Scullion said, this should be a model which should be replicated elsewhere. I quote him:



It is a tremendous concept and would make such a difference to more lives if it were established in other places.


The sorry speech was a start. Let us, as a parliament and a Commonwealth, now work towards real improvements in Aboriginal health, Aboriginal education and Aboriginal housing as a means to being genuine partners, together united towards a better future.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (17:46):  I start my contribution to the debate on National Sorry Day by acknowledging that we meet here today on the land of the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples and I pay my respect to the elders past and present. Doing that is not something that came naturally to my generation. We were not exposed to that through our education system. I can remember at school collecting money for the Aboriginal Advancement League. That was the only exposure that we would ever have. It is ironic that we had trainee teachers come from Papua New Guinea to our school, but indigenous affairs was not something that was front and centre in my education.


So when the amateur psychologists try to work out what was in my mind as I opened proceedings on 24 November last year before my resignation as Speaker, the fact of the matter is that the raw emotion I displayed was in response to the realisation that it was the last time that I would make that statement that now forms part of our standing orders to the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples. My son reminded me, 'Dad, at least you were the first Speaker who got to do it.' Sometimes sons have a way of looking at a glass as half full when I seem to always think it is half empty.


I was a member of this place from 1986 to 1997, and for a brief moment early on in that time, for a couple of months before an election, I was dragooned—and I mean dragooned—onto the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. I think I attended one meeting. The electorate of Scullin had something like .03 per cent Indigenous people when I was first elected. The city of Whittlesea, which is one of the main local government units, now has the third largest Indigenous population in Victoria. So in the quarter of a century since my election, mainly due to the search for affordable housing on the urban fringe, the Indigenous population there has become much larger. But it was the Bringing them home report that was my first experience of thinking about the issues of Indigenous Australians and what they had suffered and what they had enjoyed. I do not think that we should see this as something to do with negativity. This is about being very positive and moving forward. It was this report and the reflection on what we had seen since Europeans came and started what we refer to as the 'modern Australia' that made me think that there was something that we should be doing, not only because as members of this place we are integral to the formation of government, but because each of us as individuals, I believe, is very important as a community leader. We should be showing that leadership within our communities.


In an adjournment speech, I think in June 1997, I read a few things out of the Bringing them home report. Some went back into history about what people had said in the twenties. There was also a quote from a person that went on to be a valuable member of this place, from another political party, John McEwen when he was Minister for the Interior. He visited what was known then as the Half-caste Home in Darwin in 1937. McEwen being of the land really knew what he was saying when he said:


I know many stock breeders who would not dream of crowding their stock in the way that these half-caste children are huddled.


The other thing that came home to me was when I read the story of a young man born in 1964 and I realised that he was just a little younger than my younger sister who was born in 1963. He talked about being removed from his mother and the struggles, when the records were revealed, that the mother had had in trying to make contact with the young lad. Birthday cards and Christmas cards were not delivered but were put on his file. When he discovered his mother, she was working in an institution that looked after orphaned Aboriginal children. Fortunately they had six months to enjoy getting acquainted.


Luckily for me, straight after the tabling of Bringing them home, I was a member of the House of Representatives Committee on Family and Community Affairs for the period, I think, 1998 to 2000 when we had our inquiry into Indigenous health. That was a privilege. What we saw was often horrific, because you could not believe that people living in Australia in that period should have been left behind. Some of the communities that we visited were confronting, not because they were dysfunctional but because I, a lad from the northern suburbs of Melbourne, had not been exposed to them. The people themselves, the Indigenous people, were so open in the way that they came before us and discussed the issues and solutions and the way that they saw forward.


I slightly digress as I feel obliged because I think of him often. We had as an adviser somebody who was instrumental in the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, NACCHO, the late Puggy Hunter, who travelled with us. I guess Puggy was just a little bit younger than me. He was a great person to explain what it meant being involved in Indigenous health services. One of the things that really struck me—and at that time it was not something that I had to really worry about—was when he said: 'You just get tired when you spend your time attending the funerals of people of your own age.' As I said, that was not something that I had to think about then. I am getting closer to that time now, and that is the difference. 


There is a brilliant young Indigenous doctor, Ngiare Brown—a wonderful person. When I visited the medical faculty at Darwin University last year, I saw a number of Indigenous Australians involved in studying to become a doctor. There should be more but it is getting there; it is noticeable. I think that is important. 


The other aspect of note from this inquiry occurred on the day that we were in Sydney. We were taking evidence from the Aids Council of New South Wales. Chris, a young bloke who was there, was the men's Aboriginal worker. He had been putting his evidence about his day-to-day work and then in a 'by the way' manner he said: 'But the real thing is: how would you feel if you were a bloke like me'—and, again, I think he was born about the time of my sister—'and when you were born you were a non-person? You weren't counted in the census.' It had never struck me that I was involved. I was of a similar age to him and I had a sister his age. So he was talking about my generation. As a person he has turned out very successfully but in the back of his mind is this fact that when he was born that was his status. That was when I started to think that some of these things are really very difficult for these individuals. Some of the things that we have 'institutionally' done through our laws have to be recognised and rectified. And so, as time went on and we built the momentum to seeing the events of four years ago today, the understanding of the importance of these symbolic steps dawned on me. The fact is that we had to do these things. 


How lucky do you get in life? You get elected Speaker of the House of Representatives one day and you think that is pretty good. You bounce the ball on proceedings at 9 o'clock the next morning and then you go through one of the most moving experiences that you can ever be involved in, because the emotion on that day here, four years ago, was quite extraordinary. The fact that it really meant something was tangible. As part of the proceedings, I received the glass coolamon. It was presented to Prime Minister Rudd and then Leader of the Opposition Nelson, who presented it to me in the chair. The people of this place, the people who work here, had it on display that afternoon; it is now appropriately displayed. It is a very, very important symbol—the coolamon, a tool of antiquity. Coolamons are usually carved or made from bark but this one was made of a more modern material, glass, and in the Indigenous colours as a symbol of the Indigenous flag. That coolamon is displayed here as a reminder. 


The function today was held at 10 o'clock but I had to leave because I had another thing to do. As I moved out, who should I bump into but Aunty Lorraine Peeters, who had actually presented the coolamon. Many things happen that make you think that these things are really meant to happen. I got to briefly say to her 'Welcome back' and things like that. Today's small ceremony was very important because of what it emphasised. The contributions that have been made by the member for Hasluck, the member for Canberra and the member for Riverina are important because they all recognise that we are still on a journey. For me personally, at a very small gathering in this place to celebrate what happened four years ago, my reading of it was that people were still walking together, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and that there was a determination to make things happen. That to me is very important.


The Stolen Generations Alliance gathers around a journey of healing, truth and justice. I think that is something that we should be very optimistic about, but it is a hard slog. It is not going to be easy. When we get into the political debate across the chamber it is right to keep each other honest, but I think that in this place there is a great deal more determination to rectify the wrongs of the past and to do the right thing that transcends the politics. We will have the argy-bargy about some of the methods, but importantly we still have to continue the dialogue. My friend Ken Wyatt described what the people of the stolen generation themselves are putting together as their view of the way forward, and that is important because that dialogue is going to be important in the way we move forward.


Today it is appropriate that we acknowledge by these short statements—although mine should have been shorter—our determination to see the task through. We recognise that this is a situation that requires all of us to work together in partnership, to listen, to continue to understand the hurt that there was and to see that things can be very positive in our determination to improve all those things that are important. The inquiry that the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs did was entitled Health is life. Why Health is life? We had a bit of difficulty finding a term or expression in an Indigenous language for health. We heard from the National Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Party that:


In Aboriginal society there is no word, term or expression for ‘health’ as it is understood in western society … The word as it is used in Western society almost defies translation but the nearest translation in an Aboriginal context would probably be a term such as ‘life is health is life’.


That is the important thing in so much of Indigenous culture that transcends our known bounds of definition—the association with the land and that type of thought about health. To our Indigenous brothers and sisters I indicate that I am pleased that the journey has a greater pace than when I was first elected to this place. It is not the end; it is part of the beginning. We should all be determined to ensure that the gaps are closed.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (18:04):  I wish to begin by acknowledging the traditional owners of Australia, wherever they may be. In particular, I acknowledge the special status of the Yorta Yorta, Bangarang and other Indigenous peoples in my electorate of Murray. Today I am recognising the anniversary of the national declaration of Sorry Day on 13 February 2008. This followed the motion of regret passed on 26 August 1999, moved by John Howard when he was Prime Minister, with words fashioned in consultation with Indigenous leaders of the day.


The problem continues to be that few Australians are closely familiar with the facts of the contact history of our country. We did have frontier wars as different Aboriginal nations fought to keep their land and defend their people. We did have native police, led by white officers with secret verbal instructions to 'track and disperse' the natives—a euphemism for shooting to kill. We did have slavery, which we called the indenturing system, whereby Indigenous children were forced into labour without pay, some from the age of six, with masters who could and did summon the police to track them down, punish them and return them to work when they escaped. We did have 'miscegenation policies', which is a euphemism for 'breed them white', when it was noticed that Aborigines of mixed descent were outnumbering so-called full bloods in many places and when the economy was desperately short of manual labourers.


These colonial and post-Federation policies are described in detail and documented in a series of royal commissions and parliamentary inquiries—in the House of Commons in the UK, in every Australian colonial parliament and then in the states and the Commonwealth after 1901. Page after page of sworn evidence gives a window onto the attitudes and policies which we find unthinkable today but which led to the need for the nation to collectively say sorry on 13 February 2008.


I think it is timely to be reminded of how far we have come as a nation in adjusting our attitudes and responses to the Indigenous peoples of Australia—the original owners. Today Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders are acknowledged with protocols and with respect where once they were mostly or only objects of sympathy or disgust or were racially vilified.


In 1977 my documentary history of official government policy and race relations was published after years of research. I still reach to these documentary extracts to remind myself—often—that the miracle is that Aboriginal people survived with their oldest living culture intact or evolved in many parts of modern Australia and that some of their languages survive but, most importantly, that their identity as Aboriginal peoples has never been stronger since the usurpation of their countries which began in earnest in 1788.


I want to read from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Papers, volume 2, part 2, 1929, when the Chief Protector, Mr Bleakley, reported on the conditions of the Aborigines and half-castes of Central Australia and North Australia. He reported under the heading 'Quadroons and octoroons' after going through various other headings describing full bloods, half-castes and so on:


As already indicated the crossbreed with a preponderance of white blood should be considered separately. Their blood entitles them to be given a chance to take their place in the white community and on as favourable a footing as possible. That this may be successfully accomplished, the children should be removed from aboriginal associations at the earliest possible age and given all the advantages in education and vocational training possible to white State children to minimise as far as possible the handicap of their colour and friendless circumstances.


He goes on:


To avoid the dangers of the blood call, employment should be found where they will not come into contact with aborigines or aboriginal half castes. In spite of such precautions however, a few will doubtless drift back, and it may be found advisable to allow, even encourage, the marriage of such difficult cases with crossbreeds of darker strain.


He continues:


While official supervision and control is essential in their own interests, any appearance of branding with the aboriginal stamp should be avoided so as not to hamper unduly their upward progress. For instance, a rigid application of the regulation rates of wages for aboriginals would be manifestly unfair, as, with equal opportunities for learning, many should prove as useful as the average European servant.


This advice and Bleakley's recommendation were already in play in some parts of Australia at that time—we are talking about the 1920s. Following this very significant report to the government they were taken up more seriously. The children were removed from their parents—often forcibly, of course, and often after a great deal of hunting and tracking by police to find those children. They were placed in missions and training institutions. These children are often referred to today as the stolen generations. But did governments of the day, whether state or Commonwealth or the nascent territory governments, in fact honour the misguided but philanthropic intentions of Chief Protector Bleakley and his like minded officials and members of parliament? Did they in fact protect and educate these children who were taken away? Sadly, the children removed to be educated and raised as white were too often neglected and abused.


In the House of Representatives Commonwealth parliamentary debates of 1939 to 1940, on 7 December my predecessor, the member for Murray, Sir John McEwen, complained about the condition of the Alice Springs shelter for half-castes. He said:


There I saw a state of affairs which honorable members will find it difficult to believe—120 half-caste children, and 13 or 14 adult fullblooded and half-caste women, the parents of some of the young half-caste children, living in that most deplorable old building, which, when it rained heavily, took in the water almost as if there were no roof at all. The dormitories were a disgrace. … 


The building was roofed with corrugated iron, and had a concrete floor, so that it must certainly have been too hot in summer and almost unbearably cold in winter. I know many stud stock breeders who would not dream of crowding their stock in the way that these half-caste children were huddled in this institution in Alice Springs. Today I see that there is not one penny of the estimates to correct the deplorable state of affairs that exists at Alice Springs. It is a shameful thing to allow it to continue.


Sir John went on to describe the so-called half-caste compound at Darwin as equally shocking and disturbing and without any relief in sight.


It is right that we remind Australian citizens of this parliament's 'sorry' motion, moved in parliament four years ago. We also need to remind ourselves of its forerunner under the Howard government in 1999 and the Reconciliation Council, which worked for a number of years. I was proudly a government representative on that council. We tried to put together something that in some way would be for all Australians a serious and real statement of reconciliation. We need to continue, however, to translate a sense of sorrow and regret into real actions and new commitments for all Australians.


I am very pleased to be the Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. We have just completed a study of adolescent youths in custody and we are now considering how to retain and restore Indigenous languages at the same time as helping all Indigenous children become fluent in English so that they can fully participate in the broader Australian society. This is important work, and I am constantly struck by the goodwill of those working in the fields of linguistics, education and policy making who stepped forward to give evidence to our inquiry. There were Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people from every background and from every part of Australia.


We have come a very long way from our often brutal colonial views and actions. We are a great nation with a great future for all Australians and our spirit of reconciliation is a lesson to be learned by many other countries struggling to reach the point that we are now at in our nation. But we must never forget the past as we build a better future. We must never forget that all things are possible when people from different parts of the country remember that we are in fact all humans with equal opportunities and with an equal sense of our own humanity.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (18:14):  I acknowledge the Ngunawal and the Ngambri peoples as the traditional custodians of the Canberra area and the Noongar people as the traditional custodians of south-west Australia, including my electorate of Fremantle. I would like to take this opportunity on the fourth anniversary of the national apology to Indigenous Australians, including the stolen generations, to acknowledge that remarkable day in this place and to express the wish that we will see the hopes of that day become reality in the foreseeable future. Australia has received international recognition for the apology, as well as for endorsing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Persons and for the implementation of the highly acclaimed Indigenous Electoral Participation Program. Of course, we now have a welcome to country at the opening of parliament and we acknowledge traditional custodians at the beginning of each parliamentary day. Importantly, we are presently embarked on a process to achieve constitutional recognition of Australia's first peoples. The government has also taken many positive initiatives under the Closing the Gap program, which will be detailed shortly in the annual statement by the Prime Minister.


However, the disturbing fact remains, at present, that Aboriginal people still suffer significantly poorer health, education and employment outcomes than non-Indigenous Australians and are vastly overrepresented in the criminal justice system. The appalling death of Aboriginal elder Mr Ward in the back of a prison van in early 2008 after a raft of failures by WA Police and a number of WA government departments and by the private contractor G4S and its employees remains emblematic of the challenges.


The disturbing events of Australia Day this year were, in my view, at least partly attributable to the overwhelming despair and frustration felt by many Aboriginal Australians over the ongoing plight of their communities. The dramatic scenes on Australia Day also serve to highlight the essential discomforting aspect of our national day. It is not a unifying event. The date of 26 January marks the start of white settlement in New South Wales 224 years ago. There is nothing about that date that unifies the nation in and of itself. It also marks the beginning of the dispossession of Australia's Indigenous populations from their lands, from their families and from their culture. Given the disadvantage still suffered by Aboriginal Australians, it is no wonder they object to a celebration of this nature.


We share our national date with India's Republic Day, which commemorates the coming into force of the Constitution of India on 26 January 1950 and the freedom struggle leading up to that event. Other nations, including the US and Bangladesh, celebrate their national day as the day they attained independence. Australia became a federation on 1 January 1901. The federal parliament first met on 9 May of that year. Australia became independent of British legal jurisdiction on 3 March 1986, when the Australia Act came into operation. These have been suggested as perhaps more appropriate days. I raise this matter in the hope that it will be part of a wider community discussion, as it seems to be something you only hear on and about Australia Day, which then gets forgotten until the following year. Perhaps it will naturally be a part of a revived national debate around an Australian republic.


Another matter I wish to raise in this place today is the lack of Aboriginal representation in the national parliament. While there have been a number of Aboriginal MPs in state and territory parliaments around the country, there has been only one Aboriginal representative in the House of Representatives, the member for Hasluck, Ken Wyatt, elected in August 2010, and prior to that only two Aboriginal representatives in the Senate.


In late 2010 I attended an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference on behalf of the Australian parliament on the subject of effective participation in politics of minorities and Indigenous peoples. The conference was held in Mexico in the state of Chiapas, which contains the largest indigenous population in Mexico. The conference discussed the fact that adequate representation of minorities and indigenous peoples in policy and decision making is instrumental in breaking the cycle of poverty, discrimination and disadvantage that many members of these groups suffer, but the fact remains that minorities and indigenous peoples often remain excluded from effective decision making, including in national parliaments.


It was noted that one of the criteria for a democratic parliament is that it should reflect the diversity of the population and ensure that all citizens can participate equally. It was felt that the presence of representatives of minorities and indigenous peoples in parliament is important both symbolically and substantively. Symbolically, it transmits a clear message that they are part of the national community and take part in decisions regarding the nation's future. Substantively, they can directly influence the work of the parliament and they can also promote the interests and concerns of their communities. But ultimately it is not just up to Aboriginal people and people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds to represent their communities' needs and concerns; it is up to all of us who want to see an inclusive parliament and a truly inclusive society.


The Chiapas Declaration made a number of recommendations, including that a debate be held in the national parliament on the representation of minorities and indigenous peoples and that a national plan of action be developed to make the right of equal participation and nondiscrimination a reality. The declaration also called upon political parties to promote the effective participation of minorities and indigenous peoples. I intend to move a motion relating to the Chiapas Declaration in the near future and I hope I will have the support of the whole parliament. As other speakers to this Sorry Day motion have noted, the original Sorry Day four years ago was, of course, not a final resolution but just the beginning of making things right. Some progress has been made and much remains to be done. As said so eloquently just now by the member for Scullin, we are on a journey together. I applaud the work of Reconciliation Australia, the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples, the Close the Gap campaign, the Deaths in Custody Watch Committee, Halo, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner and all those committed in this place and elsewhere to genuine progress and reconciliation, both substantive and symbolic, for Indigenous Australians.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-02-13,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (18:20):  I too want to acknowledge the Ngambri and Ngunawal people and pay my respects to elders, past and present, and also acknowledge the huge pride I feel when I walk with and learn from the Darug people who are part of the Chifley electorate. Too often the vision of our nation's parliament that is captured on nightly news, in media or elsewhere is one that focuses much on the conflict and the drama that tends to inhabit certain corners of this place. However, I think it would benefit the Australian community to, in some part, also witness the words and sentiments that are expressed in this place.


In particular I wish to draw attention to what has occurred here today in recognising Sorry Day and the contributions that have been made by a number of people including the member for Fremantle a few moments ago. I was also particularly impressed by the member for Murray and her powerful contribution. I came in at the tail-end of the member for Scullin's contribution. While he obviously played an enormously critical role to the parliament—a role that he has more recently occupied—not only does he bring to this chamber a voice of reason and regard but also he is something that we may also benefit from. I listened carefully to his contribution and I want to acknowledge the member for Scullin and what he had to say, particularly as reflected on by the member for Fremantle, that we are on a journey together and that the apology itself did not mark an end point but is something that we need to continually work from and aspire to make better.


Today, as every anniversary since the apology delivered by then Prime Minister Rudd, the Mount Druitt and District Reconciliation Group that operates in the electorate of Chifley commemorates the day usually at the Holy Family Centre at Emerton. Chifley, I am proud to say, is home to probably about 6,000 people from Aboriginal background and I am proud to represent and work with locals in advancing their interests in terms of developing a better future, not only for themselves but also for their kids.


Today they will welcome an extremely special guest, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Gooda. The group were particularly fond of an address that he provided to the National Press Club in November 2010. He spoke in that address about his commitment and the work that he would contribute towards the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I wanted to reflect on some of his words when he said:


It’s not about looking back.


It’s about looking forward and moving forward as one, united nation.


One mob under the Southern Cross.


That speech 'One mob under the Southern Cross' particularly enlivened the Mount Druitt and District Reconciliation Group. They saw that the speech signalled his priorities as a commissioner, and his words touched many which I wanted to quote today. He said:


Relationships are built on understanding, dialogue, tolerance, acceptance, respect, trust and reciprocated affection.


Relationships are destroyed by misunderstanding, intolerance, a lack of acceptance, a lack of dialogue, mistrust and a lack of respect.


It spoke not just to those at the National Press Club but to many people in our local area who were keen to see him and hear from him. My one regret is that, after badgering him and trying to, euphemistically, vigorously represent a desire for him to visit Chifley, I am not able to be present today for his address. But I am sure that he will leave a lasting impact, as he always does, and a lot of lessons that can be learned from his words.


I want to congratulate the Mount Druitt and District Reconciliation Group for the work they do. For the past 14 years, they have every May organised a reconciliation walk in Mount Druitt. It continues to grow and they had a particularly successful one last year. I would like to acknowledge in this place the selfless work of a number of people. It is not just once a year; they meet every month and work quietly within the community, building bridges but also inspiring others. I want to acknowledge Marguerite Tobin, the president, and Pat Smith, the secretary, and they are joined by Michael Maxwell, Lyn Leerson, Kim Martin, Uncle Greg Simms, Uncle Wes Marne and Holy Family at Emerton for the work they do in providing a platform and a base of support for the Mount Druitt reconciliation group and all the great work that they do.


The member for Murray indicated, and I was particularly happy that she made reference to the fact, that I too am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I sought to be on the committee, given that there are a lot of people in my neck of the woods whom I am keen to work with and advocate on behalf of. I was especially pleased that the committee took on the work of inquiring into Indigenous languages. I think that most people who have grown up where English is a second language recognise that a connection to one's mother tongue is important on so many levels, not the least of which is that it is the link between generations; it also forms a concrete bond with culture.


In large part this is not an esoteric exercise. This inquiry is important. People in the broader community want to engage in speaking English for a host of obvious reasons, but I think there has to be space within our education system to provide for people to be able to learn Indigenous languages, and in particular for the younger generations of Indigenous Australians to learn their mother tongue and be able to pass that on and transmit culture between generations. I certainly feel strongly about that. I look forward to government receiving the formal report of the committee's inquiry and taking tangible, concrete steps, because I think it is so vitally important in so many ways.


Again, it is an honour for me not only to participate in the debate but also to listen to contributions made by people who are setting such a great example for this parliament. As I said, I look forward to the outcome of a number of other important initiatives. As reflected on by the member for Scullin, and as I mentioned earlier in this contribution, we are all on the journey together and together we look forward to making some tangible and concrete improvements.


Debate adjourned.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (18:28):  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have always wanted to stand up in this place and call for more beer, and that is exactly what I am doing tonight. When my Twitter account became aware that this was coming before the House, I knew I was not alone. There are many people in Australia who also want to see some changes in support of the small beer makers of Australia. Whilst I am sure there are 101 jokes that can be made about a politician standing up in an Australian parliament to do this, when you look at the detail you can see there is enormous inequity being faced by small beer makers. I would hope that this parliament in all seriousness and in detail can consider making some changes in support of small business generally but also in support of Australian small brewers in particular. The origin of this motion can be found in the very different circumstances of one small business in my hometown of Port Macquarie compared to one big business that recently got sold internationally. The aptly named The Little Brewing Co. operates in Port Macquarie's industrial area. It is an award winning family business producing craft beers of distinction. In the lead-up to last year's October national tax forum, Kylie Little, one of the co-owners, announced that she was sick and tired of being a tax collector first and a brewer second.


Unlike small wineries, small brewers do not get a significant rebate of the excise on sales they must collect. They only get $10,000 back, which I think was introduced in 2000 during the Howard years and was at the time trying to recognise some of the inequities faced by small brewers trying to get off the ground. The excise currently, though, is holding back this business and other businesses like them. It is keeping them from growing and potentially employing new workers.


In the lead-up to last year's national tax forum as well, by comparison, the foreign-owned SABMiller announced its purchase of Fosters for more than $10 billion. So an era of big Australian breweries is all but ended with that announcement. There are one or two that you could still argue the case might be around, but really the majority now of the large former Australian owned breweries have gone and the Australian owned beer market is the small beer market in Australia. Therefore, I would hope in policy we can consider the inequities that we place before small beer makers as compared to their multinational cousins.


In 2000 the Howard government introduced the microbrewery refund to nurture the development of small craft breweries by rebating beer excise of up to $10,000 to brewers of less than 30,000 litres of beer a year. These levels have not moved in 12 years. The Australian Association of Microbrewers has campaigned for the rebate to be lifted to $500,000 to match the tax rebate available to small winemakers. A 2007 study suggested this reform could in fact increase government revenue by removing a major barrier to microbrewery growth. It is understood that more than half of Australia's microbrewers are regionally located and many are major tourist attractions, very similar to wineries.


Alcohol tax was off the agenda at the national tax forum, wrongly in my opinion. That is why I have brought this motion before this House. The major parties in the Senate have previously rejected a similar motion to this. However, that motion was highly prescriptive, containing a definitive change to the rebate threshold to 300,000 litres. So, in the interests of giving the major parties and every member of parliament room to move, this is simply a call for the rebate to be significantly lifted and, hopefully, in considerations leading up to this year's budget or in any of the considerations from the Treasurer and the executive, that lift of the rebate can occur. I trust that the merit of supporting small, often regional, Australian businesses against dominant foreign-owned competitors will compel all members of this chamber and the major parties and the executive to support this motion and to get to work on developing fairer tax arrangements for microbreweries in Australia.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (18:33):  I rise to speak in favour of the motion moved by the member for Lyne. Microbreweries are an important niche in Australia. We have a brewery in Townsville. It is more of a boutique brewery. A brewer and a worker in a brewery cost the same whether they are working for Lion Nathan, SABMiller or the Townsville Brewery. The production costs are extraordinarily outclassed. While Lion Nathan will do 100 million litres of beer per year, Townsville Brewery will do about 200,000. So the economy of scale and the cost per unit production is just so much. The Townsville Brewery, run by Peter Summers, is trying to go from being a quaint little tourist attraction and supplying local restaurants and a couple of niche hotels to also supplying bottle shops, to take that next step. It is a major punt by anyone trying to get into small business at the best of times, but getting into something that is so dominated by the giants of beer in Queensland is even harder. The member for Lyne said 'No beer jokes please,' but up there we call VB 'green death'—it is outlawed; it is visitors' beer; it is very bad. We are the home of XXXX Bitter, the world's greatest beer. I will not do the Wally Lewis ad.


My brewery in Townsville wants to provide a quality product. Their products include Ned's Red, Townsville Bitter, Belgian Blonde, Lager Lout, Digger's Golden Ale and Bandido Loco. They do the full gamut of beers. They are trying to not only provide a bit of local interest but develop a business. Increasing the excise return or increasing tax benefits to brewers, as wineries receive, would play a significant part in them being able to compete and take that next step. Whilst I appreciate the rebate on 30,000 litres, at 200,000 litres or even a million litres it would still only be one per cent of what a major brewer would be putting out in the market. On a scale of one to 10 of how it is going to hurt the economy, we are not talking big bickies.


Whilst I have the floor, I would like to say a couple things. While the government has done nothing to help microbreweries in the last four years, changes like those outlined in the motion would have a significant and positive impact on breweries like my brewery in Townsville. It is the difference between being able to sell their beer locally to restaurants and something more. The Townsville brewery is in the process of expanding their brewing capacity. Peter Summers has recently come to me with some red tape issues and red tape is the killer of all business. In this instance, to take that next step he has to install a bottling facility. It is Chinese made and required a Chinese engineer to come and install it. The absurd bureaucracy that is in place at the moment on immigration left the brewery floundering with painful production losses. They had to outlay the cash to buy the thing and bring it in here but they simply could not access staff to come into the country to put the thing together and get it to work. At every turn we say we are in favour of small business, and at every turn we say we are trying to get small businesses its just desserts, but at every turn we put up another hurdle in front of small business. The people in small business at the moment are saying they are tax collectors first. They are working in their business, not on their business. The problem was eventually solved, but not before a lot of toing and froing and a lot of lost capacity.


I support the member for Lyne on this issue and I believe that what we are trying to do in Australia is create a finer art of what beer actually is. We are now an international beer drinking nation. It is not that you are stuck with one brand for life. I do not mind South Australian beer. I love Tasmanian beer. New South Wales and Victorian beers still leave me a bit cold. Queensland beer is still the best in the world. We should be doing everything we can to support these industries because they do bring so much to regional communities.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (18:38):  I support this motion on microbrewing in Australia that has been brought before the House by the honourable member for Lyne. I moved a similar motion on this issue on 16 March 2009. This issue has not gone away. It is still here and it is still going on. The member for Herbert has just outlined the concerns within his electorate. I have five microbreweries in my electorate of Lyons. If we are to promote innovation in Australia, as the other two members have spoken about, we need to allow microbrewers to compete on an equal footing with boutique wineries, which are their competition. It is not really the big brewers—Boag's or Cascade in Tasmania—that the microbrewers are competing with. It is really about the people who drink with their lifestyle.


Microbrewers are suffering disadvantage because they pay considerably more tax than equivalent small wineries within the same region or within other regions. I do not believe they are asking for special treatment; they are just asking for equal treatment. I do not believe they are in the same argument as alcopops or anything like that, where it involves a bulk-buying exercise and drinking lots of alcohol, which causes the problems that we see within our electorates and especially around the major cities. It is an issue that has to be dealt with, as is bulk buying and advertising aimed at the young.


The main concern for microbrewers is the complexities and inequities of the tax system in relation to alcoholic beverages. I remember looking at this when I first moved a motion a few years ago. Excise taxes go back a long way, when you start thinking about Scotland and the whiskies. But it is a major issue for rural and regional Australia. They are major employers. They employ people and bring people into our area. In my state we get a cheese factory, a microbrewery and a small winery, which can turn around a region in good time. I am very concerned and we need to act on this.


There are seven microbreweries in Tasmania, five in my electorate. They value-add to farm produce. Some of them are primary producers, producing more than just beer. They produce on-farm stuff and value-add. I went to a microbrewery not long ago and saw the barley growing on the other side of the hill. It is a pretty special thing to be able to grow the barley near the brewery and bring it down and malt it and make the beer. They also grew beef and other produce there.


Tourism is coming along. A meadery is being built and there is also a hop garden. The old hops are part of the tourism opportunities around a microbrewery. So there are very productive and innovative projects adding to the economy in Tasmania, as we have heard from members from other parts of our country. We need to build on this. The government have not been backward. I understand that the government have assisted and they are very sympathetic to the arguments being put forward. I understand there has been some reform in the small business sector here. They used to have to pay excise within seven days, but they can now get it out to 21 days or 51 days. That is a plus. We are also broadly delivering value tax relief to about 2.7 million Australian small businesses. There is also the issue of the mining tax, which will give opportunities for small business to write down assets of $6,500. (Time expired)

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2012-02-13,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (18:43):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. Microbreweries are unique and important businesses in Australia. They are very valuable to our economic growth. These breweries also provide significant job opportunities across Australia, both directly and indirectly: directly through production, sales, marketing and administration and, indirectly, they play a role through the tourism industry by attracting business to their brewing facilities through tours and taste testing.


Microbrewers are often referred to as craft brewers. They produce a fairly limited amount of beer—around 30,000 litres per year, although that is not a hard and fast definition. From a consumer perspective, they are known for their uniqueness in taste and marketing and for their innovation. These craft brewers are the classic Australian manufacturers, making local products for a local market, although of course the export market remains a viable option as always. Within my electorate of McPherson, on the Gold Coast, I am fortunate enough to have a microbrewery, which supports our local economy and helps contribute to a great niche industry throughout Australia. The microbrewery is of course the Burleigh Brewing Co. It is one of the leading microbreweries in Queensland and is the Gold Coast's only craft brewery. Burleigh Brewing Co. combines tradition and innovation in brewing a variety of beers. I must make special note of one of their gold-medal-winning beers, known as My Wife's Bitter—it deserves special mention just for its name.


In 2006 the Burleigh Brewing Co. was launched by local husband-and-wife team Brennan and Peta Fielding. Brennan is the brew master at Burleigh Brewing Co. and provides one of the vital ingredients to their success. He has over 20 years experience, including time as an international judge. It is a tribute to this local business that its beers have won so many awards, including four world championship gold medals for four different beers in its line-up, which is a fantastic achievement. It is great to see a local manufacturer recognised for its achievements. This local business brand has been described as a cross between 'monk-like tradition', in deference to the European monks who brewed many beers, and 'cool surfing living', so it is very Gold Coast unique.


The Gold Coast is of course filled with manufacturers and businesses which epitomise the ambition and success that we applaud in Australian small businesses. As a local brewery, the Burleigh Brewing Co. uses all Australian made packaging and employs 12 locals in its facility at Burleigh. I have had the opportunity to visit this facility on a number of occasions and it is most impressive. I have spoken to them and to other brewers and have really spent a lot of time trying to work through with them what the issues for their businesses are. I will speak to some of those very briefly. According to the company's own figures, beer excise now represents approximately $12 to $15 per carton of their craft beer. Based on these figures, and given the downward price pressure on the Australian beer market and the rate of excise growth over the last couple of decades, that represents about 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the company's revenue. That is a significant hit to them. The excise is payable by the brewer the minute that the beer leaves the brewery and well before the brewery has been paid for its beer. An excise report has to be prepared and paid every single week, which is a huge administrative and cash flow burden to these smaller breweries.


From the customer side, the Australian brewing market is now dominated by two major chains: Coles and Woolworths. For small suppliers in the markets this has a couple of significant effects. There is very little price elasticity for the brewers to raise their wholesale price at the same rate that the beer excise increases, because the chains are able and in a good position to put downward pressure on prices. There is no room for the smaller suppliers to negotiate terms of trade, with 90 days being the norm. This is a big issue for the microbreweries and is one that I have been delighted to speak on tonight.


Debate adjourned.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (20:44):  I rise with a grievance on behalf of the people of Bennelong, a grievance that lies central to nearly every complaint I have received from my constituents: the lack of planning, the lack of infrastructure and the lack of policy direction. Yet to address our future needs we first must understand our history: where we have come from and what we have learnt along the way.


Australia is justly proud of the legend of the digger: the bravest of men who have come from amongst us in times of peril, courageous in the face of fire and fair dinkum heroes. As we commemorate the 70th anniversary of the bombing of Darwin, we remember the courage they showed to preserve our freedom and our liberty. There have been other heroes: from those first settlers, willing or not, and those who were imposed upon and suffered every tragedy of a battlefield but who now welcome us to their country. The early pioneers survived the harshest of conditions and built our first great industry. After waves of conflict came good times, riding the sheep's back, and then enormous growth stimulated by immigrants seeking a better life from the devastation of Europe. 'She'll be right' and 'the lucky country' were accurate descriptions of our state of affairs: freedom assured by our willingness to fight for it and opportunities created and converted through hard work. Our luck has improved with mineral assets found coinciding with unprecedented demand and the world's most populous states becoming great economic powers, conveniently located in our region. You cannot beat good luck.


We have liberty, we have wealth and we have established a reputation as a loyal ally beyond question and as a trustworthy and honourable trading partner, despite recent aberrant behaviour. What is the next battle, and where will we find our next goldmine? When there are no wars, and when we have mined and exported our last ounce of luck, what will we have built with our hard-fought freedom and wealth from good fortune to preserve our way of life for future generations?


Courage in the face of fire must now be replaced with the courage to develop a vision for a great future: the courage to dream, to stimulate imagination and to unite all Australians to this purpose. This capacity will define our future heroes. One of the truisms of life is that the only constant is change, and so our next war is that very challenge—to deal with change, to value our freedoms, to be the trustees and custodians of our great wealth and to develop and realise our opportunities.


The next war is the battle of opportunity not to be lost. Our greatest challenge is to have the courage to dream, to imagine and to commit to the development of vision for a greater future. It is not good enough just to save—that would result in denying our potential. It would be disrespectful to our heroes to waste our liberty and not to realise all that our freedom can achieve. To plunder our wealth that has arrived through good fortune and hard work would be the ultimate insult to anyone who has ever tended a flock, dug a hole or built a dam.


The former member for Bennelong and Prime Minister John Howard once said that our country needs people of broad life experience who have the capacity to develop policies, because government should be won by the presentation of superior policies and government should only be retained as a result of the delivery of those policies. With the responsibility of our wealth, our liberty and our people, plans must be developed through a process of unrestrained imagination—great vision that is tested and scrutinised through the most rigorous processes but protected from those enemies within who would prioritise their own personal gain.


Australia has never had a national plan of development. Our growth has been random and ad hoc. Without a plan we have recently arrived at the confounding situation where Sydney has the second highest land prices in the world, second to Hong Kong, when our nation's single greatest asset is land—we still have boundless plains to share. Without a plan of settlement we have living costs in our major cities that are amongst the highest in the world, and congestion to match. My electorate of Bennelong is a perfect example of inappropriate amounts of high-density housing coupled with an absolute lack of infrastructure development. We once had the highest standards of living for the highest numbers of people—indeed a commonwealth. This has been eroded to a point where the cost-of-living increases are the inverse of our quality of life. Productivity and international competitiveness eroded; our true potential stifled—what to do?


A real estate developer evaluates a green site. When it stacks up, they will secure the site, build infrastructure, subdivide and sell. Wealth will have been created for the individual and opportunities for productivity for the community. Some developers will take risks and many will fail, proportionate to that risk. Experienced developers will be more conservative and spend more time and resources in evaluating the potential of a site, resulting in more certainty of wealth generation.


Where are the green sites prime for such development on a national scale? How much wealth can be created? How much will it cost? And how can this be achieved without imprisoning us in debt? What investment is required in infrastructure to be the catalyst not only for wealth creation but to provide the pressure release valve for cost-of-living pressures in our major cities whilst creating productivity and improving our quality of life?


When our two major cities form the fourth busiest air corridor in the world, yet are still linked only by a single track of rail and two lanes of highway in some parts, alarm bells should be ringing. This represents a national infrastructure deficit of serious proportions stifling our country's potential. It is clear that with no comprehensive strategic plan and no commitment to infrastructure this war will be lost.


When last considered, very fast trains were dismissed because of the likelihood of operational losses. Is that it? Is that the extent of thorough debate, when a government meets before a barbecue with butchers paper and pencils? This attitude is penny wise but pound foolish. Imagine if the same approach had been taken with the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The £6.2 million cost was not viewed as a profit-making exercise, yet the billions of dollars in land value uplift and productivity increases have repaid that investment many times over. It is a matter of historical record that the bridge was completed during the depths of the Great Depression. What do we need now during the heights of our mining boom?


What would happen if very fast trains were considered in full, if collateral benefits were weighed against the cost of a ticket? What is the development potential of the tract of land between Sydney and Melbourne? What infrastructure could be contemplated to increase land values in Albury, Goulburn, Gundagai and Wagga to provide infinite growth to our regions and relief from housing cost pressures in our major cities? What impact on productivity would development in this region have, and what wealth would be created? Should special interest groups be empowered to block such initiatives for their own personal gain?


The final judgment on our performance in dealing with our opportunities gained on battlefields of freedom and wealth gains from good fortune and hard work by previous generations is the path that we now choose. It is imperative that we master-plan our nation's development with a vision towards the next 50 to 100 years, not a policy that only sees as far as the next election. Ill-conceived projects hastily implemented that encumber future generations with debt should gain the harshest judgment. It is not good enough for us to simply sit, content with the spoils of those who confronted the hardship of a pioneer and had the courage to bring their all to that challenge. This is not worthy of those who risked all on the battlefield, made the perilous trip over oceans, found a way across the mountains or perished in total commitment, like Burke and Wills. We owe them action to grow our nation, to prove that their inspiration is alive in our veins to confront our own modern challenges.


It is time to face this next foe with the same courage, this time armed with vision from a liberated imagination and a future greater than the one envisaged by those who did not dare to dream. Perhaps we can embrace that future whilst riding on the back of a very fast train, opening up our boundless plains for industry, for jobs, facilitating growth and productivity. Then we would have made our own luck, and she would be all right.
