"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-02-25,"—I, and also on behalf of Senator Milne, move:
That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 17 June 2010:
The toxicity of the George River in north-east Tasmania, with particular reference to:
possible causes, including the potential impact of leachate from Eucalyptus nitens plantations;
the impact of the toxicity on human heath, wildlife and regional oyster farms;
previous investigations into the toxicity of the George River and any consequent actions, including whether the actions of local, state and federal governments and the private sector have been adequate;
whether past selective breeding or genetic modification of plantation trees has deliberately or inadvertently increased the trees’ toxicity and whether any risk assessments or monitoring of impacts have been conducted;
the current breeding programs for eucalyptus species and any ecological and human health implications of current research into reducing foliage palatability;
possible short- and long-term mitigation measures; and
any related matters.
This is now a matter of intense national interest following the Australian Story episodes in the last two weeks on the work of Dr Bleaney, a GP in St Helens in Tasmania, and Dr Marcus Scammell, a scientist from Sydney, pointing to the potential impact of toxins from Eucalyptus nitens plantations being a factor in the death of fisheries, particularly shell fisheries in the George River, and the intake of water from that river to the citizens of St Helens potentially causing a rise in cancer and other health issues in St Helens, which is Dr Bleaney’s concern. Added to that is speculation that the facial tumour disease which is now ravaging and decimating Tasmania’s Tasmanian devil population began in the north-east of Tasmania and has spread rapidly to much of the rest of the state, excepting now the south-western and western corners.
We do not know—it has not been established—what the cause of these problems is. But we do know that, for example, in 2004, following a flood tide down the George River, 90 per cent of the shellfish died. There has been speculation about atrazine and other spray-on chemicals, both for agricultural and forestry purposes, being the culprit. But now the very logical case is that it may be toxins coming from Eucalyptus nitens, an imported eucalypt species from Victoria, the grandchildren of which are in these plantations in the St Helens catchment.
We cannot prejudge this issue, but it is a time-honoured role for the Senate to investigate such matters when they are of such national interest. An inquiry has been established under the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania but, once again, people in St Helens, including Dr Bleaney, have expressed some reservation about that inquiry being too close to government. Similar inquiries have never stopped the Senate investigating such critical matters as this in the past. It is a logical and simple concept that the Senate and its committee system are very well placed, and in fact have an obligation and a responsibility if the issue is raised in here, to undertake such an inquiry. Senator Milne and I are asking the Senate to refer this matter to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee.
I have no doubt that we will hear from Labor, if not Liberal, that this is a stunt—the usual terminology used to dismiss it. But studied ignorance is never excusable. If there is not support from the bigger parties, there can be no other argument than studied ignorance here. It is the right of the citizens who are concerned about the impacts of toxins on their water, whatever the cause may be, to have the Senate committee system come to their assistance to help sort that out. I would think the Senate committee system has the reach not only to get to the science of this—local, national and international—but to ensure through its own processes or recommendations that, where there are gaps in the science, they too are looked at.
I note that the industry in Tasmania has welcomed a proper inquiry into this matter. I therefore can see no argument against it. My ear to the ground tells me that the government and the opposition may well be wanting to obstruct this matter. I am sure that if that happens there will be a bit more in the public arena about it, because it is just not sensible to do so. It is not responsible to do so. In my opinion—I am being very serious about this—it would be a crude and rude political obstruction of the public’s right to know through the Senate committee system. This is a search for knowledge. It is not prejudging what the case is. On the information we have, it would be welcomed by the industry, by the citizens who live in the north-east region, by Tasmanians generally and, I have no doubt, Australians generally. It is a also a very serious matter if there are toxins coming from plantations, whether they be from what is applied to them or from the trees themselves that have been planted—and I do not call that natural, because plantations are not natural. We should be looking at that.
This is a copybook case of a matter of public interest that the Senate committee system should be looking into. It would be quite irresponsible for senators to simply dismiss this as a political matter that should not be looked into. This is a real matter affecting the health of real people, affecting the livelihoods of real people, affecting the jobs of real people and concerning many, many people in the community. Of course, if there is no answer to be forthcoming from it, let us find that out. If there is a genuine culprit for the disturbing effects on the shellfish alone, let us find that out. None of us can say that has not happened and is not continuing to happen and that it is not continuing to worry the shellfish producers in this region. If we cannot find the culprit let it be so. If we can help to find it through the Senate committee system, we should responsibly be moving to do that.
I congratulate Australian Story. I congratulate Dr Bleaney and Dr Scammell and the oyster farmers and mussel growers, the people who have put so much effort into trying to find out what it is that is so clearly and definitely troubling them. It has been a long, long road. They deserve now to have not just an airing of the claims they are making but a testing of the science which goes with those claims and a look at the alternatives. That is what our Senate system does, that is what our Senate system is set up to do and that is the responsible course of action for us to be taking in this Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,13,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2010-02-25,"—Senator Brown is correct when he says that this is a serious matter, although I have to reject the assertions that he makes about the motives of the opposition. He is quite free in his attribution of motive. It is a regular thing that he does in this place and it is the way that he plays his politics. But I have to say, on behalf of the opposition, I utterly reject the assertions that he ascribes to the opposition in this matter. Obviously he is quite free to make them. That is part of the process that occurs here. But this is a serious matter and the opposition’s view on this is that we ought to put the science before the politics.
The allegations that were raised in the Australian Story programs over the last two weeks are quite serious, but the science on that is quite new. It is not something that has been put in the public arena before and it has not been peer reviewed. Like the industry in Tasmania, I welcome the process that has been put in place through the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania to conduct a proper review of the circumstances that are occurring in the George River, including doing some testing in other rivers around Tasmania so that they can have something to compare it to and so that some comparative testing can be done. I think that is more than appropriate. But, unlike Senator Bob Brown, I would like the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania to be able to conduct its review, and the Director of Public Health in Tasmania has indicated his willingness to have an independent panel with people from outside Tasmania, outside Australia if necessary, to bring in the necessary skills and qualifications to properly assess this matter.
Let us get that done. Let us investigate the science. Let us investigate the allegations that are being made. I note that Senator Brown and Senator Milne are making accusations of genetic modification of the trees. We know that is not true. Those allegations are out there broadly in the media that the trees are being genetically modified. We know though, and the reality is, that it is a matter of selection of strong-growth trees from progeny that are brought through the breeding programs. This is a breeding program that has led to high-growth trees to bring high productivity to an industry that is an important one to Tasmania and an important one to the country.
There is already an enormous amount of hyperbole. Suppositions have been drawn from the results of the research which were put to air on Australian Story last week. Links have not been proven but allegations have been made, and I for one think that it is quite reasonable for the Senate to see what the science says. I think Senator Brown’s comments are quite correct. If gaps in the science are identified following that process, I think it is quite appropriate that the Senate, having done that, moves to investigate the issue.
But this is a very new allegation. It has not yet been peer reviewed. It has not been considered on a broader scale. You can go to almost any river in Tasmania and see colour and foam. They are a feature of the rivers in Tasmania. In fact the west coast of Tasmania is well known for the tea-coloured water in its rivers, the tannins that come from the natural countryside. There are scientists in Tasmania talking today about the fact that there will be natural chemicals in the waterways in Tasmania based on the run-off and leaching from the natural environment.
As Senator Brown correctly says, plantations are a change in the environment. But it is quite interesting to note that going back into the 1990s Senator Brown and the Greens were telling us that we should get out of native forests and move to plantations for our forestry. They have been saying that for a long time, that we should get out of native forests and into plantations for our forestry. Senator Milne said yesterday in this place that up to 80 per cent, she believed, of the George River catchment was planted in plantations. My understanding is that it is five per cent. So here we have another example of the hyperbole being brought into argument already by the Greens.
So I think that it is more than reasonable to get some verification of the science, and that independent assessment has been welcomed by the industry in Tasmania. They understand that if there is a problem there it needs to be managed and it needs to be dealt with. The Director of Public Health in Tasmania understands that if there is a problem there it needs to be considered and dealt with. We likewise understand, and we welcome that the Tasmanian government has, quite rightly, put in place this process that will bring in the best experts to consider the issues that are being raised.
Senator Brown says that this is an urgent issue and it needs to be dealt with straightaway. Why haven’t the Greens brought a motion into this place to deal with toxic run-off or alleged toxic issues in Rosebery in Tasmania? They are quite selective in the issues that they bring forward. There is equal community concern in that community about toxicity in the groundwater from the mining industry, yet nothing has been heard from the Greens about that. They have been telling us for 10 years that we should get out of native forests and into plantations for our forestry. In fact in November at estimates Senator Milne alleged that we could move all of our forestry needs to plantation timbers. She asked questions of the department about moving all of our forestry operations out of native forests and into plantations. That was the point she was making. Yet here they are saying that we should not have plantations and making allegations against plantations and their damage to human health.
There is a real inconsistency to the arguments that the Greens bring forward. Senator Brown asked questions about the Forest Stewardship Council at estimates back in February. Quite fairly, I think, he asked about funding for the Forest Stewardship Council certification system. The council will not certify anything but plantation forestry in Australia, basically because of the political process that is involved with that.
—No, the logic and science.
—Senator Brown, I am pleased that you mentioned the science, because the science shows that if you want to look after biodiversity, if you want to look after carbon sequestration—which I know that you are quite passionate about—you will have long-term rotation in native forests. That is what the science says. The science is correct and the science is quite clear: if you want to look after biodiversity, if you want to look after sequestration of carbon, you will have long-term rotation in native forests. The science is very clear. Yet we have this confused and conflicting position from the Greens continuously on this issue. The only conclusion that you can come to is that they are anti-forestry.
I did not want to get this into an utterly political process here this morning, but I have because of the assertions and allegations that were made by Senator Brown about the motives of the coalition. We support fully a thorough investigation of this by the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania, utilising the best scientists, and understanding the science which, as we all agree, is quite new. These are new developments. So I support that process and it should be allowed to run its course. If then there are proved to be issues that need to be dealt with by this place, come back and have a talk to us, because I am more than happy to talk to you about it. I think that is appropriate. But let us get the science dealt with before we deal with the politics.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,13,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-02-25,"—I rise today to support the motion standing in the names of Senator Brown and me. Very clearly there needs to be an independent inquiry into what is causing the toxicity in the George River in the north-east of Tasmania. That is very clear. What is also clear is that you cannot trust the Tasmanian government to oversee an inquiry into the toxicity of that river. Why is that? It is because the allegations of toxicity in the river are not new. These have been going on for a very long time, and the Tasmanian government is condemned by its own ministers who appeared on national television saying that it is not a problem and who accused Dr Bleaney and Dr Scammell of quackery. Minister Kons at that time said ‘quackery’. Minister Llewellyn, who has overseen some of the worst environmental disasters in Tasmania in his long career, continues to say it is fresh water—fresh water killed the oysters in George Bay, says Minister Llewellyn, who has blocked at every single opportunity, as has Premier Bartlett, as has the Liberal Party in Tasmania, the move to end the use of triazines in Tasmania. Back in the early nineties when Forestry Tasmania poisoned Olivers Creek at Lorinna in northern Tasmania, atrazine in the water was coming out of the taps in that community. Full responsibility was taken, in the end, after a considerable argument, and recompense was made, tanks were put in and various other things occurred in communities around Tasmania.
For Senator Colbeck to suggest that the Greens have not been working on issues of water quality in relation to forestry activity is ludicrous. Go back to the Hansard. It is years and years and years, and it is still my view that triazines should be banned. We did finally achieve a moratorium in Tasmania for a short while when Evan Rolley, who was head of Forestry Tasmania, was forced into it. Then, eventually, they said, ‘Oh no, we have to go back to the use of triazines.’ Now we still have atrazine used in private forestry in Tasmania. Europe has banned these chemicals for a long time.
What is the relevance of this to the toxicity of the George River in north-east Tasmania? The relevance is that had the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania ever had the will to investigate, had Dr Taylor ever had the will to investigate, they would have found that there are pulses of pesticides coming down that river. We do not know what the chemical cocktail of that river is, nor do we know what the combination of the herbicides and pesticides used in the catchments and the toxicity coming from the non-native to Tasmania, Eucalyptus nitens, is actually doing. We do not know what the combination is doing. Have we had the opportunity find out? Oh, yes we have. But the problem here is that the director of the EPA ,Warren Jones, was also the general manager of the environment division and under Warren Jones’s authority there was a study into the water quality in the George River in 2005. That investigation discovered toxins. But what did it do? Absolutely nothing. It decided not to investigate further. So why would I trust an inquiry from the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania under the jurisdiction of the Tasmanian government that in 2005 decided, when it knew there were toxins in the water, that it would not investigate further? That is what it decided to do—the environment division simply concluded in 2005, on the basis of no evidence at all, that the toxins ‘are produced by native forests’ and therefore okay. We find that the toxins being referred to at the moment are not caused by native forests; they are caused by a eucalypt that is not native to Tasmania, Eucalyptus nitens.
Now to the issue of genetic improvement. There is some confusion in the community about the difference between genetic improvement and genetic modification.
—Which you are happy to exploit.
—Senator Colbeck just accused me of having said that these trees were genetically modified. I have never said that. What I said was that they have been selectively bred—genetically improved—in order to address issues that the forest industry thought it needed to address, including palatability, no doubt, to browsing species and insect attack. That is why one of the issues in the inquiry that I would like to look at is the current breeding programs for eucalyptus species and any ecological and human health implications of current research into reducing foliage palatability. We know that research is going on in the hope, from forestry’s point of view, that they can increase the level of unpalatable leaves to browsing animals. That is part of research is currently ongoing and I would like to know about that because I want to know about the impacts—not just on human health but also on wildlife. What public interest tests and what wildlife tests are there?
But the issue here is that we need to know what is going on in the George River and in catchments around Tasmania. We have been pushing for groundwater assessments in every Tasmanian catchment for I cannot tell you how long, and that has been blocked by the minister in Tasmania and the Tasmanian cabinet with the support of the Liberal Party for the last 20 years. That is why the Commonwealth is not signing off on a lot of the water initiatives in Tasmania—there is no monitoring of water quality in a lot of the groundwater in Tasmania.
—That’s not true; we funded it.
—We do not know what is in that groundwater around Tasmania. I challenge Senator Colbeck to produce any results that show water quality assessment of groundwater—consistently taken and monitored—in Tasmania over the last 20 years. That has only started in the last couple of years under pressure. You cannot get water quality groundwater testing consistently conducted across Tasmania.
I want to get to the Director of Public Health, Roscoe Taylor, who has said consistently since the Australian Story broadcast: ‘I need to see your results. Send them to me.’ Well, they were sent. A paper published at a scientific conference held in Spain on the impact on human cell lines was sent to Dr Taylor in 2008 by Dr Bleaney and Dr Scammell. Dr Taylor had that in 2008 but he did not open the file. When he said this week, ‘Oh, well, I will look at it, I need to see the research,’ he did not have to look any further than his own files to find that research. It has been there since 2008. So why would I trust an inquiry set up by the Tasmanian government, overseen by an Environment Protection Authority which looked at this in 2005 and said, ‘There is no problem, it comes from native forests, it is natural, therefore even though there are toxins we are not going to investigate further’? Why would I think that that was going to come to any other conclusion than that presided over by the current minister, who says the problem is caused by fresh water—‘There is too much fresh water; that is what kills oysters, all that fresh water going down the George River’?
There is a real problem in Tasmania. There is no transparency. There is a far too close relationship between the Tasmanian government, Forestry Tasmania and the private forest industry and there is no independence. Why should a community have had to fight so hard to have an investigation of toxicity in their water supply? You would think that was basic human health delivery and service from a government. But, no, not in Tasmania. If it comes to a choice between seriously looking at the forest industry and banning the chemicals on which it relies or actually exposing the human health consequences, then it will not happen in Tasmania. It did not happen under the previous premiers of Tasmania—Premier Bacon, Premier Lennon—or now Premier Bartlett. It is not happening, it will not happen and you could not trust it to happen because of their relationships with the forest industry.
We have heard Premier Bartlett saying now he is concerned. Where was the concern in 2005 when the EPA discovered there was toxicity but there was no need for further investigation? Where is the concern now when we discover that the file exists in the public health offices, that nothing has been done about it and that it was not opened until the media ran this story and shocked people? Quite apart from all this, the reason an investigation by the Senate is absolutely necessary is that now the whole country knows that the George River in north-eastern Tasmania has high levels of toxicity. The country will know, when the research comes out, that there are pulses in that river of a chemical cocktail going down. It will also know, contrary to what is being said, that the toxicity will be found right through the water column, not just on the surface, as has been suggested.
When the whole of Australia finds all that out, the reputation of Tasmania will be on the line. It should be in the interests of this parliament to clarify this as soon as possible and address it in a transparent and open way. I can tell you, whatever the EPA in Tasmania finds out, nobody is going to believe it because of their history of failure to address this issue in the past. That is why it needs to be an independent inquiry. What the community wants is an independent inquiry, not one under the auspices of people who have failed the community in the past and who have demonstrated a complete lack of concern about the impacts of forestry, chemical use in the forest industry, the breeding programs by forestry and so on.
Tasmania prides itself on a reputation of clean, green and clever. It prides itself on a reputation of clean air, clean water and uncontaminated soil—no thanks to either the coalition parties or to the Labor Party. That positioning has come from the Greens. That positioning has come from the campaign essentially to save the Franklin River. It was out of that that the global reputation began to be established and it was throughout the Wesley Vale campaign that I coined the phrase ‘clean and green for Tasmania’. We brought out our business and industry strategy saying Tasmania’s future reputation should be based on high-quality products, clean air, clean water, uncontaminated soil, an island where human potential knows no bounds, where creativity comes from the natural environment, where protection of the natural environment builds for the future. That was the Greens positioning, Greens business modelling and positioning, and now every export market out of Tasmania depends on that modelling, thanks to the Greens. It has been Liberal and Labor in Tasmania who have been jeopardising the branding for years because they continually undermine the authenticity of the brand by overlooking the pollution that goes on, whether it is from the mining industry or from the forest industry or from the widespread use of chemicals, and because of the refusal to have an open and transparent regime.
The reason we need this inquiry, and we need it to be fast, comprehensive and independent, is that this has to be clarified as a matter of urgency. Our export markets are going to be saying now, ‘Tasmanian product is dependent on a clean brand internationally and now we have evidence to show that the George River in north-east Tasmania has a high level of toxicity.’ We also want to know from the point of view of the people in St Helens. This is a small fishing town in Tasmania. It has no heavy industry. There is no reason you would expect why there is a cancer cluster of the nature that there is in this town. You cannot explain it. How can you explain all these cancers occurring in a fishing village where there has been no history of those cancers, where there is no heavy industry and no obvious forms of contamination? Why are cancers that you would never never or rarely see as a doctor all turning up in one community?
This has to be investigated for public health reasons. It has to be investigated for the sake of people who live in that community now and want to know what the future is for their water supply. But it also has to be investigated because of the reputation of Tasmanian product—everything from oysters through to beer. One of the ads for one of the breweries is ‘There’s something different about the water in Tasmania’. That is going to turn on that company very fast unless we get an inquiry to find out what is going on.
There is confusion about the genetic processes and what has been going on in the research. On 9 November 2000, Senator Brown asked about this issue. On that particular day, Senator Herron, the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, confirmed the Forestry Tasmania website statement by telling the world that research by the University of Tasmania was genetically transforming Eucalyptus nitens and Eucalyptus globulus. Since then they have talked about their genetic improvement programs. So it is hardly surprising that people have become confused about what genetic improvement is as opposed to genetic modification. The industry has said it is involved not in genetic modification but in improved selective breeding—genetic enhancements, if you like—which is normal in all agricultural production processes. The issue here is: what are they being improved to do? Is that increasing toxicity? Is that toxicity impacting on human health and wildlife and ecosystem health? As they are spraying triazines in Tasmania, in combination with other chemicals, what impact is that chemical cocktail having? That is why we need this inquiry.
Senator Colbeck says, ‘Let’s put the science before the politics.’ One could almost choke hearing him say that, given the behaviour of the coalition when it comes to climate change. The world’s leading scientists everywhere are telling us about the impacts of climate change and Senator Abetz declared yesterday that he is an agnostic on the science. There are plenty on that side denying the science—denying, denying, denying. They are most certainly not putting the science before politics when it comes to their position on global warming. That is pretty evident. They have not done so on just about every other issue and they are not doing it now. If they were genuinely interested in getting to the facts of the matter as quickly as possible, they would be calling on the Tasmanian government to institute an independent inquiry—independent of government.
The reason the government in Tasmania is so on the nose is the lack of transparency. For years and years people have wanted to know what is going on in the little cabal between the Tasmanian government and the bureaucracy. We saw it with the grants in the forest industry. The Department of Economic Development, Tourism and the Arts got together with the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania and recommended who should get the grants. In fact, the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania managed to get some of the grants for themselves through that process. There is no line in the sand, as the Premier of Tasmania put it, between him, his office and Evan Rolley in his department. Then there is a link from Mark Addis, from the Forest Industries Association, straight across to the bureaucracy that is heading up resources. They are all there, all mates together. They are all one phone call away.
There is no degree of separation in Tasmania when it comes to the forest industry, the Tasmanian government, the bureaucracy and the Premier’s office. That is why you cannot trust the EPA in Tasmania to conduct an investigation of the kind that needs to be made. The Senate should start that process. Tasmania’s producers deserve it. Tasmania’s community deserves it. Public health deserves that we have an inquiry as quickly as possible but also that we insist that there be an independent inquiry. As I indicated earlier, why would you trust the EPA to look into this now when the EPA said in 2005 that although there was toxicity it was from native forests—which it clearly is not—and therefore they would not investigate further? I think it really demonstrates who is calling the shots here.
Senator Heffernan was running around after the program aired the other night, saying, ‘We have to have an inquiry!’ Clearly, he was quashed by Senator Abetz and Senator Colbeck from Tasmania. He is not in here now, but he was absolutely motivated about it. He rang the other night and said, ‘We have to have an inquiry.’ I hope Senator Heffernan comes in here in a moment to tell us about how the Liberal Party and Senator Abetz prevented him from coming in here to speak or to support an inquiry. Where is he? He is quoted in some of the media on this, which says that people must support Senator Heffernan’s inquiry. Where is his inquiry? It is nowhere, because Senator Abetz is taking his directions from the forest industry in Tasmania. No doubt Senator Colbeck is too. No doubt Senator O’Brien will be taking his directions from the Tasmanian Premier. They will be hoping that all this suddenly goes quiet until 20 March, when the election will be held in Tasmania. They will not want to see an independent inquiry getting started in that time. This Senate has an obligation to public health, to the health of our wildlife and to the health of the ecosystem to do something about it. (Time expired)

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2010-02-25,"—The government do not rule out the concept of an inquiry into issues relating to the George River in Tasmania or other related matters. But we do think that it is appropriate that there are proper scientific examinations before this thing becomes the political football that, clearly, if you listened to Senator Milne’s speech, it would be intended to be, were the Senate to initiate the inquiry. There are a few points that I want to touch on. Suffice to say we will not be supporting this motion at this time.
I noted from Senator Milne’s speech that we are enjoined not to trust the Tasmanian government. I thought there was a democratic process going on there at the moment, an election campaign in which the Greens were campaigning to become the government. So do I take it from the speech that Senator Milne has given up on the chances of the Greens becoming part of the, if not the, government? Is that what I should take from the speech? Or is this part of the campaign leading up to the Tasmanian election on 20 March? I am not sure what to make of it. I do not want to jump into the bed of conspiracy theorists, but you would have to say that Senator Milne and Senator Bob Brown agree with all of the suggestions that were made in Senator Milne’s 20-minute contribution.
She talked about cancer clusters, which I understand have been the subject of an examination by Dr Roscoe Taylor. Despite the attempts to blacken Dr Taylor’s name, he is a fairly respected practitioner and the Chief Medical Officer in Tasmania. I understand he has looked at medical records held by Dr Bleaney. He or members of his department are on the public record as saying that there is no evidence that can be ascertained from Dr Bleaney’s records that shows a disproportion of particular types of cancers there compared to anywhere else. But I am no expert on that and, if we are going to start examining that, how do we examine it without access to all the medical records in that area? It is a very difficult problem and something that I suggest the Senate committee would not be able to do.
On the question of the coalition’s position on climate change, I share Senator Milne’s concerns that, on the one hand, talking about carbon sequestration in trees, as Senator Colbeck did, and, on the other hand, voting against the motion is a bit hypocritical. But didn’t the Greens also vote against the bill? If the five Greens sitting in that corner had crossed the chamber and voted with the government, we would have passed the legislation, but they chose not to. So I think it is a bit rich for the Greens to talk about hypocrisy on climate change when that was the Greens position on that vote.
On the question that was raised about triazines, the fact is that some sections of both forestry and agriculture use triazines on genetically modified canola, and there is a fair bit of that in Tasmania. There is also a fair bit of that in other parts of the country. On the other hand, there is a significant part of the green movement that says, ‘We should not have GM canola; we should only have non-GM canola.’ But the regime for that uses triazines. So there are a lot of points of difference that I could raise with the contribution that has just been made.
I go back to what Senator Colbeck said earlier. This matter has been put in the public domain by the Australian Story program. My understanding of the reports is that there was an allegation on the program that there is a toxic cocktail which is attributable to plantation Eucalyptus nitens in the foam on the Georges River and that that is having deleterious effects on both the oysters in Georges Bay and human beings. This is a very serious allegation. Quite properly, the Chief Medical Officer, on behalf of the Tasmanian government, has said, ‘I’d like to look at this, and we’re prepared to investigate it.’ I am told that, according to reports, the response was, ‘We’ll go and see our lawyers.’
I have said in this place that I find that to be a remarkable response from a group who have been prepared to go public with an allegation which damages the reputation of Tasmania while saying: ‘We won’t give you our research; go and see our lawyers. You’ll also have to satisfy the third party involved before we’ll give you the research.’ Until and unless there is a preparedness to share their research and allow it to be investigated, as Senator Colbeck said, not just by scientists and medical practitioners in Tasmania but also by those in other parts of the country or even internationally, I would be very reluctant to support the idea of jumping into what is clearly going to be a very political exercise on behalf of the Greens, pursuing their opposition to forest industries generally and besmirching the reputation of Tasmania, before we have had a chance to have access to some peer reviewing of the allegations that have been made and some proper scientific assessment of this catchment and others. Eucalyptus nitens are not only in the Georges River catchment. The suggestion in the allegation is that this will be a very widespread problem if it is a problem in that catchment.
I would much rather we have the benefit of properly conducted research if the Senate committee is going to have a look at this. What is the next step in the proposition that we have an inquiry—that somehow the Senate funds the research? At the end of the day, maybe that would be necessary, but I would much prefer that the public health bodies around this country were involved in that before it became a political football.
The government will not be supporting the reference to a committee of this matter at this time. We do not reject the concept in the future after those steps have been taken. If Senators Milne and Brown are worried about what the Tasmanian government might do, I guess they are giving up on Mr McKim’s chances of being part of the Tasmanian government in any capacity following the election on 20 March.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,13,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-02-25,"—It seems that there is always a convenient ABC story when there is an election in the air, and this edition of Australian Story is one of those. In the run-up to the last federal election, the ABC had a story on the 7.30 Report, if I recall correctly, about forestry and the impact of that and the Gunns mill on Bass Strait. The ABC was later reluctantly forced to put some corrections on the website. Before that, I recall that the ABC had a segment called Lord of the Forest, for which they were dragged kicking and screaming until they finally had to air an apology and a correction. The ABC has a very sad and sorry history in this space, so I would caution the Senate against relying on ABC stories for a Senate inquiry. Having said that, I do not prejudge that edition of Australian Story. There may well be some basis to it and it may be completely correct. All I am saying is that the track record of the ABC in this space ain’t great and I therefore question it.
The Greens are always keen on accountability and administration for others, but they have been strangely silent about the expensive brawl going on within the Wilderness Society as we speak. There have been court challenges, and, of course, we know that the Wilderness Society is the industrial arm of the Australian Greens and that there is a cross-pollination between those two organisations like you would not believe. Indeed, Senator Brown was a former director of it, if I recall correctly. What you have is the old guard fighting the new guard, with people claiming the democratic processes are not being followed—but do you know what? There has been not a peep out of the Australian Greens as to the terrible administration within the Wilderness Society, with court brawls, internal brawls, the leaking of minutes and all sorts of things. They have been strangely silent because they are partners with the Wilderness Society.
In relation to the quite outrageous allegation by Senator Milne about Senator Heffernan, I simply say: Senator Heffernan and I have not even discussed the matter. Yet she comes in here and seeks to impugn the integrity of both me and Senator Heffernan. I should not take exception to it, because that is the modus operandi of the Greens. They will say anything and do anything regardless of the facts and the circumstances. They do not need facts for their public statements and press releases. If it sounds good, just say it and, of course, never apologise afterwards. But I can say on the record here and now: Senator Heffernan and I have not discussed the Australian Story program, and why Senator Heffernan is not in the chamber I do not know.
What I do know is that, if we want to talk about the science, there are very credible scientists such Professor Gordon Duff, Dr Chris Harwood, Dr Julianne O’Reilly-Wapstra, Professor Brad Potts and Professor Jim Reid, all of whom have contributed a scientifically rigorous statement to my local paper today. They say:
No eucalypt plantations in the catchment, or anywhere else in Australia, use trees altered through genetic engineering.
I either believe the Greens’ assertion on this or these highly eminently qualified professors and doctors. At this stage of the proceedings, chances I prefer the professors and the doctors over the Greens, who are ramping up their exposure in the lead-up to the state election in Tasmania. And let’s make no bones about this: that is what this is all part and parcel of—the campaign in Tasmania. These good professors and doctors also tell us that the trees that are grown come from seeds that are grown in seed orchards and:
… have been selected in field trials for their superior growth and wood quality. They have not been selected for increased toxicity.
Whom should I believe? The professors and the doctors or the Australian Greens in here with a political agenda? I would simply commend the article. It is on page 19 of the Hobart Mercury.
I say, with respect to all honourable senators here: why should this Senate be engaged in this inquiry? There are issues of toxicity in my home state of Tasmania at Rosebery in relation to the mining industry. There are these issues all around Australia. So the question has to be asked: why this one in Tasmania now? The answer: state election, 20 March, and the Greens are simply trying to ramp it up to secure their position in Tasmania.
Let the science take its course. Let the investigations continue. For Senator Milne to basically besmirch everybody in the EPA in Tasmania does her no credit and, of course, is a very unfortunate reflection on people who are professionals. You might disagree with their science; you might disagree with the way they go about their business; but the personal reflections on them—that you would not trust them et cetera—as is always the wont with the Greens, go not a step but a leap too far. We in the coalition will be opposing the motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-02-25,"—I thank those who have contributed to this debate. To comment on that contribution from Senator Abetz, the view that the ABC in some way or another concocted this to be a pre-election program of course is absurd. Anybody else but Senator Abetz would know that. You might ask, Senator Abetz: who was it, then, that got involved in rigging the Black River bombing two days before the 1993 election? It had a big impact on that election and came from the forest industry. The culprits were never found, of course, but it was a massive, direct and planned attack on the Greens, who were doing extremely well at that time—it was nothing to do with the Greens. But Senator Abetz has never called for an inquiry into that.
When we get real evidence of a planned effort to intervene in politics and to set people up and it comes from the philosophical side that Senator Abetz is on, you never hear the call for an inquiry. But, when the Australian Broadcasting Corporation comes up with a program like this, which has obviously been a long time in the making, he immediately fits it out as being political intervention. That is politics, but it does nothing for the argument, and nor was there any cogent argument from Senator Abetz—or Senator Colbeck or Senator O’Brien—that this inquiry that Senator Milne and I are requesting the Senate refer to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee should not go ahead. The argument, of course, that it is pre-election is very much in their minds, both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. They do not want an inquiry in the run to the election because they do not want a proper public expose of the processes and the cover-ups that have occurred as citizens like Dr Bleaney and scientists like Marcus Scammell have tried to get assistance, the assistance they should have got, from departments, governments and industry to try to work out what is affecting the ecosystems downstream of the plantations in the George River basin.
This is a classic case of an area where the Senate inquiry would do best. It is not that a Senate inquiry might uncover the causal agent—the actual toxin—but it is that a Senate inquiry can see where there are gaps and where there are questions to be answered and it can put those recommendations to government so that the information can be found out. The other thing about a Senate inquiry is that it can open doors. When you hear that the health department in Tasmania was given a report from Dr Bleaney in 2008 and it had not been opened until very recent times, you wonder how on earth you can have advocates now saying that all the documents from the scientists that she has been working with should be given for peer review but we keep a closed door on the information held by government, not least by industry, because there is a lockdown on information in Tasmania.
Senator O’Brien referred to the smearing of the reputation of Tasmania. The logging industry in Tasmania, with its destruction of ecosystems, including the habitat of rare and endangered species, with its pollution of waterways and with its massive contribution—in fact, more than the rest of the Tasmanian economy put together—to greenhouse gas pollution of the atmosphere, which is all unpaid for and at great cost to taxpayers, including more than $1 billion in handouts from state and federal governments in the last two decades, has of itself been the biggest cause of the smearing of the reputation of Tasmania that one can discover. This industry needs cleaning up; this industry needs opening up; this industry needs to pay its way for the damage it does. But you get cover-up and you get the sort of situation we see now where citizens are trying to find out what it is that ails them or their water or their industries and they simply get condemned, by implication, that they do not have peer review. It is said that all their information should be handed to the loaded, biased industry boffins in government, like Minister Llewellyn—one of the most hopeless and destructive. Talk about smirching the reputation of Tasmania! Can there ever have been a minister who has so shepherded the destruction of what is good for Tasmania? There was the clean, green image and the right of new clean, green and organic agriculture, which finds itself in the vicinity of highly polluting industries like forestry, which sprays atrazine and other toxins into the air and the water catchments. The use of 1080 by this industry brought dreadful publicity worldwide and it continues in Tasmania. It results in the long and painful death of marsupial species, including those that are rare and endangered.
The smearing of the reputation of Tasmania by that industry and the damage done by it—so high-handedly and arrogantly, with weak and spineless politicians in Tasmania from the big parties shepherding it all away—speaks for itself. It is time we got past that. No wonder the Greens are indeed at 29 per cent, when you distribute preferences in the polls in Tasmania. No wonder people are looking for an alternative. No wonder they are looking for more security about the future economy of Tasmania through the Greens. We have seen such serial failure by Labor and Liberal governments.
I come back to the case in point. We do need to find out what is in the water of not only the St Helens catchments but also other catchments across Tasmania. It comes from a change in the natural ecosystems which provide clean, fresh water to people downstream, farmlands and aquatic industries. We should be monitoring that all the way, but you cannot have that where you have closed industries, secrecy and failure of openness to the public. There is the forest industry and Forestry Tasmania. Corporations like Gunns, of course, have a very unenviable record in high-handedness, obfuscation and cover-up when the public have a right to know.
Senator Colbeck said that the Greens have said that we should get out of native forests and move to plantations. He is a new player, relatively speaking, in this place. He sits on the second row and is unable to get the story straight. The Greens have always condemned the destruction of native forests and their replacement with plantations since the 1970s when the woodchip industry brought such carnage to Tasmania, and we continue to do so. If the Greens had had their say, there would be no Eucalyptus nitens plantations replacing old-growth forests and native forests in the George River catchment and we would have a North East Highlands National Park instead of the continued erosion and destruction at a rapid rate of the native forest ecosystems and the habitats of rare and endangered species in the hinterland of St Helens, Swansea, Bicheno and the whole of the east coast of Tasmania.
One only has to think about the rapid destruction of the habitat of the swift parrot, the fastest parrot on earth. This parrot is now down to a thousand pairs, which are just now preparing, after their breeding season in Tasmania, to come back to the mainland. Forestry Tasmania, aided by the parties of Senator Abetz and Senator O’Brien, is in the business of destroying the nesting sites which this rare species depends upon if it is going to survive. You cannot destroy the nursery if you are going to move to recover such a species from destruction.
I laud Dr Alison Bleaney, Dr Marcus Scammell and all the other scientists who have had their work displayed by Australian Story. This is not just a story of citizens who had a hunch, a worry or a phobia. This is a story backed up by the work of more than half-a-dozen laboratories in Australia and New Zealand. It is a story of scientists who are prepared to go on the record and talk about a toxin which is killing human cells in the laboratory. It does not necessarily mean that it will be injurious to health if it is drunk in water coming down a river, but given that there is a toxin which is going to kill skin and liver cells, is it not right that this Senate should hold an inquiry to find out if it is affecting the citizens of St Helens and citizens further downstream, and not only concerning Eucalyptus nitens, whether it is growing in plantations or naturally on the mainland—because it does not occur naturally in Tasmania—but other eucalypt species as well? Of course we should be. Of course it is a time for the airing of the very serious concerns that people have about their health, their natural environment and their future ability to be free of fear from the hidden toxins which so far have not been exactly identified.
And what if you are a blue mussel farmer in the George River catchment and you have a flood pulse come down the river and 90 per cent of your stock is killed? Don’t you have a right to be worried about that? And do you worry when it is just dismissed by a health authority who says, ‘Oh, it is fresh water’? Of course you do, and of course, for the sake of those small businesses, we should be having an inquiry into this. This is an abrogation of responsibility by the Labor and Liberal parties. Senator Heffernan has called for this Senate inquiry and has called, responsibly, for a scientific inquiry; but he has not prevailed with his Liberal colleagues. I will say this of Senator Heffernan: he has taken a keen interest in plantations, whether they be in Tasmania or on the mainland, not only because of their potential indirect effects, as in this case, on water systems, but also because of the direct effects, such as the plantations taking water out of catchments further down. He is concerned about this issue but, of course, in our party system the person who knows the most is very often the person who has the least say when it comes to an issue like having an inquiry.
Senator Heffernan has called for an inquiry, and I think he is right. Senator Abetz says, ‘We oppose an inquiry.’ I think he is wrong. Senator Colbeck says, ‘Let us not have an inquiry.’ I think he is wrong. Senator O’Brien says, ‘We won’t support an inquiry; we’ll put it off until some other time.’ We have heard that before, and he is wrong as well. Senator Milne and I are serious about this inquiry. It is the logical and responsible thing for political representatives, not least those of us from Tasmania, to be undertaking. For the citizens and the industries and scientists involved it is an abrogation of responsibility by the Labor and Liberal parties that they are going to block a simple inquiry into a very serious matter.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator Bob Brown’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-02-25,"—I, and also on behalf of Senator Milne, move:
That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 17 June 2010:
The toxicity of the George River in north-east Tasmania, with particular reference to:
possible causes, including the potential impact of leachate from Eucalyptus nitens plantations;
the impact of the toxicity on human heath, wildlife and regional oyster farms;
previous investigations into the toxicity of the George River and any consequent actions, including whether the actions of local, state and federal governments and the private sector have been adequate;
whether past selective breeding or genetic modification of plantation trees has deliberately or inadvertently increased the trees’ toxicity and whether any risk assessments or monitoring of impacts have been conducted;
the current breeding programs for eucalyptus species and any ecological and human health implications of current research into reducing foliage palatability;
possible short- and long-term mitigation measures; and
any related matters.
This is now a matter of intense national interest following the Australian Story episodes in the last two weeks on the work of Dr Bleaney, a GP in St Helens in Tasmania, and Dr Marcus Scammell, a scientist from Sydney, pointing to the potential impact of toxins from Eucalyptus nitens plantations being a factor in the death of fisheries, particularly shell fisheries in the George River, and the intake of water from that river to the citizens of St Helens potentially causing a rise in cancer and other health issues in St Helens, which is Dr Bleaney’s concern. Added to that is speculation that the facial tumour disease which is now ravaging and decimating Tasmania’s Tasmanian devil population began in the north-east of Tasmania and has spread rapidly to much of the rest of the state, excepting now the south-western and western corners.
We do not know—it has not been established—what the cause of these problems is. But we do know that, for example, in 2004, following a flood tide down the George River, 90 per cent of the shellfish died. There has been speculation about atrazine and other spray-on chemicals, both for agricultural and forestry purposes, being the culprit. But now the very logical case is that it may be toxins coming from Eucalyptus nitens, an imported eucalypt species from Victoria, the grandchildren of which are in these plantations in the St Helens catchment.
We cannot prejudge this issue, but it is a time-honoured role for the Senate to investigate such matters when they are of such national interest. An inquiry has been established under the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania but, once again, people in St Helens, including Dr Bleaney, have expressed some reservation about that inquiry being too close to government. Similar inquiries have never stopped the Senate investigating such critical matters as this in the past. It is a logical and simple concept that the Senate and its committee system are very well placed, and in fact have an obligation and a responsibility if the issue is raised in here, to undertake such an inquiry. Senator Milne and I are asking the Senate to refer this matter to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee.
I have no doubt that we will hear from Labor, if not Liberal, that this is a stunt—the usual terminology used to dismiss it. But studied ignorance is never excusable. If there is not support from the bigger parties, there can be no other argument than studied ignorance here. It is the right of the citizens who are concerned about the impacts of toxins on their water, whatever the cause may be, to have the Senate committee system come to their assistance to help sort that out. I would think the Senate committee system has the reach not only to get to the science of this—local, national and international—but to ensure through its own processes or recommendations that, where there are gaps in the science, they too are looked at.
I note that the industry in Tasmania has welcomed a proper inquiry into this matter. I therefore can see no argument against it. My ear to the ground tells me that the government and the opposition may well be wanting to obstruct this matter. I am sure that if that happens there will be a bit more in the public arena about it, because it is just not sensible to do so. It is not responsible to do so. In my opinion—I am being very serious about this—it would be a crude and rude political obstruction of the public’s right to know through the Senate committee system. This is a search for knowledge. It is not prejudging what the case is. On the information we have, it would be welcomed by the industry, by the citizens who live in the north-east region, by Tasmanians generally and, I have no doubt, Australians generally. It is a also a very serious matter if there are toxins coming from plantations, whether they be from what is applied to them or from the trees themselves that have been planted—and I do not call that natural, because plantations are not natural. We should be looking at that.
This is a copybook case of a matter of public interest that the Senate committee system should be looking into. It would be quite irresponsible for senators to simply dismiss this as a political matter that should not be looked into. This is a real matter affecting the health of real people, affecting the livelihoods of real people, affecting the jobs of real people and concerning many, many people in the community. Of course, if there is no answer to be forthcoming from it, let us find that out. If there is a genuine culprit for the disturbing effects on the shellfish alone, let us find that out. None of us can say that has not happened and is not continuing to happen and that it is not continuing to worry the shellfish producers in this region. If we cannot find the culprit let it be so. If we can help to find it through the Senate committee system, we should responsibly be moving to do that.
I congratulate Australian Story. I congratulate Dr Bleaney and Dr Scammell and the oyster farmers and mussel growers, the people who have put so much effort into trying to find out what it is that is so clearly and definitely troubling them. It has been a long, long road. They deserve now to have not just an airing of the claims they are making but a testing of the science which goes with those claims and a look at the alternatives. That is what our Senate system does, that is what our Senate system is set up to do and that is the responsible course of action for us to be taking in this Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,13,2,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2010-02-25,"—Senator Brown is correct when he says that this is a serious matter, although I have to reject the assertions that he makes about the motives of the opposition. He is quite free in his attribution of motive. It is a regular thing that he does in this place and it is the way that he plays his politics. But I have to say, on behalf of the opposition, I utterly reject the assertions that he ascribes to the opposition in this matter. Obviously he is quite free to make them. That is part of the process that occurs here. But this is a serious matter and the opposition’s view on this is that we ought to put the science before the politics.
The allegations that were raised in the Australian Story programs over the last two weeks are quite serious, but the science on that is quite new. It is not something that has been put in the public arena before and it has not been peer reviewed. Like the industry in Tasmania, I welcome the process that has been put in place through the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania to conduct a proper review of the circumstances that are occurring in the George River, including doing some testing in other rivers around Tasmania so that they can have something to compare it to and so that some comparative testing can be done. I think that is more than appropriate. But, unlike Senator Bob Brown, I would like the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania to be able to conduct its review, and the Director of Public Health in Tasmania has indicated his willingness to have an independent panel with people from outside Tasmania, outside Australia if necessary, to bring in the necessary skills and qualifications to properly assess this matter.
Let us get that done. Let us investigate the science. Let us investigate the allegations that are being made. I note that Senator Brown and Senator Milne are making accusations of genetic modification of the trees. We know that is not true. Those allegations are out there broadly in the media that the trees are being genetically modified. We know though, and the reality is, that it is a matter of selection of strong-growth trees from progeny that are brought through the breeding programs. This is a breeding program that has led to high-growth trees to bring high productivity to an industry that is an important one to Tasmania and an important one to the country.
There is already an enormous amount of hyperbole. Suppositions have been drawn from the results of the research which were put to air on Australian Story last week. Links have not been proven but allegations have been made, and I for one think that it is quite reasonable for the Senate to see what the science says. I think Senator Brown’s comments are quite correct. If gaps in the science are identified following that process, I think it is quite appropriate that the Senate, having done that, moves to investigate the issue.
But this is a very new allegation. It has not yet been peer reviewed. It has not been considered on a broader scale. You can go to almost any river in Tasmania and see colour and foam. They are a feature of the rivers in Tasmania. In fact the west coast of Tasmania is well known for the tea-coloured water in its rivers, the tannins that come from the natural countryside. There are scientists in Tasmania talking today about the fact that there will be natural chemicals in the waterways in Tasmania based on the run-off and leaching from the natural environment.
As Senator Brown correctly says, plantations are a change in the environment. But it is quite interesting to note that going back into the 1990s Senator Brown and the Greens were telling us that we should get out of native forests and move to plantations for our forestry. They have been saying that for a long time, that we should get out of native forests and into plantations for our forestry. Senator Milne said yesterday in this place that up to 80 per cent, she believed, of the George River catchment was planted in plantations. My understanding is that it is five per cent. So here we have another example of the hyperbole being brought into argument already by the Greens.
So I think that it is more than reasonable to get some verification of the science, and that independent assessment has been welcomed by the industry in Tasmania. They understand that if there is a problem there it needs to be managed and it needs to be dealt with. The Director of Public Health in Tasmania understands that if there is a problem there it needs to be considered and dealt with. We likewise understand, and we welcome that the Tasmanian government has, quite rightly, put in place this process that will bring in the best experts to consider the issues that are being raised.
Senator Brown says that this is an urgent issue and it needs to be dealt with straightaway. Why haven’t the Greens brought a motion into this place to deal with toxic run-off or alleged toxic issues in Rosebery in Tasmania? They are quite selective in the issues that they bring forward. There is equal community concern in that community about toxicity in the groundwater from the mining industry, yet nothing has been heard from the Greens about that. They have been telling us for 10 years that we should get out of native forests and into plantations for our forestry. In fact in November at estimates Senator Milne alleged that we could move all of our forestry needs to plantation timbers. She asked questions of the department about moving all of our forestry operations out of native forests and into plantations. That was the point she was making. Yet here they are saying that we should not have plantations and making allegations against plantations and their damage to human health.
There is a real inconsistency to the arguments that the Greens bring forward. Senator Brown asked questions about the Forest Stewardship Council at estimates back in February. Quite fairly, I think, he asked about funding for the Forest Stewardship Council certification system. The council will not certify anything but plantation forestry in Australia, basically because of the political process that is involved with that.
—No, the logic and science.
—Senator Brown, I am pleased that you mentioned the science, because the science shows that if you want to look after biodiversity, if you want to look after carbon sequestration—which I know that you are quite passionate about—you will have long-term rotation in native forests. That is what the science says. The science is correct and the science is quite clear: if you want to look after biodiversity, if you want to look after sequestration of carbon, you will have long-term rotation in native forests. The science is very clear. Yet we have this confused and conflicting position from the Greens continuously on this issue. The only conclusion that you can come to is that they are anti-forestry.
I did not want to get this into an utterly political process here this morning, but I have because of the assertions and allegations that were made by Senator Brown about the motives of the coalition. We support fully a thorough investigation of this by the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania, utilising the best scientists, and understanding the science which, as we all agree, is quite new. These are new developments. So I support that process and it should be allowed to run its course. If then there are proved to be issues that need to be dealt with by this place, come back and have a talk to us, because I am more than happy to talk to you about it. I think that is appropriate. But let us get the science dealt with before we deal with the politics.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,13,2,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2010-02-25,"—I rise today to support the motion standing in the names of Senator Brown and me. Very clearly there needs to be an independent inquiry into what is causing the toxicity in the George River in the north-east of Tasmania. That is very clear. What is also clear is that you cannot trust the Tasmanian government to oversee an inquiry into the toxicity of that river. Why is that? It is because the allegations of toxicity in the river are not new. These have been going on for a very long time, and the Tasmanian government is condemned by its own ministers who appeared on national television saying that it is not a problem and who accused Dr Bleaney and Dr Scammell of quackery. Minister Kons at that time said ‘quackery’. Minister Llewellyn, who has overseen some of the worst environmental disasters in Tasmania in his long career, continues to say it is fresh water—fresh water killed the oysters in George Bay, says Minister Llewellyn, who has blocked at every single opportunity, as has Premier Bartlett, as has the Liberal Party in Tasmania, the move to end the use of triazines in Tasmania. Back in the early nineties when Forestry Tasmania poisoned Olivers Creek at Lorinna in northern Tasmania, atrazine in the water was coming out of the taps in that community. Full responsibility was taken, in the end, after a considerable argument, and recompense was made, tanks were put in and various other things occurred in communities around Tasmania.
For Senator Colbeck to suggest that the Greens have not been working on issues of water quality in relation to forestry activity is ludicrous. Go back to the Hansard. It is years and years and years, and it is still my view that triazines should be banned. We did finally achieve a moratorium in Tasmania for a short while when Evan Rolley, who was head of Forestry Tasmania, was forced into it. Then, eventually, they said, ‘Oh no, we have to go back to the use of triazines.’ Now we still have atrazine used in private forestry in Tasmania. Europe has banned these chemicals for a long time.
What is the relevance of this to the toxicity of the George River in north-east Tasmania? The relevance is that had the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania ever had the will to investigate, had Dr Taylor ever had the will to investigate, they would have found that there are pulses of pesticides coming down that river. We do not know what the chemical cocktail of that river is, nor do we know what the combination of the herbicides and pesticides used in the catchments and the toxicity coming from the non-native to Tasmania, Eucalyptus nitens, is actually doing. We do not know what the combination is doing. Have we had the opportunity find out? Oh, yes we have. But the problem here is that the director of the EPA ,Warren Jones, was also the general manager of the environment division and under Warren Jones’s authority there was a study into the water quality in the George River in 2005. That investigation discovered toxins. But what did it do? Absolutely nothing. It decided not to investigate further. So why would I trust an inquiry from the Environment Protection Authority in Tasmania under the jurisdiction of the Tasmanian government that in 2005 decided, when it knew there were toxins in the water, that it would not investigate further? That is what it decided to do—the environment division simply concluded in 2005, on the basis of no evidence at all, that the toxins ‘are produced by native forests’ and therefore okay. We find that the toxins being referred to at the moment are not caused by native forests; they are caused by a eucalypt that is not native to Tasmania, Eucalyptus nitens.
Now to the issue of genetic improvement. There is some confusion in the community about the difference between genetic improvement and genetic modification.
—Which you are happy to exploit.
—Senator Colbeck just accused me of having said that these trees were genetically modified. I have never said that. What I said was that they have been selectively bred—genetically improved—in order to address issues that the forest industry thought it needed to address, including palatability, no doubt, to browsing species and insect attack. That is why one of the issues in the inquiry that I would like to look at is the current breeding programs for eucalyptus species and any ecological and human health implications of current research into reducing foliage palatability. We know that research is going on in the hope, from forestry’s point of view, that they can increase the level of unpalatable leaves to browsing animals. That is part of research is currently ongoing and I would like to know about that because I want to know about the impacts—not just on human health but also on wildlife. What public interest tests and what wildlife tests are there?
But the issue here is that we need to know what is going on in the George River and in catchments around Tasmania. We have been pushing for groundwater assessments in every Tasmanian catchment for I cannot tell you how long, and that has been blocked by the minister in Tasmania and the Tasmanian cabinet with the support of the Liberal Party for the last 20 years. That is why the Commonwealth is not signing off on a lot of the water initiatives in Tasmania—there is no monitoring of water quality in a lot of the groundwater in Tasmania.
—That’s not true; we funded it.
—We do not know what is in that groundwater around Tasmania. I challenge Senator Colbeck to produce any results that show water quality assessment of groundwater—consistently taken and monitored—in Tasmania over the last 20 years. That has only started in the last couple of years under pressure. You cannot get water quality groundwater testing consistently conducted across Tasmania.
I want to get to the Director of Public Health, Roscoe Taylor, who has said consistently since the Australian Story broadcast: ‘I need to see your results. Send them to me.’ Well, they were sent. A paper published at a scientific conference held in Spain on the impact on human cell lines was sent to Dr Taylor in 2008 by Dr Bleaney and Dr Scammell. Dr Taylor had that in 2008 but he did not open the file. When he said this week, ‘Oh, well, I will look at it, I need to see the research,’ he did not have to look any further than his own files to find that research. It has been there since 2008. So why would I trust an inquiry set up by the Tasmanian government, overseen by an Environment Protection Authority which looked at this in 2005 and said, ‘There is no problem, it comes from native forests, it is natural, therefore even though there are toxins we are not going to investigate further’? Why would I think that that was going to come to any other conclusion than that presided over by the current minister, who says the problem is caused by fresh water—‘There is too much fresh water; that is what kills oysters, all that fresh water going down the George River’?
There is a real problem in Tasmania. There is no transparency. There is a far too close relationship between the Tasmanian government, Forestry Tasmania and the private forest industry and there is no independence. Why should a community have had to fight so hard to have an investigation of toxicity in their water supply? You would think that was basic human health delivery and service from a government. But, no, not in Tasmania. If it comes to a choice between seriously looking at the forest industry and banning the chemicals on which it relies or actually exposing the human health consequences, then it will not happen in Tasmania. It did not happen under the previous premiers of Tasmania—Premier Bacon, Premier Lennon—or now Premier Bartlett. It is not happening, it will not happen and you could not trust it to happen because of their relationships with the forest industry.
We have heard Premier Bartlett saying now he is concerned. Where was the concern in 2005 when the EPA discovered there was toxicity but there was no need for further investigation? Where is the concern now when we discover that the file exists in the public health offices, that nothing has been done about it and that it was not opened until the media ran this story and shocked people? Quite apart from all this, the reason an investigation by the Senate is absolutely necessary is that now the whole country knows that the George River in north-eastern Tasmania has high levels of toxicity. The country will know, when the research comes out, that there are pulses in that river of a chemical cocktail going down. It will also know, contrary to what is being said, that the toxicity will be found right through the water column, not just on the surface, as has been suggested.
When the whole of Australia finds all that out, the reputation of Tasmania will be on the line. It should be in the interests of this parliament to clarify this as soon as possible and address it in a transparent and open way. I can tell you, whatever the EPA in Tasmania finds out, nobody is going to believe it because of their history of failure to address this issue in the past. That is why it needs to be an independent inquiry. What the community wants is an independent inquiry, not one under the auspices of people who have failed the community in the past and who have demonstrated a complete lack of concern about the impacts of forestry, chemical use in the forest industry, the breeding programs by forestry and so on.
Tasmania prides itself on a reputation of clean, green and clever. It prides itself on a reputation of clean air, clean water and uncontaminated soil—no thanks to either the coalition parties or to the Labor Party. That positioning has come from the Greens. That positioning has come from the campaign essentially to save the Franklin River. It was out of that that the global reputation began to be established and it was throughout the Wesley Vale campaign that I coined the phrase ‘clean and green for Tasmania’. We brought out our business and industry strategy saying Tasmania’s future reputation should be based on high-quality products, clean air, clean water, uncontaminated soil, an island where human potential knows no bounds, where creativity comes from the natural environment, where protection of the natural environment builds for the future. That was the Greens positioning, Greens business modelling and positioning, and now every export market out of Tasmania depends on that modelling, thanks to the Greens. It has been Liberal and Labor in Tasmania who have been jeopardising the branding for years because they continually undermine the authenticity of the brand by overlooking the pollution that goes on, whether it is from the mining industry or from the forest industry or from the widespread use of chemicals, and because of the refusal to have an open and transparent regime.
The reason we need this inquiry, and we need it to be fast, comprehensive and independent, is that this has to be clarified as a matter of urgency. Our export markets are going to be saying now, ‘Tasmanian product is dependent on a clean brand internationally and now we have evidence to show that the George River in north-east Tasmania has a high level of toxicity.’ We also want to know from the point of view of the people in St Helens. This is a small fishing town in Tasmania. It has no heavy industry. There is no reason you would expect why there is a cancer cluster of the nature that there is in this town. You cannot explain it. How can you explain all these cancers occurring in a fishing village where there has been no history of those cancers, where there is no heavy industry and no obvious forms of contamination? Why are cancers that you would never never or rarely see as a doctor all turning up in one community?
This has to be investigated for public health reasons. It has to be investigated for the sake of people who live in that community now and want to know what the future is for their water supply. But it also has to be investigated because of the reputation of Tasmanian product—everything from oysters through to beer. One of the ads for one of the breweries is ‘There’s something different about the water in Tasmania’. That is going to turn on that company very fast unless we get an inquiry to find out what is going on.
There is confusion about the genetic processes and what has been going on in the research. On 9 November 2000, Senator Brown asked about this issue. On that particular day, Senator Herron, the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, confirmed the Forestry Tasmania website statement by telling the world that research by the University of Tasmania was genetically transforming Eucalyptus nitens and Eucalyptus globulus. Since then they have talked about their genetic improvement programs. So it is hardly surprising that people have become confused about what genetic improvement is as opposed to genetic modification. The industry has said it is involved not in genetic modification but in improved selective breeding—genetic enhancements, if you like—which is normal in all agricultural production processes. The issue here is: what are they being improved to do? Is that increasing toxicity? Is that toxicity impacting on human health and wildlife and ecosystem health? As they are spraying triazines in Tasmania, in combination with other chemicals, what impact is that chemical cocktail having? That is why we need this inquiry.
Senator Colbeck says, ‘Let’s put the science before the politics.’ One could almost choke hearing him say that, given the behaviour of the coalition when it comes to climate change. The world’s leading scientists everywhere are telling us about the impacts of climate change and Senator Abetz declared yesterday that he is an agnostic on the science. There are plenty on that side denying the science—denying, denying, denying. They are most certainly not putting the science before politics when it comes to their position on global warming. That is pretty evident. They have not done so on just about every other issue and they are not doing it now. If they were genuinely interested in getting to the facts of the matter as quickly as possible, they would be calling on the Tasmanian government to institute an independent inquiry—independent of government.
The reason the government in Tasmania is so on the nose is the lack of transparency. For years and years people have wanted to know what is going on in the little cabal between the Tasmanian government and the bureaucracy. We saw it with the grants in the forest industry. The Department of Economic Development, Tourism and the Arts got together with the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania and recommended who should get the grants. In fact, the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania managed to get some of the grants for themselves through that process. There is no line in the sand, as the Premier of Tasmania put it, between him, his office and Evan Rolley in his department. Then there is a link from Mark Addis, from the Forest Industries Association, straight across to the bureaucracy that is heading up resources. They are all there, all mates together. They are all one phone call away.
There is no degree of separation in Tasmania when it comes to the forest industry, the Tasmanian government, the bureaucracy and the Premier’s office. That is why you cannot trust the EPA in Tasmania to conduct an investigation of the kind that needs to be made. The Senate should start that process. Tasmania’s producers deserve it. Tasmania’s community deserves it. Public health deserves that we have an inquiry as quickly as possible but also that we insist that there be an independent inquiry. As I indicated earlier, why would you trust the EPA to look into this now when the EPA said in 2005 that although there was toxicity it was from native forests—which it clearly is not—and therefore they would not investigate further? I think it really demonstrates who is calling the shots here.
Senator Heffernan was running around after the program aired the other night, saying, ‘We have to have an inquiry!’ Clearly, he was quashed by Senator Abetz and Senator Colbeck from Tasmania. He is not in here now, but he was absolutely motivated about it. He rang the other night and said, ‘We have to have an inquiry.’ I hope Senator Heffernan comes in here in a moment to tell us about how the Liberal Party and Senator Abetz prevented him from coming in here to speak or to support an inquiry. Where is he? He is quoted in some of the media on this, which says that people must support Senator Heffernan’s inquiry. Where is his inquiry? It is nowhere, because Senator Abetz is taking his directions from the forest industry in Tasmania. No doubt Senator Colbeck is too. No doubt Senator O’Brien will be taking his directions from the Tasmanian Premier. They will be hoping that all this suddenly goes quiet until 20 March, when the election will be held in Tasmania. They will not want to see an independent inquiry getting started in that time. This Senate has an obligation to public health, to the health of our wildlife and to the health of the ecosystem to do something about it. (Time expired)

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2010-02-25,"—The government do not rule out the concept of an inquiry into issues relating to the George River in Tasmania or other related matters. But we do think that it is appropriate that there are proper scientific examinations before this thing becomes the political football that, clearly, if you listened to Senator Milne’s speech, it would be intended to be, were the Senate to initiate the inquiry. There are a few points that I want to touch on. Suffice to say we will not be supporting this motion at this time.
I noted from Senator Milne’s speech that we are enjoined not to trust the Tasmanian government. I thought there was a democratic process going on there at the moment, an election campaign in which the Greens were campaigning to become the government. So do I take it from the speech that Senator Milne has given up on the chances of the Greens becoming part of the, if not the, government? Is that what I should take from the speech? Or is this part of the campaign leading up to the Tasmanian election on 20 March? I am not sure what to make of it. I do not want to jump into the bed of conspiracy theorists, but you would have to say that Senator Milne and Senator Bob Brown agree with all of the suggestions that were made in Senator Milne’s 20-minute contribution.
She talked about cancer clusters, which I understand have been the subject of an examination by Dr Roscoe Taylor. Despite the attempts to blacken Dr Taylor’s name, he is a fairly respected practitioner and the Chief Medical Officer in Tasmania. I understand he has looked at medical records held by Dr Bleaney. He or members of his department are on the public record as saying that there is no evidence that can be ascertained from Dr Bleaney’s records that shows a disproportion of particular types of cancers there compared to anywhere else. But I am no expert on that and, if we are going to start examining that, how do we examine it without access to all the medical records in that area? It is a very difficult problem and something that I suggest the Senate committee would not be able to do.
On the question of the coalition’s position on climate change, I share Senator Milne’s concerns that, on the one hand, talking about carbon sequestration in trees, as Senator Colbeck did, and, on the other hand, voting against the motion is a bit hypocritical. But didn’t the Greens also vote against the bill? If the five Greens sitting in that corner had crossed the chamber and voted with the government, we would have passed the legislation, but they chose not to. So I think it is a bit rich for the Greens to talk about hypocrisy on climate change when that was the Greens position on that vote.
On the question that was raised about triazines, the fact is that some sections of both forestry and agriculture use triazines on genetically modified canola, and there is a fair bit of that in Tasmania. There is also a fair bit of that in other parts of the country. On the other hand, there is a significant part of the green movement that says, ‘We should not have GM canola; we should only have non-GM canola.’ But the regime for that uses triazines. So there are a lot of points of difference that I could raise with the contribution that has just been made.
I go back to what Senator Colbeck said earlier. This matter has been put in the public domain by the Australian Story program. My understanding of the reports is that there was an allegation on the program that there is a toxic cocktail which is attributable to plantation Eucalyptus nitens in the foam on the Georges River and that that is having deleterious effects on both the oysters in Georges Bay and human beings. This is a very serious allegation. Quite properly, the Chief Medical Officer, on behalf of the Tasmanian government, has said, ‘I’d like to look at this, and we’re prepared to investigate it.’ I am told that, according to reports, the response was, ‘We’ll go and see our lawyers.’
I have said in this place that I find that to be a remarkable response from a group who have been prepared to go public with an allegation which damages the reputation of Tasmania while saying: ‘We won’t give you our research; go and see our lawyers. You’ll also have to satisfy the third party involved before we’ll give you the research.’ Until and unless there is a preparedness to share their research and allow it to be investigated, as Senator Colbeck said, not just by scientists and medical practitioners in Tasmania but also by those in other parts of the country or even internationally, I would be very reluctant to support the idea of jumping into what is clearly going to be a very political exercise on behalf of the Greens, pursuing their opposition to forest industries generally and besmirching the reputation of Tasmania, before we have had a chance to have access to some peer reviewing of the allegations that have been made and some proper scientific assessment of this catchment and others. Eucalyptus nitens are not only in the Georges River catchment. The suggestion in the allegation is that this will be a very widespread problem if it is a problem in that catchment.
I would much rather we have the benefit of properly conducted research if the Senate committee is going to have a look at this. What is the next step in the proposition that we have an inquiry—that somehow the Senate funds the research? At the end of the day, maybe that would be necessary, but I would much prefer that the public health bodies around this country were involved in that before it became a political football.
The government will not be supporting the reference to a committee of this matter at this time. We do not reject the concept in the future after those steps have been taken. If Senators Milne and Brown are worried about what the Tasmanian government might do, I guess they are giving up on Mr McKim’s chances of being part of the Tasmanian government in any capacity following the election on 20 March.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,13,2,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-02-25,"—It seems that there is always a convenient ABC story when there is an election in the air, and this edition of Australian Story is one of those. In the run-up to the last federal election, the ABC had a story on the 7.30 Report, if I recall correctly, about forestry and the impact of that and the Gunns mill on Bass Strait. The ABC was later reluctantly forced to put some corrections on the website. Before that, I recall that the ABC had a segment called Lord of the Forest, for which they were dragged kicking and screaming until they finally had to air an apology and a correction. The ABC has a very sad and sorry history in this space, so I would caution the Senate against relying on ABC stories for a Senate inquiry. Having said that, I do not prejudge that edition of Australian Story. There may well be some basis to it and it may be completely correct. All I am saying is that the track record of the ABC in this space ain’t great and I therefore question it.
The Greens are always keen on accountability and administration for others, but they have been strangely silent about the expensive brawl going on within the Wilderness Society as we speak. There have been court challenges, and, of course, we know that the Wilderness Society is the industrial arm of the Australian Greens and that there is a cross-pollination between those two organisations like you would not believe. Indeed, Senator Brown was a former director of it, if I recall correctly. What you have is the old guard fighting the new guard, with people claiming the democratic processes are not being followed—but do you know what? There has been not a peep out of the Australian Greens as to the terrible administration within the Wilderness Society, with court brawls, internal brawls, the leaking of minutes and all sorts of things. They have been strangely silent because they are partners with the Wilderness Society.
In relation to the quite outrageous allegation by Senator Milne about Senator Heffernan, I simply say: Senator Heffernan and I have not even discussed the matter. Yet she comes in here and seeks to impugn the integrity of both me and Senator Heffernan. I should not take exception to it, because that is the modus operandi of the Greens. They will say anything and do anything regardless of the facts and the circumstances. They do not need facts for their public statements and press releases. If it sounds good, just say it and, of course, never apologise afterwards. But I can say on the record here and now: Senator Heffernan and I have not discussed the Australian Story program, and why Senator Heffernan is not in the chamber I do not know.
What I do know is that, if we want to talk about the science, there are very credible scientists such Professor Gordon Duff, Dr Chris Harwood, Dr Julianne O’Reilly-Wapstra, Professor Brad Potts and Professor Jim Reid, all of whom have contributed a scientifically rigorous statement to my local paper today. They say:
No eucalypt plantations in the catchment, or anywhere else in Australia, use trees altered through genetic engineering.
I either believe the Greens’ assertion on this or these highly eminently qualified professors and doctors. At this stage of the proceedings, chances I prefer the professors and the doctors over the Greens, who are ramping up their exposure in the lead-up to the state election in Tasmania. And let’s make no bones about this: that is what this is all part and parcel of—the campaign in Tasmania. These good professors and doctors also tell us that the trees that are grown come from seeds that are grown in seed orchards and:
… have been selected in field trials for their superior growth and wood quality. They have not been selected for increased toxicity.
Whom should I believe? The professors and the doctors or the Australian Greens in here with a political agenda? I would simply commend the article. It is on page 19 of the Hobart Mercury.
I say, with respect to all honourable senators here: why should this Senate be engaged in this inquiry? There are issues of toxicity in my home state of Tasmania at Rosebery in relation to the mining industry. There are these issues all around Australia. So the question has to be asked: why this one in Tasmania now? The answer: state election, 20 March, and the Greens are simply trying to ramp it up to secure their position in Tasmania.
Let the science take its course. Let the investigations continue. For Senator Milne to basically besmirch everybody in the EPA in Tasmania does her no credit and, of course, is a very unfortunate reflection on people who are professionals. You might disagree with their science; you might disagree with the way they go about their business; but the personal reflections on them—that you would not trust them et cetera—as is always the wont with the Greens, go not a step but a leap too far. We in the coalition will be opposing the motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,13,2,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-02-25,"—I thank those who have contributed to this debate. To comment on that contribution from Senator Abetz, the view that the ABC in some way or another concocted this to be a pre-election program of course is absurd. Anybody else but Senator Abetz would know that. You might ask, Senator Abetz: who was it, then, that got involved in rigging the Black River bombing two days before the 1993 election? It had a big impact on that election and came from the forest industry. The culprits were never found, of course, but it was a massive, direct and planned attack on the Greens, who were doing extremely well at that time—it was nothing to do with the Greens. But Senator Abetz has never called for an inquiry into that.
When we get real evidence of a planned effort to intervene in politics and to set people up and it comes from the philosophical side that Senator Abetz is on, you never hear the call for an inquiry. But, when the Australian Broadcasting Corporation comes up with a program like this, which has obviously been a long time in the making, he immediately fits it out as being political intervention. That is politics, but it does nothing for the argument, and nor was there any cogent argument from Senator Abetz—or Senator Colbeck or Senator O’Brien—that this inquiry that Senator Milne and I are requesting the Senate refer to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee should not go ahead. The argument, of course, that it is pre-election is very much in their minds, both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. They do not want an inquiry in the run to the election because they do not want a proper public expose of the processes and the cover-ups that have occurred as citizens like Dr Bleaney and scientists like Marcus Scammell have tried to get assistance, the assistance they should have got, from departments, governments and industry to try to work out what is affecting the ecosystems downstream of the plantations in the George River basin.
This is a classic case of an area where the Senate inquiry would do best. It is not that a Senate inquiry might uncover the causal agent—the actual toxin—but it is that a Senate inquiry can see where there are gaps and where there are questions to be answered and it can put those recommendations to government so that the information can be found out. The other thing about a Senate inquiry is that it can open doors. When you hear that the health department in Tasmania was given a report from Dr Bleaney in 2008 and it had not been opened until very recent times, you wonder how on earth you can have advocates now saying that all the documents from the scientists that she has been working with should be given for peer review but we keep a closed door on the information held by government, not least by industry, because there is a lockdown on information in Tasmania.
Senator O’Brien referred to the smearing of the reputation of Tasmania. The logging industry in Tasmania, with its destruction of ecosystems, including the habitat of rare and endangered species, with its pollution of waterways and with its massive contribution—in fact, more than the rest of the Tasmanian economy put together—to greenhouse gas pollution of the atmosphere, which is all unpaid for and at great cost to taxpayers, including more than $1 billion in handouts from state and federal governments in the last two decades, has of itself been the biggest cause of the smearing of the reputation of Tasmania that one can discover. This industry needs cleaning up; this industry needs opening up; this industry needs to pay its way for the damage it does. But you get cover-up and you get the sort of situation we see now where citizens are trying to find out what it is that ails them or their water or their industries and they simply get condemned, by implication, that they do not have peer review. It is said that all their information should be handed to the loaded, biased industry boffins in government, like Minister Llewellyn—one of the most hopeless and destructive. Talk about smirching the reputation of Tasmania! Can there ever have been a minister who has so shepherded the destruction of what is good for Tasmania? There was the clean, green image and the right of new clean, green and organic agriculture, which finds itself in the vicinity of highly polluting industries like forestry, which sprays atrazine and other toxins into the air and the water catchments. The use of 1080 by this industry brought dreadful publicity worldwide and it continues in Tasmania. It results in the long and painful death of marsupial species, including those that are rare and endangered.
The smearing of the reputation of Tasmania by that industry and the damage done by it—so high-handedly and arrogantly, with weak and spineless politicians in Tasmania from the big parties shepherding it all away—speaks for itself. It is time we got past that. No wonder the Greens are indeed at 29 per cent, when you distribute preferences in the polls in Tasmania. No wonder people are looking for an alternative. No wonder they are looking for more security about the future economy of Tasmania through the Greens. We have seen such serial failure by Labor and Liberal governments.
I come back to the case in point. We do need to find out what is in the water of not only the St Helens catchments but also other catchments across Tasmania. It comes from a change in the natural ecosystems which provide clean, fresh water to people downstream, farmlands and aquatic industries. We should be monitoring that all the way, but you cannot have that where you have closed industries, secrecy and failure of openness to the public. There is the forest industry and Forestry Tasmania. Corporations like Gunns, of course, have a very unenviable record in high-handedness, obfuscation and cover-up when the public have a right to know.
Senator Colbeck said that the Greens have said that we should get out of native forests and move to plantations. He is a new player, relatively speaking, in this place. He sits on the second row and is unable to get the story straight. The Greens have always condemned the destruction of native forests and their replacement with plantations since the 1970s when the woodchip industry brought such carnage to Tasmania, and we continue to do so. If the Greens had had their say, there would be no Eucalyptus nitens plantations replacing old-growth forests and native forests in the George River catchment and we would have a North East Highlands National Park instead of the continued erosion and destruction at a rapid rate of the native forest ecosystems and the habitats of rare and endangered species in the hinterland of St Helens, Swansea, Bicheno and the whole of the east coast of Tasmania.
One only has to think about the rapid destruction of the habitat of the swift parrot, the fastest parrot on earth. This parrot is now down to a thousand pairs, which are just now preparing, after their breeding season in Tasmania, to come back to the mainland. Forestry Tasmania, aided by the parties of Senator Abetz and Senator O’Brien, is in the business of destroying the nesting sites which this rare species depends upon if it is going to survive. You cannot destroy the nursery if you are going to move to recover such a species from destruction.
I laud Dr Alison Bleaney, Dr Marcus Scammell and all the other scientists who have had their work displayed by Australian Story. This is not just a story of citizens who had a hunch, a worry or a phobia. This is a story backed up by the work of more than half-a-dozen laboratories in Australia and New Zealand. It is a story of scientists who are prepared to go on the record and talk about a toxin which is killing human cells in the laboratory. It does not necessarily mean that it will be injurious to health if it is drunk in water coming down a river, but given that there is a toxin which is going to kill skin and liver cells, is it not right that this Senate should hold an inquiry to find out if it is affecting the citizens of St Helens and citizens further downstream, and not only concerning Eucalyptus nitens, whether it is growing in plantations or naturally on the mainland—because it does not occur naturally in Tasmania—but other eucalypt species as well? Of course we should be. Of course it is a time for the airing of the very serious concerns that people have about their health, their natural environment and their future ability to be free of fear from the hidden toxins which so far have not been exactly identified.
And what if you are a blue mussel farmer in the George River catchment and you have a flood pulse come down the river and 90 per cent of your stock is killed? Don’t you have a right to be worried about that? And do you worry when it is just dismissed by a health authority who says, ‘Oh, it is fresh water’? Of course you do, and of course, for the sake of those small businesses, we should be having an inquiry into this. This is an abrogation of responsibility by the Labor and Liberal parties. Senator Heffernan has called for this Senate inquiry and has called, responsibly, for a scientific inquiry; but he has not prevailed with his Liberal colleagues. I will say this of Senator Heffernan: he has taken a keen interest in plantations, whether they be in Tasmania or on the mainland, not only because of their potential indirect effects, as in this case, on water systems, but also because of the direct effects, such as the plantations taking water out of catchments further down. He is concerned about this issue but, of course, in our party system the person who knows the most is very often the person who has the least say when it comes to an issue like having an inquiry.
Senator Heffernan has called for an inquiry, and I think he is right. Senator Abetz says, ‘We oppose an inquiry.’ I think he is wrong. Senator Colbeck says, ‘Let us not have an inquiry.’ I think he is wrong. Senator O’Brien says, ‘We won’t support an inquiry; we’ll put it off until some other time.’ We have heard that before, and he is wrong as well. Senator Milne and I are serious about this inquiry. It is the logical and responsible thing for political representatives, not least those of us from Tasmania, to be undertaking. For the citizens and the industries and scientists involved it is an abrogation of responsibility by the Labor and Liberal parties that they are going to block a simple inquiry into a very serious matter.

The purpose of the bill, as it identifies itself, seeks to authorise members of the Australian Defence Force to serve within the territorial limits of Australia but they may not serve beyond these limits except in accordance with a resolution authorising such service passed and carried by each house of the Australian Parliament. Essentially, the bill seeks to alter the longstanding practice of this country whereby the executive arm of the government, through a national security subcommittee of cabinet, as I understand it, authorises the dispatch of troops of Australia to either warlike or non-warlike service, certainly being service outside the territorial limits of Australia. So the question before the committee was not whether parliament should debate or engage in discussion in its various forms on the merits or otherwise. The question before the committee, in its examination of the bill, was whether the bill provided a credible alternative to the practice that has developed in this country since Federation of the executive arm of government making the decision to commit troops overseas, along with the usual discussion in the community and often with, as of late, discussion in both houses of the parliament.
The committee, in taking that tack, was primarily concerned about how the provisions of the bill would operate in practice and it examined and analysed the bill from that perspective. The report of the committee outlines that there is extensive background to this particular bill going back something of the order of 25 years. It is the third or fourth time that such a bill, if not almost certainly identical in substance then certainly very similar in substance to this bill, has been brought to the parliament by either the Greens or minority party senators of different persuasions over the years. The content of the bill has been regularly examined by ministers and shadow ministers alike and on each occasion it has been examined by relevant committees of the parliament and there has been extensive discussion in the wider community. So the content of the bill is well known.
I offer a few brief comments in passing. There was something in the order of 30 or 31 submissions only to the bill. Almost 11 or 12 of those were pages of one submission only which indicated support for the bill. In that context the committee had written to hundreds and hundreds of bodies seeking submissions and to have had such a poor response, albeit all of those who did take the trouble to respond provided worthy submissions, made it clear that perhaps we did not get the widespread debate within the committee and within the wider community that might have been sought by those who were interested in the passage of the bill.
The committee has identified a number of deficiencies in the bill that need to be attended to by those who are interested in this debate if the bill is going to be brought forward this time or some time in the future for passage. Firstly, there is the treatment of classified material and, secondly, the constraint on the ability of Defence to mobilise its forces safely and effectively is so limited. There are serious problems with definitions within the bill and inconsistencies between the explanatory memorandum and the bill itself. Because of those inconsistencies, clearly the bill had the potential to capture routine or non-warlike military activities including activities such as peacekeeping, capacity building in other countries, humanitarian assistance, antipiracy, the rescue or extraction of Australian citizens from threatening situations overseas, covert operations such as those involving submarines and responses to maritime incidents such as harassment, sabotage and the like. Those sorts of definitional deficiencies distract from the—(Time expired)

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-02-25,"—I seek leave to make a short statement of no more than five minutes.
Leave granted.
—I thank the Senate for flexibility in being given leave to make a couple of brief remarks. The Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2008 [No. 2] is a bill that I took carriage of as one of the first things that I did when I got here. As Senator Bishop has indicated, it does have a long history. It was first moved by Senator Colin Mason of the Democrats in the early 1980s and there has been nearly a quarter of a century of Senate consideration in one form or another of the proposition that the prerogative power of the executive to unilaterally put Australian men and women in harm’s way should perhaps be moderated in some form by the parliament. It was originally put forward in amendments to the Defence Act and then down the track it was formalised as a private senator’s bill. It has been amended a couple of times down the track.
The bill that I inherited was substantially similar to what Senator Andrew Bartlett last introduced in 2003 or a little later. Since the last substantive debate on this bill was had, we have had a very interesting object case study of what happens when the executive puts Australian troops in harm’s way—in the Iraq deployment—against the popular will. I was one of the hundreds of thousands of Australians who marched against the Iraq deployment for the reasons that even the government’s own intelligence agencies were telling the executive at the time: ‘This deployment is unwise. The reasoning is unfounded. We are even potentially being misled by some of our closest allies.’ If all that is not enough of a reason to reconsider the idea, then consider that a handful of people or constitutionally potentially even the Prime Minister alone can make one of the most important and grave decisions of all. The parliament debates many issues and it is still unknown to me why we have the principle that the parliament should not have some role in decision making to reflect popular will through this place, as imperfect as this building’s representation of popular will can sometimes be. At the very least, the Iraq deployment should teach us something about leaving these decisions in the hands of the executive alone.
The major parties, with some notable exceptions, appear to have bipartisan consensus that now is not the time. One notable exception is Melissa Parke, the federal member for Fremantle who put a submission into the bill to register her belief that the party’s policy should change in this regard. Some of the language in the committee suggests, as I think the chair, Senator Bishop, intimated earlier, that the principle is not completely without merit and that essentially this is an argument about detail, not intent. I do not intend to verbal Senator Bishop at this point, but I think the wording of the inquiry document that we are tabling this morning is great. It is a very useful, critical examination of the issues of some of the things that have been raised over time, but it does not go down the second step of reflecting on solutions, ideas, answers or propositions. If the bill is flawed but the basic principle is sound, then it is the work of this parliament and the obligation of this parliament to improve the bill and move it forward. If that initiative will not be coming from the major parties, then it will certainly be coming from us.
The principle is that Australia would not be alone in moving towards some form of parliamentary oversight of the deployment of troops into war-like situations or into wars. It is not something that should simply remain with the executive. Many of our closest allies, including the Westminster parliament upon which our foundation and precedent is based, are moving in this direction, and the debate in the United Kingdom is vastly more mature than it is here in Australia. So it is not a tradition that we wish to simply follow blindly.
On the basis of the small number of submissions—but acknowledging that many were of very high quality—the committee decided not to hold a formal parliamentary hearing but a hearing that was extremely valuable. I encourage all senators to read the transcript which we have appended as our dissent to the majority report. We spoke to senior ADF personnel, a former defence secretary, UN peacekeepers, ambassadors and advocates. We deliberately invited people who would not agree with us on all the issues, but they certainly brought something new to the debate and I encourage senators to look at that transcript.
There is not time now to rebut point by point the issues that have been raised by the chair, but we think this is only the beginning. This is something that will need to be debated further by the parliament. As former Clerk of the Senate Harry Evans said of the bill, its chances may be slim but its time will come. (Time expired)

—I rise to speak in support of the remarks made by the Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, Senator Bishop, on the private member’s bill, the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2008 [No. 2], and on the report. I repeat what has been said before: there is no more serious decision taken by governments or executives than to send Australian troop overseas or to deploy them overseas in a war-like situation. Unfortunately, over the past 100 years or more governments have made that decision. If someone would like to look at the history, while there might be arguments in a couple of cases, in most cases Australian troops have been deployed with the general support of the Australian people.
In his speech, Senator Ludlum talked about a decision being made by a handful of people. That handful of people he refers to are the executive of the government of Australia. They are people who are informed and base their decisions on some information that is not readily available to other members of parliament—and neither should it be. If we are to have an effective security and intelligence organisation and effective intelligence and security advice given to the government of the day, no matter who that government might be, it is not information that is publicly available. What you are asking is for the parliament to be able to make a decision as to whether or not this country should send troops away to war without being in possession of all of the facts. We know it is impossible to get all of the facts.
I have served on intelligence and security committees and on foreign affairs, defence and trade committees for a number of years, as have Senator Bishop, my friend Senator Trood and others. Governments are in the position where they make the decision and they bear the responsibilities of those decisions. If the public does not agree with the decision that has been made by an executive or a government, then the democratic will of the people can be shown at any future election, and we have seen that happen. Winston Churchill, regarded as a hero in Great Britain, was turfed out before the Second World War had even finished by the people of that country. So executives and the executive arm of government do not make these decisions lightly. They make these decisions in what they hope are full possession of the facts. They listen to other points of view.
For us to change a system that throughout history has served Australia very well is not something that many of us would want to do. There will always be those who are opposed to war under any circumstances. They would do everything and use every means possible to prevent Australian troops going into battle overseas or fighting in causes outside of Australia’s shores. In fact, sometimes, as has been proved in the past, the best way to preserve our own security from within Australia is to make sure that we attack the cause of the problems if they happen to be outside of Australia, and we have done that in the defence of our country now for a number of years.
I totally support the remarks made by Senator Bishop and the report of the committee in the recommendations or the statements that they make in their report. I hope that decisions such as this, regardless of who will be in government in the future, are left to those who have the most information at their fingertips—the intelligence information and all matters pertaining to Australia’s security.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-02-25,"—Here we go again. The Labor government do not take no for an answer. Here they are again playing politics with our health system. They are playing politics to hide their failures in the health portfolio. Before the last election they promised the world, but they have delivered next to nothing. We have had review after review, reviews of the reviews and photo opportunities around Australia. We have had budget cuts to the health portfolio while the Rudd Labor government have been going on spending spree after spending spree in other parts of government. We have had cuts to chemotherapy treatment which, only because of the scrutiny of the Senate, we have had put on the backburner. We have had cuts to patient rebates for cataract surgery which, only because of the scrutiny of the Senate, the government have had to do a backflip on. We have had cuts to the Medicare safety net even though the government promised before the election that they would not cut the Medicare safety net. We have had a $740 million cut to spending on private health insurance rebates.
 (Senator Hurley)—Order! Senator Cormann, I will ask for the conversations around the chamber to cease as I am having difficulty hearing you.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, it would be an absolute tragedy if you could not hear what I have to say in relation to Labor’s health portfolio failures because this is a very important contribution and I hope that people right across Australia hear what I have to say here today on behalf of the opposition. This government has failed the Australian people on health. This government has failed patients across Australia. Before the election Labor promised they had a plan to fix public hospitals. But what did we get after the election? Nothing. We got reviews, more reviews and reviews of the reviews.
Why are we wasting a whole week on yet again debating a piece of legislation for which this government knows it does not have the support of the Senate? Its so-called Fairer Private Health Insurance bills have been defeated before. Equally, this bill will be defeated. The government knows this, yet we are spending hours and hours debating this. Do you know why the government is wasting this time? Because it is playing politics and wanting to set itself up for a campaign in the lead-up to the next election whereby it can blame everybody else, except its own incompetence, for its failure with the health system. It knows that it has overpromised. It knows that it has underdelivered. It knows that patients across Australia have been let down by the Rudd Labor government.
Those opposite know that there is a serious risk that they will be punished for their failure with the health system at the ballot box come the next election. So they are trying to set themselves up for the excuses that they are going to roll out. Just wait for the Prime Minister to come out, in the lead-up to the next election, and blame their failure to fix the health system on the fact that this legislation did not go through the Senate, even though it was Kevin Rudd himself who gave before the last election to the Australian people an ironclad guarantee and a most emphatic commitment—an absolutely ironclad commitment—that they would retain and not do away with the existing private health insurance rebates. But what have we got in front of us? We have got an unfair private health insurance incentives  bill. We have got before us a piece of legislation which is going to be bad for our health system and bad for patients across Australia.
We on this side are committed to a strong and well balanced health system. We are committed to a health system in which all Australians can have timely and affordable access to quality hospital care. We are committed to a health system which has both a strong and well-funded public system and a strong and well-supported private system. We are committed to sensible, strong incentives that encourage Australians who can afford to do so to take responsibility for their own health care needs, to put additional resources into our health system. What have we got with this government? We have a government that has done absolutely nothing in health, that has wasted two years and that is looking for a political strategy to save its bacon in the lead-up to the next election. Who is caught up in the middle of that? Patients across Australia. Millions of patients will see their private health insurance rebates reduced or scrapped altogether as a result of this measure. Even more patients will have to compete, with all the people leaving private health over a period of time, in trying to get access to our public hospital system.
If this legislation were to be passed, it would be yet another part of Labor’s constant ideological war against private health. Labor have form on this, and they are at it again. They have never liked private health. They have never liked the important role that private health has to play as part of our overall health system. They thought before the last election that it was important, in order to win votes, that they convince the Australian people that they had learnt the lessons of the past. Before the last election Labor went out of their way to convince the Australian people that they would no longer pursue their ideological crusade against Australians with private health insurance, yet here they are at it again. So, rather than fixing the health system, Labor’s actions will make our health system worse. They will put further pressure on our health system at the same time as they will be doing nothing to fix the public health system issues that they have previously identified. This is an absolute disgrace, Madam Acting Deputy President, and I do think it is important that you can hear what I have to say on behalf of the opposition in relation to this issue, so I thank you for having asked my colleagues to quieten down so that you could listen very carefully, particularly to the very important point that I had to make in relation to this piece of legislation.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-02-25,"—The coalition will be supporting the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment Bill 2010. The bill was introduced on 10 February 2010 and amends the Commonwealth national consumer credit legislation, the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, which was passed by the parliament last year to ensure the constitutional soundness of referring power from the states to the Commonwealth in relation to consumer credit.
Last year’s credit act implemented a number of reforms, including a national licensing regime for all providers of consumer credit and services across Australia and responsible lending conduct requirements for licensees. In principle, the coalition supported the credit act and the efforts to enhance the national regulation of consumer credit by harmonising laws across states and territories.
I would like to point out that the Howard government recognised the need for and importance of standardising credit regulation, and started the process of uniformity by releasing the national consumer credit code in March 2006. Uniformity of credit regulation is the next step after the introduction of the credit code and COAG discussion under both the Howard and Rudd governments. We in the coalition worked with the government to enhance the operation of the credit act by making amendments in the Senate. These amendments require credit providers to verify information provided in a preliminary credit assessment and to provide reasons for rejecting applications for hardship variations and stays of enforcement.
Consumer credit is important to the Australian economy. It is estimated that consumer spending accounts for around 70 per cent of demand in the economy. A strong national regulatory system is needed and will boost the confidence of consumers to borrow and purchase. This is important because demand for credit has dropped significantly over the course of the global financial downturn. Statistics from the Reserve Bank of Australia on personal lending show a drop in demand of around 10 per cent since the peak in May 2008, a drop of some $16.4 billion over the 19 months to December 2009.
A stable regulatory environment for credit is needed, particularly when the government’s spending—and massive debt—threatens to push up interest rates and limit the ability of consumers to afford credit. The amendment bill allows the Commonwealth to assume responsibility for national credit regulation by allowing the referral of state powers. The legislation will come into effect on 1 July 2010. The states will have the option of adopting the Commonwealth’s legislation or enacting their own referral bill. It is important to note that certain subject matter will be excluded, allowing the states to protect their constitutional rights over certain powers such as state taxes, duties and real property registration.
Under the amendment bill, a state’s referral will remain effective if the referral act provides that the referral will terminate in certain circumstances, where the uniform regulation will impede upon state powers or where amendments to the credit act do not include excluded items. This will ensure that the states can refer their powers without limitation, whilst ensuring their constitutional rights are protected. The amendments have no impact on the operation of the credit act and will simply allow an effective referral.
As the shadow finance minister, I am pleased to see that this bill will not have any financial impact on the federal budget. The coalition supports a national credit regime and we support this bill, which allows the regime to operate effectively. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-02-25,"—in reply—I thank Senator Joyce for his contribution to the debate. This is an uncontroversial piece of legislation. It will amend the Commonwealth’s consumer credit legislation to ensure an effective referral of power from the states to the Commonwealth in relation to consumer credit. As senators may be aware, last year the government enacted legislation to implement phase one of the national consumer credit reform package, delivering on the Rudd Labor government’s commitment to modernise Australia’s consumer credit laws.
This credit reform package will, for the first time in Australia, provide for a single standard national regime for the regulation of consumer credit, replacing the state based regimes which operate inconsistently across eight jurisdictions. It is a landmark reform and has only been possible through the strong commitment of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, working in a spirit of cooperation to realise the COAG’s reform vision for a single uniform national credit law. This was evidenced by the signing of the intergovernmental National Credit Law Agreement by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments in December last year, and by a commitment of all governments to commence the national credit law at the same time later this year.
With other legislation, this represents the final move of state regulation of financial services, consumer credit, trustee companies and, interestingly, margin lending, which is a state responsibility. There has been a good deal of controversy about margin lending in the context of Storm Financial, and I pay credit to some of Senator Joyce’s colleagues who have been active in focusing attention on that. This is the final transfer of the remaining powers of the states in respect to fin-ancial regulation to the Commonwealth and, as such, it represents an important final chapter—a single standard national regulation.
This bill amends the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, the credit act, to recognise certain exclusions to the scope of the amendment power in the referral bill and to enable an effective reference of state power to be made either with or without any exclusions to that power. I thank Senator Joyce for the Liberal-National Party support of the legislation. I commend it to the Senate.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-02-25,"—I rise today to speak on the National Health Security Amendment (Background Checking) Bill 2009. Security sensitive biological agents, SSBAs, can be of benefit in medical, health and scientific research but can also pose a significant risk to human health. Bacterial and viral pathogens and toxins derived from living organisms have the potential to do harm through unintentional release, careless handling or, worse, malicious intent—for example, with anthrax. It is important that regulation of SSBAs is effective, consistent and provides appropriate safeguards in the interests of national security.
The bill before us today continues the reforms in this area made by the coalition government. The coalition government provided an investment in national health security capability in the 2004 budget. The coalition action strengthened national health security, preparedness and response capability in the event of a national health emergency or terrorist attack. The budget measure included provisions for a national register of laboratories that use or store high-risk pathogens and toxins.
In 2007, COAG agreed to the recommendations of the report on the regulation and control of biological agents. The report analysed the effectiveness of Australia’s existing regulation of SSBAs and ASIO’s assessment of threats to Australian institutions and entities storing and handling high-risk biological agents. COAG agreed to a nationally consistent scheme to regulate all aspects of the supply chain for SSBAs.
The National Health Security Act, which this bill seeks to amend, was introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition. The scheme introduced under the National Health Security Act aimed to ensure that national health security was maximised whilst minimising the regulatory and administrative burden on affected institutions. The National Health Security Act targeted security risks by consolidating the regulation and monitoring of facilities that handle SSBAs across all jurisdictions.
The risks identified as a result of a lack of nationally consistent legislation included: limited physical security requirements for facilities and entities holding SSBAs; lack of monitoring of the location, nature or destruction of SSBAs; no requirement for checking of facility and entity employees with access to SSBAs to ensure that they did not have criminal or terrorist links; and facilities and entities not uniformly reporting access to SSBAs. The National Health Security Act addressed these risks.
In relation to the bill before us today, section 35 of the National Health Security Act provides for the minister by legislative instrument to set requirements relating to the security status of the individuals who are entitled to handle or dispose of SSBAs. This bill explicitly provides that the minister may require background checks in setting those requirements for individuals involved in handling or disposing of such biological agents. The bill further provides that background checks be conducted under AusCheck for individuals who handle or dispose of SSBAs.
The AusCheck Amendment Bill 2009 sought to expand the range of background checks that AusCheck was authorised to undertake. The original expansion was to include matters related to Australia’s national security, the defence of Australia, a national emergency, the prevention of terrorism offences and executive power of the Commonwealth. A Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry recommended, amongst other things, that, in order for AusCheck to conduct background checks for individuals, there must be provision made in the principal act. The coalition also noted the concerns of the committee in relation to the lack of consultation by the Rudd government prior to the proposed expansion of AusCheck’s role. The government subsequently amended the AusCheck bill to account for the committee’s recommendations.
The bill today complies with the Senate committee’s recommendation and the subsequent amendment to the AusCheck bill for authorisation for such background checks to be included in the principal act, in this case the National Health Security Act. Background checking for individuals involved in handling and disposing of SSBAs is consistent with the intention of the national health security reform process. The coalition accepts that there has been consultation throughout this process. The coalition supports measures which provide sensible safeguards to human health and the environment as provided for in this bill. The coalition will not be opposing the bill.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH SECURITY AMENDMENT (BACKGROUND CHECKING) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-02-25,"—I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her contribution to the debate on the National Health Security Amendment Bill 2009. The bill amends the National Health Security Act 2007 to enhance Australia’s obligations for securing certain biological agents that could be used as weapons, known as security sensitive biological agents, or SSBAs. As Senator Fierravanti-Wells has discussed, the bill enables the relevant minister to set standards to require background checking of persons who handle or dispose of SSBAs. The bill strengthens Australia’s security against potential threats and delivers on the Rudd government’s commitment to protect all Australians.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-02-25,"—I rise once again to speak on the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2009. This bill was introduced on 18 March 2009 and amends the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 to incorporate into Australian law the two separate tax agreements signed with the British Virgin Islands and the Isle of Man. The agreement with the British Virgin Islands was signed in London on 27 October 2008 and the agreement with the Isle of Man was signed in London on 29 January 2009. The provisions in these agreements are consistent with other bilateral tax treaties that Australia has signed with other countries.
I would like to say at the outset that the coalition will be supporting the passage of this bill through the Senate. The agreement with the British Virgin Islands provides for a complete exchange of tax information between the two countries in both criminal and civil tax matters. This will remove the ability for Australian taxpayers to use the British Virgin Islands as a tax haven. This expands the existing relationship, where both countries only share tax information for criminal matters. In addition to the exchange of tax information provisions, this agreement also ensures that certain income is not subject to double taxation.
Specifically, this applies to ensure that those employed by governments are not subject to double taxation. Under this agreement any income received from government service is taxable only by the country to which the services were provided. Currently, such income would be taxed in Australia and by the British Virgin Islands. This provision does not apply to those earning income from private business or commerce.
This agreement also ensures that education related payments received by students are exempt from taxable income. It also ensures that students from Australia or the British Virgin Islands do not have to pay income tax on any payments made from their resident country for the purpose of education and maintenance.
The agreement with the Isle of Man provides for a complete exchange of tax information between the two countries in both criminal and civil tax matters. This will remove the ability for Australian taxpayers to use the Isle of Man as a tax haven. Currently both countries only share tax information for criminal matters. This agreement also commits the revenue agencies in each country to assist taxpayers in resolving any disputes relating to transfer pricing.
In addition to the exchange of tax information provisions, this agreement also ensures that certain income is not subject to double taxation. It ensures that income received from pensions and retirement annuities will only be taxed in the individual’s country of residence. Currently, income received from a pension or retirement annuity may be taxed in the country of residence and in the country where the income is sourced.
As in the agreement with the British Virgin Islands, this agreement also ensures that those employed by governments are not subject to double taxation. Currently, such income would be taxed in Australia and by the Isle of Man. Again, as in the agreement with the British Virgin Islands, this provision does not apply to those earning income from private business or commerce. This agreement also contains the same exemption provisions relating to education purpose payments as the agreement with the British Virgin Islands. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,"<title>

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-02-25,"—The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2009 gives force to a new tax treaty with New Zealand, a second protocol to the tax treaty with Belgium and an agreement on the allocation of tax rights over certain income with Jersey. Tax treaties facilitate trade and investment by reducing barriers caused by double taxation. The extremely close and significant economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand increases the importance of maintaining up-to-date tax arrangements between both countries. The new tax treaty, signed in Paris on 26 June 2009, strengthens and improves this relationship. The treaty updates and modernises the bilateral tax arrangements between Australia and New Zealand. The bill will insert the text of the new treaty into the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 and repeal the existing treaty.
Responding to the needs of both Australian and New Zealand taxpayers, the new treaty comprehensively updates the existing tax treaty arrangements with New Zealand. Key outcomes from the treaty include: reduced withholding taxes on certain intercorporate dividends and the complete removal on others; the removal of withholding tax on interest payments made to unrelated financial institutions or to the Australian and New Zealand governments; lower royalty withholding tax; the extension of treaty benefits to Australian managed investment trusts; the cross-recognition of the tax exempt status of pensions in both Australia and New Zealand; and a short-term secondment provision which will preclude individuals from being caught up in the other country’s tax system when they are seconded to that other country for fewer than 90 days.
Integrity provisions in the treaty will ensure that the reduced withholding tax rates are only available to those genuinely entitled to them. In addition, as New Zealand does not have a comprehensive capital gains tax, the treaty allows Australia to tax capital gains derived by Australian residents who relocate to New Zealand for up to six years after they cease to be an Australian resident, thereby preventing the double non-taxation of such capital gains.
The treaty will enter into force following the last notification that both countries have completed their domestic requirements, which, in the case of Australia, includes enactment of this bill. The bill will also amend the definition of ‘dual listed company arrangement’ in the income tax law to align it with the corresponding provision in the treaty with New Zealand.
The government is committed to the implementation of international standards of tax transparency. The second protocol to the tax treaty with Belgium upgrades the exchange of information provisions in the tax treaty between Australia and Belgium by enhancing the ability of the Belgian and Australian tax authorities to exchange taxpayer information and to exchange on a wider range of taxes. In particular, the new provisions provide that neither tax administration can refuse to provide information solely because they do not require the information for their own domestic purposes or because the information is held by a bank or similar institution.
The government is a global leader in combating cross-border tax evasion. The enhanced provisions with Belgium are an important tool in Australia’s efforts in this regard, by increasing the probability of detection when taxpayers participate in abusive tax arrangements. The tax information exchange agreement, together with the agreement for the allocation of certain taxing rights, signed with Jersey earlier this year are further evidence of the Rudd Labor government’s commitment in this area.
The bill gives effect to the agreement on the allocation of taxing rights between Australia and Jersey, which will help prevent double taxation of certain cross-border income derived by individuals who are residents of Australia or Jersey. The agreement also provides an administrative mechanism to help resolve transfer-pricing disputes that may arise between taxpayers and the revenue authorities of Australia or Jersey.
The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has considered and recommended that binding treaty action be taken in respect of all three treaties. Full details of the amendments brought forward in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I thank Senator Joyce for his contribution and for the support of the Liberal-National Party. I had to go into that detail because I needed to ensure that there was clarification of the countries that we are dealing with in this legislation.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-02-25,"—The Aviation Transport Security Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009 deals with reforms to the air cargo sector. It proposes a series of amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 that is aimed at improving the security of the air cargo supply chain. The bill will expand the definition of cargo to mean an article that is reasonably likely to be transported by aircraft and will also expand the definition of industry participants who can certify cargo to include regulated air cargo agents and accredited air cargo agents. The circumstances under which cargo can be certified by these groups or by aircraft operators will be prescribed under the regulations.
When thinking about exports, most Australians think of coal or iron ore exported through our sea ports. But many Australian exporters depend on the air cargo service to reach their overseas customers. There are other options for sending goods to overseas markets, but there is no quicker way to get exports to their destinations than by air. Many Australian businesses and their customers are prepared to pay a premium to ship goods by air. It is interesting to note that in the year 2007-08 international airfreight traffic totalled 780,000 tonnes. Both inbound and outbound international aircraft air freight have shown increases in recent years. Outbound international airfreight, that is Australia’s exports by air, totalled some 300,000 tonnes in the year ended 30 June 2008. Nearly 70,000 tonnes of this airfreight was carried by Qantas jets, but many other airlines were involved in the carriage of the airfreight. Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Cathay Pacific and Air New Zealand each carried over 20,000 tonnes of outbound air cargo. Over 40 per cent of outbound air cargo in 2008 was sent through Sydney Airport. The most common destinations for outbound air cargo sent from Australia were Singapore, Hong Kong and Auckland. In many of these cases Australian air cargo would have been forwarded on from these intermediate destinations to reach customers elsewhere around the globe. Clearly air cargo is an important part of domestic freight.
The coalition always supports any legislation or action that will improve the security of air travel, be it for freight or for passengers. Accordingly, we will be supporting this bill. The shadow minister for transport, the Hon Warren Truss, who is in the lower house, spoke on this bill when it was introduced and gave some details of the actual amendments and what they actually involve. The coalition, and indeed Australia, is fortunate in having someone with the expertise that Mr Truss has in dealing with transport matters. As senators will recall, Mr Truss was the Minister for Transport and Regional Services before the change of government and, in that role, made a magnificent contribution to the advancement of transport in all of its forms in Australia. He has taken a very close interest in the air transport industry and, indeed, in transport safety.
That brings me to another issue relating to air transport, and that is a notice of motion from the Special Minister of State that has been on the Notice Paper all week. No-one on our side of the parliament can quite understand what it means and what it is about. Indeed, Mr Truss and his office have had difficulty in finding out from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, just what this notice of motion is about. We see on the Notice Paper that it is said to be a rescission of a resolution of the Senate disallowing the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations.
Senators might well recall that last year the coalition, in conjunction with the Independents and, I think, the Greens—I am not quite sure about that—disallowed a regulation made by the minister which dealt with a number of things. In short, it put strict liability onto pilots if the door of the aircraft should be left open, as opposed to the company that owned and operated the aircraft being held liable. Quite rightly, the pilots were incensed by the strict liability being theirs when such an event might occur through absolutely no fault of their own. Safety requires that the pilots go into the cockpit, shut the door and then concentrate on flying the aircraft. But this regulation meant that even if someone else opened the aircraft door the pilots were strictly liable—that is, before the coalition and the Independents assured the disallowance of that regulation. Now, that was 5½ months ago. If the government want to reintroduce a regulation, they have to wait at least six months to do so and then it can be debated again. But for some strange reason that nobody can quite understand the government have, at the 5½-month mark, introduced this motion to rescind the regulation’s disallowance. If they waited until some time in March, our next sitting week—when we next come back after today—they could introduce that regulation again if they wanted to. However, as I said, for a reason that escapes any interested observer, this motion has been put before the Senate now.

Senator Ronaldson interjecting—

—As Senator Ronaldson rightly says, it is just bizarre. What is perhaps even more bizarre is that, although the motion was introduced on Monday and it is now Thursday, as I understand it, it is not going to be dealt with this afternoon either. So what was that all about?
One can only surmise that Mr Albanese was playing games with this to try and support his announcement on security issues, supposedly, which was rushed forward earlier this week to try and take a bit of heat off the government’s complete mismanagement of the Home Insulation Program, that fiasco—to try and save Mr Garrett’s political skin by diverting attention from Mr Garrett to security matters. We all know those security measures were rushed forward. The government has been sitting on them for months, I understand, and had not intended to do much about them. But, hello, Mr Rudd has a political problem, so what does he do? He creates some spin that will hopefully capture the attention of the news cycle—it does not matter what the real policy issues are; that does not seem to count—and away we go. We can only surmise that, as part of this spin to try and save Mr Garrett, this motion was introduced into the Senate to be dealt with. But, as I say, here we are at the end of the week and we are none the wiser as to why it was introduced now, and it seems the government is now not going to proceed with it. It is still on the Notice Paper, but the word is that it will not be dealt with this afternoon.
Even if it were to be dealt with this afternoon, one would still wonder why this motion was brought forward. This is a motion to rescind a disallowance motion passed by the Senate 5½ months ago. One still wonders why this was not left until we next come back. We are away for a week after this and then we are back for a couple of weeks. By that time, the six months will be up and, if the government want to introduce it, they can do it then—without needing to bring forward this rescission motion for the disallowance by the Senate.
When this motion appeared on the Notice Paper, a lot of people became concerned. The coalition, as at the last time I spoke with Mr Truss, had not been able to garner from Mr Albanese what the purpose of this was. Were the government intending to bring back the same regulation that had already been disallowed or was there some other purpose to this? Mr Albanese was not forthcoming, which I understand is normal. Certainly, it did raise concerns with people with a particular interest in this area—and who could have a greater interest in this area than the Australian and International Pilots Association. On 23 February, they published a media release which says:
The Federal Government’s reintroduction of changes to the Australian Aviation Transport Regulations preventing licensed pilots accessing the flight deck and transferring legal liability from airlines to pilots could decrease air safety …
Pilots are concerned that the Regulations, which were developed with minimal consultation—
and I interpose there: are we surprised about that? As we know, the Rudd government are big on talk. They say, ‘We’re consulting with all relevant stakeholders,’ but when you look behind the words you will find that most of the consultation in any field of policy endeavour is pretty limited. As I was saying, the AIPA media release says:
… the Regulations, which were developed with minimal consultation or expert input by pilots and were last year defeated in the Senate, may be reintroduced in the same form and that this may result in poor quality outcomes.
It goes on to say:
Legal advice prepared by one of Australia’s leading Senior Counsel, Brett Walker, also confirmed AIPA’s view that the new regulations were both inappropriate and unnecessary.
“Shifting criminal responsibility to the pilot in command undermines a long held aviation principle that the airline is ultimately responsible for the actions of its pilots,” …
“Any other approach risked allowing airlines to claim they were blameless for accidents and incidents.”
The media release goes on to say:
The association has also commissioned an independent risk specialist to investigation the Regulation’s premise that pilots travelling in flight deck jump seats were a safety and security threat.
This was the argument the Rudd government used when they tried to impose this regulation on the industry. They said that a pilot flying the plane when he is the captain in charge is quite okay but if he happens to be getting a lift somewhere in the jump seat he suddenly became a safety and security threat. Whereas, of course, international evidence shows that in many cases a pilot in the jump seat, a third pilot in an aircraft, has actually assisted in avoiding incidents and, indeed, in making air travel safer. The media release from the pilots association goes on to say:
“The results of this detailed, independent study clearly found that having an additional licensed pilot on the flight deck enhanced safety and security, which is hardly surprising, because if you can’t trust pilots on the flight deck, who can you trust,” Captain Barry Jackson said.
It is another one of these silly things that the Rudd government have introduced. They do it without proper consultation. They have come forward with legislation and regulations to capture, as I say, the new cycle spin. I would not do this but someone down Senator Ronaldson’s way at a country cabinet meeting recently referred to the Prime Minister as Prime Minister Blah Blah. Of course I would not call him that because I know it is unparliamentary. Obviously this person who attended the country cabinet meeting was less than impressed.
—They picked him in one.
—They picked him in one. Thank you, Senator Ronaldson.
—Like John Howard picked you in one. Absolutely hopeless.
—Hello, we have someone who does not agree that it is Prime Minister Blah Blah; someone who makes the interjection and then runs for the door to try and help the Labor Party resurrect their failing fortunes in Tasmania, it looks like.
—It’s not too crash hot for the Liberal Party either, Ian.
—Put it this way, Senator Sherry, if I were to pick which of the Liberal and Labor Party polling results I would prefer, I would easily go for the Liberal Party one. I do not want to get involved in Tasmanian politics. It is just a pity that Senator Polley cannot keep her invective for, perhaps, the Greens who are overtaking the Labor Party in Tasmania rather than direct it at me just when I was reporting what a constituent of Senator Ronaldson has said about the Prime Minister and called him Prime Minister Blah Blah. If rules did not prevent it I would have thought that was a great terminology, but I know I am not allowed to say that. I think the person who coined the phrase, Prime Minister Blah Blah, was very, very astute.
I have been misdirected here. I was simply saying that this is a government that is guided by the media cycle, by the blah blah, but when it comes to action it is rushed action, it is for actions that are not consulted. Indeed, the notice of motion, which is on the Notice Paper, I hear is not going to be dealt with. I hope that it might be dealt with because I am fascinated as to why this is being brought forward three or four weeks before it could have been dealt with anyhow by the government. Perhaps the government are so busy running around trying to pick up the mess left by Mr Garrett that they have not even bothered to work out that they could have brought it back six months later had they wanted to. Of course if they do bring it back six months later I can indicate that, if it is the same regulation they are going to impose, unless they have a brand new argument that convinces us of the unsafety of the situation that now exists, the coalition would again be opposing it. I mention it in relation to the Aviation Transport Security Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009 which we are discussing today, because it is—
—At last he mentioned it.
—He finally got to it.
—If the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Regulations are not relevant to the Aviation Transport Security Amendment Act I do not know what is. That is why it was important to raise these things. People like me and the airline pilots association and I am sure every airline pilot travelling around and from Australia will have a very, very great interest in this motion before the Senate, which we do not seem to be dealing with. Why was it there? That is the question. Perhaps Senator Sherry will explain that when he speaks later.
As I said earlier, any legislation that assists with transport safety and security is something that will always get the support of the coalition. It will not in relation to that other regulation I mentioned because it was a silly regulation that in fact detracted from aviation safety, and that is why we disallowed it six months ago and why we will continue to do so. This bill does, we believe, actually enhance transport security, and that is why the coalition will be supporting it.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION TRANSPORT SECURITY AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-02-25,"—The Aviation Transport Security Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009 will enhance the security of the air cargo supply chain, the Office of Transport Security and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, which regulates the transport security industry, to minimise the risk of unlawful interference that could result in catastrophic consequences for an aircraft with an improvised explosive device in air cargo. The security of air cargo is critical to ensure Australia’s compliance with the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the Chicago convention, and also to ensure we meet the security requirements of key trading partners such as the United States and the European Union.
On 9 February 2010 the government announced a comprehensive package of measures to strengthen Australia’s international and domestic aviation security regime against emerging threats. The package includes measures to enhance Australia’s air cargo supply chain security framework. The government will provide financial assistance to industry to install X-ray explosive trace detection technology at selected locations and establish a regulated shipper scheme. The enhanced measures will enable identification of high-risk air cargo for technology based examination to take place at an earlier point in the supply chain where cargo consignments are less consolidated. The bill and its regulations will ensure that when a parcel gets to the airport there will be assurance for the person who loads the air cargo that it has been security cleared. The bill provides the foundation for a whole-of-supply chain security system which is sufficiently flexible to meet changes in the external environment. I note the support of the Liberal and National parties for this legislation.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2010-02-25,"—I rise to make a contribution to the Australian Astronomical Observatory Bill 2009. This bill and the Australian Astronomical Observatory (Transitional Provisions) Bill 2009 are a package which provide for the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board to be dissolved and for the establishment of the Australian Astronomical Observatory, the AAO, within the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research.
The Anglo-Australian Telescope Board was established in 1969 when the Australian and United Kingdom governments entered into a treaty to fund and operate a large optical telescope in Australia. For the past 40 years the AAO has operated world-class optical and infrared observing facilities that have allowed Australian and British astronomers to become world leaders in astronomical research and the development of innovative telescope instrumentation. The AAO has also taken a lead role in formulating long-term plans for astronomy in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The AAO facilities comprise the Siding Spring National Observatory at Coonabarabran in New South Wales and also a headquarters and instrumentation laboratory at Epping in New South Wales. It is there that the Australian-Anglo telescope has been utilised to find 25 planets around other stars, has helped to determine the cause of giant cosmic explosions, also known as gamma rays bursts, and has made precise measurements of the amounts of dark energy and dark matter in the universe.
Passing these bills will herald a new area for astronomy in our nation, with the United Kingdom formally withdrawing from the partnership as of 1 July 2010 and the Australian government taking sole responsibility for what will be now known as the Australian Astronomical Observatory. The coalition has a proud record of supporting science and innovation and technology and we understand the important role science plays in adding to our knowledge about our world and solving problems and improving our lives, often in ways that were never foreseen or dreamt possible. It was the former Howard government that entered into a treaty with the United Kingdom in 2005 to facilitate the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from this program and the development of Australia’s national program in its place. We are very fortunate to have this facility in Australia, and on behalf of the coalition I am pleased to be supporting these two bills which will facilitate the establishment of a truly national observatory for Australia.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-02-25,"—I note with some interest that this bill was introduced by Minister Bowen in his first and second reading speeches on 27 August 2008, and I invite honourable senators to listen to the words that were spoken by Mr Bowen and see how things have changed quite remarkably over a short period of time. He said:
I strongly urge the opposition to reconsider their approach to this measure—
and I will refer back to that later on—
which forms part of the government’s response to inflationary pressures in the economy and our savings plan. This measure and other savings measures are an important component of our effort to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.
What remarkable words in light of the pressure we are now seeing on inflation and interest rates with the continuation of this government’s so-called stimulus spending. What remarkable words, and they have come back to haunt the government and will continue to do so.
This bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (Political Contributions and Gifts) Bill 2008 started life as the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008 and that was defeated in the Senate. It was defeated by the government versus all other parties because it sought to disenfranchise individuals in the community from participating in the political process. The great irony of that is that the government was happy to disenfranchise individuals while at the same time it was quite happy to keep a tax deduction for its own members if they were making a donation to the Australian Labor Party. If a sitting senator or member of the Labor Party was donating to the Labor Party then it was okay to get the deduction, but if someone in the community wanted to participate in the political process, apparently it was not. The government voted against that. It had the sense, thankfully, to take up this amended bill and bring it back in through the House of Representatives to here, today.
Again, of course, that original bill was a cute little way of bringing in some campaign finance reform without actually taking on the responsibility of comprehensive campaign finance reform. The government was caught out and the Senate, to its great credit, caught the government out in relation to this bill. The government knows it was caught out because within a very short period after this it started talking about comprehensive campaign finance reform, and started talking about the very things the coalition had referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for consideration as appropriate. The government, again, was trying, for purely partisan reasons, to introduce a very, very small and minimal part of campaign finance reform without having the intestinal fortitude to take it further. Funnily enough, not much has changed.
One could ask why the Australian Labor Party, the Rudd government, would want to deny citizens the right to participate in the political process by getting a tax deduction for donations while enabling their own members to get a tax deduction. Their view, I suspect, is that when you have the union movement financing you, why give the ordinary citizen the opportunity to participate? I have some figures here. From 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2008 there was a massive $61.4 million put into the election of the Australian Labor Party—$61.4 million over two years. As honourable senators have heard me say before, the trade union movement is owed by Prime Minister Rudd and the Australian Labor Party is owned by the unions.
If you look further at some of these figures, from 2007 to 2008 there was $37.6 million. If it was not for the fact that we had changed the rules in relation to transparency and associated entity returns, we would not have found out about the $26.8 million, which was indirect financing of the Australian Labor Party by their masters, the ACTU and the wider trade union movement. We would not have seen that. People would not have seen the level of influence of the unions on the Australian Labor Party if we had not changed the rules.
I am mindful of the time. We do support this bill but the irony is the government bringing it on today as noncontroversial, having been vehemently opposed to the opportunity for Australian citizens to participate in the political process by making a tax deductible donation—while at the same time ensuring that their own members were able to claim a deduction for the same donation to the same party. That is quite remarkable. But the opposition does support this bill because, quite frankly, along with the Greens and the Independents, we were the ones who effectively sponsored it.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2010-02-25,"—I move:
That intervening business be postponed till after consideration of government business order of the day no. 6, Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2009.
I just wanted to note some of the very lengthy speeches that we have already had to endure during this period of traditionally short speeches and non-controversial matters. One could even assume, if one had a suspicious mind, that the opposition would once again seek to frustrate even bringing a bill on for discussion. This bill represents an historic restructuring of the telecommunications sector. Those opposite have spent all morning trying to avoid having to face up to the fact that this is a bill that they did not have the courage to put in place when they sold Telstra. This is a market structure that should have been put in place. Those opposite failed the test on economic credibility when they were in government; they failed to do any serious heavy lifting in microeconomic reform. This is a bill that was agreed to be brought on. Now those opposite have indicated—although I hope they are going to finally see their way to having the actual bill debated, to bring this on for debate.

Senator Parry interjecting—

—Yes, there was some confusion, Senator Parry, you are correct. But you do not get to decide what the government’s business program is. This is the bill that the government would like, and needs, to bring forward to start the debate. Let us bring the debate on. Let us have the debate and let us stop the senseless filibustering, the outrageous oppositionism and the hijacking of this chamber that has gone on all week.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,24,1,speech
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2010-02-25,"—I totally reject everything Senator Conroy has just said. Non-controversial legislation time commenced at 12.45 and it completed at 1.45. That left 15 minutes, so where is the filibustering if we are trying to talk out non-controversial time, Senator? So your first point is totally incorrect, from the evidence of the clock alone. Secondly, this rearrangement of business is brought on unannounced. You sought to have these bills brought on earlier in the week. At a whips meeting last night, it was agreed by the government and the Greens and us that the order of legislation would be as it appears on the red today.
—That is not true.
—That was organised last night at the whips meeting.
—The Greens don’t support you at all on that.
—They were not prepared to debate this particular bill today and we agreed with the Greens, and the government agreed with the Greens, and organised for the legislation as it appears in the order on the red today.
—That is not true.
—Senator Conroy made one correct statement: the government does organise the business. And it did. It organised the red, and this bill appears well down that list. Senator Conroy, for whatever purpose, wants to bring this bill up, and yet in November last year Senator Conroy spent a week-long trip in Egypt instead of being here to debate the bill when it could have been brought on. There was a time and opportunity then. It was not brought on then. Now, all of a sudden, on the last day of the sitting week, he wants to bring it on for—what?—the period of about 15 minutes because he knows that we then go into question time at 2 o’clock and from question time we go into general business and other matters and the legislation will not continue until the next sitting fortnight.
Why do you want to debate it for 10 or 11 minutes? It just does not make sense. Senator Conroy must have some reason—whether he is embarrassed because he did not get it up last year, I do not know. Senator Conroy, the opposition will not be supporting you moving to change the order around for the sake of 11 minutes. What is the big issue of bringing it on for 11 minutes? It does not make sense. If it was that important your government should have put it on the red in the order it should have been. We are all prepared to move into the order. The next bill to be considered is the fairer private health insurance bill. We have Senator Cormann sitting here ready to go.
The allegation is filibustering. If that is true we could have very easily gone to 2 o’clock in non-controversial legislation. We did not. We facilitated the entire stream of legislation in a normal and orderly manner. Every speaker, I think—bar possibly one—spoke well below their allocated time so there was certainly no filibustering. In fact, quite often in this chamber I would love to go back to the Hansard and find the records. In fact, I might just do this, Senator Conroy. I would love to go back and find out how many ministers have spoken in non-controversial legislation longer than the shadow ministers. It is a complaint I have lodged with your manager on several occasions. We are expected to be brief and your ministers quite often go for the full 20 minutes—one of them is sitting in this room now. I think you need to check some of your facts about filibustering because we seem to be the more efficient party in this chamber.
We seem to be the party that actually gets work done. You come in here and constantly try to rearrange it. You cannot even allocate enough sitting weeks in a year when we give you thousands and thousands of opportunities to do so, and we end up with a bit of a mess. You try to fit legislation in where you cannot fit it in. You want to bring on a bill for 11 or 12 minutes. I cannot fathom the workings of the government, and I am sure the public cannot. I think the public will see this as we move towards the next election. You cannot organise your program properly. You also have to be cognisant of the fact that the government—whilst it is the government—does not have the numbers in this place. The opposition parties completely have the numbers in this place. We often give you warnings. I do not know how many times I have got up and warned the government of mismanagement of this place. On many occasions to assist the government we have had to help rearrange business. The government cannot run this chamber properly. We have to intervene constantly to do this.
The mess is clearly because the government does not listen to the Greens, the two Independents or the two minor party senators and the opposition when it comes to sitting weeks. We have flagged this—and Hansard will reflect—in July, August, October and November last year. We said, ‘Make sure you have enough sitting weeks in the program for 2010.’ When the calendar comes out, what does it have? Another extraordinarily low sitting year with huge gaps. That is mainly to facilitate not the business of this chamber, not the business of the parliament, but to fit in with the Prime Minister’s overseas travel itinerary. That is what the whole sitting schedule is designed around. It is nothing to do with the fair work of this place. You would get a lot more out of this chamber if we had a lot more sitting weeks. So you try to come in here and waste 11 minutes by rearranging the business. Senator Cormann is sitting here ready to go. We are not ready for the legislation further down the list and we will be opposing this rearrangement of business.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,24,1,speech
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-02-25,"—I want to clarify the Greens position. I understand that Senator Parry said that we said in the whips meeting that we were not ready, and that is absolutely correct in the sense that we did not agree for this bill to be in the non-controversial time because we think it is an important bill and we have amendments that we wish to move. However, when the parliamentary liaison officer contacted our office this morning and said, ‘If it is not in non-contro, if it is, in fact, being debated in normal government time as a government bill, we will be happy with that.’ We did clarify it with the PLO.
So there are two points. Yes, Senator Parry is right: we said that we did not want it to be in non-controversial legislation. And we did clarify this morning that we were ready. We understood that the government had communicated that to the coalition. Obviously they did not or there was a breakdown in communication or the opposition are now not ready. I just want to clarify that the Greens are ready to debate this bill as a government bill but not as a non-controversial bill. In terms of the extra sitting weeks, I remind the coalition that the Greens put forward a motion to extend the sitting weeks which the coalition did not support. Just remember that: the Greens put in a motion to make sure that the chamber sat enough times to adequately deal with the legislative agenda. That was rejected by both the ALP and the coalition.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,24,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-02-25,"—What a remarkable intervention halfway through the discussion on a bill that I had addressed, that I was not going to speak to because we were in committee and was not going to speak to after that. We have the most rattled minister, apart from Minister Garrett, in the Rudd government jumping in and intervening. Senator Conroy, the simple fact is that you have had a miserable week because your judgment has been severely questioned. Your decision to bandy yourself around the country and accept largesse from anyone who made an offer has left you exposed in relation to what it is. You know that, under the ministerial standards, you have an obligation to ensure that whatever you do does not leave your or the government open, does not leave you or the government bare. What you have done this week with this ridiculous intervention at this hour, at five minutes to two, just shows that you are completely and utterly rattled. What it shows is that if you had wanted this bill on you could have done it well before now. The bottom line is that you are rattled and your decision this morning about whether NBN will be wholesale or retail—you are just desperately looking for the front page of the paper to divert from your complete and utter inadequacies.
You know and I know that this bill was never going to be debated today. You know and I know, from what we have heard from Senator Siewert, that this was never, ever going to be debated under non-controversial legislation. You owe the Manager of Opposition Business an apology. You called him gutless, as did that senator sitting behind you, who should have the guts to apologise. When you are wrong, you say sorry. Say sorry now, because you have completely and utterly misrepresented Senator Parry.
—He doesn’t need your protection.
—I know who I would rather have operating this chamber: Senator Parry, not those sitting behind you or Senator Conroy himself. When you go to bed tonight, Senator Conroy, and reflect on your week, I invite you to have a look at the tapes of question time when you have been speaking, because the body language says it all. They think you have made a complete and utter fool of yourself this week. They know you have severely compromised yourself. They know you have severely compromised the Rudd government and they know that they have had a miserable week on the back of your inadequacies and those of Senator Arbib and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts in the other place. Have the good grace to apologise, because you intervened in the bill I was speaking to on the basis that Senator Parry had misrepresented the situation.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-02-25,"—The pressure is really starting to show on that side, isn’t it? The cracks are starting to show, because this is all about ministers not being able to compete for time in this chamber with the absolutely incompetent Minister for Health and Ageing. We have debated for a whole week now a broken promise in the health portfolio which the Labor Party knows will not have the support of this chamber. We have wasted week after week on broken promise after broken promise in the health portfolio. They cannot manage their program and now you have ministers who are starting to crack up because they cannot get time on their agenda. If this legislation is so important why didn’t you put it at the top of the list? Why did you put a piece of legislation at the top of the list which you know does not have the support of the Senate, does not have the support of the Australian people and is not good legislation for the health system?
As your top priority for legislation this week you put forward a piece of legislation which will be bad for our health system and bad for patients across Australia, a broken promise which is there to hide the fact that this government has been an absolute failure in the health portfolio. You have delivered not one jot, not one thing. You promised the world but have delivered next to nothing. We have a minister here who clearly cannot fathom that Nicola Roxon is absolutely dominating the legislative agenda in the Senate, and the government in the Senate cannot get their pieces of legislation up; as a result, they have to resort to desperate tactics. They have to resort to attacking the Manager of Opposition Business in this chamber without foundation. If the minister thinks that his piece of legislation is so important he should tell Nicola Roxon to stop putting forward legislation which clearly does not have the support the Senate.
This is just a stunt. Last year we had to waste weeks because this heartless government wanted to cut patient rebates for cataract surgery in half. Weeks and weeks and weeks of time in the Senate was wasted, and here we go again. I can understand the frustration of Senator Conroy. I can well understand that other ministers are starting to get frustrated because none of their bills can get to the top of the list. Here they are, jumping up and down because they cannot win the debate in their Senate tactics committee. They cannot get the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to get them up the list. They have only one strategy: a political strategy to come up with excuses as to why they have been such a failure in the health portfolio. This is all about coming up with a political strategy to justify to the Australian people in the lead-up to the next election why they have been such a failure in the health portfolio. It is nothing more and nothing less. Do you know what? I can understand why Senator Conroy is so frustrated. Clearly, with their failure to properly manage their program and with Nicola Roxon absolutely monopolising legislative time for the government here in the Senate, it must be very bad for him because he cannot get his legislation up. It has nothing to do with us. I absolutely agree with Senator Ronaldson: Senator Conroy should apologise to the Manager of Opposition Business for absolutely having misrepresented him.

—How much new money?
—It was a package of $41 million, Senator. In terms of that money we are providing 7,000 training places—

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—Order! You have asked your question, Senator Cormann.
—Seven thousand training places will be provided to workers who lose their jobs because of the changes in the policy, or need to be transitioned into the new program. I have, on a number of occasions, been upfront and said that there will be job losses because of the changes. There is no doubt about that. But at the same time, as all good senators know, this was a scheme that would run out some time next year. So a transition would have been required. And, as Senator Cormann has pointed out, 4,000 of the training places were provided last year as part of the government’s green jobs package to provide assistance for workers as they transition into new areas of employment because, as we know, this scheme was always going to run out at some stage. But in terms of the package, just the same way as the government stepped in during the global recession to support jobs—when, in just the same way, the coalition senators voted against the stimulus package supporting 200,000 jobs—the government has stepped in with 25 co-ordinators on the ground working with businesses to try and ensure that their workers can transition to the new program.
What Senator Cormann should do is talk to his leader, who will not even guarantee funding for the new program. He will not even guarantee funding for the new program. So if you are concerned about jobs then give support to the new program and give these workers some certainty. (Time expired)

In terms of the training places, again 4,000 of those have already been identified. They were put forward by the Prime Minister last year. In terms of the remainder, they are coming out of the structural adjustment training places. It is clear that, again, we are working to support those workers who lose their jobs in the sector—those workers who require transition.

Again, this was an industry and a bonus that would have ended some time next year, and there was always going to be a transition for many workers. The government is doing everything it can with this program, providing $41 million to help those workers transition to the new scheme.
In terms of the package, training places are being provided to assist those workers who are already with an insulation company and those workers who have lot their jobs. Senators on the other side—coalition senators—if you want to support these workers do not just ask questions here; go down the hall, talk to your leader and get him to support the new scheme, because that is the only way to defend jobs in the insulation industry.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-02-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment Participation and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery (Senator Arbib) to questions without notice asked by Senator Cormann and Birmingham today, relating to the Home Insulation Program.
It is amazing to hear Senator Arbib come in here and talk about our misunderstanding his role. At least he is admitting to actually having a role. And what is this role? This role was part of one of the greatest debacles in modern political history that is going to cost $100 million to fix up. This epitomises Labor Party management. This epitomises Labor Party risk. This epitomises the Labor Party and their whole rhetorical flourish.
Yesterday we saw our Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, wandering down to the front with his notebook in hand. He was going to take notes; he was going to fix it all up. I noticed that there did not seem to be any other notes in the notebook—it seemed to be a new notebook. It was a new notebook specially designed for the occasion—a new notebook with probably a new pen with a whole new approach. There was nothing written in that notebook, so I imagine that to that point in time he had not really come across a problem that needed fixing.
So now we have Mr Rudd and his new notebook wandering down to earnestly talk to the ceiling insulation people. Maybe he would like to talk to the families that have faced the tragedy of the deaths that have been brought about by this badly administered program, this ceiling insulation program. Maybe he would like to talk to the people who wondered today whether their roof was a death trap. Maybe he would like to talk today about all the shonky operators who have been ripping off the Australian taxpayer with all their shonky deals in this completely shonky outfit. Maybe he would like to write in his little notebook about how even today we are finding advertisements going out for the installation of ceiling batts. Maybe he would like to talk today about the people who are willing to backdate jobs so they can still get in on the act?
Senator Arbib said he had realised there were a few reports and that he had not been across them all: ‘I knew there were reports and we had meetings but I can’t tell you exactly what they were about. I can’t tell you exactly my role in them. I think you’ve misunderstood my role. I think you’ve misunderstood exactly what the Labor Party are up to. I think the whole of the Australian people are at fault because they misunderstand the Labor Party and exactly what they have been trying to do.’ It was the case that the Labor Party decided on it, in a fit of inspiration, and then they put out this program fast—and that is on their admission. That is the admission of the finance minister, Mr Lindsay Tanner, who said, ‘We didn’t have time to dot the i’s and cross the t’s. We had to get it out there.’ They did not have time to dot the i’s and cross the t’s.
So apart from the cost, the $2.45 billion that they were spending on it, what else has that admission cost us? We are seeing right now that the upfront cost of that admission is $100 million, so a $100 million statement by Mr Tanner or $100 million worth of bad management by Senator Arbib. What could that $100 million have done if they had actually managed it, if they had been diligent, if they had been decisive? If they had actually done their homework we could be using that $100 million for so many other things in our nation. We could be using it for health, we could be using it for education and we could be using it for defence but we are using it to fix up their stuff-up. That is what we have to use that $100 million for, to fix that mistake, and that is apart from the fact that there are four people dead, there have been over 100 house fires and there is the electrification of roofs. All this personifies the Labor Party.
The Republicans have their elephant, the Democrats have their donkey and the Australian Labor Party have the ceiling insulation program. That personifies exactly who they are, exactly how they operate and how shoddy and hopeless they are as an organisation. The notebook, the earnest look on the face and the strolling down to the front—it is all a rhetorical flourish but they lack the detail and they lack the capacity to bring forward an outcome. I would like Mr Rudd to table that notebook. It would be fascinating to see whether it even still exists. Does that notebook still exist? Is it really there? Whereabouts is that little prop? Let us see if Mr Rudd can table that little prop, that brand-new notebook. It is another form of deception of the Australian people in that it says that they care and that they are actually going to do something about it. Well, he stuffed it up and has got to fix it up.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-02-25,"—It has been rather interesting that we have had this very quiet question time when Senator Joyce does not say boo to a goose and then all of a sudden, when it comes to taking note of answers, we get this feigned outrage. All of a sudden he is very troubled and worried and has a commentary to give. I do not know what year you went to NIDA, Senator Joyce, and I do not know whether you passed but there you were feigning outrage after a whole hour of silence at question time.
Over the last months and months we have been criticised by those opposite for attempting to do the right thing by Australian workers. The insulation program, as we all know, was a part of a complete set of measures that responded to the global financial crisis. It has been disappointing that in some places the insulation program has not met the benchmark that we expected. It has been disappointing that there have been operators who have been prepared to break the rules.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator McLucas has the right to be heard in silence.
—When I was contacted, as many of us on this side were and I certainly hope those on the other side were, by the very large number of installers with concerns, those who by and large were doing the right thing, we were able to take their concerns through to the department, through the hotline, and they were acted on.
Minister Garrett and Minister Arbib have been on the job, ensuring that any concerns brought to their attention have been dealt with. In fact, I think that the recent announcement of support for those in the insulation industry is a sensible response to what I acknowledge is a difficult situation. The $41.2 million insulation worker adjustment package will include a $10 million insulation workers adjustment fund to help workers and firms through the transition period. It will be allocated on the recommendation of a team of existing local employment coordinators and new dedicated insulation employment coordinators. The fund will support firms to retain their workforces in work or training activities or to support workers directly. There will be $1.5 million allocated for up to 25 dedicated insulation employment coordinators, funded from the jobs fund. These new positions will assist displaced insulation workers to find alternative jobs with other employers and other industries. This assistance will complement and draw on existing support provided through local employment coordinators and the resources of the Job Services Australia network. The insulation employment coordinators will have access to the $10m insulation workers adjustment fund to assist workers transitioning to alternative jobs or training. Five million dollars has been allocated for 1,000 structural adjustment places to help retrain insulation workers in alternative industries announced today. There will be $24.7 million allocated for 6,000 training places that have already been announced, to assist insulation workers—2,000 each from the Apprenticeship Access places; the language literacy and numeracy program; and the structural adjustment program.
Those opposite have been critical of our response to the global financial crisis from the beginning. If it is such a disaster, why is Australia one of only two OECD countries which have not gone into recession? We are working hard to ensure that elements of the insulation program that have not been quite up to the mark—and we acknowledge that—are now being addressed. We have all acknowledged—and this is nothing amazing—that there have been difficulties. What we have done, and what your side has not acknowledged, is see that every time there has been a problem there has been an appropriate response. We are ensuring that jobs are protected for as long as they can be into the future.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Home Insulation Program</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,27,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-02-25,"—Heaven help us if that is getting on with the job or up to the job. You must be terribly proud, Senator McLucas, that four people have died from this program. You must be terribly proud that 93 house fires have been linked. You must be very proud that 1,000 homes may have electrified roofs.
—Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: that was a deeply offensive remark and I ask that it be withdrawn. His assertion implied that senators on this side, including Senator McLucas, would be proud of people dying. It is deeply offensive, it is false and I ask that it be withdrawn.
—I withdraw it on the basis that it was a commentary, not a comment directed at Senator McLucas. But let us make sure the public record is absolutely clear. You came into this place and you have defended a program, and I have said to you that four people have died as a result of it. I have said to you that 98 house fires have been linked to it. I have said to you that 1,000 homes are electrified. I put to you that another 200,000 are at risk. If you are proud of that, I would be very surprised. And that is my point, Senator McLucas. There is nothing to be proud of. That is the point I was making.
The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, are apparently on the job. I want to take the chamber back to the questions today from Senator Birmingham to Minister Arbib. They were two absolutely fundamental key questions, neither of which was responded to, and there is a very good reason for that. The first question was:
Did any departmental officials ever advise ... the minister or his staff that the starting date of the Home Insulation Program should be delayed?
That is a very simple question, to which there was no response. The second question was:
Given the minister’s statements yesterday and on Tuesday that his role at these regular meetings with officials was ‘to ensure the rollout was proceeding smoothly and on time ...
The minister stood up after question time today and conveniently dropped the words ‘on time’. Mr Deputy President, I will tell you why you have not had a response to these questions. It is because this does not stop at Minister Arbib and Minister Garrett. This goes right to the top. I thought the comments of Dean Mighell today on Melbourne radio station 3AW were most instructive. He said: ‘But it was not well thought out. It is part of the problem of style of government.’ And it is the style of this government to rush in and try to address a problem by the expenditure of money. It is about doing things such as the NBN—$43 billion—without an iota of a business plan. This is a government that has been described by my colleagues today as ‘blah, blah, blah’. Yesterday, this blah, blah, blah Prime Minister was at it outside with the installers. He said, ‘We are just having a yak.’ The expression ‘yak’ is described in the dictionary as ‘empty conversation’. This is empty conversation. This is all talk, no action. This is blah, blah, blah—empty, empty, empty conversation. The dictionary says the colloquial expression of yak is, ‘To talk or chatter, especially pointlessly and continuously.’ So we do have blah, blah, blah.
The reason Minister Arbib refused to answer Senator Birmingham’s quite clear and deliberate questions is that he knows the Prime Minister is in this up to his ears. He knows that the Prime Minister told Minister Arbib that he was to roll this out, irrespective of what advice he was given. That is the only thing you can take from the minister’s refusal to answer the very simple question, ‘Did any departmental officials ever advise the minister or his staff that the starting date of the Home Insulation Program should be delayed?’ Why would he not answer that question? It is because the answer is yes. We know what his role is, because he told us. It was to ensure the rollout was proceeding smoothly and on time. This minister knew what the advice was. This minister knew that Minter Ellison had addressed a number of issues and therefore they set a three-month delay. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2010-02-25,"—It is very interesting to follow Senator Ronaldson. Most times I do not. I might have to request to follow him more often, because he is extraordinarily amusing in the way he talks—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I tell you we are very serious about it. We have acted on these concerns and the issues of safety. What we have been given today is somebody who would rather make fun and talk about the definition of ‘yak’ in the dictionary. That is what we have got with him waving his hands around and trying to make slurs against individual senators on this side of the chamber. I am not sure whether he withdrew or not in the end.
—He did withdraw.
—However, this government takes the issue of safety very seriously. That is why the minister has acted to boost safety for households and for workers who undertake the installation of these programs. The $41.2 million Insulation Worker Adjustment package will help workers and firms through this transition period. The package offers support to retain people in their current job until the Renewable Energy Bonus program begins and assistance to find alternative jobs or a relevant training place where employment opportunities are not available. The $41.2 million Insulation Worker Adjustment package comprises a $10 million Insulation Workers Adjustment Fund to help workers and firms through the transition period, $1.5 million to fund up to 25 dedicated insulation employment coordinators to assist displaced insulation workers to find alternative jobs, $5 million for an additional 1,000 Structural Adjustment Places to help retrain insulation workers in alternative industries and $24.7 million in already announced funding to support 6,000 already announced training places to assist insulation workers. These places are divided between 2,000 Structural Adjustment Places, taking the total to 3,000 places—

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Cormann is so rude.

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—I am used to it, Senator, but some other senators find it more distracting than those of us who are used to you interjecting constantly. It is simply rude and contrary to standing orders.
—On the point of order: I am listening very carefully. There have been various degrees of interjection. I thought that this time it was much quieter. Senator Brown, please continue.
—There are also 2,000 Language, Literacy and Numeracy Program places and 2,000 Apprenticeships Access Program places, which provide prevocational training to workers seeking to enter an apprenticeship. These and other measures guarantee them access to retraining, support and help in developing a tailored employment pathway plan to find another job as quickly as possible. They will be eligible for one of the 7,000 training places available for redundant insulation workers.
This strong commitment is in stark contrast to what is offered by the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition, in a doorstop, has said he does not believe in training; he is not interested in training. Mr Abbott said:
I think that training programmes for people who have been thrown out of work are of limited usefulness; people need jobs, that’s what they need.
—What’s wrong with that?
—That flies in the face of everything that every stakeholder in the insulation industry has said about the importance of training in the sector. That is why. Training is vital for workers and businesses who want to participate in the new scheme and for getting unskilled workers into new jobs. The Prime Minister is on record about working our way through the implementation of inspections and the rectification of work which is necessary. He has also indicated support for the firms and workers. We accept responsibility for the problems which have arisen, and of course that means—
—None of your ministers have.
—The government has accepted the responsibility for the problems that have arisen, and we have put in place measures— (Time expired)

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2010-02-25,"—I also rise to take note of answers given by Senator Arbib, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery, to questions asked by Senators Cormann and Birmingham. I thank Senator Carol Brown for her remarks, but she seems to miss the point. Why would the job training and help programs be necessary if the original program had worked? This was a government program set forth in excruciating detail, with apparently umpteen safeguards and reasons why it would work. Why didn’t it work? The opposition and I call for the minister’s sacking or resignation as the only honourable course left.
The Prime Minister said today, in a couple of places, that he is ultimately responsible for the failure of this program. As is usual with the Prime Minister, these words are very hollow and they are very different from the reality that, unfortunately, everybody else can see. The Prime Minister has not taken the responsibility to sack this incompetent minister. The Prime Minister has not taken responsibility for the deaths of the four victims of this program and apologised to their families. He has not taken responsibility for the hundreds of thousands who are at risk in their homes and apologised to them. He did not even have the guts to stand up in the parliament during the censure motion earlier this week and defend his minister, defend his program or defend himself.
Now we see him making the token effort to wander out into the front courtyard of this place and give the appearance of listening. We also saw him calling in the troops and circling the wagons this morning in a special caucus briefing. Reportedly the Prime Minister advised caucus that they were all in it together. Well, he and Minister Garrett are the people who have lumped the entire Labor Party government in this together, including senators like Senator Carol Brown, who has to stand up in all good faith and defend him. I remind the Prime Minister that he is not a victim in this, even though his ego may be bruised; he and his ministers are, in fact, the perpetrators.
I remind the Senate that there are 24,000 homes with unsafe or substandard installations, 160,000 installations that did not meet product standards, 80,000 installations that did not meet safety standards, 1,000 electrified homes—how would you like that?—and that there have been 93 house fires and the four tragic deaths of the young men. And yet the Prime Minister has the gall to call Mr Garrett a first-class minister and a very effective minister. Those endorsements came within the last week. This is despite the fact that the minister received over 21 individual warnings over safety and the reports of the four deaths.
Despite the minister’s officials receiving a Minter Ellison report exposing deep concerns in April last year, and a further risk register from Minter Ellison with a clear warning to delay the program for three months to correct the problems, he claims he did not know anything about it until 11 days ago. The Prime Minister’s own officials were warned, in February 2009, but he claims that he did not know anything about that either—a very convenient lapse in ministerial procedure across two departments! This is a ridiculous farce being perpetrated by the Prime Minister and the minister for the environment.
The facts are that as early as 9 March last year the minister was warned in writing by the National Electrical and Communications Association that the program was a disaster waiting to happen. In late April last year he was warned by territory and state ministers that this program was a disaster waiting to happen and that if it went ahead in that form there would be serious risk to property and life. On 14 October last year, we had the first death—and it goes on and on and on. The minister received warnings from the Master Electricians association, the ACTU, the New South Wales minister and Labor government ministers but he finally acted only in February.
Now, all of this was entirely preventable, yet the minister took no action to reduce the risks. In fact, he bragged about how wonderfully successful the program was. It beggars belief that both of these men were unaware of at least some of these warnings. So why did the program proceed? Why did the minister not demand further information before authorising it and how is it possible for the minister to be so callous? This minister has comprehensively failed to undertake the due diligence demanded or to heed the warnings. In either case, the result must be the same, because failure to do so is grounds for his termination.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-02-25,"—The issue I rise to speak to this afternoon is one of great importance to all Australians who value fairness and justice: the right to have their love formally recognised by the state through marriage.
The Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009 seeks to amend the Marriage Act by removing any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Today is a monumental, momentous day. It is a historic day for us to be debating a particular piece of legislation that deals specifically with removing the discrimination that currently exists within the Marriage Act. It comes after an inquiry that received over 27,000 submissions from Australians wanting this issue to be discussed and debated in our federal parliament. It is clear that the community has strong views on this issue and they wanted it debated by their elected representatives. Thousands have taken to the streets in support of this bill, with this year earmarked as the national year of action on same-sex marriage. Only this coming weekend, thousands and thousands of people will line the streets of Sydney for the Sydney mardi gras—people gathering together because they want to celebrate equality.
The momentum for this bill is growing. The momentum amongst the Australian community for removing this discrimination is growing every year. The polls—the support out there in the community—suggest that over 60 per cent of Australians want to see same-sex marriage legal in Australia. They do not want to see people discriminated against any longer.
The idea that consenting adults should have the right to celebrate their love and commitment as they see fit is such a simple principle, yet in this place it is still controversial. While a majority of Australians agree—let’s remove that discrimination; let’s insist on fairness and justice—we still have objections from both sides of the chamber. The old parties continue, based on party lines, to think that it is still appropriate for them to deny same-sex couples the same recognition as heterosexual couples.
My message to Mr Rudd and to Mr Abbott today is very clear: we have just begun the second decade of the 21st century; it is time for us to progress. Surely, it is time for us to have moved past the days when we discriminated against people based on their gender or their sexual orientation. That kind of discrimination belongs in the past. I must say—it may sound crass but it is true—that if Mr Rudd and Mr Abbott are so wedded to it, they too belong in the past. Let’s recognise the diversity of modern Australia by giving all committed and loving relationships between consenting adults the same rights and protections.
The same arguments that are being trotted out by those who oppose this bill have some historical parallels. I am sure that when our predecessors debated giving Indigenous people the right to be recognised as citizens of their own country or when women were given the right to vote the same eyebrows were raised. There were some people who argued that the sky would fall in. But we changed those laws because we knew it was right. We drew a line in the sand and said: ‘Let’s consign this kind of discrimination to the past.’ That is what this bill is asking us to do today. We know that the nay-sayers back then were wrong, and we know here today that the nay-sayers are wrong. Removing that kind of discrimination makes the fabric of our society stronger, not weaker. Today I am calling on the Senate to move past these outdated petty prejudices and to strengthen our democracy and our society by removing another form of discrimination that has lingered for way too long.
While Victoria, Tasmania, the ACT and, as recently this week, New South Wales have established relationship registration and civil partnership schemes for same-sex couples, these schemes should not be used by the federal government as an excuse to not accept that what we need is true equality for marriage. These schemes continue to fall short of equal legal recognition enjoyed by heterosexual relationships and must not be used as a substitute for marriage. It is important for us to remember that this is not just an issue for same-sex couples but for all of us who believe in justice, fairness and the ultimate of human rights. It is a human rights issue. It is about the legitimacy of the institution of marriage not being undermined by discrimination.
We must also remember that this is not just a religious issue. We know that 65 per cent of marriages in Australia are conducted by civil celebrants, not religious celebrants. We know that 65 per cent of marriages do not occur within the institutions of the church. We know that 65 per cent of marriages in Australia are conducted by people and for people who want their relationship recognised not just by their loved ones, not just by their families and each other but by the state as well. The difference for same-sex couples is that currently under the Marriage Act they simply do not have the choice to marry. We need to be able to remove that discrimination and give them that choice today.
The Prime Minister of the day and the Leader of the Opposition should not have the power to ensure that their members in this place vote based on their own ideological and conservative views. Let us be honest: we know that in this place and in the other place there are people on all sides of the chamber who fundamentally believe that this type of discrimination should be removed. Hopefully, today we will get to a vote on this bill. I would like to see us vote according to our conscience. If we look at the issue and at fairness and justice and want to vote according to what is right, we will want to remove that discrimination.
Throughout the Senate inquiry into this bill, numerous people submitted their personal stories suggesting how changing this bill would positively affect them. We heard mothers and fathers talking about how they longed for their children to have their relationships recognised. We heard from one mother who has two sons; one’s relationship is recognised because he is straight and the other’s relationship is not recognised because he is gay. The Prime Minister has been asked to consider why one of this woman’s sons is a second-class citizen. We need to remove this type of discrimination. We need to embrace equality for all—equal love.
The sky has not fallen in in places like Belgium, Sweden, Canada, South America, South Africa and various states of the United States because they have changed the laws to reflect an acceptance that same-sex couples have the same rights as heterosexual couples. In fact, I would argue that the sun is shining brighter in those places. We should not be in a situation where Australian citizens have to leave our country to have their relationships recognised through marriages in Canada, only to arrive back in Australia, step off the plane at Sydney International Airport and know that all of a sudden their marriage is invalid. It is time for us to move forward. It is time for us to progress. It is time for this parliament to discuss this issue and to think very carefully about what type of discrimination we want to leave future generations of Australians. How can we say, ‘All people are equal but some are more equal than others’? It simply does not make sense. I commend the bill to the Senate, and I look forward to the debate.",SENATE,<title>MARRIAGE EQUALITY AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2010-02-25,"—The Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009 seeks to make amendments to the Marriage Act 1961. The Australian government believes that all couples who have a mutual commitment to a shared life should have the opportunity to have their relationship officially recognised. That is why the government supports the development of a nationally consistent framework that provides the opportunity for all couples who have a mutual commitment to a shared life to have their relationships officially recognised. At the same time, the government is committed to maintaining the definition of ‘marriage’ as currently set out in the Marriage Act. It is for this reason that the government cannot support the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill currently before the Senate.
To date, relationship recognition schemes have been established in Tasmania, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. The government welcomes the announcement of the New South Wales government this week that it will develop a relationship recognition scheme. The scheme will enable de facto couples, both opposite sex and same sex, to have their relationships formally recognised and will form part of a nationally consistent framework. Of course, the federal government will work with the New South Wales government to ensure that all de facto relationships registered under the New South Wales scheme are recognised under Commonwealth laws and programs. This co-operation has already occurred in relation to other relationship recognition schemes which are recognised under Commonwealth laws and programs.
The Australian government believes that people are entitled to respect, equality, dignity and the opportunity to participate in society free of hatred and harassment and to receive the protection of the law regardless of their sexuality or gender identity. Consistent with this belief, the Rudd government moved quickly to pass legislation to remove discrimination against same-sex-couples and their children from 84 Commonwealth laws. The reform process was completed within the first 18 months of the government’s term and demonstrates our commitment to remove discrimination and make a practical difference. The reforms removed discrimination in areas of Commonwealth activity including taxation, social security, health, aged care, superannuation, immigration, child support and family law. As I said, 84 Commonwealth laws have been reformed by this government—and all of the reforms are now in force.
These reforms mean that same-sex couples have the same entitlements and obligations that apply to opposite-sex couples. Of course, the precise impact of the reforms will depend on individual circumstances but, in particular, equal treatment means that some same-sex couples will get access to benefits they could not previously access.
In summary, the reforms are as follows. Same-sex couples and their dependent children can now access the Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, PBS, safety net as a family. This means same-sex fam-ilies may have reduced medical costs once they reach the threshold. More information can be found on the Medicare Australia website or by ringing the information line.
The reforms removed discrimination in Commonwealth superannuation schemes as of 1 January 2009. The changes make death benefits available to the same-sex partners of deceased scheme members and their children. The changes also make it easier for regu-lated superannuation funds to recognise same-sex relationships. People should contact their superannuation scheme trustees for more information.
With respect to tax offsets, from 1 July 2009 same-sex couples have access to tax concessions previously denied to them, resulting in them having to pay less tax. A same-sex couple may be eligible for the dependent spouse tax offset, where previously they would have been denied eligibility. A member of a same-sex couple may also claim the net medical expense tax offset for medical expenses incurred by their partner and any dependent children. Some older individuals will also benefit from the changes. Members of a same-sex couple will now be able to transfer their unused senior Australian tax offset to their partner. The tax office website has information on these changes.
On immigration, from 1 July 2009 same-sex couples and their children have been considered members of a family unit for visa purposes. Same-sex partners of Australian citizens, Australian permanent residents and eligible New Zealand citizens are able to apply for the same partner visa as opposite-sex partners.
From 1 July 2009 same-sex couples have been able to apply for child support on separation.
The government also provided $450,000 for a community education campaign to inform same-sex couples of the implications of the same-sex reform package. This complemented Centrelink’s extensive information campaign. The measures included a website, which provides an overview of the reforms; $100,000 for the National Welfare Rights Network, to help Centrelink clients with independent and confidential legal advice about the same-sex reforms; and $350,000 for the development of a community education and advertising program, to be developed and managed by the National Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Health Alliance in partnership with a number of community based organisations.
In concluding, as I have said, the Australian government believes that all couples who have a mutual commitment to a shared life should have the opportunity to have their relationships officially recognised. That is why the government supports the development of a nationally consistent framework that provides the opportunity for all couples who have a mutual commitment to a shared life to have their relationships officially recognised. This position is consistent with the government’s position to maintain the definition of a marriage as currently set out in the Marriage Act. As I have outlined in my comments today, the Rudd Labor government has moved quickly. It has passed legislation to remove discrimination for same-sex couples and their children from 84 Commonwealth laws. This was a very significant set of changes in taxation, social security, health, aged care, superannuation, immigration, child support and family law. This was a very extensive set of changes to Australian Commonwealth law. So, for the reasons I have outlined, and on this basis, the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill cannot be supported.",SENATE,<title>MARRIAGE EQUALITY AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-02-25,"—The coalition does not support this bill, because the coalition believes that the definition of marriage as contained in the existing provisions of the Marriage Act reflects the standards and the mores of contemporary Australia, and we are not persuaded that that definition ought to be changed.
I must say that, although I listened with great care and attention to Senator Hanson-Young’s speech, I fail to see this issue as being an issue about discrimination. What Senator Hanson-Young failed to acknowledge in her contribution is that there are certain customs and practices in any society that are unique to certain types of relationships, and to acknowledge that is not to discriminate against people. In our society the limitation of marriage to people of opposite sex is not to discriminate against people who wish to belong to same-sex relationships; it is merely to acknowledge the undoubted social reality and custom in Australia that marriage is a unique institution which has only ever been regarded as being between a man and a woman. I am astonished that there could be outrage at discrimination against gay couples by not extending to them the definition of a custom—that is, marriage—which has never, ever in any society, in the whole of human history, been regarded as other than a relationship or a status that exists between a man and a woman.
So, quite simply, the coalition does not see this as an issue about discrimination at all. The argument about discrimination was an argument that we had in this chamber in 2008. As Senator Sherry has said, in 2008 the Senate passed laws which removed discrimination against same-sex couples in 84 Commonwealth statutes. The removal of those discriminatory provisions against same-sex couples had the strong support of the coalition. In fact, as a result of the deliberations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which looked at the two bills concerned at length, we actually improved the bills and extended them further than was the government’s original intention. They were passed in the end without controversy between the government and the opposition.
So the position of the coalition, the Liberal and National parties, on the question of discrimination against same-sex couples is clear and unambiguous: we do not think there should be discrimination in any way, shape or form. We think the relationship between people in same-sex relationships is entitled to as much respect as the relationship between people in heterosexual relationships. But we also acknowledge that marriage has a unique status, that marriage has only ever been understood to mean one thing—a point that my colleague Senator Guy Barnett makes very eloquently in his additional remarks to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee’s report on this bill, a report which, I should say, recommended that the bill not be passed.
This is a very sensitive area, and it has to be approached bearing in mind not one but two very important values. One of those values is that all people are entitled to equal respect and their relationships are entitled to equal respect regardless of their sexuality. But the other principle is that marriage has only ever been understood to mean one thing, and in the coalition’s view that understanding ought to continue.

I apologise for not mentioning that earlier.",SENATE,<title>MARRIAGE EQUALITY AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-02-25,"—Family First does not support the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009. The current definition of marriage is that it is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. Family First believes that this definition is still relevant in today’s society and should be maintained. The current bill seeks to undermine this definition of marriage and undermines the family. Family First believes that families are the foundation stone of society and that flourishing family life creates the best environment for children. Family First believes we need to do more to strengthen families and the relationships in families to reduce the incidence of and negative outcomes of family and relationship breakdown.",SENATE,<title>MARRIAGE EQUALITY AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2010-02-25,"—I would like to make a short contribution to the debate on the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009. Today the Greens have put before the Senate a bill that would endorse and make legal same-sex marriages and would give them the same standing as a marriage between a man and a woman. I cannot support that, and neither can many of my constituents. That does not infer that I discriminate against same-sex couples; I certainly do not, but I do not believe you can have a marriage between a same-sex couple as you have between and a man and a woman. I come confidently into the Senate as a happily married man of 40 years standing to recognise marriage as an institution that can never be replaced or mimicked by a same-sex marriage. I had an email from one constituent that I thought covered it better than I could:
We both vehemently oppose such proposals—
meaning same-sex marriage. It continues:
We have taken seriously the commitments we made to “marriage”, which has required each of us to faithfully maintain various disciplines over a long period.
But if the definition of ‘marriage’ is broadened and blurred as proposed, it would make the commitment we have made appear to be of little significance. Consequently we would regard it as an insulting, invasive and unacceptable violation of our rights to now have our commitment massively devalued.
We will of course maintain our commitment. It has been and will continue to be of enormous value to us and now our 21 descendants, all of whom are also benefiting from making the same commitments. It is clear to us from this experience as well as from observing—

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-02-25,"—in reply—I thank the other speakers for their contributions to the debate today. It is important to point out that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009 is about offering marriage equality. It is about removing the discrimination that does not currently allow same sex couples to marry under federal law. I say to the minister through you, Mr Deputy President, that this is not about money. Marriage between a man and woman is not simply about money. Marriage between a man and a man or a woman and a woman, which this bill would allow, would not simply be about money. Marriage, of course, is about love. It is about commitment. It is about the symbolism of being able to show your relationship, with its true trust, commitment and support, to your loving family and having that respected under federal law. As a mother put it so perfectly when talking about her two sons:
My straight son has all the privileges that go with being heterosexual, including legalising his relationship and—
all—
the respect that brings.
But she said—
my gay son—
that is, her other son—
does not share these privileges.
                   …              …              …
She said that, as a parent, she was very sad about this. She went on to say:
… to me—
marriage—
is about building a life together. It provides emotional, financial and social commitment and it is a symbolic expression of love. It is … about people being happier and healthier because—
they are in—
… a stable relationship, which of course is what any parent wants for their child …
This is the discrimination we wish to remove.

This Bill overrides the Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. It is necessary to examine the costs and benefits of doing so in this instance. This Bill overrides the EPBC Act. It is necessary to examine the costs and benefits of doing so in this instance. this Bill provides the Commonwealth with the power to override all state and territory laws that could delay, hinder or regulate the imposition of a radioactive waste facility. The States and Territories should be afforded the opportunity through a Senate inquiry to offer their views on the implication of this action.
The Bill’s stated intention is to resolve long-standing disputes over the management of radioactive waste which has generated public debate and controversy for many decades. There is no doubt there will be a high degree of public interest in this bill.

At the end of the motion, add ""but, in respect of the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010, the provisions of the bill also be referred to the Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 24 June 2010"".
I understand the proposed amendment to the motion has been circulated to the whips. Its circulation was set in motion a little while ago, but I will inform senators exactly what I am doing. The proposed amendment does not seek to impede the work of the Selection of Bills Committee. It refers specifically to one of the recommendations in respect of the National Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2010, which was presented to the House of Representatives the other day.
The Selection of Bills Committee has recommended the referral of this extremely important bill, in which we know there is going to be a very high degree of public interest not just in the Northern Territory but right around the country, to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for an inquiry which basically gives people 11 working days to inform the committee—and for the committee, hopefully, to inform itself—as to the wide-ranging import of a bill of this kind. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee is exactly the right place for this referral to go with regard to the quite serious constitutional implications of the drafting of the bill, which effectively not merely trespasses but bulldozes the rights of states and territories. The Northern Territory is on the front line right at the moment, but this bill seeks to effectively clear a path through any private interests, Aboriginal interests, environmental interests and the relevant state and territory legislation that would impede the site selection and location of a national radioactive waste dump, the first that has ever operated in Australia.
We have a 20- or 30-year history of coercive attempts at dumping this form of material on remote Aboriginal communities and it is time that that approach ceased, effective immediately. We thought we had that commitment in hand from the Labor government. Comments were made by candidates, by sitting senators and by Labor members of parliament that the approach of the former government was wrong and that it was time to move to a different footing—a respectful, scientific, deliberative approach as to what to do with our radioactive waste. Instead what we have is a continuation of this process. Now we have the Selection of Bills Committee moving for a very rapid short-circuiting of due process on an issue that the community has enormous interest in.
You will note that we are not proposing the cancellation of the recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee. I think it is entirely appropriate that the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee assess the constitutional implications of this bill. If that is the recommendation of the committee, that is fine. This motion seeks to refer the bill simultaneously to the Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts for a decent period of time. We have set the report date at 24 June 2010, which is enough time for the committee to seek correspondence—and they will be getting a lot of it from around the country but particularly from the people on the ground at Muckaty Station, who know that they are targeted by this legislation. They know absolutely that this is a continuation of the process that we have seen before. If it is the government and Minister Martin Ferguson’s decision to continue down this track that has failed and left in its wake a trail of Commonwealth ministers in failed attempts to coercively establish radioactive waste dumps, then that is the government’s decision and so be it.
But, at the very least, give the Senate a chance to do its job. Let the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee look into the constitutional implications of bulldozing aside state and territory rights in the site selection, the location, the construction and the operation of the dump, but give the Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee the opportunity to conduct a thorough inquiry and take evidence from the community. We know a high degree of public interest will be expressed, because that same committee did an exceptional job in the second and third quarters of 2008 and came up with a consensus report. It was chaired by Senator McEwen. We travelled to Alice Springs and we had hearings here in Canberra. We took evidence from all stakeholders, but most importantly we took evidence from people who had come down from Tennant Creek. That was the first time that they had had their voices heard in this debate. For the government to refuse to refer this to an appropriate committee for a decent period of time is a calculated abuse of the Senate’s oversight role.

Inquiry into Patient Assisted Travel Schemes Highway to Health: Better Access for Rural, Regional and Remote Patients


By the Senate Community Affairs Committee


February 2010


Commonwealth Government Response


The Commonwealth’s role in improving access to health services for people in rural and remote communities

The Commonwealth Government recognises the health care needs of people living in rural and remote areas and is committed to developing flexible, long-term solutions to providing services for all communities and to supporting local solutions, developed in consultation with local communities.
Over seven million people, or 32% of Australians, live outside major cities.  People living in rural and remote areas of Australia face difficulties in accessing the full range of medical and specialist services.  Difficulties in access to treatment can be attributed to factors such as geographical isolation, a relative shortage of health care providers, sparse health infrastructure, and a higher proportion of disadvantaged groups such as Indigenous Australians.
The health status of Australians in rural and remote areas is generally considered to be poorer than that of other Australians. Rural Australians have a shorter life expectancy, higher death rates and are more likely to have a disability compared to city dwellers.
The Commonwealth Government is seeking to address the imbalance in access to health services for people in regional, rural and remote areas.  Targeted rural health expenditure supports programs aimed at increasing the rural health workforce, improving health infrastructure and improving access to, and sustainability of, health services.  The Government has also supported innovative health care solutions such as the development of Multipurpose Services and e-health solutions for rural and remote areas.
In 2009-10, the Government is investing more than $700 million in targeted rural health programs.  This is in addition to support provided through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), the new National Healthcare Agreement and associated National Partnership funding in the areas of hospitals, the health workforce, prevention and Indigenous health.  Rural program funding is separate from investment through Indigenous specific programs and aged care programs.

Patient Assisted Travel Schemes (PATS)

The Government understands that an important element of health care for people living in rural and remote areas can be access to suitable transport for patients who are required to travel to receive essential medical and specialist services.
A range of factors determines the extent of community need for PATS, including the type of care required, the availability of services locally, and the capacity of the patient to meet costs. Because of regional disparities in access to health services, people living in rural and remote areas are more likely to need to travel to receive services.
The Commonwealth Government makes a significant contribution to supporting access to health services so that patients’ needs to travel are minimised.  However, the states and territories currently have obligations under the new National Healthcare Agreement to provide
free public hospital services for all Australians, based on clinical need, irrespective of their geographic location.  Where hospital and other facilities are not located within a reasonable distance to rural and remote communities, patients may need to travel to access care appropriate to their clinical need.
All states and territories have a travel assistance scheme for patients requiring specialised care not available within a specified distance from where they live1.  However, while the state and territory governments have been responsible for managing their respective Patient Assisted Travel Schemes since 1 January 1987, the Commonwealth Government remains committed to working with state and territory governments to improve the system.
While there are some specific responses to the recommendations in the Senate Community Affairs Committee report, Highway to Health: Better Access for Rural, Regional and Remote Patients which follow, the Commonwealth Government is considering the issues raised by the Report through the various reform and collaborative processes outlined in this response.

Senate Inquiry into Patient Assisted Travel Schemes (PATS)

On 28 March 2007, the Senate referred the operation and effectiveness of PATS to the Senate Community Affairs Committee for inquiry.  The Senate Inquiry considered many issues
including the need for, and utilisation of, existing patient assisted travel schemes, inconsistencies in the development and application of guidelines across jurisdictions, and the extent to which good health outcomes in rural and remote areas are dependent on effective patient assisted travel schemes.
The Committee tabled its report, Highway to Health: Better Access for Rural, Regional and Remote Patients on 20 September 2007.  (See “Collaborative Work with State and Territory Governments”, p. 7.)

Post Election Areas of Reform


Election Commitments

Since coming to office in November 2007, the Commonwealth Government has been committed to working with the state and territory governments to improve health outcomes for Australians, including those living in rural and remote areas.
Specifically, the Commonwealth Government has implemented, or is implementing, the following election commitments:
Strengthening primary care in local communities through investing $275.2 million over five years to establish GP Super Clinics in 31 localities across the nation, including some rural areas. 2

Putting extra nurses in country hospitals through the $81 million nursing package.
Improving rural and remote community access to funding for essential health infrastructure, equipment and service planning through the establishment of the National Rural and Remote Health Infrastructure Program, that is providing more than $46 million over four years commencing 1 July 2008.
Expanding and enhancing specialist services through the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program (MSOAP) by providing an additional $9 million over three years.
Investing $8.5 million in additional rural scholarships for medical students, and in supporting obstetricians in rural areas.
Investing $2.5 million for the establishment of an Australian Allied Health Rural and Remote Clinical Placements Scholarships Plan.
Maternity services through the development of a national maternity services plan.
Investing $5.3 million to improve access to renal dialysis services for remote communities in the Northern Territory, as part of the Government’s $21.5 million commitment to boost health services in the Northern Territory.
Further, the Government continues to support existing programs for the rural health workforce such as the rural clinical schools, university departments of rural health, and rural health scholarships.

Audit of Health Workforce in Rural and Regional Australia and Reviews of Commonwealth Funded Rural Health Programs and Geographic Classification Systems

In December 2007, the Prime Minister announced an audit of rural and regional health workforce shortages.
The Audit of Health Workforce in Rural and Regional Australia, which was released on 30 April 2008, found that:
the supply of health professionals is not sufficient to meet current needs;
the supply of health professionals in many rural and regional areas is low to very poor; and
there has been a reliance on 17-year old population figures in developing incentives for doctors and other rural workforce policies.
In response to the audit, the Minister for Health and Ageing announced that the Government would establish an Office of Rural Health within the Department of Health and Ageing to provide a focus for the reform of Commonwealth funded rural health policies and programs.
The Office of Rural Health was established on 1 July 2008.  The Office draws together rural health service delivery, rural health policy and rural workforce distribution programs.
As a first priority, the Office of Rural Health was tasked to review all targeted Commonwealth funded rural health programs as well as the classification systems that determine eligibility for rural health program funding.  The purpose of the reviews was to ensure that incentives and rural health policies respond to current population figures and areas of need, and that programs which support rural health professionals target those communities in most need of assistance.
The reviews are now completed and outcomes include a significant new investment in rural health workforce and service delivery programs in the 2009-10 Federal Budget totalling $206.3 million (over four years).  This is in addition to existing funding for these programs of $843.4 million over four years.
Included in the Budget package is the “Rural Health Reform – Supporting Communities with Workforce Shortages measure”, which provides additional funding of $134.4 million over four years, in addition to $379.8 million already committed.
This package specifically addresses the need to attract and retain doctors to rural practice and provides increased financial and non-financial incentives to support new and existing doctors.
Further, the package recognises that doctor shortages are particularly acute in the more remote areas and incentives have been geared (scaled), with increased benefits for practice in more remote areas.
Another important outcome of the rural reviews was the decision to progressively introduce, from July 2009, the Australian Standard Geographical Classification System (ASGC) Remoteness Areas (RA) to replace the Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Areas (RRMA) classification and other geographic classification systems used by rural health programs that were subject to the reviews.
ASGC-RA, developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, uses 2006 Census data and is widely used by Commonwealth and state agencies.  Using ASGC-RA will help to ensure that rural health workforce incentives are targeted to areas of need – ‘the more remote you go, the greater the reward’ – and that rural health programs are targeted to where funding is most needed.
Finally, the review of rural health programs identified over 60 programs with significant rural health components, over 40 of which could be considered to be targeted rural health programs.
Most of these programs have been developed over time in response to different policy priorities and as such, there was significant overlap and duplication between programs.
In response, the Government has agreed to a new rural health program structure, comprising five major program streams and ten sub-programs. Through this consolidation exercise, it has been possible to reduce the number of targeted rural health programs by over 40 per cent.  As such, the burden of reporting for funded organisations will be reduced and access to services and programs will be enhanced for communities and health professionals.
In implementing the measures outlined above, the Department will be mindful of the outcomes of reviews taking place as part of the broader national health reform agenda, including the National Primary Health Care Strategy, the National Preventative Health Strategy, the Maternity Services Plan and the work of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission.

New National Healthcare Agreement and National Partnerships

On 29 November 2008, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreed to the new National Healthcare Agreement and National Partnership funding, providing $64.4 billion over five years to states and territories.  This is an increase of more than $22 billion over the previous Healthcare Agreements.
The Commonwealth contribution to National Partnership funding includes: $1.75 billion for Hospitals and Health Workforce Reform; $872 million over the six years to 2014-15 to reform Australia’s efforts in preventing lifestyle risks associated with chronic disease; $805.5 million to close the gap in health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians; $750 million to reduce pressure on emergency departments; and $108.9 million for the National E-Health Transition Authority.
This investment is in addition to the $600 million already committed to reduce elective surgery waiting times – which enabled over 41,000 additional elective surgery procedures to be conducted in 2008.
The National Healthcare Agreement now goes beyond hospitals and covers public health, prevention and the interactions of hospitals with primary, aged and community based care.  The Agreement forms part of the broader Intergovernmental Agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, aimed at improving the quality and effectiveness of government services and providing states and territories with increased flexibility in the way they deliver services to the Australian people.

National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission

The National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission’s final report was released on 27 July 2009.  In the report, the Commission made a number of recommendations on the theme of delivering better health outcomes for remote and rural communities. This included the following recommendation:

We recommend that a patient travel and accommodation assistance scheme be funded at a level that takes better account of the out-of-pocket costs of patients and their families and facilitates timely treatment and care (Recommendation 67).

In response to the release of the Commission’s final report, the Australian Government has undertaken direct consultations with the Australian public, the States and Territories, and the health sector about their views on health reform, including the ideas contained within the Commission’s report. The Government is considering its response to the report.
A full copy of the report including details of the Government’s consultations can be found on the website www.yourhealth.gov.au.

The National Primary Health Care Strategy

On 31 August 2009, the Prime Minister, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, and the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, launched the Draft National Primary Health Care Strategy, Building a 21st Century Primary Health Care System.
The Draft Strategy identifies five key building blocks which are considered essential system-wide underpinnings for a responsive and integrated primary health care system for the 21st century.  These are:
regional integration;
information and technology, including e-Health;
skilled workforce;
infrastructure; and
financing and system performance.
Drawing from these building blocks are four priority directions for change:
Key Priority Area 1:  Improving Access and Reducing Inequity;
Key Priority Area 2:  Better Management of Chronic Condition;
Key Priority Area 3:  Increasing the Focus on Prevention; and
Key Priority Area 4:  Improving Quality, Safety, Performance and Accountability.
The Draft Strategy is accompanied by a Report, Primary Health Care Reform in Australia, which provides detailed information about the issues that emerged during the stakeholder consultation process and sets out the broader context in which primary health care in Australia operates and has developed.
The Draft Strategy focuses on what the Government can do to improve the frontline health care that Australians depend on, and provides a draft road map to guide future policy and practice in primary health care in Australia.

National Preventative Health Taskforce

The Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, and the Chair of the National Preventative Health Taskforce, Professor Rob Moodie, launched the National Preventative Health Strategy on 1 September 2009.
The Strategy seeks to curb lifestyle related risk factors driving the growth in preventable chronic disease and specifically targets obesity, tobacco and the excessive consumption of alcohol.
The risk factors for chronic disease are particularly prevalent in rural and remote Australia, due in part to the relatively higher proportion of Indigenous people living in these communities.  The Strategy includes improving the health of rural and remote Australians and closing the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians as key targets.
The Government will consider on merit the recommendations made in the Strategy in conjunction with the findings of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission’s report and the draft National Primary Health Care Strategy.
The Government has consulted widely on this broader health reform agenda and will put a position to states and territories later in the year.

Maternity Services Review

As part of the 2009-10 Federal Budget, the Com-monwealth Government has announced a $120.5 million maternity reform package.
Amongst the measures, the package includes Medicare Benefits Schedule subsidised services and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidised medicines provided or prescribed by appropriately qualified and experienced midwives working in a collaborative model of care.  It will also deliver more services for rural and remote communities through an expansion of the successful Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program and extra scholarships for GPs and midwives, particularly in rural and remote Australia.
The package is the first step towards meeting the Government’s commitment to develop a National Maternity Services Plan to ensure the coordination of maternity services across Australia.
The new Medicare arrangements will be subject to agreement with states and territories on the Plan – states and territories will be asked to make complementary commitments and investments, particularly around the provision of birthing centres and rural maternity units.

Health and Hospitals Fund

The Government established the Health and Hospitals Fund (HHF) as part of its nation-building agenda to invest in Australia’s long-term future and to strengthen the Australian economy.  The Government has committed $5 billion from the 2007-08 Budget surplus to the Fund to provide a financing source for health infrastructure priorities.
In the 2009-10 Federal Budget, the Government announced a $3.2 billion health infrastructure package which includes significant investments for regional Australia.  The package includes $1.3 billion in funding to support better cancer care, $1.5 billion towards hospitals infrastructure and other projects of national significance and $430 million for the construction of research facilities to enable the faster translation of research outcomes into patient care.
Projects with direct benefits for people living in rural, remote and regional Australia include:
$560 million for the construction of regional cancer centres.  A network of around 10 regional cancer centres, with formal links to integrated cancer centres in Sydney and Melbourne, will be established.  This funding will help improve access to cancer services and health outcomes for cancer patients across Australia
$120 million for state‑of‑the‑art digital mammography equipment for BreastScreen Australia, replacing existing analogue machines around Australia
$8.6 million for the Kimberley Renal Service (Western Australia)
$7.9 million for the replacement of the paediatrics unit in Broome (Western Australia)
$13.6 million towards the hospital emergency department in Alice Springs (Northern Territory)
$18.6 million for short-term patient accommodation at Royal Darwin Hospital (Northern Territory)
$27 million towards the Narrabri District Health Service Centre (New South Wales)
$250 million for the expansion of Townsville Hospital (Queensland)
$76 million for the expansion of Rockhampton Hospital (Queensland)
$9.2 million for 23 smaller health care infrastructure projects in rural Australia.

Collaborative Work with State and Territory Governments

The Commonwealth Government will continue to work with state and territory governments to support access to health services by people living in rural and remote areas of Australia.
At the Australian Health Ministers’ Conference meeting of 29 February 2008, Health Ministers expressed their commitment to addressing the needs of people who are required to travel to attend medical treatment when they agreed to progress the recommendations of the Senate Community Affairs Committee report.
In response to this report, a taskforce was established by the Health Policy Priorities Principal Committee at the request of the Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council (AHMAC) to examine the recommendations of the report and to report to AHMAC.
The states, territories and the Commonwealth are continuing to work together to examine the recommendations in the Senate Committee’s report.

National Rural and Remote Health Strategic Framework

In addition to the above collaborative efforts the Commonwealth is working with states and territories to develop a National Rural and Remote Health Strategic Framework as a successor document to the now outdated Healthy Horizons: A Framework for improving the Health of Rural, Regional and Remote Australians.   The Rural Health Standing Committee (RHSC), a sub-Committee of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council is tasked with developing this new framework.
To ensure that the new national strategic framework targets activity towards the most pressing priorities for rural and remote health, the RHSC has agreed to focus on six key themes, including access and service models.  Patient assisted travel schemes will be a particular focus.
This work will need to align with the outcomes of current national health reform activity, in particular the work of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, the National Primary Health Care Strategy, the National Preventative Health Strategy, the Maternity Services Review, and COAG health reforms.

Commonwealth Government Response


Recommendation 1

7.105 That the next Australian Health Care Agreement recognise the fundamental importance of patient assisted travel schemes and include:
a clear commitment to improvement of services;
a clear allocation of funding for the schemes;
a clear articulation of the services and supports that people using transport schemes can access; and
a commitment to regular monitoring of access and service provision.
Commonwealth Government Response
The Commonwealth Government notes this recommendation.
As part of the new National Healthcare Agreement, states and territories have committed to providing and funding patient assistance travel schemes and ensuring public patients are aware of how to access the schemes.
The states, territories and the Commonwealth are continuing to work together to consider the recommendations of the Senate Committee report, as outlined in the response to Recommendation 13, below.

Recommendations 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 13

These recommendations relate to the establishment of an AHMAC taskforce to progress issues relating to PATS.

Recommendation 2

7.110 That as a matter of urgency, the Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council establish a taskforce comprised of government, consumer and practitioner representatives to develop a set of national standards for patient assisted travel schemes that ensure equity of access to medical services for people living in rural, regional and remote Australia.
7.111 That, in establishing national standards, the taskforce:
identify relevant legislative, geographic, demographic and health service variables of the States and Territories impacting on access;
identify barriers to access including costs of travel and accommodation, restrictions on escort eligibility and access to transport;
assess the impact of co-payments;
identify mechanisms to improve access for patients travelling between jurisdictions;
identify, as a matter of priority, core, minimum standards that are relevant to all jurisdictions particularly in relation to eligibility criteria and subsidy levels; and
give consideration to the development of optimal, outcomes-based standards that support consistent, quality outcomes for consumers, whilst enabling different State/Territory approaches that are responsive to local need.
7.112 Development of the national standards should include (but not be limited by) consideration of the following areas:
patient escorts including approval for:
psycho-social support;
approval for more than one caregiver to accompany a child; and
approval for a caregiver to accompany a pregnant woman.
eligibility:
identify a means other than the distance threshold to determine eligibility that takes into account a broader range of factors such as public transport access and road conditions; and
referral on the basis of the nearest appropriate specialists where an appointment can be secured within a clinically acceptable timeframe.
appeals processes.

Recommendation 3

7.114 That the taskforce report to the Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council expeditiously so that national standards can be formulated and instituted within twelve months of tabling of the Committee’s report.

Recommendation 4

7.116 That the taskforce develop a performance monitoring framework, which enables ongoing assessment of State/Territory travel schemes against the national standards and relevant goals set out in the (revised) Healthy Horizons Framework, and facilitates continuous quality improvement.

Recommendation 6

7.119 That the taskforce review existing administrative arrangements to make them less complex, including development of a simplified generic application form; consideration of an on-line application process; and revision of the authorisation processes.

Recommendation 8

7.124 That the taskforce identify appropriate mechanisms against which to review subsidy levels on a regular basis to keep pace with changes in living costs.

Recommendation 13

7.131 That the taskforce develop a marketing and communication strategy that targets consumers and health practitioners. Consideration should be given to the role of the Divisions of General Practice in educating GPs about the scheme.
Commonwealth Government Response
The Commonwealth Government supports the establishment of a taskforce to examine key aspects of patient assisted travel schemes and is participating in this taskforce.
The Commonwealth Government notes that at the AHMAC meeting of 6 March 2008, members agreed to direct the Health Policy Priority Principal Committee (HPPPC) to establish a taskforce to examine the recommendations of the report Highway to Health: Better Access for Rural, Regional and Remote Patients and that the HPPPC report back to AHMAC.
Accordingly, the states, territories and the Commonwealth have met as a taskforce to consider the Senate Committee’s recommendations.  The Commonwealth is continuing to participate with the states and territories to progress this work.

Recommendations 5 and 7

These recommendations refer to specific matters relating to AHMAC, including the development of mechanisms for monitoring performance, identifying areas for improvement and determining subsidies for transport and accommodation costs for patients.

Recommendation 5

7.117 That the Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council establish a mechanism to monitor performance, identify areas for improvement and review the standards as required.

Recommendation 7

7.123 That the Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council determine transport and accommodation subsidy rates that better reflect a reasonable proportion of actual travel costs and encourage people to access treatment early.
Commonwealth Government Response
The Commonwealth Government supports recommendations 5 and 7 in-principle and notes the benefits of the development and monitoring of national standards and the development of transport and accommodation subsidy rates that better reflect a reasonable proportion of actual travel costs.
While the state and territory governments have had responsibility for managing their respective Patient Assisted Travel Schemes since 1 January 1987, the Commonwealth Government supports these recommendations and is committed to working with state and territory governments to improve the system so that patients can travel to attend essential medical and specialist services.

Recommendation 10

7.126     That the Commonwealth Government initiate negotiations with the private health insurance sector to encourage insurers to offer products that include transport and accommodation assistance.
Commonwealth Government Response
The Commonwealth Government agrees with the aim of the recommendation.  However the Commonwealth Government also notes that ‘general treatment’ is defined in the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 as treatment (including the provision of goods and services) that is intended to manage or prevent a disease, injury or condition.
Individual health insurers can determine whether or not their general treatment policies provide benefits for travel and accommodation costs and any limits on benefits they will pay, provided they comply with the private health insurance legislation.  Health insurers make these decisions on a commercial basis.  The issue of whether any private health insurance funds currently provide any benefits for patient assisted travel, or would be interested to do so without increasing premiums will be raised with their national peak body by the Department of Health and Ageing.

Recommendations 9, 11, 12, 14 and 15

These recommendations identify issues to be considered by state and territory governments.

Recommendation 9

7.125 That all States and Territories adopt a pre-payment system, whether by vouchers,
tickets or advance bookings, for patients experiencing financial difficulty with the initial outlay.

Recommendation 11

7.127  That State and Territory Governments develop memoranda of understanding that underpin clear, workable reciprocal arrangements for cross-border travel.

Recommendation 12

7.129 That State and Territory Governments expand travel schemes to cover items on the Medical Benefits Schedule – Enhanced Primary Care and live organ donor transplants (with assistance to the donor and recipient) and access to clinical trials.

Recommendation 14

7.133 That appropriate, on-site (or nearby) accommodation facilities be incorporated into the planning and design of new hospitals/treatment centres.

Recommendation 15

7.134 That State and Territory Governments work proactively with charities and not-for-profit organisations to provide affordable patient accommodation and services. This should include:
developing administrative arrangements that facilitate organisations’ access to PATS funding;
establishing memoranda of understanding with charitable organisations, which set out commitments to quality service delivery; and
developing partnerships with the non-government sector to provide suitable patient accommodation.
Commonwealth Government Response
These recommendations mainly relate to matters that are currently the responsibility of state and territory governments.
The Commonwealth Government acknowledges that state and territory governments are better placed to develop and administer more flexible and effective measures for those in need of patient assisted transport, having regard to their own distribution of specialist services and the specific needs of their rural populations.
In relation to Recommendation 14, as part of the 2009-10 Federal Budget the Commonwealth Government committed $560 million from its Health and Hospitals Fund for the construction of a network of around 10 best practice regional cancer centres to help close the gap in cancer outcomes for people in rural and regional Australia.

Recommendation 16

7.138 That State and Territory Governments, in consultation with Indigenous representatives and Indigenous Health Services, identify and adopt best practice standards and develop programs to improve Indigenous patients’ access to medical services by:
ensuring continuity of care for Indigenous patients by establishing liaison services and improving coordination in, and between, remote communities and treatment centres;
accommodating the cultural and language needs of Indigenous patients from remote communities, particularly in respect to the provision of escorts and translators; and
expanding access to appropriate accommodation services.
7.139 In establishing these best practice standards and programs government and Indigenous representatives should:
identify and build on existing examples of good practice by health services in Indigenous communities and State and Territory programs; and
establish clear governance and administrative arrangements for the delivery of programs, including consideration of the most appropriate bodies to provide day-to-day administration of services (for example, a government body or community-managed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health services).
Commonwealth Government Response
The Commonwealth Government supports this recommendation to improve Indigenous patients’ access to medical services.
In 2004-05, 15% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians reported that at some time in the last 12 months they did not go to a doctor when needed and 7% reported that they did not go to hospital when needed.  Reasons for not accessing services included cost, transport/distance, waiting times etc.  Of those who did not go to a doctor when needed, 11% in non-remote areas and 28% in remote areas reported transport/distance as one of the reasons they did not go.  Of those who did not go to hospital when needed, 13% in non-remote areas and 34% in remote areas reported transport/distance as one of the reasons they did not go (Australian Health Ministers’ Advisory Council, 2008, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Performance Framework Report, Canberra).
In relation to the administrative and partnership arrangements proposed under these recommendations, the Commonwealth Government notes that it funds a national network of Indigenous specific primary health care services that, in partnership with State/Territory governments, are well placed to support improved access through better accommodation and transport assistance.
In addition, on 29 November 2008, COAG agreed to an historic $1.6 billion (over four years) National Partnership Agreement on Closing the Gap in Indigenous Health Outcomes, with the Commonwealth contributing $805.5 million, and states and territories collectively contributing up to $771.5 million.  This National Partnership aims to work towards closing the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a generation, including strategies to improve access to medical services and coordination and continuity of care.
——————

1On 1 January 1987, the states and territories agreed to accept responsibility for patient assisted travel schemes in return for an increase in funding from the Commonwealth through the Financial Assistance Grants.  This decision was made in recognition of the fact that the state and territory governments were better placed to develop and administer more flexible and effective measures for those in need, having regard to their distribution of specialist services and the specific needs of their rural populations.

2Since the election in November 2007, the Commonwealth Government has committed to establishing an additional five GP Super Clinics, taking the total to 36.

Government response to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts Report:


Management of Australia’s Waste Streams (including consideration of the Drink Container Recycling Bill 2008)

This is the Government response to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts Inquiry into the Management of Australia’s Waste Streams (including consideration of the Drink Container Recycling Bill 2008), as tabled on 3 September 2008.
The Government acknowledges the importance of the Committee’s inquiry into the management of Australia’s waste streams, and the value of its findings in contributing to the growth and stability of the sector into the future. The report highlights the environmental, economic and social impacts of waste and acknowledges that waste management is a complex and multilayered policy area.

Context

On 20 March 2008, the Senate passed a motion requiring the Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee to inquire into and report on the ‘management of Australia’s waste streams’. The Senate Committee was required to have particular reference to:
(a) trends in waste production in Australia across household, consumer, commercial and industrial waste streams,
(b) effectiveness of existing strategies to reduce, recover or reuse waste from different waste streams,
(c) potential new strategies to reduce, recover or reuse waste from different waste streams,
(d) the economic, environmental and social benefits and costs of such strategies,
(e) policy priorities to maximise the efficiency and efficacy of efforts to reduce, recover or reuse waste from different waste streams, and
(f) consideration of the Drink Container Recycling Bill 2008.
The Senate Committee tabled its final report on 3 September 2008—Management of Australia’s Waste Streams (including consideration of the Drink Container Recycling Bill 2008).  The Family First Party provided a dissenting report.

Introduction

The day-to-day management of waste is primarily the responsibility of the state, territory and local governments. The role of the Australian Government in waste management has evolved in recent years and it is now increasingly engaged in national waste policy development. A particular focus is on developing harmonised national approaches for significant waste issues which provide cost effective, fit-for-purpose solutions. The Australian Government also has the leading role in waste policy related to Australia’s international obligations and is signatory to a number of international agreements on waste including the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants and the Rotterdam Convention on Pesticides and Industrial Chemicals.
The primary fora for harmonised action on waste issues of national significance are the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC) and the National Environment Protection Council. Through these fora, Australian environment Ministers seek to work within and across governments, and with industry and communities, to achieve effective, efficient and nationally consistent policies on waste to enhance social, human health, economic and environmental outcomes.
Of particular relevance to several of the Senate Inquiry recommendations is the agreement on 5 November 2009 by the EPHC to release a new national policy on waste and resource management. The National Waste Policy: Less Waste, More Resources (the National Waste Policy) has a strong focus on taking responsibility, through product stewardship, to reduce the environmental, health and safety footprint of manufactured goods during and at end of life. The National Waste Policy can be viewed on the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts website: www.environment.gov.au/wastepolicy.
A key priority will be for the Australian Government to establish national product stewardship framework legislation, in consultation with states, territories, industry and the community. Public consultation on the design of the legislation will occur during 2010.
The policy charts the vision for resource recovery and waste management to 2020. It was developed with regard to relevant Council of Australian Governments’ agreements and with the support of industry and key non government organizations. The policy provides for collaboration to deliver effective approaches to domestic waste issues and aligns our waste management with Australia’s international obligations.
The policy sets out a comprehensive action agenda across six areas: taking responsibility; improving the market; pursuing sustainability; reducing hazard and risk; tailoring solutions and providing the evidence. It will complement action on climate change (including the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme–CPRS) and sustainability and includes landmark framework legislation for product stewardship that will support industry-run collection and recycling schemes.
The EPHC will also release a comprehensive National Waste Report to document current state and trends in waste and waste management in Australia.
Recommendation
Position
AG Comment
Recommendation 1
The committee recommends that state and territory governments implement waste reduction targets that are set in a sustainability context and based on rigorous analysis and sound science.
Noted
Waste reduction targets are primarily the responsibility of individual state and territory governments and the EPHC’s attention has been drawn to the recommendations of the Senate Committee’s report.
A key objective of the National Waste Policy is to avoid the generation of waste, reduce the amount of waste (including hazardous waste) for disposal, manage waste as a resource and ensure that waste treatment, disposal, recovery and re-use is undertaken in a safe, scientific and environmentally sound manner.
The National Waste Policy establishes key directions and strategies relating to both sustainability and evidence-based decision making. Pursuing sustainability is focussed on less waste and improved use of waste to achieve broader environmental, social and economic benefits, whilst providing the evidence acknowledges the need for access by decision makers to meaningful, accurate and current national waste and resource recovery data and information, in order to measure progress and educate and inform the behaviour and the choices of the community.
Recommendation 2
The committee recommends that landfill levies should be applied across all jurisdictions, adjusted for the impact on smaller communities, and should be calculated to include the full range of social and environmental externalities.
Noted
The application of landfill levies is primarily the responsibility of individual state and territory governments and the EPHC’s attention has been drawn to the recommendations of the Senate Committee’s report.
Recommendation 3
The committee recommends that state and territory governments pursue the hypothecation of landfill [levies] and their investment into resource recovery initiatives and infrastructure to the fullest extent possible.
Noted
This matter is primarily the responsibility of individual state and territory governments and the EPHC’s attention has been drawn to the recommendations of the Senate Committee’s report
Recommendation 4
The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government calculates options to send a direct and undiluted price signal to the market and publishes the greenhouse benefits of recycling or landfill gas reduction, capture and use as part of its deliberations on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
Noted
The proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) provides a direct price signal in the area of greenhouse gas emissions from landfill. The domestic offset program under the CPRS will also provide abatement incentives to the waste sector, in some situations, for emissions from closed landfill facilities and legacy waste. The Renewable Energy Target will continue to provide incentives to capture landfill waste methane to generate renewable electricity (including legacy emissions and emissions at sites that are already closed).
Recommendation 5
The committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council undertake a cost‑benefit analysis of glass in the kerbside recycling system including economic, social and environmental externalities. Such an analysis should consider alternatives to kerbside recycling for glass, including container deposit schemes, and their potential economic, social and environmental impacts.
Agreed
The EPHC has been considering options for national measures to improve packaging recycling and reduce litter, with a particular emphasis on beverage containers. In May 2009, the EPHC considered the findings of a Beverage Container Investigation Report which provided an assessment of the relative costs of potential national measures, including container deposit legislation. This report has been published and can be found at www.ephc.gov.au.
On 5 November 2009, the EPHC was advised of the preliminary findings from this survey which found a high level of community interest in recycling packaging and reduced litter. Ministers will consider the final report out of session with a view to making evidence based decision on appropriate action to address the community’s desire to recycle more packaging and reduce litter.
In November 2009, the EPHC supported in-principle the strengthened Australian Packaging Covenant to replace the National Packaging Covenant which is due to expire on 30 June 2010. The updated Covenant has a greater focus on package design, workplace recycling, public recycling and litter reduction projects.
Recommendation 6
The committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council consider initiatives, including container deposit schemes, to improve away-from-home recycling. Such initiatives should include elements such as an incentive to recycle, convenience, adequate infrastructure and a supporting education and awareness program.
Agreed
Better management of packaging to improve the use of resources, reduce the environmental impact of packaging design, enhance away from home recycling and reduce litter is one of the strategies under the National Waste Policy. It will be progressed by all governments through EPHC activities, including the National Packaging Covenant.
In November 2009, the EPHC supported in-principle the strengthened Australian Packaging Covenant to replace the National Packaging Covenant which is due to expire on 30 June 2010. The updated Covenant will have a greater focus on package design, workplace recycling, public recycling and litter reduction projects.
In 2008 the National Packaging Covenant Council approved funding for away from home recycling projects which are expected to divert a further 181,000 tonnes per year from landfill by 2010. The Covenant is also influencing away-from-home recovery rates through the actions of individual signatories, some of which are establishing or expanding collection services in public places and workplaces.
Recommendation 7
The committee recommends that waste management policy must be grounded in rigorous cost-benefit analysis which encompass economic, environmental and social externalities.

Agreed
Consistent with Council of Australian Government requirements, the Australian Government and the EPHC conducts rigorous assessments (including cost-benefit analyses) which encompass economic, environmental and social externalities.
Regulation Impact Statements, assessed as adequate by the Office of Best Practice Regulation, have recently been completed for the National Waste Policy and the televisions and computers product stewardship scheme.
Recommendation
Position
AG Comment
Recommendation 8
The committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council develop a national resource efficiency strategy. The strategy should seek consistent policies between the states and adopt a principles-based approach; including sustainability, the waste hierarchy, extended producer responsibility and user pays cost reflective pricing as guiding principles.
Agreed in principle
Managing waste as a resource is one of the aims of the National Waste Policy.
The National Waste Policy sets a comprehensive agenda for national co-ordinated action on waste across six key areas; taking responsibility; improving the market; pursuing sustainability; reducing hazard and risk; tailoring solutions and providing the evidence. The policy identifies 16 strategies that would benefit from a national or coordinated approach.
The policy is principles-based and clearly articulates the scope, aims and outcomes. It provides national leadership on waste and resource recovery where it is needed and facilitates collaboration between the states on national issues.  It ensures that waste management remains aligned with Australia’s international obligations, including the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes, and complements the Australian Government’s approach to climate change and sustainability. 
Recommendation 9
The committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council re-establish the national waste data system. Once the Waste Management Association of Australia’s review of the Australian Waste Database is complete, governments should consider whether to fund the CSIRO and/or the Australian Bureau of Statistics to re-establish the national waste data system.
Agreed in Principle
Through the National Waste Policy, the Australian Government, in collaboration with state and territory governments, will develop and publish a three-yearly current and future trends waste and resource recovery report. This will be underpinned by a system that provides access to integrated national core data on waste and resource recovery that is accurate, meaningful and up-to-date and available online.
Recommendation 10
The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, and state and territory governments audit the adequacy of existing resource recovery infrastructure and commit funding or implement policy changes which will address any deficiencies.
Agreed in Principle
The issue of adequacy of resource recovery infrastructure is generally a matter that is best handled on a specific material or product basis and/or by individual jurisdictions.
The National Waste Policy will facilitate resource recovery by addressing market impediments and removing red tape. For example national specifications for use of recycled construction and demolition waste in pavements will be developed and made publicly available.
The Australian Government, through the National Waste Policy, will also undertake an audit of existing waste infrastructure and local capability in selected remote Indigenous communities as part of a larger essential services audit under the COAG National Indigenous Housing Partnership Agreement.
Recommendation 11
The committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council establish national minimum environmental standards in relation to emissions from landfill operations including the reduction, capture and use of landfill gas emissions. Such standards should be applied to all landfill sites above an agreed threshold.

Agreed in Principle
The National Waste Policy complements Australian Government policy on climate change and sustainability by addressing greenhouse gas emissions from wastes that are not covered by the proposed CPRS and developing a strategy through the EPHC that is consistent with the states role in managing the health and safety risks of landfill gas emissions; and supports the operation of the CPRS in addressing greenhouse gas emissions.
The Australian Government will also, in collaboration with state and territory governments, develop a strategy for measures to address emissions from disposal of waste to landfills and other waste activities which support the operation of a future CPRS.
Recommendation
Position
AG Comment
Recommendation 12
The committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council recommend measures to reduce the quantities of organic material going into landfill. The options considered should include utilisation of alternative waste technologies and a cap and trade scheme.
Noted
The management of landfills, and the imposition of economic instruments to manage the material deposited in landfills, is generally a matter for individual state and territory governments. The proposed CPRS is also intended to reduce the generation of greenhouse gases, including methane, and can be expected to influence the quantity of organic material that is landfilled.
Under the National Waste Policy state and territory governments will build on existing commitments and continue to phase down the amount of biodegradable material sent to landfill.
Recommendation 13
The committee recommends that in light of the emergence of national priorities including climate change and water conservation, the Environment Protection and Heritage Council (EPHC) review the adequacy and transparency of the EPHC waste framework.
Agreed
On 7 November 2008, the EPHC agreed to review the 2002 EPHC National Waste Framework. The framework was considered during development of the National Waste Policy.

Recommendation 14
The committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council expedite the establishment of Extended Producer Responsibility arrangements for identified products of national significance.
Agreed in Principle
A key priority for the National Waste Policy is the development of National Product Stewardship Framework legislation. This framework will support efficient industry-run schemes for collecting and recycling end of life products, and ensure that proposed arrangements are accountable and effective. The legislation will include industry-led, co-regulatory and regulatory components and set out specific criteria that must be met for products and materials to be covered under the framework. In addition to meeting these criteria, a net community benefit would also need to be established for the government to regulate industry participation in a stewardship scheme for that product or material.
On 5 November 2009, the EPHC announced that televisions and computers and tyres would be the first products to be covered by the legislative framework.
Recommendation 15
The committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council revitalise the product stewardship National Environment Protection Measure to address waste issues of national significance in a timely and coordinated manner.
Noted
See the response to Recommendation 14.

Recommendation 16
The committee recommends the Environment Protection and Heritage Council work towards a national container deposit system. As part of its review the committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council consider the South Australian model and the Drink Container Recycling Bill 2008.
Noted
See the response to Recommendation 5.
Recommendation 17
The committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council finalise and/or develop Extended Producer Responsibility initiatives for the various forms of e-waste as a matter of priority.
Agreed
See the response to Recommendation 14.

Recommendation 18
The committee recommends that the Environment Protection and Heritage Council consider an Extended Producer Responsibility initiative for compact fluorescent lamps as a matter of priority.
Agreed in Principle
In May 2009 the Australian Government initiated Fluoro-cycle, a voluntary scheme to increase recycling of mercury containing lamps from the commercial and public lighting sector. More than 90 percent of all lighting waste is sourced from commercial and public lighting. Fluoro-cycle will build on existing infrastructure as well as some individual but fragmented activities by companies to recycle their waste lamps. The scheme may be expanded to include domestic waste lamps.
The National Waste Policy will also provide support through voluntary accreditation of community and industry run recycling schemes. The lighting industry and key stakeholders are working with government to increase the recycling of mercury containing lights.

Australian Government response to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration report into Item 16525 in Part 3 of Schedule 1 to the Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations 2007.


Introduction

On 18 June 2008, a motion was moved in the Senate by Senator Guy Barnett to disallow item 16525 in Part 3 of Schedule 1 to the Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations 2007.  On 16 September 2008 the Senate referred the subject of the motion for disallowance of item 16525 to the Finance and Public Administration Committee (the Committee) for inquiry.  The Committee was asked to report on
(a) the terms of item 16525 of part 3 of Schedule 1 to the Health Insurance (General Medical Services Table) Regulations 2007;
(b) the number of services receiving payments under this item and the cost of these payments;
(c) the basis upon which payments of benefits are made under this item; and
(d) the effects of disallowing this item.
The Committee tabled its report in the Senate on 13 November 2008.  The Committee did not make any recommendation in relation to the disallowance of item 16525.  However, it noted that concerns were expressed over the lack of data on terminations in Australia and made two recommendations aimed at improving the collection of perinatal and neonatal data.

Recommendation 1

2.52  The committee recommends that Australian Health Ministers’ Conference ensure the prompt application of the Perinatal Society of Australia and New Zealand Perinatal Mortality Classifications across all States and Territories.

Recommendation 2

2.53 The committee recommends that Australian Health Ministers’ Conference secure an agreement with all jurisdictions to work towards providing complete and uniform data to the Perinatal National Minimum Data Set.

The Maternity Services Review

The Maternity Services Review was the first step in developing a comprehensive plan for maternity services into the future, and it considered issues relevant to the full range of maternity services which include pregnancy care, birthing, postnatal care and peer and social support for women in the perinatal period. Improving Maternity Services in Australia: The Report of the Maternity Services Review (the Report), released in February 2009, provided recommendations for maternity reform. The first of these recommendations is that the Australian Government, in consultation with states and territories and key stakeholders, agree and implement arrangements for consistent, comprehensive national data collection, monitoring and review, for maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity.

Government Response

In response to the Report, the 2009-10 Improving Maternity Services Budget Package provides $120.5 million over four years for a maternity reform package which includes funding for improved maternity data collections in Australia. The Australian Government has also sought commitment from the states and territories to develop a National Maternity Services Plan (the Plan).  The Plan will provide further support to maternity reform through a strategic national and state framework to guide policy and program development to improve, coordinate and ensure greater access to maternity services in Australia, across a three to five year timeframe.

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government promotes and supports efforts to achieve ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) by the United States Senate, including by making clear that United States ratification of the CTBT would be positively received by Australia and other countries, and that Australia seeks a world without nuclear weapons.

Response

Supported.  The Government fully agrees with the Committee that the CTBT is a critical element of global disarmament and non-proliferation efforts.  Entry into force of the CTBT is a disarmament and non-proliferation priority for the Government. The Government will promote and support efforts to achieve ratification by all countries that must do so for the treaty to enter into force, including the United States.
In his address on 24 September 2009 to the sixth Article XIV Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the CTBT, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Smith, said that Australia welcomed and encouraged the support of President Obama for the CTBT, and that US ratification would be a profound step towards entry into force of the treaty.  Australia will continue to make clear to both the US Administration and, as appropriate, the Congress that Australia, a close ally, is strongly in favour of US ratification of the CTBT.

Recommendation 2

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government pursue diplomatic efforts to encourage ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) by the remaining Annex II states whose ratification is required to achieve entry into force of the Treaty, and seek undertakings from these countries that they will not be the impediment to the CTBT entering into force.

Response

Supported.  The Government will continue to take every appropriate opportunity to urge all states yet to ratify the CTBT to do so, especially the remaining Annex 2 states.
In his 24 September 2009 address to the Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the CTBT, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Smith, reiterated Australia’s strong support for the treaty and the urgent need for its swift entry into force.  The Government will continue to use such multilateral opportunities, as well as bilateral discussions, to promote ratifications.
In 2009 Australia chaired the CTBT Organization’s Preparatory Commission (CTBTO PrepCom).  The CTBTO is responsible for ensuring the treaty’s verification mechanisms are ready to meet the treaty’s requirements on entry into force. Australia works closely with the CTBTO PrepCom, including to promote ratification in our region, most recently through workshops in Jakarta in November 2008 and in Palau in May 2009.
Australia is a lead sponsor of a resolution in the UN General Assembly First Committee which calls for early entry into force of the CTBT.  This year (2009), for the first time, all five Permanent Members of the UN Security Council (United States, China, France United Kingdom and Russia) co-sponsored the resolution. 

Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty


Recommendation 3

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government continue to pursue vigorous diplomatic efforts to promote negotiation of a verifiable Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT), as well as measures for safeguarding the vast existing stockpiles of weapons-usable fissile materials.

Response

Supported.  Commencement of negotiations on a verifiable FMCT is a disarmament and non-proliferation priority for the Australian Government.  As one of the six 2009 presidents of the Conference on Disarmament (CD), Australia worked tirelessly for the adoption of a program of work that included negotiation of a verifiable FMCT. Australia has also contributed much to the development of technical concepts for a future treaty.  The Government was therefore disappointed that the CD could not agree on implementation of the work program in 2009.
In 2010, Australia will work for the adoption by the CD of a program of work that includes negotiation of an FMCT and for the commencement of negotiations.
Australia strongly supports the development of measures, whether as part of an FMCT or separately, to address the issue of excess stocks of fissile material in nuclear weapons programs, including measures to bring such stocks under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.
Australia actively promotes the development of the highest international standards for the protection of nuclear material, playing a lead role in the development and implementation of enhancements to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, and working to finalise an update to IAEA guidelines on physical protection arrangements.
Australia welcomes President Obama’s initiative to host a global Nuclear Security Summit in 2010.  One of the issues the Summit will address will be how to ensure that stocks of fissile material are effectively secured.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government ensure that adequate resourcing is made available to diplomatic staff in Geneva and, where appropriate, in other missions to enable Australia to take an active and involved role in negotiations for a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT).

Response

Supported.  The Government will ensure that adequate resources are available for Australia to take an active and constructive role in any FMCT negotiations.   

The NPT and IAEA Safeguards


Recommendation 5

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government encourage all other uranium exporting countries to require that the countries to whom they export uranium have an Additional Protocol in place.

Response

Supported.  The Government welcomes the Committee’s focus on the Additional Protocol (AP).  The AP is an integral part of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system and, together with the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, constitutes the contemporary standard for IAEA safeguards.  The Australian Government has made adherence to an AP a condition of supply for Australian uranium and nuclear material derived from it.  The Australian Government takes every appropriate opportunity to urge other nuclear suppliers to impose similar requirements, including in forums such as the IAEA and the Nuclear Suppliers Group.
Australia also contributes to the universalisation of the AP by conducting outreach through seminars and courses.

Recommendation 6

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government abandon its zero real growth policy on the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) budget and work with other states to strengthen the IAEA’s funding base.

Response

Supported.  Australia will continue to work closely with the members of the IAEA Board of Governors to ensure the Agency is adequately resourced.  At the August 2009 Board of Governors meeting, Australia joined consensus to support a 2.7% real increase in the IAEA’s budget for 2010-2011.
In 2009 Australia made an assessed contribution to the IAEA’s regular budget of AUD 9.7 million.  In addition, Australia made voluntary contributions to the Technical Cooperation Fund (AUD 2.2 million) and the Nuclear Security Fund (AUD 450,000).

Fuel cycle multilateralisation


Recommendation 7

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government investigate further the potential merits and risks of fuel cycle multilateralisation proposals, including through:
discussion of such proposals at the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference;
advocating within the Nuclear Suppliers Group for the development of restrictive criteria for the supply of sensitive nuclear technologies; and
engaging in dialogue with those countries in South-East Asia proposing to develop a nuclear energy industry.

Response

Supported.  Recognising the potential for proposals relating to multilateral fuel assurance mechanisms and multilateralisation of the fuel cycle to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation, the Government has and will continue to explore the potential merits and risks of such proposals in all relevant forums.
Several fuel assurance proposals are under consideration by the IAEA’s Board of Governors, of which Australia is a member.  Australia was one of 23 Board members to support a resolution ‘Request by the Russian Federation regarding its Initiative to Establish a Reserve of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) for the Supply of LEU to the IAEA for its Member States’ which was adopted at the Board of Governors meeting on 27 November 2009.
Australia expects the issue of multilateral fuel assurances and multilateralisation of the fuel cycle to be considered at the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, and will take a constructive approach to the discussion.
As one of the forty-six members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), Australia is closely involved in discussions in the NSG aimed at developing criteria for the supply of sensitive nuclear technologies.
Australia actively engages Southeast Asian countries on a wide range of nuclear issues, providing training and assistance on IAEA safeguards, and on the physical protection of nuclear material and facilities.  Australia played a leading role in the establishment in 2009 of the Asia Pacific Safeguards Network.

Nuclear Weapons Convention


Recommendation 8

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government make clear in international fora its support for the adoption of a Nuclear Weapons Convention.

Response

Noted.  The Government is firmly committed to a world free of nuclear weapons and recognises that at an appropriate time, the international community may need to explore possible legal frameworks, including a Nuclear Weapons Convention, for the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons.  It nonetheless sees this as a long term goal.

Recommendation 9

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government allocate research and consultation resources to the development of a Nuclear Weapons Convention with a clear legal framework and enforceable verification.

Response

Noted.  The Government currently places priority on a successful outcome to the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference, negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT) and entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). All of these will contribute to creating the conditions necessary for a world free of nuclear weapons.
The Government also recognises the critical importance of strong and effective verification measures to the evolving nuclear disarmament architecture and is examining how Australia can best contribute to this work.

Other treaties


Recommendation 10

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government encourage an early conclusion to the negotiation of a replacement nuclear weapons reduction treaty by the United States and Russia, involving deep, verifiable and irreversible cuts, followed by its prompt ratification and entry into force.

Response

Supported.  The Government welcomed the signature by Presidents Obama and Medvedev of the Joint Understanding for a follow-on to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) which committed the United States and Russia to reduce their nuclear arsenals and delivery systems.  This was an important step towards finalisation of an agreement to replace START, and a strong signal of Russia’s and the United States’ commitment to substantial progress on nuclear disarmament.
Australia calls for deeper, faster, more transparent and irreversible reductions in their nuclear arsenals by all nuclear-armed states.

Recommendation 11

The Committee recommends that Australia play a leading role in advocating for full recognition of a southern hemisphere nuclear weapons free zone and in developing formal links between all members of nuclear weapons free zones, and that the Australian Government raise the issue at the 2010 NPT Review Conference and consider hosting a conference on this issue.

Response

Supported.  Australia has been a consistently strong supporter of the development of Nuclear Weapon-Free Zones (NWFZs) freely arrived at by member states.  
The Government welcomed the 2009 entry into force of the African NWFZ (the Treaty of Pelindaba) which, in addition to making the African continent a NWFZ, in effect introduced a Southern Hemisphere NWFZ.  At the 2009 United Nations General Assembly, Australia moved to co-sponsorship of resolutions calling for recognition of a NWFZ in the Southern Hemisphere and adjacent areas and a resolution on a Southeast Asian NWFZ.
Australia also co-sponsored a resolution supporting the convening of a conference of states parties and signatories to treaties by which NWFZs have been established. The aim of the conference would be to strengthen cooperation between parties to NWFZs. The conference would be held in New York in the lead up to the 2010 NPT Review Conference.

The Conference on Disarmament


Recommendation 12

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government undertakes strong diplomatic efforts to progress the work program of the Conference on Disarmament.

Response

Supported.  The Government will continue to make every effort to progress the Conference on Disarmament’s (CD) work program.  Australia served as one of the Presidents of the Conference on Disarmament in 2009 and made a strong contribution to the adoption by the CD of a work program in May 2009.  Australia was disappointed the work program was not implemented in 2009.
The CD’s rules of procedure require that the Conference adopt a new program of work for 2010. Australia will continue to work with all CD member states for the adoption and implementation of a program of work for 2010 including negotiation of an FMCT.

International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament


Recommendation 13

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government continue to actively support the work of the International Commission for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament.

Response

Supported.  The report of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament (ICNND) was received in Tokyo on 15 December 2009 by the Prime Ministers of Australia and Japan.  The Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, welcomed the report as providing an important framework for practical discussions on how to advance the cause of non-proliferation and disarmament in 2010, which will be a critical year for the world.
The Government established and strongly supports the Commission. In the 2009-2010 budget the Government provided $9.2 million over two years to enable ICNND’s work to continue, including following the launch of its report.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade established a secretariat to support the Commission, including to organise and service plenary and regional meetings of the Commission and to support high-level advocacy by the co-chairs and commissioners in a wide range of bilateral and multilateral meetings.  The secretariat will continue to support the co-chairs and commissioners in their advocacy of the report over the months leading in to the NPT Review Conference in May 2010.

Recommendation 14

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government seeks to build the adequacy and the continuity of the resources allocated to diplomatic and expert capabilities in disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Response

Supported.  The Prime Minister, in his National Security Statement to the Parliament in December 2008, articulated the Government’s commitment to ensuring the adequacy and continuity of resources allocated to national security policy.
Within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the International Security Division, the Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation Office and Australia’s overseas diplomatic network are responsible for implementing the Government’s nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation agenda.

2010 NPT Review Conference


Recommendation 15

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government seeks to promote agreement to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

Response

Supported.  Entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty are key non-proliferation and disarmament priorities.
The Government will vigorously pursue these objectives at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, as well as in other multilateral and bilateral fora.

Recommendation 16

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government seeks to promote universalisation of the Additional Protocol to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) at the 2010 NPT Review Conference.

Response

Supported.  The Additional Protocol (AP) is an integral part of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) safeguards system.  The Government has made adherence to an AP a condition of supply for Australian uranium and nuclear material derived from it, and contributes to universalisation of the AP through outreach seminars and courses.
The Government will continue to press for universal adoption of the Additional Protocol, including at the 2010 NPT Review Conference.

Recommendation 17

The Committee recommends that the Australian Government pursue, in conjunction with the Indonesian Government, an event for parliamentarians at the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (2010 NPT Review Conference) designed to encourage more active parliamentary involvement in these issues.

Response

Noted.  The Government works closely with Indonesia on non-proliferation and disarmament issues and will explore the possibility of jointly hosting an event for parliamentarians at the 2010 NPT Review Conference.

The role of Parliamentarians


Recommendation 18

The Committee recommends that the Presiding Officers agree to all outgoing official parliamentary delegations being briefed on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation issues, with a mandate to raise these issues during discussions with other parliamentarians as appropriate.

Response (NOTE: The Presiding Officers will respond to Recommendations 18 to 22.)


Recommendation 19

The Committee recommends that the Presiding Officers agree to the Parliament’s outgoing delegation program for 2010 being arranged so that the regular bilateral visit to the United States coincides with the 2010 NPT Review Conference, thus allowing parliamentarians an opportunity to participate in this Conference.

Recommendation 20

The Committee recommends that the delegation to the 121st Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in October 2009 takes this report to that conference to promote further discussion of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament issues.

Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade


Report into the Defence Annual Report 2006-07


Government Response


Recommendation 1

That subject to national security requirements, the ADF and Government schedule large acquisitions in a sustainable manner over time, to avoid peaks and troughs for Australian industry and to better provide a long-teen through-life support capability.

Government Response


Agreed In Principle. While the needs of the ADF must remain our primary consideration, Defence is examining options to better 'level load' demand on Australian industry. This was examined in the context of the 2009 Defence White Paper). As Chapter 16 of the Defence White Paper states, carefully managing local industry growth and capability at a rate commensurate with the ADF's needs is critical to Defence. Defence's aim will be to build greater flexibility into DCP programming to mitigate the adverse capability impacts associated with large expenditure 'peaks and troughs'.
Moreover, as outlined in the Defence Capability Plan 2009, over the next four years the Government sees strong growth in demand for local industry. This is especially pronounced in the maritime and electronics sectors. While there will be peaks and troughs in Defence demand, these are off a high base level of local work.

Recommendation 2

That consideration of Australia's future combat aircraft needs, including the critical air to air combat role, be determined by the paramount strategic importance of this capability, as recognised in the 2000 White Paper. That the decision on future air combat capability be determined by the analysis of available platform capabilities against Australia's strategic reform requirements and not be constrained by a predetermined requirement for a single platform.

Government Response


Agreed In Principle. The Government agrees with the Committee's comments on strategic importance. The 2009 Defence White Paper details the Government's directions for the future of the air combat capability, which are based on rigorous strategic logic, clearly defined strategic priorities and the outcomes of a comprehensive review of the ADF's force structure.

Recommendation 3

Provided by Assistant Treasurer.

Recommendation 4

The Committee recommends that the Government consider the acquisition of battlefield mobility assets for the Abrams tanks, such as bridge-laying capability.

Government Response


Agreed. Battlefield mobility is identified in the 2009 Defence White Paper as a key capability priority for the Army. The requirement for battlefield mobility assets for Abrams tanks may indicatively be met by combat bridge laying, for gap crossing, or ploughs, rollers, blades for countemiine and obstacle clearance. There also exists military off-the-shelf systems for combat bridging that may support the Abrams tanks' battlefield mobility. This will be investigated as part of DCP project LAND 155 — Enhanced Gap Crossing Capability.

Recommendation 5

The Committee recommends that the Government expedite a solution to upgrade communications suites to ensure integration of all battle management systems to create a modern and effective Network Centric Warfare capability.

Government Response


Agreed In Principle. The 2009 Defence White Paper placed a high priority of Information Superiority, including the area of Command, Control, Communications and Battlespace Management. The White Paper also places a priority on building the networked force and identified the Government's directions to Defence in the achievement of this force.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-02-25,"—Having risen to continue my remarks, I want to finish off this week by speaking in relation to the NBN and particularly those matters that have surrounded the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. A number of senators here tonight have been in parliament for a long time and fully understand when a government has had a good week and when a government has had a bad week. The record and history will show that this has been a bad, bad week for the government. Those like me who have been here for a long time know what the body language says, and the government’s body language tells us that those on the other side have come back this week to this place rattled. There is no engagement from the back bench and their ministers are not being supported—they are clearly rattled. They are clearly rattled about what has come out in relation to NBN and Mr Mike Kaiser.
Let me put this into perspective. The Prime Minister is earning $380,000 or thereabouts a year these days. I think it is under $400,000. We have a man who was effectively given the job in NBN as its government relations manager for $450,000—$450,000 to run the government relations part of NBN. That is more than is given to the Prime Minister of this country. The Prime Minister is doing a rotten job, but there is no way known that Mr Mike Kaiser is worth more than the Prime Minister is. Can I tell you again, because this is very important when you are talking about a man who has been clearly given a $450,000 job by the minister for communications, what is on the public record about Mr Mike Kaiser. Mr Mike Kaiser was named in the Shepherdson royal commission as a roll rorter and he was forced to resign from the Queensland parliament. What a great candidate for a government relations job with something as sensitive as NBN and its relationship with Telstra and the whole communications industry! So $450,000 for a rorter named in the Shepherdson inquiry. What a disgrace, and there is not one person in this chamber that does not know the relationship between Minister Conroy and Mike Kaiser. It cannot be justified. The questions have not been answered. We will continue to pursue this minister in relation to this matter.
In the short period of time left open to me, I want to look at the front page story of the Australian today in relation to the National Broadband Network and the botched endeavours of the minister for communications. Can you believe that we have a $43 billion project for which there is no business plan?

Senator Eggleston interjecting—

—It is remarkable, Senator Eggleston. Not only is there no business plan and no business case but we now find, as indicated on the front page of the Australian—and not denied by the minister—this:
THE Rudd government has backflipped on one of its key promises about the operation of the new national broadband network in an attempt to bolster the economic credentials of the massive $43 billion project and to enforce Telstra’s co-operation.
The draft legislation released yesterday reveals Communications Minister Stephen Conroy will have the discretion to allow NBN Co to effectively become a government-owned retailer of telecommunications services—
so a government-owned retailer of telecommunications services, not a wholesaler, as was promised! This is another backflip by a government that cannot help itself in relation to broken promises. It is the government of broken promises and it is the government of blah, blah, blah. (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-02-25,"—I rise today to speak on the very important issue of organ donation. As we know, this week is Australian Organ Donor Awareness Week. There have been many people in both the other chamber and this chamber wearing the badge that I am wearing today to say that they support organ donation and Australian Organ Donation Awareness Week.
The decision to become a donor is a very personal and a very important one. Organ donation is another one of those issues that is very confronting to people. It is an issue that we would probably prefer not to think about but one that we should think about and one that we should talk about. We should think about it because, basically, organ donation saves lives. I am proud to be a registered organ donor, as are my husband, son, daughter and both my parents, who are in their 80s.
As a bit of background, the first heart transplant was done in South Africa in 1967, with Australia following closely in 1968. I am sure that everybody in this place remembers how significant that was in those times. The first single-lung transplant in Australia was undertaken in 1990. So there was a bit of a lag. In Australia more than 80 per cent of people support organ donation as a concept, but unfortunately the percentage of registered donors is much less. Only 1,328,721 people have registered their intention with the Australian Organ Donor Register, and some of these are objections. There is still more work to be done in this very important area. Out of that number, unfortunately only 56 per cent of families actually give approval for their loved one’s organs to be donated once the loved one has deceased. I am pleased that in my home state of Tasmania the donor rate is 16 people per million compared to the national average of 12 people per million. As I said, that is really still not good enough and leaves a lot of room for improvement.
Families may decide against organ donation because they are not sure if it is what their relative would have wanted or maybe because they are scared, distressed or unable to cope at the time with the request from the medical staff. That is completely understandable, but that trauma is eased if you have discussed the issue with your family and they are aware of your wishes. I believe it is important that everyone considers organ donation and makes an informed decision about it. Regardless of whether a person is an organ donor or not, it is important to make their loved ones aware of their decision, as I said, so that their wishes are carried out.
In November last year the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, announced $151 million was to be spent to boost Australia’s organ donor rate through the national DonateLife network. As part of this announcement, my home state of Tasmania received funding to establish a dedicated office for organ donation. In total, the Rudd government has provided $276,000 to the Tasmanian program for the 2009-10 financial year. The DonateLife network has the key message of ‘discover, decide and discuss’, which encompasses the three steps needed when considering organ donation.
Firstly, it is important to understand the facts, obviously so an informed decision can be made. Once you have made the decision, it is important to fill out the forms, but more important is the step of discussing this decision with your family. Almost 50 per cent of people do not realise that their family would have to confirm their wishes to be a donor. Dr Andrew Taylor from the Royal Hobart Hospital has been appointed as the Tasmanian State Medical Director with the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority in Tasmania. Dr Taylor will provide support and education for families experiencing the loss of a loved one and confronting what is a very difficult decision to make at such a traumatic time. He will also be Tasmania’s link to the national DonateLife network. He will develop Tasmania’s first organ and tissue donation agency. This is an important step forward for Tasmania, as it has previously been necessary to fly clinicians from Victoria to assess potential donors. Dr Taylor will be assisted by Rob Thornton, an experienced nurse, and both the Launceston General Hospital and the North West Regional Hospital will provide services on a part-time basis.
In Australia during 2009, 247 people donated their organs. Because of this, almost 800 people were able to have transplants. However, as of 4 January 2010, 1,770 people were waiting to get the phone call that gives them another chance at life and, sadly, not all of them will have a donor in time to save their life. To become an organ donor, people should register with the Australian Organ Donor Register. Registering is not a guarantee that your organs will be used. Families are still consulted and may override your decision. However, this is rare, especially if they have been aware of your wishes prior to your death.
Health professionals have access to the register 24 hours a day so they can check if the patient is on the register. Even if a patient is not a registered donor, doctors may still ask the families if they would consent to the organs being donated if the person is likely to be a potential candidate as a donor. While everyone can be registered donors, only about one per cent of the population can be organ donors. This is because it is necessary for the donors to actually die in hospital so that they can be kept on a ventilator while the organs are harvested. For those people who are unfortunately killed in road accidents and things like that, even if they are registered organ donors, their organs are not suitable to be donated.
There are a number of myths regarding organ donation which I would like to clarify. One is the comment that doctors may not work as hard to save the life of a person who is a registered donor. This is simply not true. Doctors have an obligation to save lives whenever it is possible and, I believe, in all cases work hard to do that. The medical staff who treat patients are not transplant physicians. The role of the transplant physician is to liaise with candidates and recipients rather than work in the emergency department or surgery.
Another myth is that it is possible for people to be declared dead when they are still alive, and this is a concern that a lot of people seem to have. But there are strict guidelines, covered by legislation, to ensure that people have been assessed properly before being declared deceased. Some people also worry that organ donors’ bodies will be mutilated and therefore it would not be possible to have an open casket at the funeral. The procedure is undertaken as carefully as any surgery would be. All attempts are made to ensure scars are minimal. Even skin and corneas can be donated with limited impact. People may be concerned that their organs might be used for medical research, but this is another myth, because this is only allowed if specific consent has been given.
Contrary to popular belief, age is not a factor in organ donation. Elderly people can be donors, as can infants. It depends on the physical health of the person. Some donors’ organs may all be suitable for donation, while other people may have only one or two organs suitable for donation. It is also untrue that families of organ donors are charged for the removal of the organs; this expense is met by the government.
It should also be noted that it is possible for living people to donate some organs and tissue. For example, a person can function with one healthy kidney, so they may give the other one to someone in need of a transplant if they are a match. This often happens between family members. Bone marrow can also be taken from a live donor.
One example of a live donor is the late Michelle Eather of Tasmania. Michelle donated a kidney to a stranger from America in 2007. Unfortunately, Michelle passed away in 2009 as a result of complications from multiple sclerosis. Michelle maintained she had made the right decision right up until she died. Due to the circumstances of her death, Michelle’s organs could not be donated; however, permission was granted for them to be used for medical research into multiple sclerosis.
Australian Doujon Zammit was also an organ donor following his tragic death in Greece while on holiday. Mr Zammit had expressed his views on organ donation, and his family followed his wishes. Doujon’s organs saved four lives, including that of Australian Kostas Gribilas. A new heart allowed Kostas to marry his partner, Poppy, with Doujon’s father, Oliver, as best man. Some well-known people have had to have organ transplants, including Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins— (Time expired)

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2010-02-25,"—I rise to speak on the retirement of a prominent Tasmanian from public life, a Tasmanian who has spent 44 years in the service of his fellow Tasmanians and Australians, 35 of those years in parliamentary service. Of course, I am speaking about one of the greatest characters in Australian politics over the last 50 years or so, the Mouth from the South, the Hon. Michael Hodgman QC MP. I wanted to add my comments to those made in this place some weeks ago by Senator Barnett. There is much that can be said of Michael—his time in public office; his passion for Tasmania, for Hobart, for regional Australia, for the law; his antics, his stunts, his legendary rhetoric; and his loyalty to our sovereign, Her Majesty the Queen of Australia.
Michael Hodgman is the longest currently serving member of any Australian parliament. He was first elected in 1966 as an Independent member of Tasmania’s upper house Legislative Council—it is a quirk of Tasmania’s electoral system—in the seat of Huon. In an ‘only in Tasmania’ moment, he was re-elected unopposed in 1972. Michael resigned in 1974 and was elected Liberal federal member for Denison in 1975. He was re-elected in 1977, 1980, 1983 and 1984, before being defeated in 1987 following a redistribution of electoral boundaries. During this time, he served as a minister in the Fraser coalition government. After one further, unsuccessful shot at the federal seat of Denison in 1990, Michael decided to run for state parliament and in 1992 he was elected as the member for the state seat of Denison in the Tasmanian House of Assembly, a position he successfully defended in the 1996 state election. He was subsequently defeated in 1998 but came back again in a count-back in 2001 following the retirement of former state premier Ray Groom, whose son, Matt, is campaigning to replace Michael on 20 March in the state election. He was then re-elected in 2002 and again in 2006.
As a Tasmanian growing up in a political family—like Michael, my father was a politician—the spectre of Michael Hodgman has always loomed large for me and I am proud to have the opportunity to pay tribute to this great Tasmanian this evening. But Michael’s impact has extended far beyond someone like me who grew up with politics within Tasmania. Indeed, there are very few political observers across Australia who are not aware of Michael’s work, his oratory and passion for Australia and for its sovereign. Michael Hodgman is a politician of the old school and, now aged 71, his time in politics has seen him part of a momentous period in Australian life. He has known many of our nation’s and, for that matter, the world’s leaders. Most famously, his oratory earned him the title of Mouth from the South, as mentioned already, and his passion for Australia earned him the title of Patriot. He has an incredible memory—an amazing ability to recall people’s names, their background and an issue they might have brought up with him years ago.
Whether it is his passion for the horses, his beloved football club Geelong, the navy, boxing or tennis, Michael has always led an active life and, therefore, it is a tragedy that the reason for his retirement is his health and a sad lesson to us all on the impact of long-term smoking.
Michael has been a champion of many causes. He was resolute about the Indonesian presence in East Timor, to the detriment of his own career advancement in the Fraser government during the late 1970s. He was one of the first politicians to speak out vehemently against apartheid when many others were conveniently looking the other way. He fought for the Huon naval base in Hobart, the retention of the historic Anglesea Barracks, the establishment of the Antarctic Division headquarters in Kingston, south of Hobart, and the CSIRO moving to Hobart.
He was proud to be Minister for the Capital Territory and in that role to be involved in the construction of this building and working closely with the chairman of the Parliament House Construction Authority, Sir John Holland. Michael and his Canberra flatmate, Bruce Goodluck, who held the neighbouring seat of Franklin, were known at the time as the ‘odd couple’ and were well known nationally for their antics in seeking publicity, and sometimes some of these antics involved taking the micky out of each other. Bruce Goodluck told a story where he bought pink paper, sprinkled it with Chanel No. 5 and wrote on it: ‘Dear Mr Hodgman, I have had my eyes on you since you first came to parliament. If you are interested wear a red carnation. I usually frequent the press boxes.’ Of course, the next day Michael Hodgman was seen frequenting the press gallery and boxes wearing a red carnation.
But behind the pranks was a very serious message to governments—ignore the outlying states and the regional seats at their peril. Michael was a ferocious fighter for what he believed in such as tackling the Hawke socialist government, states’ rights, East Timorese freedom and immigration. He is known for his pressure to speed up the development of Hobart’s Southern Outlet, lobbying for Hobart’s second bridge, railing against the Soviet Union and above all fighting for the battlers.
Many of Canberra’s older residents would remember Michael’s reign as Minister for the Capital Territory. He was also known as the ‘Minister for Opening Doors’ because, if there was an opening occurring, he would be there. In fact, press coverage at the time sometimes speculated whether Michael actually spent any time away from Canberra. Once when Michael was criticised for removing protesters from the Parliament House lawns in his role as minister he explained that it was to give other demonstrators more room.
When Michael Hodgman was Minister for the Capital Territory his departmental officials found him excellent at raising the profile of Canberra and promoting the national capital, but sometimes the routine paperwork was neglected. After the ministerial in-tray had grown to the dimensions of a small mountain one senior public servant, a Mr Dempster, suggested ever so mildly to the minister that he might want to deal with some of the submissions. Michael got on very well with Mr Dempster and had given him a nickname, and responded: ‘Look, Hamster, you worry about the paperwork, and I’ll worry about the politics!’
Notable incidents seemed to follow Michael. There was a story that during the 1990 federal election campaign at an election fundraiser some of the women taking part in a fashion parade started to auction off their clothes to the highest bidder. By all accounts at least one Michael Hodgman t-shirt and one bra were removed and auctioned off. The auction was only a week after a reported wet t-shirt contest, again involving a Michael Hodgman t-shirt. The stories made the front page of the Hobart Mercury a week before the election.
I can clearly remember the notoriety Michael received for his comments that caused the leadership spill which saw Andrew Peacock take the Liberal leadership from the then leader John Howard. I do not think Mr Howard ever quite forgave Michael for that. There were also Michael’s own leadership ambitions. At one point he was widely reported as a potential leader of the Liberal Party and in one ballot finished only 12 votes behind John Howard for deputy leader. Michael was also touted as a potential leader in the Tasmanian state parliament but, despite putting his name forward, this was not to be.
There is no doubt that Michael has led a colourful career and life; that description is one I repeatedly found when researching this speech. Even though he has been colourful he has been compassionate and he has delivered real outcomes for his constituents. Michael has served Tasmanians and Australians with absolute dedication often to the detriment of his life and time with a family that he loves deeply.
On 20 March 2010 Michael retires from active service in the Tasmanian parliament. I have no doubt that this will be with a very heavy heart as so much of his life has revolved around service to Tasmanians and Australians. Despite this, I suspect Michael is looking forward to that day, not because it will provide him an opportunity to wind down and spend more time with his grandchildren and his family or to pursue pastimes that he has not had time for since first entering parliament some 44 years ago, but because it will, with a fair wind, be the day that his son, Will Hodgman, will become Premier of Tasmania.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Mr Michael Hodgman QC</title>,Adjournment,41,1,speech
