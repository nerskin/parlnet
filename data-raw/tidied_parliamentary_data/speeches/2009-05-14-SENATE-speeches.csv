"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-05-14,"—I move:
That Part 3 (clauses 3.1 to 3.3) of Determination 2009/04: Remuneration and Allowances for Holders of Public Office; and Members of Parliament – Entitlements and Office Holders Additional Salary, made pursuant to subsections 7(1), 7(3) and 7(4) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, be disapproved.
This motion is to disallow the regulation by which the members of parliament would get an extra $4,900 a year, or $90 a week, in electorate allowance. As all members of the chamber are aware, that allowance is to enable us to extend our services to our electorates. However, there is no mandating of that and it may be that members who do not spend the money on the electorate are able to use it as personal income; in which case, of course, it is taxable income. The problem with this decision by the Remuneration Tribunal is that it has apparently been taken in the absence of recognition by the tribunal—which is quite extraordinary in itself—that we are in a recession. There has been no increase in this allocation in real terms since 2002, and throughout all the boom years since then the Remuneration Tribunal made no decision to increase the amount. But it waits until we are in the middle of the worst recession, arguably, since the Great Depression and announces that members of parliament should be getting an extra $4,900 a year in electorate allowances. It is simply up to us to rectify that and we should be rejecting this proposal.
The budget that was announced the night before last had in it an increase for single pensioners of $32.49 a week, which they have been waiting for since 1993. I think it is untoward and unacceptable that we members of parliament should be getting three times that amount without any of the difficulties that pensioners find themselves in. In fact, for pensioner couples the increase is $10 a week, but MPs would be effectively getting $90 a week.
The Prime Minister had the wisdom last year to turn down the Remuneration Tribunal’s recommendation that members of parliament get quite a hike in the base salary that we receive. That was generally given a good reception—at least outside parliament. If this rise goes into the purses and wallets of MPs, it will be seen simply as a backdoor way of receiving that increase, and it has been seen in that way. I think that we have to be able to show the electorate that MPs are capable of some belt-tightening at a time when people are hurting. Hundreds of thousands of Australians are losing their jobs altogether or are having their small businesses closed down, and they are finding times very difficult indeed.
I think that the electorate at large would welcome MPs applying some restraint until this recession is over. Therefore, the Greens have decided to move for disallowance of a recommendation that, in my view, would never have come from the Remuneration Tribunal if it were living in the real world, if it had its eye on where society is and the relevant position of MPs, and, indeed, if it had any nous at all about the economic circumstances of this nation. Apparently, the three independent members of the Remuneration Tribunal live in some isolated world where news of economic events, if not other events, does not get to them. They should have taken into account the circumstances in which all Australians find themselves in a recession, and they should have made sure that their decision on this matter was commensurate with the existing circumstances in society. This rise is not commensurate with existing circumstances, and we should have the good sense that the Remuneration Tribunal did not have and reject the recommendation that electoral allowances increase by $4,900 a year. I commend this disallowance motion to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-05-14,"—I rise to commend Senator Brown for this motion and indicate my support for it. Senator Bob Brown is right. It is never a good time, in the public’s eyes, for an increase in the remuneration for politicians; but this is a particularly bad time, given the economic circumstances. I think it begs some broader questions about the structure and role of the Remuneration Tribunal and whether there ought to be a greater degree of transparency and accountability with respect to it. I think it is important for this to be considered as part of a broader reform, and I for one join with Senator Brown and the Greens in opposing this rise.
During my time in state parliament a survey was undertaken, which I participated in—not all members participated in it—from the state equivalent of the Remuneration Tribunal. It asked what MPs spent their electoral allowances on. I was more than happy to participate in that, and I could demonstrate back then that I spent more than my electoral allowance on matters that were properly the subject of an electoral allowance. I think that is something that should be looked at by the Remuneration Tribunal or any new body in the future. I do not think it is unreasonable for the public to expect a degree of transparency and accountability in relation to this, and I agree with Senator Brown that there is a criticism that the Remuneration Tribunal just does not live in the real world in the context of this decision. I have said, and Senator Brown has said, that this could be seen as a backdoor pay rise, because there is no obligation to spend this money for electoral allowance purposes. That is one of the flaws.
If the structure of the allowance were different, then maybe there could be different arguments in relation to it. But, having said that, my plea is that there ought to be broad bipartisan reform of the whole system of politicians’ remuneration so that there can be some community input. I think it would stand us in good stead in terms of our reputation as politicians if it were broadened out. Right now I do not think there is that level of public trust and confidence in the system. I think that the Remuneration Tribunal moves in mysterious ways, and I think that it adds to the cynicism that the public feel towards their elected representatives. I think we can do a lot to fix that, and supporting this motion is one small step. I am looking forward to further substantive reform in relation to the whole issue of politicians’ remuneration and entitlements, how they are determined and the level of community input.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-05-14,"—Family First support this motion to disapprove part 3 of the Remuneration Tribunal’s determination 2009/04. At the heart of this is that we have the Rudd government telling us that we need to tighten our belts and that everybody has got to do their bit. We heard that same mantra being espoused in the budget that has recently come through. But how does having an increase to the electoral allowance mean that pollies are tightening their belts? How does that go hand in hand? How could anyone in this chamber not support this motion? We are calling on Australians to do their bit, to pull in their belts a bit, and telling them we are all going to do our bit and do our part, but here we have pollies doing the reverse. They are expanding their benefits. This is sending all of the wrong signals to the Australian public. At a time when times are tough, increasing the electoral allowance does not make sense.
The Remuneration Tribunal has a job—it makes recommendations for parliamentarians to approve or disapprove—so let us not hide behind the fact that it is an independent body. It is, and it has done what we have asked it to do—that is, to make a recommendation. But it is up to the politicians in this chamber today to use their conscience, to look the Australian public in the eye and honestly ask themselves if they can sleep at night knowing that if they do not support this disallowance motion today then they are telling the Australian public that it is okay for us to spend more. We are asking the community to do their bit, but politicians are exempt.
If you look at the budget that was put forward on Tuesday night, the only people the budget did not have an impact on were pollies. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has 60 more staff, $13 million more a year, but the poor couple pensioners are doing it tough. I appeal to both sides of the chamber to think about this. Should politicians expand their electoral allowances at this point in time? We would not hide behind the argument that it has not increased for many years. That arguement can be put aside given that we are asking Australians to pull their belts in and do their bit while politicians get away with nearly murder in this regard. You cannot, if you are genuine, allow this increase to go through. I appeal to both sides of the chamber today to rethink what they are going to do on this vote. This is a very important vote. This is a telling time as to whether pollies are going to pull their own belts in and not have them expand.
The electoral allowance is all well and good, and the argument that it has not been increased for a number of years is a decent argument. But these are tough times, and as Kevin Rudd pulls the lever of the GFC—it reminds me of a bucket of KFC; every time you have a problem, it is the GFC. And here is an example: the global financial crisis means you should not be making an increase to the electoral allowance and today you should ensure that increase is not taken by politicians. I appeal to both sides of the chamber to support this motion here before us.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2009-05-14,"—The government does recognise that the issue of parliamentarians’ allowances does get raised in the community. It is a strong position that has been recognised in this chamber over a long period of time—that is, that people, particularly in this chamber, should not be setting their own pay and conditions. It is recognised that there is a perennial argument about what politicians should be paid. It does get raised by both sides of the chamber and gy the minor parties and the community. In acknowledging that debate, it is a sensible proposition to say that there is and should be an independent system that operates, which sets up a system whereby decisions are made by an independent tribunal. It is a sensible position. The alternative would be that individuals themselves might set up pay and conditions, and that would lessen the position that we are in now.
This is a proposition that seeks to disallow a Remuneration Tribunal decision. The government does not support that position. The Remuneration Tribunal is an independent statutory authority and its remuneration decisions are made accordingly. The electoral allowance for federal parliamentarians has not been increased since January 2000. The Remuneration Tribunal recently completed a review of the electoral allowance for federal parliamentarians. This is the first time that a review of the electoral allowance has been conducted since late 2002. As a result of the 2009 review, the Remuneration Tribunal decided to increase the allowance by 17 per cent to approximately $32,000 per year. This increase is outlined in the determination 2009/04.
On behalf of the government, I would like to take this opportunity to assure the chamber that the purpose of this allowance is to reimburse members of parliament for costs necessarily incurred in providing services to their constituents. I recognise that Senator Bob Brown raised the issue that went to base salaries—that is, the base salaries of federal politicians are determined by the Prime Minister, who decided that they would be frozen for the 2008-09 financial year. In determining the base salary of federal parliamentarians, the Prime Minister does take the advice of the Remuneration Tribunal. The Prime Minister decided to freeze the base salaries of federal parliamentarians at $127,000 for the 2008-09 financial year.
In contrast to base salary determinations, subsections 7(1), 7(2) and 7(4) of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 provide the Remuneration Tribunal with the power to determine a range of entitlements and allowances for senators and members of the federal parliament. The major allowances determined by the tribunal include travel allowances, travel allowance rates and travel related provisions, the electoral allowance, the qualifying period for a life gold pass, severance travel and certain other office facilities.
As senators in this chamber will know, all Remuneration Tribunal determinations are disallowable by the parliament. In handing down its decision on electoral allowances, the Remuneration Tribunal made a statement about the nature of the electoral allowance. For the information of the Senate I might go to the content of that statement:
Federal parliamentarians (both Senators and Members of the House of Representatives) have been in receipt of an electorate allowance since 1952.
The purpose of the allowance is to provide funding to members to cover a range of expenses involved in servicing their electorates. The allowance comprises a base amount plus supplementary amounts for those Members whose electorates exceed 2000 square kilometres in size. At the end of each financial year any part of the allowance which is not expended on genuine electorate expenses to the satisfaction of the Australian Tax Office is regarded as personal income and taxed accordingly. Rates of similar allowances available to members of parliaments and assemblies around Australia vary widely.
The allowance enables members to make modest provision for expenditure at their discretion to address differing needs in their respective electorates. Previous reviews have noted that members spend the allowance in widely varying ways in servicing their electorates.
The Remuneration Tribunal determines the amount of the allowance. There is no automatic mechanism for adjusting it each year and the Tribunal has not varied the amount since January 2000. The Consumer Price Index has since increased by more than 30 per cent; that is, more than 3 per cent annually.
The tribunal has taken into account the costs to members of meeting the commitments to which their allowances are directed and has recognised that they have increased over the same period. Accordingly the tribunal made a decision to lift the base allowance to take into account the diminution of that amount for that period.
It is long established that the independence of the tribunal and its decision making in these areas should be recognised. I think the alternative is something that the government would consider—that is, politicians setting pay and conditions themselves. In this instance I recognise Senator Brown’s concern and the concern that is raised in the community about these matters. However, the use of a disallowance motion is recognised as quite a blunt instrument in this instance. I note the comments made by Senator Xenophon about transparency. The Remuneration Tribunal is a statutory office, it is transparent and is able to provide information upon request to any senator or member who wishes to seek further information. Of course in this instance the tribunal, as I have said, has come to an independent decision in respect of allowances.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2009-05-14,"—Sometimes with these types of debates it is tempting to question what is principle and what is politics. Putting that to one side, there is actually a principle at stake in relation to this whole issue. The principle is—and this is the issue that the opposition has with this disallowance motion—do politicians determine their own salaries and other add-ons or do we rely on an independent umpire? By the context of this motion it might be seen that we will take over from the independent umpire. But what happens in this place in 12 months, five years or 10 years time when the nature of the place might change? We might have a group of MPs who are actually desperate to determine far higher terms of engagement for themselves.
So, if you are serious about the principle, the principle must be that we are not the ones who are best placed to determine our own terms and conditions. In fact I think it is an outrageous notion that members of parliament should be determining their own terms and conditions. The opposition has made it very, very clear that the Remuneration Tribunal is an independent umpire who makes these decisions. Whether we like the outcomes or not, and whether some members of the community like them or do not like them, is not the issue. It is the principle of the fact that we should not be determining our own terms and conditions.
Quite frankly I think we owe it to the community for them to know that there is an independent umpire and that it is not politicians making determinations about their own terms and conditions. If anything, maybe the argument should be that we increase the independence of the Remuneration Tribunal so that there is a far bigger gap between us and the independent umpire. This debate today is about who makes the determinations. We disagree with Senator Brown that politicians are the ones who should be determining their own terms and conditions and we passionately believe that should remain the domain of an independent umpire.",SENATE,<title>REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL DETERMINATION</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-05-14,"—I thank senators for their contribution. The argument from both the government and the opposition falls flat when we remember that just last year the Prime Minister ruled out a pay increase recommended by the Remuneration Tribunal.
—We want more independence, not less.
—I do not know what that interjection means, but it did not help much. The fact is that the Prime Minister overruled the Remuneration Tribunal, and members in this place raised no debate about it. Now we have this extraordinary $4,900 recommendation coming from the tribunal and members are saying that we must not intervene on that because it is an independent tribunal.
I ask this: is there any member present who was consulted about this increase, about the burden of electorate costs on us? If you ask me, the Remuneration Tribunal is working out of thin air. I do not know how they came to their deliberation, I do not know where the inquiry was, I do not know who was called before them and I certainly do not know who made the reference. Why on earth would a tribunal wait through eight good years and make no recommendation on increasing the electorate allowance and then, in the middle of a recession when everybody is pulling their belts in and hundreds of thousands of Australians are finding themselves with no job income at all, recommend that politicians get an extra $4,900, not to be necessarily directed to the electorate but to spend as they will? That is the other point here. It is to spend as politicians will, and some do not spend it on the electorate. I do not know; I think the Remuneration Tribunal itself needs looking at. I commend this disallowance motion to the Senate.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-05-14,"—I move:
That on the introduction of any of the following bills into the House of Representatives or any other bill that forms part of the Government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, provisions of these bills be referred immediately to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 15 June 2009, including, but not limited to the following:
Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges – Customs) Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges – Excise) Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges – General) Bill 2009;

Customs Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2009;
Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2009; and
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Household Assistance) Bill 2009.
This is a motion to refer to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee the bills which comprise the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in its entirety—with the one exception of the forestry components, which will commence slightly later.
The subject matter of the bills that are proposed to be referred has been a matter of consideration and inquiry for a long period of time. I want to take the Senate through this so that we can be clear about what is occur-ring. In February last year the government set out its approach, consistent with our election commitment, to introduce a trading scheme—the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The release of the green paper made very clear what the government’s timetable was. We had an extensive process of consideration of the green paper, which led to the decisions in December and the publication of the white paper. It is these bills which give effect to the white paper. So that is one set of processes. And I would remind senators that the green paper garnered over 1,000—I think 1,026—submissions and the CPRS draft legislation received a further 160 non-campaign submissions as well as 11,000 general responses.
In addition to the green paper and white paper consultation processes, the government also commissioned the Garnaut review. That review went through last year. It received almost 4,000 submissions and held information sessions all around the country to gain feedback—and I will come to that. Prior to that there was quite a lot of discussion by previous governments and the state and territory governments through their state and territory task forces on the design of a trading scheme.
So this has been a heavily scrutinised and considered reform that has had extensive community engagement. Just under this government there have been a green paper process—1,000 submissions; the Garnaut review—4,000 submissions; and a white paper process. In addition, the government referred the exposure draft of these bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, which has reported. The bills which have been introduced into the other place by my colleague Mr Combet today largely reflect the content of the exposure draft but obviously there are some changes. Hence, we think it is appropriate that this go to the appropriate committee, which is the Senate economics committee, which previously dealt with the exposure draft legislation.
So if there is any suggestion that there has been insufficient scrutiny, I would say to the chamber that this has actually been one of the most scrutinised reforms, just under this term of government, that this parliament has seen. There have been extensive government processes, extensive parliamentary processes and extensive community processes which have enabled the community to engage very closely with the model that the government was putting forward. I would also make the point that, in addition to those processes, the parliament has taken a very great interest in climate policy. In fact, in the 12 months to date we believe there have been some 13 inquiries before the parliament to deal with climate change matters. Hearings relating to these inquiries have been held all over the country. We calculate that there were approximately 787 appearances before these committees. So let us be clear. Just under this government there have been a green paper process—over 1,000 submissions; the Garnaut review—4,000 submissions; public hearings held by the Garnaut review all over the country; and Senate committee processes plus 13 committee inquiries into climate change.
This is an overdue reform. It is time for action. There are those who want to delay consideration of this scheme—not because they want a better process, not because they are focused on a better outcome, but because they simply do not believe climate change is real and they simply do not want to have to make a decision to vote for or against this bill. That is the question.
—Stop trying to cover up your backflip.
—I will take that interjection. Senator Abetz accuses us of a cover-up. But we have been transparent. We have come to the Australian people and said that we want to take action on climate change, and we have set out this process. I can tell you where the cover-up is: it is on that side. It is those opposite who want to continue to delay consideration of this, not because they think it is the right thing to do, not because they think it is in the national interest, but because they cannot get a position. I want to talk for a while about what has occurred, on the opposition side of the chamber over the last few years—in fact longer than that. This issue of an emissions trading scheme has been on the public policy agenda for a very long time. In fact, those opposite might like to know—

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—I will take that interjection too. Senator Abetz said it was put on the agenda by the Howard government. It certainly was on the agenda for a long time, Senator Abetz. In fact, earlier this year was the 10th anniversary of the first report to the Howard government on the establishment of a trading scheme. I do not know what everyone else was doing 10 years ago—I certainly was not here—but you were already talking about it then. And the opposition’s position is, ‘Let’s just keep talking.’ I want to remind the opposition of a couple of things. It seems quite remarkable that Australian politics has come full circle. We seem to have a position from some members of the opposition which is at odds with former Prime Minister Howard. I remind those opposite that, in February 2007, Mr Howard said, ‘There can be no argument that greenhouse gases are having an adverse impact on the Earth’s environment.’ So I am wondering where Senator Bernardi and Senator Minchin are—oh, Senator Bernardi is in the chair, and it is bit unfair to verbal him when he is in the chair.
—We’re all here.
—And Senator Joyce and Senator Boswell are here too. It is quite remarkable. We have senators in this chamber who are more conservative on climate change than former Prime Minister Howard. Now that is an achievement. That is really an achievement. They are here and they are all here ready to talk about why we should not do anything. Let us remember, even your conservative Prime Minister took a position, even-tually, that recognised the science. So who is out of touch on this issue? It is Senators Minchin, Bernardi, Abetz, Boswell and—
—Don’t leave me out; I want to be in.
—Joyce. Senator Joyce does not want to be left out. I put you in at the end there because you are proud to be amongst those who do not agree with former Prime Minister Howard. It is interesting to actually read some of former Prime Minister Howard’s own work. It is commonly known as the Shergold report and it is the report to the then Prime Minister entitled Report of the task group on emissions trading.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Mr Acting Deputy President, I will take Senator Abetz in a debate any time, but he keeps foaming at the mouth in this debate. He has not actually drawn breath in terms of interjections since I have been on my feet. I am sure he will have the opportunity to put his views, which are more conservative than Mr Howard’s, shortly. But he might do me the courtesy of at least drawing breath at some point during my discussion. I remind those opposite of Mr Howard’s report, which occurred while they were in government. I did not hear them at the time jumping up and down and saying that Prime Minister Howard was going to act too precipitously. I did not hear them at the time publicly saying this was going to be a dreadful thing and how appalling it was for Australia to go down this path. I would like to remind those opposite what was said in this report, which was presented in June 2007, before the election. It said:
… waiting until a truly global response emerges before imposing an emissions cap will place costs on Australia by increasing business uncertainty and delaying or losing investment. Already there is evidence that investment in key emissions-intensive industries and energy infrastructure is being deferred.
You received that advice in government two years ago, and you are still arguing a position that you do not want to give business the signal on certainty that was called for when you were in government, and that even then Prime Minister Howard took heed of. I will remind you that the task group also said:
… the Task Group has concluded that Australia should not wait … It believes that there are benefits, which outweigh the costs, in early adoption by Australia of an appropriate emissions constraint.
What have we seen since then? We have seen this extraordinary crab-walk from the other side. Frankly, the climate change troglodytes, those who simply do not believe that climate change is real, have gradually, gradually gained control of the party room. Their voices, when in government, were muted; but now, when in opposition, they have gradually pushed the opposition to a more and more extreme position on this issue. The position that is occasionally articulated by Mr Turnbull is the same position that Mr Nelson took and was, as I recall, one of the reasons you replaced him as leader, because those in the Liberal Party thought he had taken the wrong position on climate change policy. Mr Turnbull has now taken the same position. So I am not quite sure where the consistency is.
I remind those opposite also of the timetable that was proposed when they were in government, which included the passage of the legislation in 2009. That was your policy. It is interesting to note the way Mr Turnbull’s position has changed on this issue. Mr Turnbull said at the Press Club on 21 May 2008—and you should listen to this, Senator Joyce, because you will really enjoy this, particularly after your Press Club performance:
The Emissions Trading Scheme is the central mechanism to decarbonise our economy.
Do you agree with that, Senator Joyce? The fact is that Mr Turnbull used to believe in this. On 26 May, some five days later, he said:
The biggest element in the fight against climate change has to be the emissions-trading scheme …
He then started to crab-walk away from it. What is the reason for this? How do you go from having the trading scheme as the biggest element to now saying that it is not necessary at all? There is really only one explanation for that about-face and that is that he is worried about his leadership, he is worried about the numbers in the party room. He is running now an entirely different position because he is concerned about those in his party room who still think climate change is not real.
I want to go back to why we need to have this inquiry and why we want to bring it in in the June sittings, as we previously publicly and transparently indicated. It is because this is an overdue reform. We want legislation passed this year because we want to give business the certainty that they are calling for. Those opposite might not like to remember that the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group—and I know this will get Senator Boswell going—have all said they want the legislation passed this year. It seems extraordinary that those opposite could be so focused on their own internal issues that they do not listen to the calls from the community, including the business community, about the importance of giving business certainty.
The second reason why we want this passed this year is that Copenhagen is important. Australia needs to go to Copenhagen with targets that are backed by a mechanism to meet them. It is extraordinary that those on the other side say they want a global agreement in Australia’s national interest but are not prepared to ensure that we put targets on the table which are responsibly backed by a scheme to meet them. They say they want a global agreement in the national interest. Well, give the government and the negotiators the legislation that enables them to maximise that chance.
What is occurring in this place and in this debate is that the self-interest of the Leader of the Opposition is trumping the national interest. Malcolm Turnbull knows this is the right thing to do. He is trying to delay taking this into his party room. He is delaying taking a position on this because he is scared he does not have the numbers. We are seeing from the other side the self-interest and weakness of one man overriding what is in the national interest.
This is an overdue reform that has been the subject of intensive and detailed consideration by the parliament. There has been an extraordinary amount of community engagement through the Garnaut review processes. As well, people have had an opportunity to comment on the green paper. This has also been the subject of the exposure draft inquiry by the Senate and has been out for community consultation. The only reason that those opposite would argue for a delay is that they do not want to take a position on this, because some in their party room—and Senator Joyce would proudly number himself amongst them, I am sure—do not believe climate change is real. No matter how long we talk about this and no matter how much consideration is given, they do not want to vote to actually take action.
It is self-interest trumping national interest. It is time for us to engage in this reform. We want this reported on so we can commence the debate on this in the June sittings, as we said to the Australian people we would do.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-05-14,"—I want to draw us back to the substantive part of this debate. We are debating whether these 11 bills should be referred to a committee for examination. I move to the motion moved by Senator Wong:
Omit “15 June 2009”, substitute “11 August 2009”.
This amendment will change the date of reporting for the committee from 15 June to 11 August this year. The reason for the amendment is that in the words of Senator Wong herself, this is a very substantive suite of bills.
Senator Wong indicated there have been over 11,000 general submissions. These 11 bills were put through the House of Representatives this morning. We have not had a chance to examine any of the bills. We have not seen them. The government wants to rush this through. Why does the government want to rush this through when the government has deferred the implementation of the CPRS until well beyond 2010? We believe an extra few weeks will give the community the opportunity to make submissions and allow the Senate due process.
We also need to consider that this is budget week. Committees and senators are going to be inundated with work in examining the budget bills. This week the legislative program is not moving forward as fast as it could because of the budget. The Senate is going to need the remaining two weeks of the winter session—we have estimates in the next fortnight—to examine other bills and to finish some of the work that is already on the agenda that the government considers necessary and urgent. We, therefore, strongly suggest that the committee not report on these bills before the senators have had a chance to consider them by having examination during the winter recess.
The winter recess, as many senators know, is often used for a lot of committee work whilst the pressures of parliament do not exist. This would give ample opportunity for people who wished to make a submission to do so. This would also give ample opportunity for the committee to be ready to proceed with the inquiry. This is not just any piece of legislation; this is one of the government’s most significant pieces of legislation. Senator Wong has admitted that herself this morning. She has indicated that many Australians have expressed a lot of interest in this. Senators need to have a clear and open path and plenty of time to examine the bills. There are 11 bills, not just one bill, so we strongly suggest that the Senate adopts the amendment and moves the reporting date of the committee to 11 August 2009, which will give ample opportunity for the committee to do its work properly and then for the Senate to consider the committee’s report when it next meets after the winter recess. This will give the government plenty of time to make any decisions it needs to after the committee has reported, because the government itself does not want to implement this until well into 2011.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-05-14,"—On behalf of the opposition, can I just put a few markers in the ground. Sure, this issue has been inquired into at some great length by the Senate. As a result of those inquiries and examinations, Senator Wong’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation has been junked. We are now looking at Mr Combet’s legislation because the Prime Minister himself was forced to put somebody else into the ministry as a parliamentary secretary to prop up this failing minister. Her legislation was such a failure that the government itself has junked it. It is now in the rubbish bin.

Senator Cameron interjecting—

—I know why Senator Cameron is interjecting. It is because day after day of these committee hearings Senator Cameron championed the legislation, saying how good it was and how it had to get through the parliament. He has now been totally humiliated by the Prime Minister saying, ‘The legislation is that bad we are going to junk it and, what is more, we are going to delay the scheme’s introduction by a further 12 months.’
So we have another suite of legislation—11 bills in all—and this government, who were brought into power saying that they would use the Senate responsibly and properly and allow things to be analysed, are now saying, ‘Let’s have a very quick turnaround on this legislation. We do not want an extensive Senate inquiry.’ Methinks I know why they do not want that extensive Senate inquiry. It is because they fear that the Combet model may well go the way of the Wong model of legislation—that is, end up in the rubbish bin because it is so fatally flawed.
Let us make no mistake about this. When Professor Garnaut himself appeared before one of the Senate committees to talk about the legislation, do you know what he had to admit? It was that he has not had time to look at the legislation. If someone like Professor Garnaut, who was allegedly the architect of the flawed Wong model, did not have enough time, surely it is acceptable to say for the Combet model now that we might want some people to actually look at it and consider it?
Senator Wong went on this great little excursion talking about who was, who was not and who might be expressing some concerns about the science in relation to climate change. That is completely and utterly irrelevant to the reason her legislation was junked by her own Prime Minister. She can talk about everybody else but the issue here this morning is that her legislation has been junked, Mr Combet’s legislation is now before us and the Senate has a right to look at that in some considerable detail. To ask for a deferral of some two months for further and proper consideration should cause no problems for any senator who is interested in the role of the Senate being used to its full extent.
When is Copenhagen? It is later this year—November or December. Even if the Senate were to start debating this in August-September, there would be sufficient time prior to Copenhagen. In a very rare convergence of my views and those of Greenpeace, Greenpeace have said what a ludicrous proposition it is to put forward your targets in domestic legislation, set them down in concrete, and then to go overseas and try to negotiate and bargain. Everybody knows your starting and finishing position because you have already legislated it domestically. You has shown all your cards and you have lost all your negotiating powers. Even Greenpeace acknowledges that. Anybody would know that. And you would have thought the person allegedly most skilled in matters of foreign affairs, the Prime Minister himself, Mr Rudd, would have known it as well. Yet the government continue with this nonsense mantra that somehow the legislation has to be passed because of Copenhagen.
I say to the government: you have now broken your election promise in relation to the introduction of this emissions trading scheme. You have broken it because you must have known—or you now know; reality has mugged you—that you cannot introduce it with a commencement date in 2010. That is exactly what we said during the last election campaign, and the high and mighty Mr Rudd, ‘Mr Morality’ himself, said, ‘This is a high moral issue—in fact, the most important moral issue this country faces—and the scheme has to come in in 2010.’ All of a sudden, the morals are out the back door, along with good manners and everything else with this government, and we can now apparently delay this issue of great morality for another 12 months or more.
If it is not to start for an extra 12 months or more, that puts them into the timetable that John Howard and the coalition said would be the responsible timetable during the last election campaign. Labor have now adopted it. Rather than admitting they got it wrong—they got their model wrong, they got their legislation wrong—Senator Wong comes in here and tries to obfuscate. The simple facts are these: Labor tried to rush a scheme. They now know they can no longer rush it. In their rush, they put forward a flawed piece of legislation. The Prime Minister himself has recognised it. Labor have junked it. They have called in Mr Combet to prop up this ailing minister. He has put forward legislation, only tabled today. I have not seen it as yet. There are 11 separate pieces of legislation.
We are in budget week. I think most senators next week will be fully employed preparing for Senate estimates, which then go for a fortnight, taking us well into the month of June. When on earth would a proper inquiry be undertaken for these 11 bills, reporting by 15 June? It is treating the Senate with contempt, and we as a Senate have a duty and an obligation to the people of Australia to ensure that this legislation is properly examined. The reason they want to rush it is not because of Copenhagen but that they are so concerned that proper examination would mean that they might have to junk the Combet model, just as they had to junk the Wong model. We believe in proper Senate scrutiny of this legislation and I fully support the excellent amendment moved by my friend and colleague Senator Parry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-05-14,"—Delaying the reporting date on this issue to August this year is fair enough. We have had the claim that Malcolm Turnbull is crab-walking on this. I can tell you that Mr Rudd makes Mr Turnbull look like Rudolph Nureyev.
—Who?
—Mr Rudd is Rudolph Nureyev. This is the man who has more pirouettes, more turns on this issue than one could ever display. I watched him last night. Maybe he was giving us a display of it last night with his little jink in front of the camera. ‘Rudd’ is short for Rudolph Nureyev. He is the archetypal policy dancer on the ETS. Do you know why he is doing it? He is doing it because he wants to jump the consequences over an election. He wants to jump the consequences over the possibility of a double dissolution in going to the people. The reason he wants to do that is that he knows full well that the workers in Labor Party seats will be the ones that lose their jobs over this. It will be the people of Mackay, it will be the people of Gladstone, it will be the people of Illawarra and it will be the people of the Hunter Valley. It will be the people that the Labor Party has deserted. The working families of Australia are being deserted by the Labor Party. That is what it is all about. You can go to Copenhagen, to Disneyland—wherever you like—but the position of the National Party on this will be quite clear: to understand the word ‘no’.
Those opposite talk about certainty. I will give you certainty. How is ‘no’ for certainty? ‘No’ is a very certain word; it is very easy to understand. You talk about arguing for a position. It is an amorphous, nebulous concept of this bumper sticker morality which has become the ETS scheme. The answer is no. We cannot put this up at the expense of Australian working families. We cannot start on this banal attempt to sole-handedly lead the world into some sunny, environmental upland, which is what Mr Rudd wants to do. It is all a part of the self-glorification of our Prime Minister as he attempts to become—I don’t know—president of the UN or whatever his grander ambitions are after he leaves this place. His own party have pulled him into gear.
I have never seen a more uncomfortable person than Minister Wong. She looked more uncomfortable than Mr Rudd after he lost his hair dryer. She was hung out to dry by her own Prime Minister. After all the wonderful, glorious statements about saving the world, he marched her out to the front of the building to say what we have already said—only they say no now; we say no, full stop. The reason we need an extension for this inquiry is so that we can drag this mangy cat back out again and all have another look at it, so that we can pull out the entrails of this chicken and divine from them over the table of the Senate, so that we can look into it and say, ‘What exactly are we trying to do here?’ Apparently, Australia is going to cool the planet—single-handedly. The Knights Templar are led by Prime Minister Rudd, only he is not really leading; he is just hanging people out to dry, including the minister.
We have had the Senate Economics Committee inquiry, we have had the fuel and energy inquiry and we have another inquiry going on now. We have 11 pieces of legislation coming back in here and they are going to try to push it on through. They want to do that because they do not want proper examination. The period that we have to look at something that could turn the economy of our nation upside down is contemporaneous with budget estimates. And they are saying that that is respect for the Senate! I acknowledge that the Greens will have an entirely different view. But I imagine that they too want the capacity to really drill down into this legislation. The Labor Party are trying to be sneaky and tricky as they walk over the future prosperity of regional Australia and of the working families of Australia—for what? It is an attempt to go forward with some bumper sticker morality for inner suburbia. But don’t worry about the people of Mackay, don’t worry about the people in Gladstone—

Senator Cameron interjecting—

—Don’t worry about your workers in the Illawarra and your workers in the Hunter Valley. No, don’t worry about them. You put on your Giorgio Armani suit and go and do the light fandango at a coffee shop near wherever you live, Senator Cameron, as you morph into this new type of Senator Cameron—this new type of environmentally sensitive, soft, wonderful, marshmallow Senator Cameron. Where has the steel from your spine gone? You have changed, Senator Cameron. You have changed since you have been here. You have changed into something else. And Mr Rudd has changed too.
So we have here the Rudolf Nureyev school of political pirouettes. We see this exercise from Mr Rudd as he pushes Minister Wong out the front door to hang herself out to dry on a piece of legislation that is an absolute debacle. Now they are trying to say, ‘Well, it’s a debacle now, so if we let it mature for 12 months then it will somehow get better.’ A silly idea now is a silly idea in 12 months time—it is just a silly idea that is one year old. We in the National Party are as one. We will be making sure that the entrails of this festering chicken are brought out on the table so we can once more take it apart piece by piece—through Labor seat, by Labor seat, by Labor seat, by Labor seat, by Labor seat. Then we will see what the political Rudolf Nureyev of policy pirouettes does next—the illustrious, the formidable and the ever-changing Mr Kevin Rudd.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-05-14,"—I have to say that I have not heard quite so many cliches rolled together in one speech in a very long time—from the entrails of a festering chicken through to marshmallows, steel in the spine and all manner of things. Entertaining as that might be, I would like to return to the substance of the matter before the Senate—which is an amendment to change the reporting date in the motion put forward by the government. I rise today to say that I will be supporting the reference of the bills relating to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to the economics committee for inquiry and I support the reporting date of 15 June, which is the day that the climate policy committee, which I worked with the coalition to establish, will also be reporting.
The fact of the matter is that between now and June 15 June the matters to be looked at are the changes to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that have been announced since the Senate economics committee reported previously. They relate to some very specific matters. They relate to the government’s decisions to: delay the commencement of the scheme for one year; establish a $10 price for the following year; and give further compensation to the trade exposed sectors, as shown in the budget this week, of $1.1 billion out of the public purse for extended compensation. This is the first time we have really seen a figure for the extent to which this scheme will not be self funding and the extent to which it will dip into the public purse for the next five years for that $1.1 billion—and that is just the beginning, I suspect, but that is a matter to be looked at. The other issue is the target. The government has changed its previous target range of five to 15 per cent to five to 25 per cent conditional upon a number of matters which the government has specified.
The government have said that the targets must be underpinned by mechanisms to meet them, and I will look forward to hearing the government explain how they will achieve a 25 per cent reduction on 2000 levels. Given the current parameters of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the extent of compensation and so on, I cannot see how in the eight years between 2012 and 2020 that 25 per cent reduction will be achieved under the CPRS. I can only assume that if the government did commit to that and if by some miraculous outcome the rest of the world agreed to the conditions—and I do not believe the government itself thinks they will ever be agreed to, but let us assume they were—then the government is meaning to buy in the rest of the commitment from overseas at-again-a huge cost. I am very interested to know about that, but that will come out in the Senate committee report. Those matters are going to be looked at by the Senate economics committee and by the climate policy committee. I think that reporting on 15 June, before the next session, is within the time frame that the government established at the beginning of this year. Anyone taking any notice of the projected timetable for government legislation would have noted that on no other piece of legislation have we had a clearer timetable established by the government for a very long period of time. It is not my intention to delay the legislation.
I have to say, having listened to the contribution from Senator Joyce, that, when you have already made your mind up as emphatically as he has—whether it is dancing with Nureyev, playing with marshmallows, looking at the fermenting entrails of chickens or all of that combined that leads you to you a ‘no’—why would you want longer to investigate something? You have already indicated to the Senate that, come what may, no matter what, in no uncertain terms whatsoever, the answer is no. So the answer of ‘no’ should be available on 15 June as well as in August or whatever date the coalition is putting forward.
I think the reality of the coalition’s position here in terms of a different date comes down to two things. Firstly, it is to avoid a trigger for a double dissolution and, secondly, it is to avoid a split in the coalition because if the legislation is put forward in June as expected then Malcolm Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, if he were to choose to support the legislation, would be seen to have a split in the Senate and would lose control of his party. So it is clearly in the coalition’s interests to put this as late in the year as possible. That would suit the coalition because it wishes to avoid a public split on a major piece of legislation like this. To me that is clearly the main reason behind the delay. The other thing is that, as we all know, for a trigger for a double dissolution you need three months between a piece of legislation coming in and it coming in again and being defeated. If the government was hoping to go to a double dissolution on the climate change legislation then it needs to get it into the Senate and have a decision made on that in June in order to be able to bring it back and be able to go to an October or November election before Copenhagen.
So let’s be very realistic about what is going on here. The reasons the coalition is putting up for delay have nothing to do with further scrutiny of these bills; they have much more to do with holding the coalition together and avoiding triggers. Senator Joyce has said nothing that would persuade me to the contrary on that. Also, Senator Joyce said by way of interjection earlier that he believed climate change was real but that there was nothing you could do about it. That indicates that he does not believe that human activity has any contribution to make. Otherwise, he would understand that you can do something about it by stopping carbon dioxide emissions going to atmosphere. You can make a significant reduction in carbon dioxide going to atmosphere through industrial processes and all the other means by which it is happening. I would say to Senator Joyce that stopping the logging in the Florentine in Tasmania would stop massive amounts of carbon dioxide going to atmosphere. Indeed, stopping the regeneration burns across Tasmania this autumn would stop massive amounts of carbon dioxide going to atmosphere. So there is plenty we can do. If you believe climate change is real, there is plenty we can do, and we could be doing it tomorrow.
I have seen no evidence of a genuine commitment to deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the urgent time frame that is required. The IPCC has said that global emissions must peak and come down at 2015. They must peak and then come down. The scientists are telling us we are already beyond 450 parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent. The Prime Minister has said that 450 parts per million CO equivalent is in Australia’s interests. I remind the Senate that 450 parts per million gives us only a 50 per cent chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change—that is, defined as an increase of more than two degrees—and the scientists are saying that they are not persuaded by that any longer. They are saying we should be aiming for much lower. They are saying we should be aiming for something like 350 parts per million. That shows that 450 parts per million is not the target but the absolute minimum aim. We should in fact have a much lower target as a global ambition.
Having said that, we do not have time to delay the implementation of the scheme another year. We do not have time to start slowly. The assumption that you can finish strongly assumes that there is no urgent time frame for stabilisation. I notice one of the government’s conditions on the 25 is stabilisation at 2020—which, according to the IPCC, is too late. We can have these discussions in the economics committee and in the climate policy committee, and people who are interested enough to be there can ask those questions and have those discussions at that time. I will not be supporting a delay in the reporting date of these committees. The matters that need to be discussed are there. I note that in today’s paper there is a reference to ‘technical matters’ that the government wants to sort out. ‘Technical matters’ have turned out to be more compensation for the coal industry. I want to put the government on notice: that is not a technical matter; that is yet more compensation. It should be signalled clearly before the Senate economics committee or the climate policy committee actually hold their inquiries. That is not technical; that is a yet bigger burden on the public purse.
In conclusion, I would say this. If you really aspire to dealing with climate change then you do not lock in a weak target until 2020 and leave the Australian budget and therefore the Australian people vulnerable to huge compensation payouts to the industries that caused the problem in the first place. The reason the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group now want this legislation passed is that they know that the big polluters and the big emitters in Australia—the coal industry in Australia—are never going to get a better deal than the one on the table now. The Business Council of Australia—the members of which are the Liberal Party’s biggest donors—will be on the phone to the Leader of the Opposition saying: ‘Pass this, because we’ll never get a better deal. If this doesn’t get through before Copenhagen, the situation will only get worse as the rest of the world will call for deeper cuts and faster and more stringent action.’ That is why the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia want it passed. They want it locked in for 2020 so that their members—from the public purse—get paid. The polluters will get paid every time between now and 2020 there is action taken that is beyond the scope of the scheme as it is currently.
That is why they want certainty. They want certainty about the extent of the compensation; they want to know that no change will occur without them being massively compensated. Locking in a low target for such a long time is one major structural weakness of this scheme. It is a disingenuous 25, because I do not believe that even the government thinks that the rest of the world would possibly agree to the conditions. I note that, when this was announced, the government emphasised time and time again the conditionality of the 25 in order to signal to the big polluters that there is a high probability—almost a certainty—that nobody will agree to Australia’s conditions. It is setting up quite an interesting debate for the next short while. There is no group of people in this parliament more committed to urgent action on climate change than the Greens. But the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is an economic tool to give effect to an environmental aspiration—that is, stopping catastrophic climate change. If an economic tool does not deliver environmental effectiveness or economic efficiency then you have to ask yourself: what is the point in putting it in place?
Environmental effectiveness is the priority for the Greens, and environmental effectiveness comes from the science. The science tells us that deep cuts by 2020 are required. We do not have generations to go; we only have a matter of years. And in fact everyone in this parliament has a personal responsibility in terms of making deep cuts. Incrementalism will not get us there. Half a bridge will not get us there. Deep cuts are what will get us there, and what will get us there, in an Australian and global context, is for Australia to put 40 per cent on the table in Copenhagen as a goodwill statement towards a global agreement. But what Australia will do, regardless of what the rest of the world does, is put 25 per cent on the table. That is the Bali negotiating range. China has said that they expect developed countries—annex 1 countries—to put on the table offers at the top end of the 25 to 40 per cent range. The developing world has, for some time, felt a failure of the annex 1 countries to act in good faith on the basis of the original Kyoto bargain—and indeed the other climate negotiations in recent years—and I do not believe it is going to see Australia’s current approach as being a good faith offer in relation to what is necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change.
I cannot put to the Senate more strongly the emergency that we have on our hands and to contrast the response of the Prime Minister to the global financial crisis with his response to the climate crisis. The global financial crisis saw the Prime Minister rushing to the United States and Europe—rushing to meetings all over the place—to talk about what could be done on the global financial crisis. We have not seen the same urgency in relation to climate change. We have not seen the same commitment in terms of dollars. We had no money to spend before the global financial crisis; now we have billions. In fact, millions has become such an outdated figure it just seems a meaningless thing. If you want to spend money now, you have to do it in billions. But there were not billions to spend on structural adjustment on climate change. There are still not billions to be spent on getting Australia off its addiction to coal. But it seems to be that there are plenty of dollars, billions of dollars available, to continue to support the coal industry.
The budget this week is underpinned by the assumption that coal will be back, that the boom times will come again and that Australia’s future prosperity will be underpinned by a resources boom of the future. Hence we see the billions going into the Hunter Valley railway line and the port expansion, into ongoing support for the coal industry and into carbon capture and storage—which is simply legitimising ongoing coal mining. Today there is a major marine conference in Indonesia that is talking about the disaster of the oceans and the collapse of the Coral Triangle. And where is the Prime Minister? He is turning a sod in the Hunter Valley for the new coal railway line. That gives you a sense of where this Prime Minister’s priorities are. He may talk about climate change but his priority is the maintenance of coal and coal exports. He cannot see beyond coal. You have to look at those compensation provisions and ask yourself what happened to the principle of polluter pays. What happened to that principle in Australia? We have now got to the principle that the polluter is paid, and is paid by the taxpayer. We are all going to pay higher energy bills around Australia because the government has exempted the big energy users and emitters from the Renewable Energy Target. Everybody else is going to pay more because of that, not to mention those provisions of compensation, and that is why the scheme is economically inefficient.
Nevertheless, I believe that the hearings we are going to have between now and 15 June will shed some more light on those extra billion dollars to be spent on the big emitters, and we will be very interested to see how Australia is going to get to its 25 per cent given the mechanisms, the delay, and the weak carbon price. We will also see whether there was ever the intent towards transformation in the Australian economy, because delaying a year and setting a $10 price is no signal for transformation. The biggest signal for Australia to pick up on today is the Prime Minister turning that sod for the coal railway in the Hunter Valley. If you want to see where Kevin Rudd wants to take Australia, look at that and recognise that this scheme is simply an economic tool. But it is not an efficient economic tool nor is it an environmentally effective tool, as I am sure the hearings for both of these committees between now and 15 June will demonstrate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2009-05-14,"—I do support the extension of the timing. We spent three weeks listening to evidence in the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy in order to scrutinise one bill. I understand there are 11 bills being put into the House this morning. As Senator Joyce has said, yes, the National Party is totally committed on this. Nevertheless, we reserve the right to expose further flaws in the bill. Even the people who are not as committed as Senator Joyce and me in the National Party have the right to understand what is wrong with these bills. We will put the spotlight on them, let people give evidence and have a look, and then bring it back. So I fully support the extension of time.
I want to pick up on some of the contribution made by Senator Wong. I do not normally feel sorry for Senator Wong. I think she does a job. But she had to stand next to the Prime Minister the other night. He had already told the Australian people that if we did not act now we were going to be swamped by seas and burnt to death and that it would never rain again. And Senator Wong, in reply to questions from me, has continued that message in the Senate time after time. But I felt sorry for Senator Wong there; she looked shattered. She did not know where to go. The Prime Minister completely pulled the rug out from under her. So, Senator Wong, you were dumped.
Then they said, ‘Senator Wong is not cutting through; let’s get Mr Combet and we’ll run him on as a reserve.’ He has gone out and he has tried to buy off industry after industry with little bits of bait here and there, but I do not think he is achieving anything, because delaying these bills for a year is not going to do anything. It is just going to give a reprieve for a year.
I sat on a committee with Senator Wong and Senator Cameron, and I recall that only one person, one manufacturer, Origin Energy—they have a few wind farms but really are a retailer and can pass the cost on—actually supported this legislation. They are the only ones who actually manufacture anything. I listened to the paper industry in Tasmania, I listened to the zinc industry in Tasmania, and they were totally opposed to this climate change legislation as it has been put up by the government. I went to Western Australia and I listened to the gas industry, and I listened to primary industries. They were totally opposed. We went to Melbourne—to the steel industry, the paper industry and the mining industry. Every industry in Australia is opposed to this legislation, because they know it is going to cost them jobs. They know it is going to wipe them out. Some of the industries have said, ‘It will not particularly worry us cost-wise. We’ll just turn the elevators around and instead of exporting we’ll import. We’ve got the silos that we export out of. We’ll just close our manufacturing down. We won’t do it immediately; there is no certainty, and we won’t spend any more money on these plants and equipment. As they run down we will just import more and, as the equipment gets old and obsolete, we will import more.’ Senator Wong, I commend to you the evidence that people gave. They are not doing it because they do not want climate change or because they want to oppose it but because they know what the legislation is going to do to their business.
There is something missing in this debate, and I cannot understand it. I can understand where the Greens are coming from, and that is legitimate. I can understand where the National Party is coming from, and I understand where the Liberal Party is coming from. But what is missing in this debate is this: why is the Labor Party ratting on their blue-collar workers? We have been told by every industry in Australia that this is going to cost jobs. We have been told by the dairy industry that it is going to cost the dairy farmers $9,000 per farm—that is just for the dairying; the price will go up when the cows have to be slaughtered. We are also told by the dairy processors, ‘It is going to impact on our process workers.’ We have been told by every industry, ‘Our process workers are going to suffer.’ In the mining industry, 10,000 jobs are going to go. Those are blue-collar jobs. Why are you selling those people out? And why do you take their union fees? Why do you go out and say, ‘Pay your $400, $500 or $600; we’re looking after you?’ You are selling them out. You are taking their money and you are selling them out.

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—Even that, Senator Joyce. It is going to have an impact on the people who live in the leafy suburbs too, because someone else is filling the ships that take the export product out. That is done in the mining industry and in the primary industries, and the people who live in the leafy suburbs are carrying the export load.
I suggest that the reason the Labor Party do not want to extend this legislation is that there is, in the blue-collar areas, an awakening. They are saying: ‘Hang on a moment. What’s this going to do for me? How am I going to live? How’s my family going to live? What am I going to do? I’m a miner. It’s what I know. I’m a forester. I am a process worker in a timber mill. I am not skilled in any other way to make a living. How am I going to feed my family? How am I going to look after my kids? What am I going to do?’ That is dawning on these people now. You saw it a couple of days ago in the Riverina, when a parrot took preference over workers. The parrot was put on a higher pedestal than 800 jobs. You cannot win without those blue-collar workers, and you cannot win without the Greens.
Your moderates in your party—the doctors, the wives, the teachers, the academics—cannot get you over the line, and you are playing Russian roulette. And you do not want another three months for the awakening to go further out there, because it is happening now. It is happening on our polling; it must be happening on your polling. People are saying: ‘I want a job. The global crisis is my main concern. I want to feed my kids. I want to look after my house.’ There is an awakening out there. This should be called the Tanner and Plibersek legislation. You know that without Greens preferences you cannot win. You have never tried to fight the Greens back. You have encouraged them and now they are dictating the terms to you. You have taken a tiger by the tail and you cannot get off its back. Their demands will increase and increase and increase. You can never satisfy the demands of the green lobby. They cannot be satisfied. You are on the tiger’s back and you cannot get off.
At the same time we got attacked from the Right. We defended our position and fought back. You never did. That was with Pauline Hanson—you never did. You encouraged the Greens and said: ‘All right. We’ll let them live. We’ll even throw them a few bones.’ They have got to the point now that they are controlling you. You have let them build up to the point where you are being led around by the nose by the Greens.
—You’re telling me I never did anything about Pauline Hanson? Watch your mouth. How dare you!
—You might not like it—
—Don’t you ever accuse me about racism.
—I am not lecturing you about racism. I never mentioned the word racism. I said the Right.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Order!
—You never fought the Left back. That is what I am saying. You never stood up to the Greens—never. And now they have devoured you. Now they are leading you around and you are in a crisis. Whether you realise it or not you are in a huge crisis because you cannot keep the blue-collar workers uninformed. They are becoming more and more informed, and you can see it in our polling and your polling. You may not like this, Senator Wong, but you are the fall guy. You are the guy who has been set up to dud the blue-collar workers. You might not like it, but you are.
We are opposed to this bill because we cannot see it doing anything on its own.
—Don’t bother putting it to an inquiry then!
—We will put it to an inquiry. We are opposed to it. Of course we are opposed to it. Why do I think it should go to an inquiry? Because, when I sat there for three weeks listening to the evidence, I found out more and more why this bill should not go through. It even gets to the point that you cannot even dump your rubbish without incurring a cost. The more you listen to it, the more stupid it becomes. You cannot put your rubbish in a rubbish dump without incurring a penalty. I never knew that until I listened at the inquiry, and there were many other things that I learned but they only made me realise how stupid and silly this was.
If I were asked to design a piece of legislation that would wreck the Australian economy, that would put people out of work, that would close industry down, I do not believe I could have designed a better program. That is not my view; that is the view of every major person who is involved in industry. I said it yesterday and I will repeat it: one of the directors of the Reserve Bank—and he must have got there because he had influence with the Liberals or the Nationals or presumably the Labor Party—said that Australia will survive a global crisis but it may not survive an ETS. That is someone who has credibility. He is also a director of BlueScope or OneSteel. We heard from both companies, and they said they could not survive with this. And now you have Combet going around offering a bet here and trying to pick the industries off one by one, saying: ‘Here are a few more certificates. We’ll give you another five per cent. We’ll extend it for a year.’ As one person—I forget his name—said, ‘You can’t put lipstick on a pig because it will still look like a pig with lipstick,’ and that is exactly what this bill is going to look like: a pig with lipstick.
It is wrong. The Business Council of Australia have sold their people out and they know it. They are going through a huge conflict at the moment. A lot of people are leaving. A lot of people are saying that they are being sold out and they are in an awkward position. They have the rent seekers on one side who know they can get a quid if these certificates are exchanged and sold around, bought in from overseas. There is a quid in it for them. But who pays? I will tell you who pays—the working families pay. Working families are going to pay for this indiscretion. I am certain—and I have never been more certain in 26, going on 27, years in this place—that this is the worst piece of legislation I have ever seen produced by the Labor Party, and I have seen some stinkers. But this is the very worst.
I cannot believe Senator Cameron. I would have thought he would stand up for the working man. He has completely sold out. I do not know whether he has been brainwashed—although I do not think he is that silly—or whether he is being a good trooper and doing what he has been told to do. But I say to him: you do not have to prostitute yourself. You got here on the Labor vote, on the blue-collar vote, and you are not standing up for them. In fact, the only people who are standing up for them are the coalition. They are waking up fast, and you want to get this legislation through quickly before they do wake up. But I think you have left it too late. They are waking up now. They are waking up in Gladstone, where the cement and aluminium industries are. They know their jobs are on the line. They are waking up in Rockhampton. The abattoir workers in Rockhampton know. The miners in the Bowen Basin know. The word is out: ‘These people are trading our jobs for Greens preferences, and we do not like it. We feel betrayed. We only have our vote to protect ourselves and we will use that vote.’

Senator Wong interjecting—
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-05-14,"—I hear the minister encouraging me to speak, so thank you, Minister. Regrettably I have an important meeting at midday, so should anyone else want to follow me I will only be nine minutes. I want to support what Senator Boswell just said. He and I sat on the Select Committee on Climate Policy, which was looking into this legislation. I was also involved in Senator Mathias Cormann’s Select Committee on Fuel and Energy, which was looking into the same issue. I have come to the conclusion, from watching the Labor members on those committees and from watching the approach of the government, that the government desperately want us to defeat this legislation. They do not want to have to face the workers that Senator Boswell spoke about if they have cost them their jobs, but they do want to be able go to their green constituency and their Greens second preference voters in the capital cities and say, ‘We tried to do something but the nasty coalition, Senator Xenophon and the Greens all conspired to knock the legislation off.’ That is what I think the Labor Party want to be able to say. They know, as Senator Boswell says, that this legislation will cost the jobs of workers.
I live in North Queensland, not far from the Bowen Basin coalfields. I know the number of people who work in those areas and the wealth they generate. I also know the mortgages that they have run up in buying investment properties because they have good jobs in the Bowen Basin coalfields. Those people’s jobs will be at real risk, and they know it. Regrettably the ACTU gave very toady evidence to the committee. The ACTU put Labor in government and they want to keep them there, so they will roll over to help the government get through any legislation they bring on board. But the ACTU could not answer the questions about what would happen to the jobs of their members, to the working families of Australia that we heard so much about from Mr Rudd prior to the last election.
It distresses me that what the Labor Party, supposedly the party of the workers—they have long since lost that status, but they still maintain the pretence of looking after workers—are going to do with this legislation is simply export jobs offshore. In the coal area they will go to Indonesia, Colombia and South Africa, places where the people who own the Australian mines already have other mines. They will not invest in Australia when we have an impost that the rest of the world does not have. It is a double whammy: we will lose investment in Australia and the jobs of working families in the Bowen Basin coalfields, but it will not make one iota of difference to the carbon emissions of the planet. Emissions will simply move from Australia to Indonesia, Colombia or South Africa, where they will be even worse. I do not want to speak for them—they are all old enough and able enough to speak for themselves—but it was quite clear that the Labor members on both committees that I sat on in relation to emissions trading share that view. It would be different if you were going to do something about emissions trading or the changing climate of the world, but it will not do anything because the emissions will simply be exported offshore, and in the course of that we will lose jobs.
This is not just in the Bowen Basin coalfields—it is in Gladstone, Mackay, the aluminium industries and the cement industries, and we heard evidence from all of them. In fact we heard evidence from literally hundreds of people. We started at eight o’clock in the morning and finished at six o’clock at night. Some of the green groups would come in and oppose it for a different reason, but witness after witness pointed out the absolute stupidity of this legislation—the jobs it will cost and the loss to Australia’s economy. I recall that in regional Australia the dairy industry gave evidence that, although it does not apply directly to them until at least 2015, this emissions trading scheme will mean a loss of between $6,000 and $9,000 per producer in their industry. We also heard evidence from the Thiess meatworks in Rockhampton which clearly indicated that 400 jobs would be lost in that city.
I wonder what the Labor member for Capricornia, Ms Kirsten Livermore, is doing about that. Is she acquiescing in the loss of 400 jobs from working families in the Rockhampton area? I wonder what Mr Bidgood, the Labor member for Dawson, is doing about all the jobs that will be lost by working families in the Mackay region of Queensland. What are those Labor members doing? I know that they have been muzzled and gagged. What is Mr Trevor doing for all of the jobs that will be lost in his electorate, centred on Gladstone? There will be huge job losses. While we and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, were in Gladstone we heard daily announcements of job losses in that city, but not a murmur from the Labor member supposedly representing the interests of the working families in the Gladstone area. Those three members in particular have been gagged by the minister or by Mr Rudd and are not able to raise their voices.
I hope that some of the Labor senators, who clearly know this is a dog of a piece of legislation, will have the courage to yet again roll the minister in her push to destroy Australia without any benefit for the changing climate of the world—and that is the real problem. I know Senator Wong was humiliated by Mr Rudd when he did that partial backflip and put it off for a year. I only hope—and I do not mean the minister any personal ill will—that she is again rolled and that the Labor caucus will eventually say to her: enough is enough. If it were going to do anything about the changing climate of the world or emissions of carbon into the atmosphere then perhaps you could grin and bear it—and I only say ‘perhaps’. However, when it will not do that but destroy the jobs and the economies of many parts of rural and regional Australia, it is just not worth contemplating.
As we were told at the committee, modelling done in relation to rural and regional Australia has not seen the light of day. Why? We can only guess, but I think we can guess pretty intelligently, that the modelling that has been done for the New South Wales government demonstrates quite clearly that this is a dog of a piece of legislation when it comes to rural and regional Australia, and it is a dog of a piece of legislation when it comes to the Bowen Basin coalfields. I talk about that locality in a generic way but there are towns, people, houses, livelihoods and schools there which will all disappear if this legislation goes through in the way desired by the minister and Mr Rudd. There are places like Moranbah, Glenden, Tieri, Middlemount, Clermont, Blackwater and Moura, all of which are hotbeds of unionism. They mounted a fabulous campaign at the last election—and good luck to them; they did it very well—but they are eventually starting to wake up to the fact that this government they put in is hell-bent on costing them their jobs. I would imagine that it will not be long before the grassroots membership of the unions realise that their union bosses, their union leaders, hand in hand with the Labor Party hierarchy, are doing them in the bottom big time. They will work that out. It has been slow, but I think they are eventually starting to realise that this Labor government, which they worked so hard to get elected, is really a government that does not have their interests at heart and will cost them not only their jobs but their houses, their mortgages and their way of life—all to no avail.
At the very least, this legislation needs to be put off until after Copenhagen. The minister, Mr Rudd and—I do not want to malign them—some of those who clearly followed the Labor line for political reasons seem to think that, when we get to Copenhagen, everyone else in the world will say, ‘Gee, Australia’s doing this so we had better follow.’ Again, we had witness after qualified witness who said, ‘Much as we like Australia, much as we think we’re pretty good’—and we are pretty good—’we’re very small players in the international diplomacy field.’ I refer you to the Senate committee Hansard which shows very good evidence given by a consultant who was formerly associated with ABARE. Have a look at that, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, and you will see that, at least, we should put this legislation off until we see what the rest of the world does. If the minister is so confident that the rest of the world—China, India, the United States, Russia and, might I add, Colombia, South Africa and Indonesia—will take on a 25 per cent target, yes, let us go for it. If they take on a 40 per cent target, perhaps we should seriously consider it. But we will do that when they do it. Otherwise, all we will do is export Australian working family jobs to other countries for no benefit whatsoever to the changing climate of the world. Tell me: what sort of a government would promote this sort of dog-type legislation? I apologise for dogs. This legislation is infinitely worse than any mangy dingo you would find anywhere in Australia. It is stupid legislation and I would certainly hope that the Senate, and perhaps the government, will take the initiative and delay it at least until after Copenhagen and then have another look at it in the light of what the rest of the world is going to do.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-05-14,"—What a visceral debate this has been. I think it started off with Senator Wong taunting Senator Bernardi while he was in the chair. I thought that was cruel and unusual punishment, and I think she acknowledges that. Senator Bernardi could not respond and was gagged, in a sense, by being in the chair. Thankfully I will never be in the chair, so that is something I do not have to worry about. To me, the issue is one of process—that is, not the whys and wherefores of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—
—Correct.
—Senator Parry agrees with me; he may disagree with the next thing I am going to say. It is this: there are two parallel inquiries—in fact, some would say three parallel inquiries because of the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy, ably chaired by Senator Cormann. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy. The climate policy committee made a decision to report on the changes announced recently by the government by 15 June. I supported that and, as I understand it, the coalition did not object to that. On that basis, I thought it was quite reasonable for the economics committee to have a similar reporting date, because we have already looked at the architecture of this particular scheme and we have already looked at alternative schemes in relation to the scheme design and alternative approaches to tackle the, I believe, very serious problem of carbon pollution. The government is not putting up a totally new architecture of a scheme; it is putting up different targets and a different compensation package. So in a sense it has not gone back to square one; it has changed targets and changed compensation mechanisms in respect of its amended scheme. I would have thought it is not unreasonable for the economics committee to deal with that by 15 June. That is why, in terms of process, I believe it is not unreasonable to tackle it in the next month.
In the context of the merits of the bill, that is another matter. They can be debated when these bills come to the Senate to be debated and where amendments can be considered and we can look at the merits or otherwise of the substantive bill and any amendments. The whole issue of Copenhagen is something that can be dealt with, I believe, at that time. But, in terms of the process that is already in place with respect to the economics committee and the climate policy committee, these are not amendments that go to the architecture of the scheme. We know what the architecture is because we have had a debate about that and there have been inquiries by the two committees, and I believe we ought to get on with it and then we can have a substantive debate about the merits or otherwise of this amended scheme and any amendments in the context of the debate when the bills are introduced. Therefore I support the minister’s motion.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Parry’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,18,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-05-14,"—I move:
That on the introduction of any of the following bills into the House of Representatives or any other bill that forms part of the Government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, provisions of these bills be referred immediately to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 15 June 2009, including, but not limited to the following:
Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges – Customs) Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges – Excise) Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Charges – General) Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS Fuel Credits) Bill 2009;
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS Fuel Credits) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009;
Customs Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2009;
Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2009; and
Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Household Assistance) Bill 2009.
This is a motion to refer to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee the bills which comprise the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in its entirety—with the one exception of the forestry components, which will commence slightly later.
The subject matter of the bills that are proposed to be referred has been a matter of consideration and inquiry for a long period of time. I want to take the Senate through this so that we can be clear about what is occur-ring. In February last year the government set out its approach, consistent with our election commitment, to introduce a trading scheme—the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The release of the green paper made very clear what the government’s timetable was. We had an extensive process of consideration of the green paper, which led to the decisions in December and the publication of the white paper. It is these bills which give effect to the white paper. So that is one set of processes. And I would remind senators that the green paper garnered over 1,000—I think 1,026—submissions and the CPRS draft legislation received a further 160 non-campaign submissions as well as 11,000 general responses.
In addition to the green paper and white paper consultation processes, the government also commissioned the Garnaut review. That review went through last year. It received almost 4,000 submissions and held information sessions all around the country to gain feedback—and I will come to that. Prior to that there was quite a lot of discussion by previous governments and the state and territory governments through their state and territory task forces on the design of a trading scheme.
So this has been a heavily scrutinised and considered reform that has had extensive community engagement. Just under this government there have been a green paper process—1,000 submissions; the Garnaut review—4,000 submissions; and a white paper process. In addition, the government referred the exposure draft of these bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics, which has reported. The bills which have been introduced into the other place by my colleague Mr Combet today largely reflect the content of the exposure draft but obviously there are some changes. Hence, we think it is appropriate that this go to the appropriate committee, which is the Senate economics committee, which previously dealt with the exposure draft legislation.
So if there is any suggestion that there has been insufficient scrutiny, I would say to the chamber that this has actually been one of the most scrutinised reforms, just under this term of government, that this parliament has seen. There have been extensive government processes, extensive parliamentary processes and extensive community processes which have enabled the community to engage very closely with the model that the government was putting forward. I would also make the point that, in addition to those processes, the parliament has taken a very great interest in climate policy. In fact, in the 12 months to date we believe there have been some 13 inquiries before the parliament to deal with climate change matters. Hearings relating to these inquiries have been held all over the country. We calculate that there were approximately 787 appearances before these committees. So let us be clear. Just under this government there have been a green paper process—over 1,000 submissions; the Garnaut review—4,000 submissions; public hearings held by the Garnaut review all over the country; and Senate committee processes plus 13 committee inquiries into climate change.
This is an overdue reform. It is time for action. There are those who want to delay consideration of this scheme—not because they want a better process, not because they are focused on a better outcome, but because they simply do not believe climate change is real and they simply do not want to have to make a decision to vote for or against this bill. That is the question.
—Stop trying to cover up your backflip.
—I will take that interjection. Senator Abetz accuses us of a cover-up. But we have been transparent. We have come to the Australian people and said that we want to take action on climate change, and we have set out this process. I can tell you where the cover-up is: it is on that side. It is those opposite who want to continue to delay consideration of this, not because they think it is the right thing to do, not because they think it is in the national interest, but because they cannot get a position. I want to talk for a while about what has occurred, on the opposition side of the chamber over the last few years—in fact longer than that. This issue of an emissions trading scheme has been on the public policy agenda for a very long time. In fact, those opposite might like to know—

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—I will take that interjection too. Senator Abetz said it was put on the agenda by the Howard government. It certainly was on the agenda for a long time, Senator Abetz. In fact, earlier this year was the 10th anniversary of the first report to the Howard government on the establishment of a trading scheme. I do not know what everyone else was doing 10 years ago—I certainly was not here—but you were already talking about it then. And the opposition’s position is, ‘Let’s just keep talking.’ I want to remind the opposition of a couple of things. It seems quite remarkable that Australian politics has come full circle. We seem to have a position from some members of the opposition which is at odds with former Prime Minister Howard. I remind those opposite that, in February 2007, Mr Howard said, ‘There can be no argument that greenhouse gases are having an adverse impact on the Earth’s environment.’ So I am wondering where Senator Bernardi and Senator Minchin are—oh, Senator Bernardi is in the chair, and it is bit unfair to verbal him when he is in the chair.
—We’re all here.
—And Senator Joyce and Senator Boswell are here too. It is quite remarkable. We have senators in this chamber who are more conservative on climate change than former Prime Minister Howard. Now that is an achievement. That is really an achievement. They are here and they are all here ready to talk about why we should not do anything. Let us remember, even your conservative Prime Minister took a position, even-tually, that recognised the science. So who is out of touch on this issue? It is Senators Minchin, Bernardi, Abetz, Boswell and—
—Don’t leave me out; I want to be in.
—Joyce. Senator Joyce does not want to be left out. I put you in at the end there because you are proud to be amongst those who do not agree with former Prime Minister Howard. It is interesting to actually read some of former Prime Minister Howard’s own work. It is commonly known as the Shergold report and it is the report to the then Prime Minister entitled Report of the task group on emissions trading.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—Mr Acting Deputy President, I will take Senator Abetz in a debate any time, but he keeps foaming at the mouth in this debate. He has not actually drawn breath in terms of interjections since I have been on my feet. I am sure he will have the opportunity to put his views, which are more conservative than Mr Howard’s, shortly. But he might do me the courtesy of at least drawing breath at some point during my discussion. I remind those opposite of Mr Howard’s report, which occurred while they were in government. I did not hear them at the time jumping up and down and saying that Prime Minister Howard was going to act too precipitously. I did not hear them at the time publicly saying this was going to be a dreadful thing and how appalling it was for Australia to go down this path. I would like to remind those opposite what was said in this report, which was presented in June 2007, before the election. It said:
… waiting until a truly global response emerges before imposing an emissions cap will place costs on Australia by increasing business uncertainty and delaying or losing investment. Already there is evidence that investment in key emissions-intensive industries and energy infrastructure is being deferred.
You received that advice in government two years ago, and you are still arguing a position that you do not want to give business the signal on certainty that was called for when you were in government, and that even then Prime Minister Howard took heed of. I will remind you that the task group also said:
… the Task Group has concluded that Australia should not wait … It believes that there are benefits, which outweigh the costs, in early adoption by Australia of an appropriate emissions constraint.
What have we seen since then? We have seen this extraordinary crab-walk from the other side. Frankly, the climate change troglodytes, those who simply do not believe that climate change is real, have gradually, gradually gained control of the party room. Their voices, when in government, were muted; but now, when in opposition, they have gradually pushed the opposition to a more and more extreme position on this issue. The position that is occasionally articulated by Mr Turnbull is the same position that Mr Nelson took and was, as I recall, one of the reasons you replaced him as leader, because those in the Liberal Party thought he had taken the wrong position on climate change policy. Mr Turnbull has now taken the same position. So I am not quite sure where the consistency is.
I remind those opposite also of the timetable that was proposed when they were in government, which included the passage of the legislation in 2009. That was your policy. It is interesting to note the way Mr Turnbull’s position has changed on this issue. Mr Turnbull said at the Press Club on 21 May 2008—and you should listen to this, Senator Joyce, because you will really enjoy this, particularly after your Press Club performance:
The Emissions Trading Scheme is the central mechanism to decarbonise our economy.
Do you agree with that, Senator Joyce? The fact is that Mr Turnbull used to believe in this. On 26 May, some five days later, he said:
The biggest element in the fight against climate change has to be the emissions-trading scheme …
He then started to crab-walk away from it. What is the reason for this? How do you go from having the trading scheme as the biggest element to now saying that it is not necessary at all? There is really only one explanation for that about-face and that is that he is worried about his leadership, he is worried about the numbers in the party room. He is running now an entirely different position because he is concerned about those in his party room who still think climate change is not real.
I want to go back to why we need to have this inquiry and why we want to bring it in in the June sittings, as we previously publicly and transparently indicated. It is because this is an overdue reform. We want legislation passed this year because we want to give business the certainty that they are calling for. Those opposite might not like to remember that the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group—and I know this will get Senator Boswell going—have all said they want the legislation passed this year. It seems extraordinary that those opposite could be so focused on their own internal issues that they do not listen to the calls from the community, including the business community, about the importance of giving business certainty.
The second reason why we want this passed this year is that Copenhagen is important. Australia needs to go to Copenhagen with targets that are backed by a mechanism to meet them. It is extraordinary that those on the other side say they want a global agreement in Australia’s national interest but are not prepared to ensure that we put targets on the table which are responsibly backed by a scheme to meet them. They say they want a global agreement in the national interest. Well, give the government and the negotiators the legislation that enables them to maximise that chance.
What is occurring in this place and in this debate is that the self-interest of the Leader of the Opposition is trumping the national interest. Malcolm Turnbull knows this is the right thing to do. He is trying to delay taking this into his party room. He is delaying taking a position on this because he is scared he does not have the numbers. We are seeing from the other side the self-interest and weakness of one man overriding what is in the national interest.
This is an overdue reform that has been the subject of intensive and detailed consideration by the parliament. There has been an extraordinary amount of community engagement through the Garnaut review processes. As well, people have had an opportunity to comment on the green paper. This has also been the subject of the exposure draft inquiry by the Senate and has been out for community consultation. The only reason that those opposite would argue for a delay is that they do not want to take a position on this, because some in their party room—and Senator Joyce would proudly number himself amongst them, I am sure—do not believe climate change is real. No matter how long we talk about this and no matter how much consideration is given, they do not want to vote to actually take action.
It is self-interest trumping national interest. It is time for us to engage in this reform. We want this reported on so we can commence the debate on this in the June sittings, as we said to the Australian people we would do.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,18,2
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-05-14,"—I want to draw us back to the substantive part of this debate. We are debating whether these 11 bills should be referred to a committee for examination. I move to the motion moved by Senator Wong:
Omit “15 June 2009”, substitute “11 August 2009”.
This amendment will change the date of reporting for the committee from 15 June to 11 August this year. The reason for the amendment is that in the words of Senator Wong herself, this is a very substantive suite of bills.
Senator Wong indicated there have been over 11,000 general submissions. These 11 bills were put through the House of Representatives this morning. We have not had a chance to examine any of the bills. We have not seen them. The government wants to rush this through. Why does the government want to rush this through when the government has deferred the implementation of the CPRS until well beyond 2010? We believe an extra few weeks will give the community the opportunity to make submissions and allow the Senate due process.
We also need to consider that this is budget week. Committees and senators are going to be inundated with work in examining the budget bills. This week the legislative program is not moving forward as fast as it could because of the budget. The Senate is going to need the remaining two weeks of the winter session—we have estimates in the next fortnight—to examine other bills and to finish some of the work that is already on the agenda that the government considers necessary and urgent. We, therefore, strongly suggest that the committee not report on these bills before the senators have had a chance to consider them by having examination during the winter recess.
The winter recess, as many senators know, is often used for a lot of committee work whilst the pressures of parliament do not exist. This would give ample opportunity for people who wished to make a submission to do so. This would also give ample opportunity for the committee to be ready to proceed with the inquiry. This is not just any piece of legislation; this is one of the government’s most significant pieces of legislation. Senator Wong has admitted that herself this morning. She has indicated that many Australians have expressed a lot of interest in this. Senators need to have a clear and open path and plenty of time to examine the bills. There are 11 bills, not just one bill, so we strongly suggest that the Senate adopts the amendment and moves the reporting date of the committee to 11 August 2009, which will give ample opportunity for the committee to do its work properly and then for the Senate to consider the committee’s report when it next meets after the winter recess. This will give the government plenty of time to make any decisions it needs to after the committee has reported, because the government itself does not want to implement this until well into 2011.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,18,2
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-05-14,"—On behalf of the opposition, can I just put a few markers in the ground. Sure, this issue has been inquired into at some great length by the Senate. As a result of those inquiries and examinations, Senator Wong’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation has been junked. We are now looking at Mr Combet’s legislation because the Prime Minister himself was forced to put somebody else into the ministry as a parliamentary secretary to prop up this failing minister. Her legislation was such a failure that the government itself has junked it. It is now in the rubbish bin.

Senator Cameron interjecting—

—I know why Senator Cameron is interjecting. It is because day after day of these committee hearings Senator Cameron championed the legislation, saying how good it was and how it had to get through the parliament. He has now been totally humiliated by the Prime Minister saying, ‘The legislation is that bad we are going to junk it and, what is more, we are going to delay the scheme’s introduction by a further 12 months.’
So we have another suite of legislation—11 bills in all—and this government, who were brought into power saying that they would use the Senate responsibly and properly and allow things to be analysed, are now saying, ‘Let’s have a very quick turnaround on this legislation. We do not want an extensive Senate inquiry.’ Methinks I know why they do not want that extensive Senate inquiry. It is because they fear that the Combet model may well go the way of the Wong model of legislation—that is, end up in the rubbish bin because it is so fatally flawed.
Let us make no mistake about this. When Professor Garnaut himself appeared before one of the Senate committees to talk about the legislation, do you know what he had to admit? It was that he has not had time to look at the legislation. If someone like Professor Garnaut, who was allegedly the architect of the flawed Wong model, did not have enough time, surely it is acceptable to say for the Combet model now that we might want some people to actually look at it and consider it?
Senator Wong went on this great little excursion talking about who was, who was not and who might be expressing some concerns about the science in relation to climate change. That is completely and utterly irrelevant to the reason her legislation was junked by her own Prime Minister. She can talk about everybody else but the issue here this morning is that her legislation has been junked, Mr Combet’s legislation is now before us and the Senate has a right to look at that in some considerable detail. To ask for a deferral of some two months for further and proper consideration should cause no problems for any senator who is interested in the role of the Senate being used to its full extent.
When is Copenhagen? It is later this year—November or December. Even if the Senate were to start debating this in August-September, there would be sufficient time prior to Copenhagen. In a very rare convergence of my views and those of Greenpeace, Greenpeace have said what a ludicrous proposition it is to put forward your targets in domestic legislation, set them down in concrete, and then to go overseas and try to negotiate and bargain. Everybody knows your starting and finishing position because you have already legislated it domestically. You has shown all your cards and you have lost all your negotiating powers. Even Greenpeace acknowledges that. Anybody would know that. And you would have thought the person allegedly most skilled in matters of foreign affairs, the Prime Minister himself, Mr Rudd, would have known it as well. Yet the government continue with this nonsense mantra that somehow the legislation has to be passed because of Copenhagen.
I say to the government: you have now broken your election promise in relation to the introduction of this emissions trading scheme. You have broken it because you must have known—or you now know; reality has mugged you—that you cannot introduce it with a commencement date in 2010. That is exactly what we said during the last election campaign, and the high and mighty Mr Rudd, ‘Mr Morality’ himself, said, ‘This is a high moral issue—in fact, the most important moral issue this country faces—and the scheme has to come in in 2010.’ All of a sudden, the morals are out the back door, along with good manners and everything else with this government, and we can now apparently delay this issue of great morality for another 12 months or more.
If it is not to start for an extra 12 months or more, that puts them into the timetable that John Howard and the coalition said would be the responsible timetable during the last election campaign. Labor have now adopted it. Rather than admitting they got it wrong—they got their model wrong, they got their legislation wrong—Senator Wong comes in here and tries to obfuscate. The simple facts are these: Labor tried to rush a scheme. They now know they can no longer rush it. In their rush, they put forward a flawed piece of legislation. The Prime Minister himself has recognised it. Labor have junked it. They have called in Mr Combet to prop up this ailing minister. He has put forward legislation, only tabled today. I have not seen it as yet. There are 11 separate pieces of legislation.
We are in budget week. I think most senators next week will be fully employed preparing for Senate estimates, which then go for a fortnight, taking us well into the month of June. When on earth would a proper inquiry be undertaken for these 11 bills, reporting by 15 June? It is treating the Senate with contempt, and we as a Senate have a duty and an obligation to the people of Australia to ensure that this legislation is properly examined. The reason they want to rush it is not because of Copenhagen but that they are so concerned that proper examination would mean that they might have to junk the Combet model, just as they had to junk the Wong model. We believe in proper Senate scrutiny of this legislation and I fully support the excellent amendment moved by my friend and colleague Senator Parry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,18,2
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-05-14,"—Delaying the reporting date on this issue to August this year is fair enough. We have had the claim that Malcolm Turnbull is crab-walking on this. I can tell you that Mr Rudd makes Mr Turnbull look like Rudolph Nureyev.
—Who?
—Mr Rudd is Rudolph Nureyev. This is the man who has more pirouettes, more turns on this issue than one could ever display. I watched him last night. Maybe he was giving us a display of it last night with his little jink in front of the camera. ‘Rudd’ is short for Rudolph Nureyev. He is the archetypal policy dancer on the ETS. Do you know why he is doing it? He is doing it because he wants to jump the consequences over an election. He wants to jump the consequences over the possibility of a double dissolution in going to the people. The reason he wants to do that is that he knows full well that the workers in Labor Party seats will be the ones that lose their jobs over this. It will be the people of Mackay, it will be the people of Gladstone, it will be the people of Illawarra and it will be the people of the Hunter Valley. It will be the people that the Labor Party has deserted. The working families of Australia are being deserted by the Labor Party. That is what it is all about. You can go to Copenhagen, to Disneyland—wherever you like—but the position of the National Party on this will be quite clear: to understand the word ‘no’.
Those opposite talk about certainty. I will give you certainty. How is ‘no’ for certainty? ‘No’ is a very certain word; it is very easy to understand. You talk about arguing for a position. It is an amorphous, nebulous concept of this bumper sticker morality which has become the ETS scheme. The answer is no. We cannot put this up at the expense of Australian working families. We cannot start on this banal attempt to sole-handedly lead the world into some sunny, environmental upland, which is what Mr Rudd wants to do. It is all a part of the self-glorification of our Prime Minister as he attempts to become—I don’t know—president of the UN or whatever his grander ambitions are after he leaves this place. His own party have pulled him into gear.
I have never seen a more uncomfortable person than Minister Wong. She looked more uncomfortable than Mr Rudd after he lost his hair dryer. She was hung out to dry by her own Prime Minister. After all the wonderful, glorious statements about saving the world, he marched her out to the front of the building to say what we have already said—only they say no now; we say no, full stop. The reason we need an extension for this inquiry is so that we can drag this mangy cat back out again and all have another look at it, so that we can pull out the entrails of this chicken and divine from them over the table of the Senate, so that we can look into it and say, ‘What exactly are we trying to do here?’ Apparently, Australia is going to cool the planet—single-handedly. The Knights Templar are led by Prime Minister Rudd, only he is not really leading; he is just hanging people out to dry, including the minister.
We have had the Senate Economics Committee inquiry, we have had the fuel and energy inquiry and we have another inquiry going on now. We have 11 pieces of legislation coming back in here and they are going to try to push it on through. They want to do that because they do not want proper examination. The period that we have to look at something that could turn the economy of our nation upside down is contemporaneous with budget estimates. And they are saying that that is respect for the Senate! I acknowledge that the Greens will have an entirely different view. But I imagine that they too want the capacity to really drill down into this legislation. The Labor Party are trying to be sneaky and tricky as they walk over the future prosperity of regional Australia and of the working families of Australia—for what? It is an attempt to go forward with some bumper sticker morality for inner suburbia. But don’t worry about the people of Mackay, don’t worry about the people in Gladstone—

Senator Cameron interjecting—

—Don’t worry about your workers in the Illawarra and your workers in the Hunter Valley. No, don’t worry about them. You put on your Giorgio Armani suit and go and do the light fandango at a coffee shop near wherever you live, Senator Cameron, as you morph into this new type of Senator Cameron—this new type of environmentally sensitive, soft, wonderful, marshmallow Senator Cameron. Where has the steel from your spine gone? You have changed, Senator Cameron. You have changed since you have been here. You have changed into something else. And Mr Rudd has changed too.
So we have here the Rudolf Nureyev school of political pirouettes. We see this exercise from Mr Rudd as he pushes Minister Wong out the front door to hang herself out to dry on a piece of legislation that is an absolute debacle. Now they are trying to say, ‘Well, it’s a debacle now, so if we let it mature for 12 months then it will somehow get better.’ A silly idea now is a silly idea in 12 months time—it is just a silly idea that is one year old. We in the National Party are as one. We will be making sure that the entrails of this festering chicken are brought out on the table so we can once more take it apart piece by piece—through Labor seat, by Labor seat, by Labor seat, by Labor seat, by Labor seat. Then we will see what the political Rudolf Nureyev of policy pirouettes does next—the illustrious, the formidable and the ever-changing Mr Kevin Rudd.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,18,2
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-05-14,"—I have to say that I have not heard quite so many cliches rolled together in one speech in a very long time—from the entrails of a festering chicken through to marshmallows, steel in the spine and all manner of things. Entertaining as that might be, I would like to return to the substance of the matter before the Senate—which is an amendment to change the reporting date in the motion put forward by the government. I rise today to say that I will be supporting the reference of the bills relating to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to the economics committee for inquiry and I support the reporting date of 15 June, which is the day that the climate policy committee, which I worked with the coalition to establish, will also be reporting.
The fact of the matter is that between now and June 15 June the matters to be looked at are the changes to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that have been announced since the Senate economics committee reported previously. They relate to some very specific matters. They relate to the government’s decisions to: delay the commencement of the scheme for one year; establish a $10 price for the following year; and give further compensation to the trade exposed sectors, as shown in the budget this week, of $1.1 billion out of the public purse for extended compensation. This is the first time we have really seen a figure for the extent to which this scheme will not be self funding and the extent to which it will dip into the public purse for the next five years for that $1.1 billion—and that is just the beginning, I suspect, but that is a matter to be looked at. The other issue is the target. The government has changed its previous target range of five to 15 per cent to five to 25 per cent conditional upon a number of matters which the government has specified.
The government have said that the targets must be underpinned by mechanisms to meet them, and I will look forward to hearing the government explain how they will achieve a 25 per cent reduction on 2000 levels. Given the current parameters of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the extent of compensation and so on, I cannot see how in the eight years between 2012 and 2020 that 25 per cent reduction will be achieved under the CPRS. I can only assume that if the government did commit to that and if by some miraculous outcome the rest of the world agreed to the conditions—and I do not believe the government itself thinks they will ever be agreed to, but let us assume they were—then the government is meaning to buy in the rest of the commitment from overseas at-again-a huge cost. I am very interested to know about that, but that will come out in the Senate committee report. Those matters are going to be looked at by the Senate economics committee and by the climate policy committee. I think that reporting on 15 June, before the next session, is within the time frame that the government established at the beginning of this year. Anyone taking any notice of the projected timetable for government legislation would have noted that on no other piece of legislation have we had a clearer timetable established by the government for a very long period of time. It is not my intention to delay the legislation.
I have to say, having listened to the contribution from Senator Joyce, that, when you have already made your mind up as emphatically as he has—whether it is dancing with Nureyev, playing with marshmallows, looking at the fermenting entrails of chickens or all of that combined that leads you to you a ‘no’—why would you want longer to investigate something? You have already indicated to the Senate that, come what may, no matter what, in no uncertain terms whatsoever, the answer is no. So the answer of ‘no’ should be available on 15 June as well as in August or whatever date the coalition is putting forward.
I think the reality of the coalition’s position here in terms of a different date comes down to two things. Firstly, it is to avoid a trigger for a double dissolution and, secondly, it is to avoid a split in the coalition because if the legislation is put forward in June as expected then Malcolm Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, if he were to choose to support the legislation, would be seen to have a split in the Senate and would lose control of his party. So it is clearly in the coalition’s interests to put this as late in the year as possible. That would suit the coalition because it wishes to avoid a public split on a major piece of legislation like this. To me that is clearly the main reason behind the delay. The other thing is that, as we all know, for a trigger for a double dissolution you need three months between a piece of legislation coming in and it coming in again and being defeated. If the government was hoping to go to a double dissolution on the climate change legislation then it needs to get it into the Senate and have a decision made on that in June in order to be able to bring it back and be able to go to an October or November election before Copenhagen.
So let’s be very realistic about what is going on here. The reasons the coalition is putting up for delay have nothing to do with further scrutiny of these bills; they have much more to do with holding the coalition together and avoiding triggers. Senator Joyce has said nothing that would persuade me to the contrary on that. Also, Senator Joyce said by way of interjection earlier that he believed climate change was real but that there was nothing you could do about it. That indicates that he does not believe that human activity has any contribution to make. Otherwise, he would understand that you can do something about it by stopping carbon dioxide emissions going to atmosphere. You can make a significant reduction in carbon dioxide going to atmosphere through industrial processes and all the other means by which it is happening. I would say to Senator Joyce that stopping the logging in the Florentine in Tasmania would stop massive amounts of carbon dioxide going to atmosphere. Indeed, stopping the regeneration burns across Tasmania this autumn would stop massive amounts of carbon dioxide going to atmosphere. So there is plenty we can do. If you believe climate change is real, there is plenty we can do, and we could be doing it tomorrow.
I have seen no evidence of a genuine commitment to deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the urgent time frame that is required. The IPCC has said that global emissions must peak and come down at 2015. They must peak and then come down. The scientists are telling us we are already beyond 450 parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent. The Prime Minister has said that 450 parts per million CO equivalent is in Australia’s interests. I remind the Senate that 450 parts per million gives us only a 50 per cent chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change—that is, defined as an increase of more than two degrees—and the scientists are saying that they are not persuaded by that any longer. They are saying we should be aiming for much lower. They are saying we should be aiming for something like 350 parts per million. That shows that 450 parts per million is not the target but the absolute minimum aim. We should in fact have a much lower target as a global ambition.
Having said that, we do not have time to delay the implementation of the scheme another year. We do not have time to start slowly. The assumption that you can finish strongly assumes that there is no urgent time frame for stabilisation. I notice one of the government’s conditions on the 25 is stabilisation at 2020—which, according to the IPCC, is too late. We can have these discussions in the economics committee and in the climate policy committee, and people who are interested enough to be there can ask those questions and have those discussions at that time. I will not be supporting a delay in the reporting date of these committees. The matters that need to be discussed are there. I note that in today’s paper there is a reference to ‘technical matters’ that the government wants to sort out. ‘Technical matters’ have turned out to be more compensation for the coal industry. I want to put the government on notice: that is not a technical matter; that is yet more compensation. It should be signalled clearly before the Senate economics committee or the climate policy committee actually hold their inquiries. That is not technical; that is a yet bigger burden on the public purse.
In conclusion, I would say this. If you really aspire to dealing with climate change then you do not lock in a weak target until 2020 and leave the Australian budget and therefore the Australian people vulnerable to huge compensation payouts to the industries that caused the problem in the first place. The reason the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group now want this legislation passed is that they know that the big polluters and the big emitters in Australia—the coal industry in Australia—are never going to get a better deal than the one on the table now. The Business Council of Australia—the members of which are the Liberal Party’s biggest donors—will be on the phone to the Leader of the Opposition saying: ‘Pass this, because we’ll never get a better deal. If this doesn’t get through before Copenhagen, the situation will only get worse as the rest of the world will call for deeper cuts and faster and more stringent action.’ That is why the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia want it passed. They want it locked in for 2020 so that their members—from the public purse—get paid. The polluters will get paid every time between now and 2020 there is action taken that is beyond the scope of the scheme as it is currently.
That is why they want certainty. They want certainty about the extent of the compensation; they want to know that no change will occur without them being massively compensated. Locking in a low target for such a long time is one major structural weakness of this scheme. It is a disingenuous 25, because I do not believe that even the government thinks that the rest of the world would possibly agree to the conditions. I note that, when this was announced, the government emphasised time and time again the conditionality of the 25 in order to signal to the big polluters that there is a high probability—almost a certainty—that nobody will agree to Australia’s conditions. It is setting up quite an interesting debate for the next short while. There is no group of people in this parliament more committed to urgent action on climate change than the Greens. But the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is an economic tool to give effect to an environmental aspiration—that is, stopping catastrophic climate change. If an economic tool does not deliver environmental effectiveness or economic efficiency then you have to ask yourself: what is the point in putting it in place?
Environmental effectiveness is the priority for the Greens, and environmental effectiveness comes from the science. The science tells us that deep cuts by 2020 are required. We do not have generations to go; we only have a matter of years. And in fact everyone in this parliament has a personal responsibility in terms of making deep cuts. Incrementalism will not get us there. Half a bridge will not get us there. Deep cuts are what will get us there, and what will get us there, in an Australian and global context, is for Australia to put 40 per cent on the table in Copenhagen as a goodwill statement towards a global agreement. But what Australia will do, regardless of what the rest of the world does, is put 25 per cent on the table. That is the Bali negotiating range. China has said that they expect developed countries—annex 1 countries—to put on the table offers at the top end of the 25 to 40 per cent range. The developing world has, for some time, felt a failure of the annex 1 countries to act in good faith on the basis of the original Kyoto bargain—and indeed the other climate negotiations in recent years—and I do not believe it is going to see Australia’s current approach as being a good faith offer in relation to what is necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change.
I cannot put to the Senate more strongly the emergency that we have on our hands and to contrast the response of the Prime Minister to the global financial crisis with his response to the climate crisis. The global financial crisis saw the Prime Minister rushing to the United States and Europe—rushing to meetings all over the place—to talk about what could be done on the global financial crisis. We have not seen the same urgency in relation to climate change. We have not seen the same commitment in terms of dollars. We had no money to spend before the global financial crisis; now we have billions. In fact, millions has become such an outdated figure it just seems a meaningless thing. If you want to spend money now, you have to do it in billions. But there were not billions to spend on structural adjustment on climate change. There are still not billions to be spent on getting Australia off its addiction to coal. But it seems to be that there are plenty of dollars, billions of dollars available, to continue to support the coal industry.
The budget this week is underpinned by the assumption that coal will be back, that the boom times will come again and that Australia’s future prosperity will be underpinned by a resources boom of the future. Hence we see the billions going into the Hunter Valley railway line and the port expansion, into ongoing support for the coal industry and into carbon capture and storage—which is simply legitimising ongoing coal mining. Today there is a major marine conference in Indonesia that is talking about the disaster of the oceans and the collapse of the Coral Triangle. And where is the Prime Minister? He is turning a sod in the Hunter Valley for the new coal railway line. That gives you a sense of where this Prime Minister’s priorities are. He may talk about climate change but his priority is the maintenance of coal and coal exports. He cannot see beyond coal. You have to look at those compensation provisions and ask yourself what happened to the principle of polluter pays. What happened to that principle in Australia? We have now got to the principle that the polluter is paid, and is paid by the taxpayer. We are all going to pay higher energy bills around Australia because the government has exempted the big energy users and emitters from the Renewable Energy Target. Everybody else is going to pay more because of that, not to mention those provisions of compensation, and that is why the scheme is economically inefficient.
Nevertheless, I believe that the hearings we are going to have between now and 15 June will shed some more light on those extra billion dollars to be spent on the big emitters, and we will be very interested to see how Australia is going to get to its 25 per cent given the mechanisms, the delay, and the weak carbon price. We will also see whether there was ever the intent towards transformation in the Australian economy, because delaying a year and setting a $10 price is no signal for transformation. The biggest signal for Australia to pick up on today is the Prime Minister turning that sod for the coal railway in the Hunter Valley. If you want to see where Kevin Rudd wants to take Australia, look at that and recognise that this scheme is simply an economic tool. But it is not an efficient economic tool nor is it an environmentally effective tool, as I am sure the hearings for both of these committees between now and 15 June will demonstrate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,18,2
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2009-05-14,"—I do support the extension of the timing. We spent three weeks listening to evidence in the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy in order to scrutinise one bill. I understand there are 11 bills being put into the House this morning. As Senator Joyce has said, yes, the National Party is totally committed on this. Nevertheless, we reserve the right to expose further flaws in the bill. Even the people who are not as committed as Senator Joyce and me in the National Party have the right to understand what is wrong with these bills. We will put the spotlight on them, let people give evidence and have a look, and then bring it back. So I fully support the extension of time.
I want to pick up on some of the contribution made by Senator Wong. I do not normally feel sorry for Senator Wong. I think she does a job. But she had to stand next to the Prime Minister the other night. He had already told the Australian people that if we did not act now we were going to be swamped by seas and burnt to death and that it would never rain again. And Senator Wong, in reply to questions from me, has continued that message in the Senate time after time. But I felt sorry for Senator Wong there; she looked shattered. She did not know where to go. The Prime Minister completely pulled the rug out from under her. So, Senator Wong, you were dumped.
Then they said, ‘Senator Wong is not cutting through; let’s get Mr Combet and we’ll run him on as a reserve.’ He has gone out and he has tried to buy off industry after industry with little bits of bait here and there, but I do not think he is achieving anything, because delaying these bills for a year is not going to do anything. It is just going to give a reprieve for a year.
I sat on a committee with Senator Wong and Senator Cameron, and I recall that only one person, one manufacturer, Origin Energy—they have a few wind farms but really are a retailer and can pass the cost on—actually supported this legislation. They are the only ones who actually manufacture anything. I listened to the paper industry in Tasmania, I listened to the zinc industry in Tasmania, and they were totally opposed to this climate change legislation as it has been put up by the government. I went to Western Australia and I listened to the gas industry, and I listened to primary industries. They were totally opposed. We went to Melbourne—to the steel industry, the paper industry and the mining industry. Every industry in Australia is opposed to this legislation, because they know it is going to cost them jobs. They know it is going to wipe them out. Some of the industries have said, ‘It will not particularly worry us cost-wise. We’ll just turn the elevators around and instead of exporting we’ll import. We’ve got the silos that we export out of. We’ll just close our manufacturing down. We won’t do it immediately; there is no certainty, and we won’t spend any more money on these plants and equipment. As they run down we will just import more and, as the equipment gets old and obsolete, we will import more.’ Senator Wong, I commend to you the evidence that people gave. They are not doing it because they do not want climate change or because they want to oppose it but because they know what the legislation is going to do to their business.
There is something missing in this debate, and I cannot understand it. I can understand where the Greens are coming from, and that is legitimate. I can understand where the National Party is coming from, and I understand where the Liberal Party is coming from. But what is missing in this debate is this: why is the Labor Party ratting on their blue-collar workers? We have been told by every industry in Australia that this is going to cost jobs. We have been told by the dairy industry that it is going to cost the dairy farmers $9,000 per farm—that is just for the dairying; the price will go up when the cows have to be slaughtered. We are also told by the dairy processors, ‘It is going to impact on our process workers.’ We have been told by every industry, ‘Our process workers are going to suffer.’ In the mining industry, 10,000 jobs are going to go. Those are blue-collar jobs. Why are you selling those people out? And why do you take their union fees? Why do you go out and say, ‘Pay your $400, $500 or $600; we’re looking after you?’ You are selling them out. You are taking their money and you are selling them out.

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—Even that, Senator Joyce. It is going to have an impact on the people who live in the leafy suburbs too, because someone else is filling the ships that take the export product out. That is done in the mining industry and in the primary industries, and the people who live in the leafy suburbs are carrying the export load.
I suggest that the reason the Labor Party do not want to extend this legislation is that there is, in the blue-collar areas, an awakening. They are saying: ‘Hang on a moment. What’s this going to do for me? How am I going to live? How’s my family going to live? What am I going to do? I’m a miner. It’s what I know. I’m a forester. I am a process worker in a timber mill. I am not skilled in any other way to make a living. How am I going to feed my family? How am I going to look after my kids? What am I going to do?’ That is dawning on these people now. You saw it a couple of days ago in the Riverina, when a parrot took preference over workers. The parrot was put on a higher pedestal than 800 jobs. You cannot win without those blue-collar workers, and you cannot win without the Greens.
Your moderates in your party—the doctors, the wives, the teachers, the academics—cannot get you over the line, and you are playing Russian roulette. And you do not want another three months for the awakening to go further out there, because it is happening now. It is happening on our polling; it must be happening on your polling. People are saying: ‘I want a job. The global crisis is my main concern. I want to feed my kids. I want to look after my house.’ There is an awakening out there. This should be called the Tanner and Plibersek legislation. You know that without Greens preferences you cannot win. You have never tried to fight the Greens back. You have encouraged them and now they are dictating the terms to you. You have taken a tiger by the tail and you cannot get off its back. Their demands will increase and increase and increase. You can never satisfy the demands of the green lobby. They cannot be satisfied. You are on the tiger’s back and you cannot get off.
At the same time we got attacked from the Right. We defended our position and fought back. You never did. That was with Pauline Hanson—you never did. You encouraged the Greens and said: ‘All right. We’ll let them live. We’ll even throw them a few bones.’ They have got to the point now that they are controlling you. You have let them build up to the point where you are being led around by the nose by the Greens.
—You’re telling me I never did anything about Pauline Hanson? Watch your mouth. How dare you!
—You might not like it—
—Don’t you ever accuse me about racism.
—I am not lecturing you about racism. I never mentioned the word racism. I said the Right.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Order!
—You never fought the Left back. That is what I am saying. You never stood up to the Greens—never. And now they have devoured you. Now they are leading you around and you are in a crisis. Whether you realise it or not you are in a huge crisis because you cannot keep the blue-collar workers uninformed. They are becoming more and more informed, and you can see it in our polling and your polling. You may not like this, Senator Wong, but you are the fall guy. You are the guy who has been set up to dud the blue-collar workers. You might not like it, but you are.
We are opposed to this bill because we cannot see it doing anything on its own.
—Don’t bother putting it to an inquiry then!
—We will put it to an inquiry. We are opposed to it. Of course we are opposed to it. Why do I think it should go to an inquiry? Because, when I sat there for three weeks listening to the evidence, I found out more and more why this bill should not go through. It even gets to the point that you cannot even dump your rubbish without incurring a cost. The more you listen to it, the more stupid it becomes. You cannot put your rubbish in a rubbish dump without incurring a penalty. I never knew that until I listened at the inquiry, and there were many other things that I learned but they only made me realise how stupid and silly this was.
If I were asked to design a piece of legislation that would wreck the Australian economy, that would put people out of work, that would close industry down, I do not believe I could have designed a better program. That is not my view; that is the view of every major person who is involved in industry. I said it yesterday and I will repeat it: one of the directors of the Reserve Bank—and he must have got there because he had influence with the Liberals or the Nationals or presumably the Labor Party—said that Australia will survive a global crisis but it may not survive an ETS. That is someone who has credibility. He is also a director of BlueScope or OneSteel. We heard from both companies, and they said they could not survive with this. And now you have Combet going around offering a bet here and trying to pick the industries off one by one, saying: ‘Here are a few more certificates. We’ll give you another five per cent. We’ll extend it for a year.’ As one person—I forget his name—said, ‘You can’t put lipstick on a pig because it will still look like a pig with lipstick,’ and that is exactly what this bill is going to look like: a pig with lipstick.
It is wrong. The Business Council of Australia have sold their people out and they know it. They are going through a huge conflict at the moment. A lot of people are leaving. A lot of people are saying that they are being sold out and they are in an awkward position. They have the rent seekers on one side who know they can get a quid if these certificates are exchanged and sold around, bought in from overseas. There is a quid in it for them. But who pays? I will tell you who pays—the working families pay. Working families are going to pay for this indiscretion. I am certain—and I have never been more certain in 26, going on 27, years in this place—that this is the worst piece of legislation I have ever seen produced by the Labor Party, and I have seen some stinkers. But this is the very worst.
I cannot believe Senator Cameron. I would have thought he would stand up for the working man. He has completely sold out. I do not know whether he has been brainwashed—although I do not think he is that silly—or whether he is being a good trooper and doing what he has been told to do. But I say to him: you do not have to prostitute yourself. You got here on the Labor vote, on the blue-collar vote, and you are not standing up for them. In fact, the only people who are standing up for them are the coalition. They are waking up fast, and you want to get this legislation through quickly before they do wake up. But I think you have left it too late. They are waking up now. They are waking up in Gladstone, where the cement and aluminium industries are. They know their jobs are on the line. They are waking up in Rockhampton. The abattoir workers in Rockhampton know. The miners in the Bowen Basin know. The word is out: ‘These people are trading our jobs for Greens preferences, and we do not like it. We feel betrayed. We only have our vote to protect ourselves and we will use that vote.’

Senator Wong interjecting—
",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,18,2
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-05-14,"—I hear the minister encouraging me to speak, so thank you, Minister. Regrettably I have an important meeting at midday, so should anyone else want to follow me I will only be nine minutes. I want to support what Senator Boswell just said. He and I sat on the Select Committee on Climate Policy, which was looking into this legislation. I was also involved in Senator Mathias Cormann’s Select Committee on Fuel and Energy, which was looking into the same issue. I have come to the conclusion, from watching the Labor members on those committees and from watching the approach of the government, that the government desperately want us to defeat this legislation. They do not want to have to face the workers that Senator Boswell spoke about if they have cost them their jobs, but they do want to be able go to their green constituency and their Greens second preference voters in the capital cities and say, ‘We tried to do something but the nasty coalition, Senator Xenophon and the Greens all conspired to knock the legislation off.’ That is what I think the Labor Party want to be able to say. They know, as Senator Boswell says, that this legislation will cost the jobs of workers.
I live in North Queensland, not far from the Bowen Basin coalfields. I know the number of people who work in those areas and the wealth they generate. I also know the mortgages that they have run up in buying investment properties because they have good jobs in the Bowen Basin coalfields. Those people’s jobs will be at real risk, and they know it. Regrettably the ACTU gave very toady evidence to the committee. The ACTU put Labor in government and they want to keep them there, so they will roll over to help the government get through any legislation they bring on board. But the ACTU could not answer the questions about what would happen to the jobs of their members, to the working families of Australia that we heard so much about from Mr Rudd prior to the last election.
It distresses me that what the Labor Party, supposedly the party of the workers—they have long since lost that status, but they still maintain the pretence of looking after workers—are going to do with this legislation is simply export jobs offshore. In the coal area they will go to Indonesia, Colombia and South Africa, places where the people who own the Australian mines already have other mines. They will not invest in Australia when we have an impost that the rest of the world does not have. It is a double whammy: we will lose investment in Australia and the jobs of working families in the Bowen Basin coalfields, but it will not make one iota of difference to the carbon emissions of the planet. Emissions will simply move from Australia to Indonesia, Colombia or South Africa, where they will be even worse. I do not want to speak for them—they are all old enough and able enough to speak for themselves—but it was quite clear that the Labor members on both committees that I sat on in relation to emissions trading share that view. It would be different if you were going to do something about emissions trading or the changing climate of the world, but it will not do anything because the emissions will simply be exported offshore, and in the course of that we will lose jobs.
This is not just in the Bowen Basin coalfields—it is in Gladstone, Mackay, the aluminium industries and the cement industries, and we heard evidence from all of them. In fact we heard evidence from literally hundreds of people. We started at eight o’clock in the morning and finished at six o’clock at night. Some of the green groups would come in and oppose it for a different reason, but witness after witness pointed out the absolute stupidity of this legislation—the jobs it will cost and the loss to Australia’s economy. I recall that in regional Australia the dairy industry gave evidence that, although it does not apply directly to them until at least 2015, this emissions trading scheme will mean a loss of between $6,000 and $9,000 per producer in their industry. We also heard evidence from the Thiess meatworks in Rockhampton which clearly indicated that 400 jobs would be lost in that city.
I wonder what the Labor member for Capricornia, Ms Kirsten Livermore, is doing about that. Is she acquiescing in the loss of 400 jobs from working families in the Rockhampton area? I wonder what Mr Bidgood, the Labor member for Dawson, is doing about all the jobs that will be lost by working families in the Mackay region of Queensland. What are those Labor members doing? I know that they have been muzzled and gagged. What is Mr Trevor doing for all of the jobs that will be lost in his electorate, centred on Gladstone? There will be huge job losses. While we and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, were in Gladstone we heard daily announcements of job losses in that city, but not a murmur from the Labor member supposedly representing the interests of the working families in the Gladstone area. Those three members in particular have been gagged by the minister or by Mr Rudd and are not able to raise their voices.
I hope that some of the Labor senators, who clearly know this is a dog of a piece of legislation, will have the courage to yet again roll the minister in her push to destroy Australia without any benefit for the changing climate of the world—and that is the real problem. I know Senator Wong was humiliated by Mr Rudd when he did that partial backflip and put it off for a year. I only hope—and I do not mean the minister any personal ill will—that she is again rolled and that the Labor caucus will eventually say to her: enough is enough. If it were going to do anything about the changing climate of the world or emissions of carbon into the atmosphere then perhaps you could grin and bear it—and I only say ‘perhaps’. However, when it will not do that but destroy the jobs and the economies of many parts of rural and regional Australia, it is just not worth contemplating.
As we were told at the committee, modelling done in relation to rural and regional Australia has not seen the light of day. Why? We can only guess, but I think we can guess pretty intelligently, that the modelling that has been done for the New South Wales government demonstrates quite clearly that this is a dog of a piece of legislation when it comes to rural and regional Australia, and it is a dog of a piece of legislation when it comes to the Bowen Basin coalfields. I talk about that locality in a generic way but there are towns, people, houses, livelihoods and schools there which will all disappear if this legislation goes through in the way desired by the minister and Mr Rudd. There are places like Moranbah, Glenden, Tieri, Middlemount, Clermont, Blackwater and Moura, all of which are hotbeds of unionism. They mounted a fabulous campaign at the last election—and good luck to them; they did it very well—but they are eventually starting to wake up to the fact that this government they put in is hell-bent on costing them their jobs. I would imagine that it will not be long before the grassroots membership of the unions realise that their union bosses, their union leaders, hand in hand with the Labor Party hierarchy, are doing them in the bottom big time. They will work that out. It has been slow, but I think they are eventually starting to realise that this Labor government, which they worked so hard to get elected, is really a government that does not have their interests at heart and will cost them not only their jobs but their houses, their mortgages and their way of life—all to no avail.
At the very least, this legislation needs to be put off until after Copenhagen. The minister, Mr Rudd and—I do not want to malign them—some of those who clearly followed the Labor line for political reasons seem to think that, when we get to Copenhagen, everyone else in the world will say, ‘Gee, Australia’s doing this so we had better follow.’ Again, we had witness after qualified witness who said, ‘Much as we like Australia, much as we think we’re pretty good’—and we are pretty good—’we’re very small players in the international diplomacy field.’ I refer you to the Senate committee Hansard which shows very good evidence given by a consultant who was formerly associated with ABARE. Have a look at that, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, and you will see that, at least, we should put this legislation off until we see what the rest of the world does. If the minister is so confident that the rest of the world—China, India, the United States, Russia and, might I add, Colombia, South Africa and Indonesia—will take on a 25 per cent target, yes, let us go for it. If they take on a 40 per cent target, perhaps we should seriously consider it. But we will do that when they do it. Otherwise, all we will do is export Australian working family jobs to other countries for no benefit whatsoever to the changing climate of the world. Tell me: what sort of a government would promote this sort of dog-type legislation? I apologise for dogs. This legislation is infinitely worse than any mangy dingo you would find anywhere in Australia. It is stupid legislation and I would certainly hope that the Senate, and perhaps the government, will take the initiative and delay it at least until after Copenhagen and then have another look at it in the light of what the rest of the world is going to do.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Reference</title>,Committees,18,2
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-05-14,"—What a visceral debate this has been. I think it started off with Senator Wong taunting Senator Bernardi while he was in the chair. I thought that was cruel and unusual punishment, and I think she acknowledges that. Senator Bernardi could not respond and was gagged, in a sense, by being in the chair. Thankfully I will never be in the chair, so that is something I do not have to worry about. To me, the issue is one of process—that is, not the whys and wherefores of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme—
—Correct.
—Senator Parry agrees with me; he may disagree with the next thing I am going to say. It is this: there are two parallel inquiries—in fact, some would say three parallel inquiries because of the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy, ably chaired by Senator Cormann. I am a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy. The climate policy committee made a decision to report on the changes announced recently by the government by 15 June. I supported that and, as I understand it, the coalition did not object to that. On that basis, I thought it was quite reasonable for the economics committee to have a similar reporting date, because we have already looked at the architecture of this particular scheme and we have already looked at alternative schemes in relation to the scheme design and alternative approaches to tackle the, I believe, very serious problem of carbon pollution. The government is not putting up a totally new architecture of a scheme; it is putting up different targets and a different compensation package. So in a sense it has not gone back to square one; it has changed targets and changed compensation mechanisms in respect of its amended scheme. I would have thought it is not unreasonable for the economics committee to deal with that by 15 June. That is why, in terms of process, I believe it is not unreasonable to tackle it in the next month.
In the context of the merits of the bill, that is another matter. They can be debated when these bills come to the Senate to be debated and where amendments can be considered and we can look at the merits or otherwise of the substantive bill and any amendments. The whole issue of Copenhagen is something that can be dealt with, I believe, at that time. But, in terms of the process that is already in place with respect to the economics committee and the climate policy committee, these are not amendments that go to the architecture of the scheme. We know what the architecture is because we have had a debate about that and there have been inquiries by the two committees, and I believe we ought to get on with it and then we can have a substantive debate about the merits or otherwise of this amended scheme and any amendments in the context of the debate when the bills are introduced. Therefore I support the minister’s motion.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2009-05-14,"—The Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 substantially deals with two measures from the budget.
The first aspect of this bill is the provision for an ongoing lump sum payment of $600 a year for people on carer allowance and on carer payments. This provision effectively regularises payments that have been made since 2004 under the Howard government. I would like to take this opportunity to place on record—and I am sure that this is shared in a bipartisan sense—the great appreciation of parliament for the fantastic work of carers in Australia. I suspect it would not matter how much we paid them; most Australians would agree that it would never make up for the huge contribution they make not only to the people who they care for but, of course, to the wider community.
In 1998 the former coalition government extended the support to carers of children with a profound disability. I think it was in 2004 that we introduced the carer bonus payment, which was a one-off carer bonus payment of $1,000 to each person in receipt of the carer payment and $600 to each recipient of a carer allowance, which was then announced in the 2004-05 budget. In effect, that continued until this day. What this provision does is regularise that payment.
The only other aspect of this bill of note is to suspend for three years the indexation of the income threshold to the people accessing family tax benefits. This is a straight savings measure and is non-controversial. It will not be opposed by those on this side. Again, the carers are the unsung heroes of the Australian community, and I feel that these payments only really give recognition and acknowledgement to the work that they do. I commend this legislation to this place.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2009 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-05-14,"—The Greens would like to briefly put on record our support for the approach in the Social Security and Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009 and also acknowledge the value of the work that carers contribute to the community in Australia. Without those carers, we would not be able to deliver the care and look after the people who are most in need of care in our community. Quite frankly, we would not have functional care services.
The latest statistics show a contribution of $30 billion worth of care per year to our community. I think that is an underestimation of the care that is provided. The past up-and-down yearly system of bonuses has been unfair to carers because it leaves them in doubt each year as to whether they are going to be able to make ends meet and whether they are going to be able to get that extra little bit of support, so the Greens will be supporting this bill. We particularly want to acknowledge their contribution.
We would also like to put on record for the government that we think there is still further work to do in support of carers. We are aware of the bill that we would have been debating this week—it now looks like it has been put off—and that is the bill that is coming to deal with carers of children in particular. But there is other work that needs to be done, and I know that both the government and the opposition are aware of this. There are other issues that need resolving for carers, particularly around their long-term requirements. We all know that carers have to come out of the workforce and they do not get superannuation, and I know that carers are keen to get better coordination across government. I will acknowledge—particularly as she is in the chamber—that Senator Stephens is looking at these very important issues but there is still a greater need for coordination across government.
I will also say—and I will go into this in more detail when we talk about the next bill—that there is still a considerable way to go to help carers. A lot of work has been done recently about helping and supporting carers of children, but there are still quite a few issues that need to be resolved for carers of adults, particularly our ageing carers and carers looking after the frail and aged, particularly their partners. So we will be continuing to pursue that with government, as I am sure Senator Stephens knows. We would like to put that on record and put the government on notice that we will continue to follow those issues up. I am pleased that carers will now not have to wait with bated breath each year to see if they are going to get that extra little supplemental bonus and that their enormous contribution to our society is acknowledged.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2009 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1

We can only suspect that it has a lot to do with the semantics of the budget and, perhaps, Mr Rudd not wanting to confess to a deficit in excess of $58 billion.
What this bill is all about is bringing forward from the next financial year into this financial year an amount of $480 million going to local government. The government gives the explanation that it will allow local government to get on with job-creating works, but that does not seem to ring true. Our consultation with the Australian Local Government Association suggests that this was not sought by local governments throughout Australia; it is simply something the government is doing. As I say, we cannot quite understand why it is. It means that the quarterly payment that was due at the beginning of next financial year, $480 million, will be paid in this financial year. It means councils will have that additional money this financial year. They will not be able to spend it in the next couple of months, quite clearly, and it means they will have to hold it in reserve to spend next year.
So what is this all about? Perhaps whichever minister is dealing with this legislation in the Senate can give us a convincing reason why this is happening. We can only think that the Treasurer did not want to talk about a deficit of more than $58 billion. It is fudging the figures somewhere along the line. Local governments are certainly not getting any more money; they are getting the same amount of money, but it is just that the first quarterly payment is coming forward in this financial year. There is no sensible or believable explanation given by the government in the second reading speech or the explanatory memorandum. We are just curious as to why it has happened.
But it is good to see the Labor government continuing the financial assistance grants that the previous coalition government made to local government throughout Australia in recognition of the quite significant work that local government does in all aspects of the life of Australians. Certainly councils look after the old triple R—roads, rates and rubbish—but these days they look after a lot more than that. I know that in my state of Queensland, particularly in many of the smaller regional councils, they take on a real community leadership role and deal with a lot of infrastructure projects and many other works that benefit their communities.
Councils also get money under Roads to Recovery, another initiative of the Howard government which I am pleased to see the current government continuing—for the time being, at least. That is an initiative where roads money goes directly to councils, cutting out the middleman at state government level, so councils can do good works on local roads. Unfortunately, in Queensland we are finding that quite a number of local councils are using their R2R money on state roads, roads that should be maintained and improved by the Queensland state government but that the Queensland government are not at all interested in because they are outside the south-east corner of our state. We find the local authorities using the money given to them by the Commonwealth government for local roads on these state roads simply because nobody else is maintaining them.
But local governments play a much wider role in the community as well. I was interested the other day to see all of the mayors from local governments from Townsville out to Mount Isa—and there are five or six of them—indicating that, as the headline in the newspaper says, ‘Mayors support uranium’. The newspaper article says that:
Mayors in the seven shires between Mount Isa and Townsville have unanimously voted in favour of uranium mining in Queensland.
That is a very interesting aspect of the views of some community leaders in that particular area.
Their support for uranium mining simply mirrors the support given by Ms Betty Kiernan, the Labor member for the state seat of Mount Isa. It also mirrors the urgings of the former Labor member for Mount Isa, who was minister for mines in the Beattie government, who is very vocal in his support for uranium mining. I think one of Queensland’s leading union officials, Mr Bill Ludwig from the AWU—
—Good man.
—A very good man. I am not quite sure why he supports the ALP, although perhaps there is evidence of why in this chamber at the moment! He, like me, is very concerned about workers in the north-west and the north of Australia. He is very concerned about the emissions trading scheme. I do not think he has said too much publicly because he does not want to embarrass those who might be close to him who might be forced to take a position on it that does not support the interests of his members. But he is the sort of union leader who is interested in workers’ jobs. He is the sort of union leader who would be very concerned about the emissions trading scheme and the impact it will have on jobs in the Bowen Basin coalfields, the aluminium industry, the cement industry, the cattle industry and the dairy industry across Australia. Also, as I recall—and, if I am wrong, someone will no doubt tell me—Mr Bill Ludwig, the AWU union leader, is a supporter of uranium mining in Australia.
I am not indicating that I necessarily am or am not a supporter of uranium mining. I do know there is a hell of a lot of it. I declare an interest here. I have a couple of shares in penny dreadfuls, some of which are prospecting for uranium or think they have found it. I will just declare that as an interest. But there is a lot of uranium in Northern Australia, particularly Northern Queensland, and that is why these men across that part of Northern Australia have unanimously voted in favour of uranium mining in Queensland—as I say, mirroring support given by the Labor state member for Mount Isa. They have done that because they realise that uranium is used around the world. In Australia, uranium from three mines seems to be okay, but uranium from any more than three mines seems to be bad uranium—the policy of the Labor Party that everyone finds difficult to understand. But they also looked at emissions trading, carbon emissions into the atmosphere, and realised that one of the reasons the European Union is able to talk about meeting targets is because a substantial part of the power in the European Union comes from nuclear power. One wonders why people like the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, who are paranoid about carbon emissions, are not at least investigating—I am not saying supporting—the possibility of having uranium in the mix of energy providers for Australia.
But I digress. I am simply indicating that local governments in Australia take on a far wider role than the old road rates and rubbish activities of the past. In Australia local government is very well led at a national level by Councillor Paul Bell—a Queenslander, I am proud to say. He hails from the mining city of Emerald in Central Queensland. I know he would be having concerns about the emissions trading scheme, as anyone who lives in those areas would be. Certainly local government is well led and well resourced in Australia. There are a lot of very good CEOs of the various state local government associations, people like Greg Hallam in Queensland, who are very professional and do a great job in assisting local governments deliver their services.
I was at a local government conference in Hughenden in western Queensland just last week and I took the opportunity there to urge local governments to get together across the top of Australia to try to establish some sort of North Australian congress to fight for a better deal for North Australia. As I know you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Trood, about 45 per cent of Australia’s land mass is north of the Tropic of Capricorn, but only five per cent of Australia’s population lives in that area. In a federal parliament of over 200 members and senators, 142 federal members and 73 senators are in the south of Australia, below the Tropic of Capricorn, and across the north of Australia there are only eight federal members and three senators. I guess that is why, in a democracy, Northern Australia at times gets overlooked.
Northern Australia contributes 33.4 per cent of the national sea exports from Australia. Of Australia’s export earnings, Northern Australia contributes something like 30 per cent. We in the north—this is very relevant in these times of a drying continent—have anywhere between 47 and 66 per cent of the national river run-off. That all occurs in Northern Australia. The predictions on climate change are that the south of our continent will get drier and the north will get a little wetter or stay the same. We have that huge freshwater run-off across the north. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to work out that in the future most of Australia’s food will be grown in Northern Australia because it has good, reliable water and it has a mosaic of good quality lands. In fact, I often proudly quote the Peanut Company of Australia, which originated in Kingaroy at the time when the name ‘Kingaroy’ was synonymous with peanuts. It is difficult to believe that in the not-too-distant future there will be very few, if any, peanuts grown in the Kingaroy district. They will all be grown in Katherine in the Northern Territory or in that corridor between Townsville and Mount Isa once good water storage comes into play.
In those parts of Northern Australia there are carefully considered programs for the harvesting and storage of some of that fresh water. We know about the Menzies government’s great initiative in the Ord irrigation scheme, a scheme which I am delighted to say the new Western Australian government has picked up and committed $200 million to extending. I give credit where credit is due. I am pleased to see the current government matching the Western Australian government’s $200 million to go on to stage 2 and perhaps stage 3 of the Ord River scheme. I was delighted in Darwin last week, in discussions with ministers in the Northern Territory government, to find that the Northern Territory government has dropped its disinterest in stage 2 of the Ord and is now coming to the table to be part of the discussions in looking at stage 3.
The Douglas Daley area in the Northern Territory is a good water supply source. There are certainly issues to be addressed, but that is an area that will support agriculture into the future. In my state of Queensland there is a lot more capacity in the Burdekin dam area. By increasing the size of the dam wall you could almost double the amount of water available, which will feed not only Australia but the world in many years to come. There are smaller projects too. There is the O’Connell Creek diversion off the Flinders River at Richmond. It is almost shovel-ready. It is the sort of project that I hope Mr Rudd would be seriously looking at as he wants to spend some of this money on nation building. I suspect it will not get a guernsey because it is probably too sensible.
The Queensland government need to make some decisions in relation to water allocation, which they seem quite incapable of doing. There is a good project that could start now and create a lot of jobs and more good quality agricultural land to feed Australian mouths and indeed the mouths of the increasingly hungry across the world. The Mt Beckford scheme is further up the Flinders River near Hughenden. It is a good project that could be put into operation with a bit of government leadership. There is also the Green Hills dam proposal on the Gilbert River just north of Georgetown up in the gulf. These are all projects that are almost shovel-ready. That seems to be the new buzz word these days. Those are some projects that the Labor government could very well and usefully have a look at if they could get their mates in the Queensland government to make some decisions.
We in the north really do need to get the people of southern Australia to understand just what a significant contribution the north makes to the national economy and to the future of people living in the south of Australia. That is why I have suggested that a Northern Australian parliament, sponsored by local governments across the north, might be one way of attracting the focus and the impetus to get some interest from southern-centric governments, both in Queensland and in Australia. That demonstrates the length and breadth and the width and depth of work that local governments do for our country these days. That is why the coalition continues to support financial assistance grants to local governments. That is why, although we are mystified as to why this bill is being introduced, we are supporting the bill currently before the chamber.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2009-05-14,"—I thank Senator Macdonald for his contribution to the debate on the Financial Assistance Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and for his ongoing support for local government. Can I explain quite clearly why this bill is being brought forward. Under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act as it currently stands there is no mechanism for the Commonwealth to respond quickly and responsibly to support local government by bringing forward a portion of next year’s financial assistance grants. So the amendments we are seeking here are simply to provide the flexibility to advance payments from the next financial year to the current year. The amendments will also increase the general drawing rights authorising debits from the COAG Reform Fund for the purposes of making grants of general revenue assistance to the states. The government is looking forward to the passage of this bill to enable the Commonwealth to provide that general purpose financial assistance to the states and of course to help local government meet the current economic challenges. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2009-05-14,"—In summing up the debate on this bill, I thank those who spoke on this very important bill. The Australian government is committed to supporting Australian workers, committed to getting Australians into jobs, committed to ensuring Australians have safe workplaces and committed to looking after Australian workers if they suffer a workplace injury. We are heartened by the fact that there is a declining number of deaths in Australian workplaces, but of course this is of little comfort to the families of those men and women who perish in workplace accidents.
This bill will deliver increases in the benefits paid to the families of workers who die as a result of their work, and that is central to the government’s support of Australian workers and their families. I would like to particularly acknowledge the interest of Senator Lundy in this bill and the decision which will ensure that the family of the ACT firefighter who was tragically killed while fighting the Victorian bushfires, Mr David Balfour, will receive increased benefits.
In the last budget the government committed to increasing the Comcare lump sum death benefits from the current level of $229,494 to $400,000, and that commitment also increases weekly benefits for dependent children from $72.98 to $110 per child. As I say the government understands that this is of little comfort to families who have lost a loved one as a result of their employment. Nothing can bring those people back; the best we can do as a government and a parliament is to deliver greater financial certainty to those families. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2009-05-14,"—I would like to make some brief remarks on the passage of the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008. The Australian Greens acknowledge that the amendments proposed by the government through this bill are noncontroversial. These particular amendments provide for Queensland to finally come into the accountability framework, contributing record keeping, reporting and compliance with inspection obligations, and establishing the minimum standards for agency compliance. What is noteworthy about Queensland is that it has a Public Interest Monitor—an independent barrister who represents the public interest and, in the case of this legislation, is basically a barrier to police having unfettered power to get highly intrusive powers for surveillance device warrants or covert search warrants. The Public Interest Monitor will be present for the actual warrant applications in Queensland. While the history of the Queensland police force is mixed, as we all know from the Fitzgerald inquiry and various exposes in the media, including pieces in Four Corners, it is especially appropriate for this kind of oversight to ensure that the police and law enforcement agencies are respecting privacy and acting within the law. But the question really is: why aren’t the citizens of every state protected in this way? Why is there not an office such as this in all states and territories that ensures that checks and balances do ensure that privacy rights are upheld?
As I said the first time I got to my feet in this place, it is very concerning that an Australian telephone is 23 times more likely to be bugged than an American telephone. In the United States only judges may issue telecommunications warrants, but in Australia almost all are issued by nonjudges, as we can see from the list of authorised personnel listed in the bill before us today, which empowers the state commissioners to authorise officers of a particular rank to be a certifying officer. The Australian people should be provided with evidence that this level of surveillance is actually necessary and that it is being used in successful prosecutions. The legislation should also be reviewed to ensure that necessary, lawful and proportionate access by law enforcement agencies to telecommunications data is balanced with the public’s right to communicate free from surveillance. Australians should be able to communicate with their friends and colleagues without a range of organisations listening in. It must only be in extraordinary circumstances when that right to privacy is denied.
Who exactly is being spied upon? In many cases it has been people who are working for peace and human rights or organising their democratic right to free expression which we hold very dear in this country. Why are these people under surveillance? We have seen recent media reports, particularly in Victoria and New South Wales, of state law enforcement agencies spying on perfectly legitimate organisations who are simply expressing their democratic rights to dissent from certain kinds of decisions or certain activities. Why are they under surveillance? A public interest monitor mechanism in every state and territory will help ensure that proper justification is made each and every time an Australian’s right to privacy is breached.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2009-05-14,"—I thank Senator Ludlum for those comments and I thank other senators for their contributions to this debate on the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008. This is a very important bill in ensuring that law enforcement agencies can protect the safety and security of Australians wherever they live. As Senator Ludlum pointed out, currently, Queensland is the only jurisdiction whose agencies cannot seek or execute an interception warrant. So the passage of this bill will clear the way for Queensland to enact legislation that satisfies the accountability obligations set out in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and, importantly, by recognising a role for the Public Interest Monitor in this act, Queensland will be able to legislate an oversight role for that body without conflicting with the Commonwealth act.
The bill maintains the integrity of the interception regime by prescribing a role for the Public Interest Monitor that recognises its importance to the oversight of police activities in Queensland while respecting the independence and integrity of the decision makers as currently set out in the act. So the government is looking forward to receiving further advice from Queensland regarding the passage of complementary legislation which was introduced into the Queensland parliament on 22 April this year.
This bill facilitates a truly national telecommunications interception regime and is a further step in the ongoing modernisation of Australia’s interception laws for law enforcement and national security purposes. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-05-14,"—There are a number of amendments that will be considered as part of the Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009. I thought it would be useful for the chamber and for the orderly handling—at least of the coalition’s participation in the debate—if I were to outline our general approach to the amendments.
Central to discussions about this bill is whether the Australian Business Investment Partnership is required at all. In the coalition’s view, we should not be intervening in the commercial property market, or indeed any market, with all the distortional effects that this causes unless there are sound reasons for doing so. The fundamental question here is: is there a sound reason? What has been missing from this debate is any concrete evidence that there is a clear and present need for a government backed facility of the kind proposed in this bill to be available to meet funding gaps in the commercial property sector. Quite apart from our objections to the structure of Ruddbank—moral hazard arguments, conflicts of interest, vague lending criteria, problems with governance, lack of accountability and so forth—the fundamental rationale for the bank, that foreign banks are likely to withdraw from syndicated large debt facilities, has, in our view, not yet been established.
I do accept that in the current financial climate there may be challenges in refinancing risk. But the anecdotal scenarios of ifs and buts and maybes qualified the evidence—heavily qualified it, in my view, given that some witnesses arguing for this bill in the Senate Standing Committee on Economics fortified the coalition’s view that the primary rationale for setting up this bank has not been made out. Notwithstanding the importance of the commercial property sector—and that must be acknowledged—there is no sound public policy reason that I can discern that would justify the cost of setting up this bank just because circumstances might at some unspecified time arise where it could be needed. And just think about this: if we approached every institutional and financial risk in the private sector that way, there would be a never-ending queue of sectoral interests requiring a safety net and similar treatment with the risk passing to the hapless taxpayer. So whilst some of the amendments proposed by Senators Xenophon and Fielding and the Australian Greens are well-intentioned and even thoughtful—and I have had a look at all of them—in our view they are redundant. That is because the primary rationale for the bill has not materialised. No amount of amending it will make any more compelling evidence that foreign banks are likely to withdraw their investments from syndicated loans in circumstances where our domestic banks are unable or unwilling to fill the gap. It is, of course, the proverbial analogy, the lipstick on a pig analogy, that a nicer shade will not make it any prettier. Amendments, however sound, will not overcome the fact that the bill lacks its fundamental premise.
I also alluded in my remarks during the second reading debate to the coalition’s concerns that there may even be a possibility that the arrangements surrounding Ruddbank will increase Commonwealth debt by another $28 billion. I made those remarks prior to the budget being handed down on Tuesday night. On Tuesday night, of course, the Australian people were confronted by a Rudd Labor government budget that will define this government, I think, for all time. Australia is now swamped by the largest cumulative deficits, $220 billion, in contemporary Australian history, and the largest public debt—a whopping $188 billion net public debt and rising—and by spending, that is, on any view, out of control. Just since the 2007 election there has already been $124 billion of new spending by the Rudd Labor government. Labor has lost control of the nation’s finances, and there is absolutely no justification for adding another potential liability of $28 billion. I know that sounds quite minor with the magnitude of the numbers of billions that get thrown around under the guise of making provision in this climate. But in this bill it is unfair to be adding another potential liability of $28 billion to Labor’s rivers of red ink stretching as far as the eye can see. We believe that in the absence of the case being made out for this bill there is no justification for amending it; and that will be the approach that the coalition will take to the amendments that are no doubt about to be put forward.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-05-14,"—As I said in the second reading debate, the Greens view this legislation with some apprehension. It puts $2 billion of public money up, to be matched by the four banks putting in half a billion each. That is, under the existing legislation, going to be governed by a board of five, one each from the big banks and one from the Commonwealth—which is out of kilter. We have an amendment to make now to give the Commonwealth two votes there, and they will have a veto. But it also brings into play the potential for a further $26 billion of taxpayers’ money, because that is the provision for guarantees for loans should it be required. In other words, the Commonwealth commitment of taxpayers’ money in this legislation is bigger than the commitment by the four banks put together. Where will the money go? It will go to developers of such things as shopping centres and other private enterprise developments where the concern was—which I do not think is now nearly as strong—that such developments would be financed by foreign loans, and that the foreign lenders at a time of recession may not be prepared to renew the loans. It is to put up a guarantee from the taxpayers to the private sector developers that, come what may, they will get new finance.
There are all sorts of ramifications with legislation like this as to the availability of money to other potential borrowers and the fact that small business is left out altogether. Be that as it may, the Greens have consistently said that we are responsibly aware that the government is there to govern, it is a time of enormous crisis on the economic front, and we as a nation are in recession. We have, I think, potentially reached agreement about rebalancing the board by having six officers on the Australian Business Investment Partnership—an added one from the Commonwealth. I think that is very wise, because it will mean that instead of a single Commonwealth officer being there to negotiate with four private sector officers—one from each of the banks—there will be two Commonwealth officers. We do not have to be too schooled in social dynamics to know that that will give the Commonwealth a much better bargaining position and, if necessary, a much wiser ability to use the veto.
The other important amendment that I put forward on behalf of the Australian Greens, in the absence of action from the government, is:
The annual salary of any officer of any other party to the arrangement is not greater than $1,000,000.
That is, the development companies that are potentially entertaining getting a guaranteed loan at the risk of the taxpayer should not include people who are then taking home more than a million dollars a year. It is an embarrassingly high figure, when one looks at the Prime Minister’s income of around $400,000. This is presuming that there is a developer out there, a manager of a development corporation or a development, who is doing work that is worth two and a half times that of  the Prime Minister. Obviously that is not the case. But this is to thwart taxpayers’ money being used to back up what the Prime Minister himself has described as the ‘obscene’ executive officer salaries we have seen in Australia in recent years.
While it is not germane to Australia, this got right out of hand in the United States, where the president has taken some action. I want to quote from a letter from Attorney-General Cuomo of the State of New York to the Chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services in Washington, the Hon. Barney Frank. It outlines Merrill Lynch bonuses for last year. People will know that Merrill Lynch was a casualty of the recession, or maybe a big cause of it. The letter says:
Merrill Lynch’s decision to secretly and prematurely award approximately $3.6 billion in bonuses, and Bank of America’s apparent complicity in it, raises serious and disturbing questions. By December 8, 2008, Merrill and presumably Bank of America must have been aware that the fourth quarter and yearly earnings results were disastrous. Indeed, on January 16, 2009, the companies announced that in the fourth quarter alone Merrill Lynch has lost $15.31 billion, and more than $27 billion for the year. In the face of these losses, federal taxpayers were forced to help Bank of America acquire Merrill. Thus, Bank of America also announced on January 16, 2009, that the federal government would invest $20 billion in the deal and provide $188 billion in protection against further losses primarily from the Merrill Lynch portfolio. These investments were in addition to the previous $25 billion in TARP funding that taxpayers had given to Bank of America.
Now listen to this. The Attorney-General of New York, writing to the committee on Capitol Hill, said:
Bearing in mind that Merrill moved up its bonus payments in advance of its announced $15 billion quarterly loss and $27 billion annual loss, we have determined that Merrill Lynch made the following bonus payments:
The top four bonus recipients received a combined $121 million;
The next four bonus recipients received a combined $62 million;
The next six bonus recipients received a combined $66 million;
Fourteen individuals received bonuses of $10 million or more and combined they received more than $250 million;
20 individuals received bonuses of $8 million or more;
53 individuals received bonuses of $5 million or more;
149 individuals received bonuses of $3 million or more;
Overall, the top 149 bonus recipients received a combined $858 million;
696 individuals received bonuses of $1 million or more.
You cannot relate that experience directly to Australia, but we do have examples in Australia, if we look at the year 2008, of what the Prime Minister called ‘obscene’ CEO payments. He was not directly referring to these payouts—but I will—which may well be involved directly in the largesse that this particular bill gives to these companies at the risk of the taxpayer. The CEO of ANZ Bank, Mike Smith, got $6 million. The CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Norris, got $8.66 million. John Stewart, of National Australia Bank, got $4.28 million. In the development area—and that is where this bill is directly aimed—Frank Lowy of Westfield got a $15.88 million annual salary and, in Mirvac, Mr G Paramor got $2.8 million. That needs to be reined in.
We believe in free enterprise and we also believe in a fair go. I have been putting forward the idea that there should be a cap on the most excessive of CEO payments since at least 2004-05. It seemed a bit of a cry in the wilderness during the boom times, but now we are in a recession, when money is scarce and taxpayers are concerned for their future and indeed a lot of them have become unemployed or are seeing their small businesses collapse. This legislation aims to give financial help, indeed bailouts, to some of the biggest developers in the country if there are defaults on foreign loans. If we are going to do that, then the quid pro quo should be that those developers pull their belts in and accept a reasonable—by anybody else’s standards—if not very, very comfortable income of a million dollars or less. We the Greens do not see that as anything other than a fair go.
I have written to the Prime Minister on a number of occasions on this issue. I have in this legislature put forward a number of motions and amendments to introduce much more relaxed caps than this one—on one occasion a cap of $5 million. They have been routinely voted down by both the opposition and the government. This is put forward not as some gesture. As I said in my speech on the second reading, this is a serious amendment and, as far as we are concerned, support for this legislation depends on movement from the government.
Yesterday I had some conversation with officers of the government and suggested that they come back with an alternative amendment if they cannot support this one. I have got none. I have not even got a suggestion of one. I must take it from that that the Prime Minister is simply not interested in taking any real action at all on what he calls the obscene CEO payouts. Well, we are.
I would expect that the government, in the absence of any other suggestion—but echoing the Prime Minister’s alarm about the greed that sometimes overtakes CEOs in formulating their own magnificent payouts—will support the Greens amendment. I would expect the government to do that and take it as seriously as we of course take this piece of legislation. It involves large amounts of money and very considerable potential risk to Australian taxpayers. The amendment to put a cap of $1 million on the CEO payments of companies who might receive guarantees or loans under this legislation ought to be heeded seriously by the government and supported.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-05-14,"—I want to respond to some of Senator Brown’s concerns. The government shares Senator Brown’s concerns, frustrations and even anger at some of the corporate excess that has wreaked havoc across the world. While I think that your amendments are well intentioned and deserve serious consideration, they probably do not go far enough. By moving an amendment that only narrowly targets individuals in this area you are actually missing the wider cause of the problem. To just address this here like this does not actually solve the issues that you are seeking to solve. I share much in common with you about those issues.
You quoted extensively—and rightfully so—about the excess, greed and disgraceful behaviour of some of those corporate barons in the United States. The perverse part of what you are proposing is that there is a difference between the executives of the companies that we are seeking to assist here and those executives who were involved in that greedy, avaricious behaviour in the US. They were rewarding themselves for bad behaviour, and that bad behaviour brought on their own problems. The individuals being targeted here are the victims of the behaviour that you are describing.
The fact that they are unable to get their debt rolled over is not actually their fault. The purpose of this bill is to try and address issues for the corporations that are victims of the financial crisis, not necessarily through any fault of their own. While I laud and applaud your motives, I urge you to work closely with the government in this area. Personally, I would welcome that. There are many ideas that I think deserve serious consideration and to be put forward and debated as part of the Productivity Commission’s examination. I have got a lot of faith in Allan Fels and his willingness to tackle this area. Many of your ideas should be considered by Mr Fels in his report, and I would welcome your input into that process.
But I think you are actually confusing cause and effect in that the people who have caused this, who you identified rightfully in your last address to this place, are not the people you are seeking to put a constraint upon. They are not necessarily behaving badly or causing this problem. While I appreciate that you are determined to pursue your amendment, there is a genuine and serious attempt by this government to address the broader issues which I believe you are actually seeking to address. While we are not going to be in a position to support your amendment, we urge you to put forward all your ideas, talk with Allan Fels, talk with the Productivity Commission and join in this debate, which I think has to be had. The monumental failure of the corporate—and particularly financial—sector to manage and disclose risk has brought the world economic system to its knees. Your anger and frustration with those individuals and the systemic failure that has taken place is well placed and justified. But I believe this punishes those who have not been responsible for that bad behaviour, and it misses the larger target that we should be dealing with.
While I am sure you will pursue your amendment, and while we cannot support it, I urge you to participate and bring forward a range of policy options, solutions and ideas to the process that the government is engaged in. Allan Fels is a man of enormous integrity and I believe he will bring forward a package to address the excess, the greed, the extraordinarily bad behaviour and the systemic failure that we have seen cripple the world economy. I urge you—even if your amendment is defeated—to consider supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-05-14,"—I thank the minister for that response, but it is right off the mark. We have been talking with the government. In fact, I have written a number of times to the Prime Minister on this matter over the last six months. It is a bit precious for the government to say now that they would welcome us working closely with them on this issue. The fact is that we have had no response from the government. If you are going to work on an issue it takes a two-way discourse. I am a little jaded with the evolved position whereby the crossbench just helps the government with all manner of issues—not least the responsible way in which we helped the government with its very contentious stimulus packages of tens of billions of dollars. I will talk a bit more about this tonight; I have got some very job-rich good amendments to those packages for the Australian taxpayer. But it is a two-way street. We also have constituencies and we also have good policy initiatives—not to be made just as additions to government legislation but to be considered seriously by government and, on this occasion, by the Prime Minister himself.
It appears as if the Prime Minister has taken for granted the very public and reasoned approach to this matter of extreme executive payments since he has been in office. I have certainly had no communication about it. We are not going to be taken for granted on everything down the line. We are very, very serious players and senators in every debate that comes before this place. We expect that the government would take seriously these amendments, which went to it in March—it is now May. Except for a visit from some officers from the Treasurer’s office yesterday, we have had no response. Now the minister is saying, ‘Pass this bill and work with us and we have sent it off to the Productivity Commission. I’m sure you’d have some good ideas to put into there.’ That is putting it on to a long-term trajectory. We have no date; we have no open process that is available here.
Senator Conroy said that my amendments do not go far enough. Well, there should be little problem in amendments that go some way towards fixing this issue, and the government should be supporting them. What is the minister asking me to do? Tighten down the salary cap of a million dollars to an Obamaesque level of US$500 million? I don’t think so. I think the amendments are not broad enough and the government has had ample time to consider what it might put forward to this chamber instead. But on the eve of this debate, instead of that, the Prime Minister announced that he was asking the Productivity Commission to look at the matter. Prior to that, he was getting a report to take to an entity in Europe before the G20 conference—they were going to look at it; Australia would have a submission there. This is being duck shoved by Prime Minister Rudd. He has the description of the greed and the obscenity right, but he is not taking the action. These Greens amendments safely take action—I do admit that it is not broad enough, but they at least take limited action—which is reasonable given the circumstances, and we insist upon them.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,31,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-05-14,"—Senator Brown, I think you do the Prime Minister an injustice. I do not believe he treats this glibly or lightly. If you read his contribution in the Monthly Magazine I think you will see he has a deep commitment to wanting to address these issues at an international level and at the domestic level. I think you do him an injustice. I cannot agree with you that, because he has not written back to you, it means he is not interested in your views. I assure you that you should not take it personally.
The point I was making about this amendment not going far enough is that it is poorly targeted, because you are not targeting the people who created the problem; you are targeting the victims. When I say that it does not go far enough, it does not go far enough because you are actually not addressing the very people who deserve to be addressed. This is an important and substantive issue and it deserves to address the broader corporate sector and not just be amendments. I am not being pejorative when I say this: you said, ‘We don’t just want to move amendments.’ We are offering you the opportunity to do much more than that: to be part of a process that will deliver a substantive policy and not just be an amendment. As I say, I am not being pejorative when I say that; I am responding to how you described it. You do have more ideas and you have got a broader agenda than simply this amendment. The best way to progress that broader agenda and those broader ideas is to work with Allan Fels, to work with the Productivity Commission so that we actually address those that deserve to be dealt with.
As you would be aware from my past responsibilities, I have put forward many, many suggestions about how to curb corporate excess. I have a range of ideas that I would like also to see incorporated by the Productivity Commission and the government’s response to this disgraceful behaviour. I would say to you, though, Senator Brown, that I have never thought of you as jaded. You have been in the chamber a lot longer than me. I know that you have moved many amendments over many years. It is a bit like Senator Murray, who I think kept a tally of all the times he moved one particular amendment and was defeated. He was never jaded, either. I think you do yourself a disservice to suggest that you are jaded by wanting to pursue this policy agenda. I myself pursued it for over six years—in fact, before that: I was active before I was even on the front bench.
—What was your success rate?
—I got a couple of amendments up ultimately in the chamber—with your support, can I say.
—Here is your opportunity.
—But my point generally to you, Senator Brown, is that this does not go anywhere near far enough. This does not even, I believe, genuinely address the people who deserve to be addressed. I have moved on from those previous responsibilities but I still share your frustration at the greed and bad behaviour of many in the corporate world. They have brought the world to its knees by their, at times, criminal behaviour, by their greedy behaviour, by their deceitful behaviour. I just think there is a more comprehensive suite of measures that could come forward that more directly target this area.
So, as I said, we will not be able to support this foreshadowed amendment, but I urge you to support the bill even if your amendment is unsuccessful. It is not a question of taking you for granted or taking the Greens for granted on this issue. This is an issue on which a substantial body of work is being prepared, and I urge you to participate in that process. Allan Fels is a man of significant integrity. He deserves the chance to hear your views and your policy responses. I would hope that, even if your amendment is not successful, you will not use the defeat of that amendment as an excuse to sink a measure that is actually necessary to protect jobs in this country you but that will pursue with us an opportunity for a suite of measures that is far more substantial than just this one lone amendment.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-05-14,"—by leave—I move Family First amendments (1), (3) and (7), on sheet 5785 revised, together:
(1)    Clause 4, page 2 (after line 25), after the definition of enforcement resolution, insert:

lending criteria means the criteria used by a provider of financing or refinancing to decide whether or not to provide financing or refinancing.
(3)    Clause 8, page 5 (line 11), omit “and (5)”, substitute “, (5) and (5A)”.
(7)    Clause 8, page 6 (after line 17), after subclause (5), insert:
Lending criteria
      (5A)    ABIP Limited must be satisfied that the lending criteria applied by ABIP Limited in assessing the application for financing or refinancing under the arrangement are no less prudent than the lending criteria for investment grade loans that the members of ABIP Limited (other than the Commonwealth) would apply when deciding whether to enter into such an arrangement in the ordinary course of their business.
These amendments concern legislating lending criteria. This is all about making sure that up to $28 billion from the public purse has good governance around it, and is not left it to regulations. To have the very key area of lending criteria determined not by this parliament but by regulation I think would be very dangerous. So the amendments Family First have put forward here are to legislate the lending criteria. It makes sense that the lending criteria are no less strict than those required by other commercially competitive banks. So that is what we are seeking to do with these amendments. It is prudent and it makes sense to do it as the parliament rather than leaving it to regulations, and that is what these particular amendments are about.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,33,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2009-05-14,"—Could I indicate that, as to clause 8, page 6, lines 8 to 11 of Senator Fielding’s amendments, the government very reluctantly will support that. Clause 8, page 6, lines 16 and 17 we, equally reluctantly, support. We welcome clause 8, page 6, after line 17—the amendment that ensures that lending criteria are of a high standard and that the standard is set down in law. As I indicated, we reluctantly support the absolute time limit on time of loans, and we reluctantly support the limit to commercial property. But we do expect the Senate’s cooperation if ABIP is required to lend outside commercial property to support jobs. If that circumstance arises, we will return and we will need to deal with that very speedily because of the structure of the legislation that we are putting in place today. So we would hope that we can expect the chamber’s cooperation on that matter.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-05-14,"—by leave—In relation to the Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009, I move amendments (2), (4) and (5) on sheet 5785 as revised:
(2)    Clause 7, page 5 (line 4), after “Limited”, insert “, and approved by the Minister,”.
(4)    Clause 8, page 6 (lines 8 to 11), omit paragraph (3)(b), substitute:
              (b)    is an arrangement of a kind:
                    (i)    that all the members of ABIP Limited agree, in writing, that ABIP Limited may enter into; and
                   (ii)    that the Minister approves in writing, provided that:
                       (A)    the time provided for by section 46B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 for the disallowance of the Minister’s approval has expired and the approval has not been disallowed by either House of the Parliament; or
                        (B)    the Minister’s approval has been specifically approved by resolution of each House of the Parliament.
(5)    Clause 8, page 6 (before line 12), before subclause (4), insert:
      (3A)    An approval under subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) is not a legislative instrument, but is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
These amendments go to, I suppose, an area that has been a little contentious—what ABIP can actually refinance, or what types of loans they can provide. The whole premise of ABIP as it was put forward in the public’s mind was about helping commercial property funding. The idea here is that there is a tightening of funds and there could be some circumstances where commercial property comes up for refinancing. They are very complex issues. One partner of a syndicate might, for various reasons, pull out. It could be because an overseas bank or financier, having had restrictions or limitations placed on them, is unable to refinance their portion of a particular loan for commercial property.
The whole idea was that the focus would be on commercial property. In the legislation it also said the financing could be for other things, and I think that makes it too open ended. Parliament would be giving broad approval without knowing what these other things were actually for. I do not want to overly focus on the other things as we could get quite emotive and raise a few items that could be considered other things. I think it is very prudent that, if you are going to have up to $28 billion of funds from the public purse, there needs to be some confidence about what it is going to be used for. What we have to do is make sure it is for commercial property, but if ABIP and the minister believe they need to do financing in areas other than commercial property, then it really has to come back to parliament basically to make sure that approval is given before ABIP actually makes the loan. That is what those amendments (2), (4) and (5) on sheet 5785 are actually doing.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-05-14,"—by leave— In relation to the Australian Business Investment Partnership Bill 2009, I move amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 5794:
(1)    Clause 4, page 2 (after line 7), after the definition of ABIP Limited, insert:

ACCC means the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission established by section 6A of the Trade Practices Act 1974, and includes a member of the Commission or a Division of the Commission performing the functions of the Commission.
(2)    Clause 4, page 3 (after line 5), after the definition of loan, insert:

member of the Commission has the same meaning as in the Trade Practices Act 1974.
(3)    Page 10 (after line 30), after clause 16, insert:
16A ACCC’s functions
         (1)    The ACCC’s functions under this Act are set out in this section. In performing these functions the ACCC may exercise any of the powers it has under the Trade Practices Act 1974.
ACCC to prepare competition impact statement
         (2)    The ACCC must prepare a competition impact statement in accordance with this section.
         (3)    The statement must identify the potential costs and benefits to competition and consumers of exempting ABIP Limited and its activities from competition laws.
         (4)    The ACCC must give to the Minister a copy of the statement not later than 3 months after the commencement of this Act. As soon as practicable after the Minister is given the copy, the Minister must cause it to be laid before each House of the Parliament.
ACCC to monitor competition exemption
         (5)    The ACCC must prepare a competition exemption report in accordance with this section as soon as practicable after 30 June of each financial year:
              (a)    that commences on or after 1 July 2010; and
              (b)    in which a financing arrangement is entered into under section 8.
         (6)    The report must:
              (a)    identify the costs and benefits to competition and consumers of exempting ABIP Limited and its activities from competition laws; and
              (b)    express an opinion as to:
                    (i)    whether the benefits to competition and consumers of ABIP Limited and its activities during the preceding 12 months outweighed the costs to competition and consumers; and
                   (ii)    if under subparagraph (i) the opinion is expressed that those benefits outweighed those costs during the preceding 12 months—whether there have been any material changes in circumstances such that the costs or potential costs to competition and consumers of ABIP Limited and its activities now outweigh the benefits to competition and consumers.
         (7)    The ACCC must give to the Minister a copy of the report as soon as practicable after preparing it. As soon as practicable after the Minister is given the copy, the Minister must cause it to be laid before each House of the Parliament.
Identifying costs and benefits
         (8)    In identifying and reporting on the costs and benefits to competition and consumers, the ACCC must have particular regard to the matters set out in Part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974.
Interpretation
         (9)    In this section:

exempting ABIP Limited and its activities from competition laws means specifying, and specifically authorising, the conduct referred to in subsection 16(1) for the purposes of subsection 51(1) of the Trade Practices Act 1974.
These amendments relate to the ACCC monitoring the exemption granted to ABIP and the ACCC being required to prepare a competition impact statement. I discussed this during my second reading contribution. I have had discussions with the government and I believe that the ACCC has an important role in monitoring the exemption and its impact on consumers and in identifying the costs and benefits for competition and consumers of exempting ABIP from competition laws. I am grateful to associate Professor Frank Zumbo from the University of New South Wales for his advice and suggestions.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-05-14,"—We have had some extensive debate on the important amendment from the Australian Greens which would put a cap on salaries of $1 million for those who are to benefit out of the loans arrangements that are facilitated by this legislation. The minister has said that our amendments do not go far enough in terms of restricting what the Prime Minister has described as obscene take-home payments. I want to be more direct with the minister about this. The Greens will not be supporting this legislation if the government does not agree either to the amendment that we have put forward or to an alternative which satisfies us that the government is taking action, as have many similar countries around the world. The debate on this legislation is now going to go into the next period of sittings. I expect that the Prime Minister will engage in discussions with the Greens to come up with a provision which at least deals with the potential for CEOs of development organisations to have millions of dollars going to them in one way or another in take-home moneys from corporations which have at-risk loan arrangements guaranteed through the government.
I hope that the government understands clearly how important this measure is as far as the Greens are concerned. I make this offer to the government that we have serious negotiations about how to bring in an amendment, if the government cannot support this amendment, which does put a cap on those beneficiaries of the loan arrangements that are in here at the taxpayer’s expense. It is a serious matter and we want it taken seriously. We want action on it. I can do no more than make this public appeal, having written to the Prime Minister a number of times to get some action from the government on the matter.

I understand that Defence was required under subpoena to provide all Defence imagery concerning the incident to the Northern Territory police to assist with the criminal investigation into the incident. Because of the ongoing Northern Territory police criminal investigation, Defence is not authorised to publicly release any of this imagery at this time. I can also say, and this might be of interest to some senators, that I have been advised now that a small quantity of imagery, consisting of approximately 20 seconds of video footage of the aftermath of the explosion together with approximately 20 photographs, was cleared for public release by the Northern Territory police. I am also advised that Defence subsequently released that imagery and that is the only imagery that Defence has released at this time.
Finally, if it assists the Senate I can say that the Northern Territory police remain in possession of all other Defence imagery concerning this incident. As the Northern Territory police investigation progresses I am advised that the police will continue to formally advise Defence when imagery can be subsequently released. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would be aware, before I had that further advice provided to me I indicated that I would take on notice that particular matter that Senator Ferguson raised in relation to one of the supplementary questions.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2009-05-14,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Human Services (Senator Ludwig) to questions without notice asked by senators Cormann and Boyce today relating to private health insurance.
Australians have been deceived by this government; they have been conned. The 11 million Australians who take additional responsibility for their healthcare needs by taking out private cover have been conned. And I say to those 11 million Australians: you cannot believe a word this government say when they make public policy commitments on private health insurance.
Today we heard Senator Ludwig’s answers, and it was very clear that he had no idea whatsoever as to what the impact of his government’s policy would be on the 11 million Australians taking additional responsibility for their own healthcare needs. He tried to use a figure of 25,000 Australians, and was sneering at me for asking a supplementary question. He said: ‘You didn’t listen to the answer; you just read your supplementary.’ And all he did was read out a pre-prepared question time brief without having any idea what he was advising the Senate about. There are 1.8 million Australians who will face automatic increases in the cost of their private health insurance premiums.
—I said 1.7 million.
—So 1.7 million? I am pleased to hear that the minister is still listening. There are 1.7 million Australians facing an automatic increase in the cost of their private health insurance—up to 42 per cent—as a result of the government’s actions.
Labor has form on this, of course. Labor has been waging an ideological war on Australians with private health insurance for decades. From Whitlam to Hawke to Keating, they have been at it. After the Hawke and Keating governments, the proportion of Australians with private health insurance plummeted from 63 per cent to 30 per cent before the Howard government was able to turn the ship around and restore some balance in our health system. This government, in opposition, said they were going to be different, that they had learnt from their mistakes of the past, they knew that what Whitlam and Hawke and Keating had done to our health system by undermining Australians with private health insurance was the wrong thing to do. They made an absolutely clear and unequivocal commitment that they were going to retain the private health insurance rebate. They said, ‘We won’t touch it.’
Those of us on this side of the chamber were a bit suspicious as to how genuine that commitment was. We asked questions in the lead-up to the last election. We raised doubts. We were not quite sure that the Labor Party really meant it when they said they would retain the existing private health insurance rebate. Do you know what the then opposition health spokeswoman, Nicola Roxon, said it was? She said it was a Liberal scare campaign. She put out a press release on 26 September 2007 that said:
Federal Labor rejects the Liberal scare campaign around the Private Health Insurance rebates.
The Liberal Party scare campaign this morning reared its head …
On many occasions for many months, Federal Labor has made it crystal clear that we are committed to retaining all of the existing Private Health Insurance rebates…
The now Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition, wrote to the Australian Health Insurance Association. He said:
Both my Shadow Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, and I have made it clear that we are totally committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebate.
That was before the election. We asked questions, being suspicious in the context of Peter Garrett’s remarks: ‘Once we get in, we will just change it all.’ We asked questions again and again in estimates. We asked: ‘Are you sure? Are you really committed?’ Leo Shanahan from the Age did some good investigative journalistic work. He wrote an article about Treasury advice recommending to the government that it should scrap the rebate. So questions were asked. And what did the health minister, Nicola Roxon, say only in February this year? She said that the government was firmly committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebate. Now of course we know that at that time the government was busily working on plans to scrap the rebate.
This is a blatant broken promise that will hurt not only Australians with private health insurance, but all Australians who need timely and affordable access to quality hospital care. By pushing people out of private health insurance, by pushing people into public hospitals that are already overburdened and overstretched, the government is going to make it harder for people who currently have to rely on the public system by forcing them to compete with people who have left their private cover.
The minister today said, ‘Last year you said a million people would leave.’ No, actually Treasury modelling said that 660,000 Australians would leave private health insurance’—and their savings were based on it. He knows that it is much too early to assess the impact. We have not even had one quarter of membership data since the watered down version of their attack last year was implemented. This is a government that has form in its ideological war on private health and people cannot trust a word it is saying on private health insurance. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2009-05-14,"—I want to take a moment to talk about the context in which the budget was framed before I move on to the private health insurance issue. The Rudd Labor government has crafted its second budget, and it contains the building blocks of Australia’s future productivity and prosperity.

Senator Cormann interjecting—

—I listened to you in silence, Senator Cormann. The budget has been designed to support jobs and small businesses by investing in the infrastructure we need for tomorrow. As the Treasurer has reiterated on many occasions, this budget was framed in the most challenging economic conditions since the Great Depression. We have seen the global financial crisis contribute to the write-down of government revenues to the tune of $210 billion. This, of course, has had a major impact on the budget, so the Treasurer has made some tough choices. Those tough choices involve significant savings measures which the government knows may not be very popular. But they are the right choices and they will help us to steer the budget back into surplus in the future. The budget will help deliver growth to Australia so that the economy is ready and in a position to capitalise when the global recession turns around and a recovery takes place.
The changes to private health insurance are about a rebalance so that those who have the greater capacity to pay for their own health insurance do so. It is consistent with the government’s commitment to maintaining the balance between public and private health systems that high-income earners will receive less in government payments for their private health insurance but will face an increase in cost should they opt out of their health cover. From 1 July 2010, the government will introduce three new private health insurance tiers so that the higher income earners receive less carrot and more stick to be insured. All income thresholds will continue to remain indexed to wages, keeping these changes fair and sustainable into the future. These changes will affect around 10 per cent of Australian adults. For low- and middle-income earners, the existing 30, 35 and 40 per cent private health insurance rebates will remain in place.
I would like to take a moment to repeat some of the comments made yesterday by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon. She said:
We are maintaining a very hefty public supplement for those people who take out private health insurance, but what we have done is said that those who are high-income earners should pull their weight a little bit more. So it is basically what it is all about and, as you have heard, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been discussing this across the board not just for private health insurance. We think that people who are earning higher incomes should have private health insurance. We do not think the taxpayer should pay even more for their rebate than they pay for lower income earners.
She also went on to discuss the projections. She is on record as saying that the projection for the number of people that will pull out is very small. It is about 25,000 people. When you have nearly 10 million people insured, that is a tiny number—and you have to remember that the industry, when we made the small changes to the surcharge last year, were out speculating that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people would pull out of private health insurance. Those opposite were also, of course, a part of that dishonest scare campaign about those changes made last year, saying out there in the community that hundreds of thousands of people would pull out.
What we have seen is that the rebate, as it currently stands, has become unsustainable. Minister Ludwig said today, in his answers to questions from those opposite, that the policy has been changed because the private health rebate was becoming unsustainable in the budget that has taken a $200 billion hit as a result of the biggest global financial crisis since the Great Depression. The government is making important structural reforms in this area to rebalance support for private health insurance and to put expenditure onto a sustainable footing for the future. (Time expired)

"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2009-05-14,"—I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Ludwig. I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate the decision by the Rudd government to reduce or remove the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. The idea that singles earning over $74,000 and couples earning over $150,000 will have their 30 per cent rebate reduced or removed is an insult to the Australian people. If you ask any member of the public who is currently earning $74,000 whether they consider themselves to be the wealthy that the Rudd government is targeting, I can assure you that their answer would be a resounding ‘no’. These people are paying mortgages, loans, rates and bills, and they are trying to get ahead in life. Their private health insurance allows them the security of knowing that if they require medical treatment it is available to them. In turn, this frees up the public health system, which is currently struggling to cope with increased waiting lists. Instead, the Rudd government has made the decision to reduce the 30 per cent rebate, which I have no doubt will mean that many people will leave the private health system or drop their ancillary cover. This is a very important issue and I will speak about it later.
In the budget papers, section 2, ‘Department outcomes, program 9.1, key performance indicators’ at page 256 states that the number of people currently covered by private health insurance hospital treatment cover will be maintained at 9.7 million. This target has been set for three years of the budget up until 2012-13. I would ask how a target set at 9.7 million will remain the same for three years. What this means is that the government has decided that the number of people who have private health insurance will not increase; it will remain the same. If these targets forecast by the government are maintained, and private health insurance membership does not increase over 9.7 million, then the proportion of the population insured will decline to 41.7 per cent. Compare this to the current trend in private health insurance membership of the last two years. If this were to continue, the proportion of the population with hospital cover would increase to 50.2 per cent. The difference in the proportion of the population forecast by the government to be covered by hospital insurance against current trends in 2012-13 will be almost 1.8 million people. To put this into perspective, Western Australia has a population of two million and if the whole of Western Australia had to rely on the public health system, there would be a meltdown. The system is not coping at the moment and it certainly could not cope with this extra group of people.
The projected cost of these 1.8 million people—the same amount that would be expended in the private hospital sector if these people were insured—would mean that the public hospital systems would require an additional $4.8 billion over the four-year period from 2009-10 to 2012-13 to cover in-hospital costs. I would like to know where the current government is going to find an extra $4.8 billion. How will Mr Rudd and Mr Swan be able to come up with this extra $4.8 billion to ensure the public health system is able to look after the extra 1.8 million people?
I would now like to speak about the ancillary cover. It is not just our public health system that is at risk; it is also the public dental system. For example, if people were to drop their current ancillary cover, this would mean that their current cover of $3,000 per year would reduce to $2,000 per year, but their health provider would have the same outgoings with a reduced amount of revenue. To cover this, everyone’s premium would have to increase, including for ancillary cover. If the amount for ancillary cover is increased, further people will drop their cover. This would result in a huge drop in the number of people covered. Considering that currently 50 per cent of ancillary cover is dental, if people were to drop their dental cover this would do one thing: it would flood the public dental service, which is already at crisis point.
At present, dental decay is the most common disease in Australia, with 19 million people having existing decayed teeth and 11 million people with newly-decayed teeth each year. If more people were to transfer from the private to the public dental system, we can guess at how these numbers would increase. The drop in dental cover due to the reduction in the rebate currently available to many Australians would drive a stake through the heart of the public dental system. Did Mr Swan or Mr Rudd think about this as they reduced the rebate? I do not think they did. (Time expired)

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2009-05-14,"—I respect Senator Adams’s genuine concerns about the operation of the Australian health system, but I think it is important to point out the circumstances in which the government has found itself in dealing with these issues. As Senator Carol Brown noted, we face the worst financial crisis in this country since the Great Depression. As much as the government would like to do all things for all people, the practical reality of the circumstances in which we find ourselves is that it is simply not going to be possible. The Treasurer pointed out that we have had something like a $20 billion drop in our receipts in the framing of this budget. We know where that is coming from. It is coming from Senator Adams’s home state, it is coming from the mining industry, and businesses generally are finding it far more difficult to operate. That is affecting the amount of money that the government has available to spend on health. As a result of that, we need to rebalance the way in which we provide support for the private health system. In particular, we have to ensure that any changes we make to the system provide for a fairer distribution of benefits. That is really the underpinning basis upon which this government has approached the issue and, in particular, how it looks at the way in which lower income earners are treated through the system.
Senator Adams raised a number of issues about the possibility of people leaving the system as a result of the changes that are being proposed by the government. But we heard all of that last year, when the opposition was opposing the changes the government was then making—
—They were watered down twice—
—We have heard all of these arguments before by the opposition, and to some extent it is simply a case of—
—Treasury modelling!
—I sat and listened to Senator Adams in silence. I would appreciate the same courtesy, Senator Cormann. We have heard all of these arguments before. They did not come to fruition last time. In fact, my understanding is that maybe the change has actually resulted in a slight increase in the number of people taking out private health benefits.
I think there are some important facts that need to be brought to the table in this debate. I have talked about some of the difficult economic circumstances that we find ourselves in. Currently approximately 14 per cent of single taxpayers who have incomes above $74,000 receive about 28 per cent of the total public health insurance rebate paid to singles. Under the new reforms that we are proposing, these single taxpayers will receive about 12 per cent of the total public health rebate paid to singles. Similarly, approximately 12 per cent of couple taxpayers who have incomes above $150,000 currently receive approximately 21 per cent of the total public health insurance rebate paid to couples. Under the new reforms, these couple taxpayers will receive about nine per cent of the total public health rebate paid to couples.
Another important factor in this debate is the Treasury modelling. It estimates that, under the reforms that the government is proposing as part of the current budget, 99.7 per cent of people are expected to remain in private health insurance. So there is almost no change to the system, based on the Treasury modelling that the government has done on this issue. The reason for this is that the higher income earners who receive a lower rebate will face a higher tax penalty avoiding— (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2009-05-14,"—I would like to take note of answers given by Senator Ludwig during question time, particularly in relation to some further comments he made about the question that I asked him. Senator Ludwig claimed that it was not legitimate to use comments that he had made during a debate around the privatisation of Medibank Private in the current situation, which—using Labor-speak—is not the privatisation of Medibank Private but the turning of Medibank Private into a hollow log for the government. It will still be a for-profit company. It will be owned by the government. It may not be owned by the public as it would be if it were a private company. It will just be paying out to the government.
I mention again the comments made at the time by Senator Ludwig, who said during a discussion about whether Medibank Private should be a private company—that is, a for-profit company—that it stands to reason that if you have to generate a profit that places an additional burden on premiums. That was said by Senator Ludwig in 2006. He wants to obfuscate now and claim that that related only to privatising Medibank Private, not to creating a Medibank Private government owned business enterprise which—guess what?—will pay taxes and distribute dividends. I thought that this would have suggested that the two were not entirely dissimilar. And we are told that Medibank Private is to become a government owned business enterprise in the name of competitive neutrality—that is, that this enterprise will do exactly what private, for-profit insurers in this market are required to do. It will pay taxes and it will distribute dividends. So I am still a little puzzled what the difference in market forces on the premiums of Medibank Private in its new guise might be that would make it any different from any other company in this space or different from a privatised Medibank Private.
Let us look at why the government would not want to turn Medibank Private into a private company. It is about who gets the dividends. This is an exercise that has been turned into a fine and high art by the state Labor governments of Australia: ripping the profits out of government owned enterprises to prop up their own inadequate, deficit-ridden economies. Time after time, successful organisations have been ruined, leaving states with energy crises because so much money was ripped out of the electricity providers. States have had water crises because no funds were left in the government owned enterprises to build the infrastructure necessary to maintain population growth.
Now we have another hollow log that the Labor government has created in the name of competitive neutrality so it can rip some of the profits out of Medibank Private, out of the hands of private patients and private medical practitioners in Australia, and stick them in its own little pocket in an attempt to mitigate the worst excesses of the deficit that it has allowed to develop. There is only one reason this has become a government owned enterprise and not a not-for-profit company. We also had Senator Ludwig telling us that only 25,000 people will drop out. This is yet another example of the politics of envy that the government practises. Only 12,000 people lost the baby bonus—the numbers go on and on. The government is cherry picking people who deserve better treatment. (Time expired)

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-05-14,"—I present the government’s response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on its inquiry into supporting families through disability trusts, and seek leave to have the document incorporated in Hansard.

Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY AFFAIRS’ REPORT
Building trust: Supporting families through Disability Trusts
This is the Australian Government’s response to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs Inquiry into Special Disability Trusts, Building trust: Supporting families through Disability Trusts, as tabled on 16 October 2008.
The Government welcomed this inquiry and acknowledges the importance of the Committee’s findings in highlighting ways that Special Disability Trusts could be enhanced to more readily assist those families who are in a position to make private financial provision for a family member with severe disability.
The Government has engaged extensively with carers and people with disability, and it is aware of the concerns of parents and carers about what will happen to their family member with disability when they are no longer able to continue their caring role.  Given that the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported 6,400 parent carers aged over 65 and a further 44,400 in the age group 45 to 64 in its 2003 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers, it is critical that we find ways to support carers and families in their caring role and to help them plan for the future care needs of their family member with disability.
The Special Disability Trust measure was introduced to allow aged parents/carers, who had the capacity to do so, to contribute to the current and future care of their family member with severe disability without these contributions impacting on their income support payments.  The rules around Special Disability Trusts were intended to ensure maximum protection of the beneficiary’s interests and peace of mind for the parents/carers that their arrangements for the future care and accommodation of their family member would be carried out as they intended.  Nonetheless it was anticipated that a greater number of inter vivos Special Disability Trusts would have been established within the first two years of the measure’s introduction.
Over the past 12 months, the Government has progressed a range of significant initiatives to support people with disability, their families and carers.  These initiatives have involved national consultation on the development of a National Disability Strategy, a national policy statement which will maximise inclusion and set the directions and priorities for the development of legislation, policy and financing of services that respond to the needs of people with disability, their families and carers.  It has also included working collaboratively with State and Territory governments to develop a National Disability Agreement from 1 January 2009 which will see significant reforms to the disability services system and a Commonwealth investment of $5.3 billion over the next five years. 
In April 2008 the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, the Hon Bill Shorten MP, established the Disability Investment Group to explore innovative ideas from the private sector that will help people with disability and their families access greater support and plan for the future.
The Government is considering changes to Special Disability Trusts within the context of the Disability Investment Group’s report and other work the Government is currently undertaking to support people with disability, their families and carers, such as consultations in developing the National Disability Strategy.
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY AFFAIRS’ REPORT
Building trust: Supporting families through Disability Trusts

Recommendation 1

The committee recommends that the special disability trust eligibility requirements in section 1209M of the Social Security Act 1991 be amended to:
Remove section 1209M(b);
Include eligibility requirements which effectively enable those with intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses to become beneficiaries of special disability trusts.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to an amendment to section 1209M of the Social Security Act 1991 and section 52ZZZWA of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 to make it easier for people with intellectual disability and/or mental illness to be eligible as beneficiaries for a Special Disability Trust.

Recommendation 2

The committee recommends that the asset value limit for special disability trusts in section 1209Y of the Social Security Act 1991 be increased to $1,000,000 and annually indexed according to a rate which reflects ordinary investment returns or the Consumer Price Index whichever is greater.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to an amendment to section 1209Y of the Social Security Act 1991 and section 52ZZZWK of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 to increase the assets concessional limit in the context of the overall taxation and social security concessions applying to Special Disability Trusts.
The Government notes however that the original limit of $500,000 is indexed and currently stands at $532,000 at 1 July 2008.  As the principal residence of the beneficiary is exempt as an assessable asset, consistent with the assets test under social security and veterans’ entitlement provisions, Special Disability Trust assets can currently exceed $1 million and remain within the current concessional limit.
In addition to the principal residence exemption, there is an assets test free area of up to $171,750 for a single homeowner or $243,500 for couples who are homeowners and $296,250 for a single non‑homeowner or $368,000 for couples who are non‑homeowners.
Increasing the assets concessional limit significantly, may raise issues relating to the equity of income support for people with disability and the need to balance equity considerations with the encouragement of private investment by those who can afford to contribute toward the cost of their own care.

Recommendation 3

The committee recommends that the provisions relating to the special disability trust gifting concession be amended to annually index the gifting concession limit to the rate applied to the special disability trust asset value limit.

Response

The Government does not agree to this recommendation.  The non-indexation of the current gifting concession aligns with broader social security gifting provisions.  Any change to include indexation of the gifting concession for Special Disability Trusts would therefore have broader implications.

Recommendation 4

The committee recommends that, if after adoption of the recommendations in this report there is no improvement in the uptake of special disability trusts after two years, options to expand eligibility for the gifting concession should be reviewed.

Response

The Government agrees in-principle to this recommendation.  It notes that there would be no budgetary impact given that the current $500,000 concession would be shared by a larger pool of contributors.  The Government also notes that a low take-up, despite the implementation of other recommendations, may not be attributable to the current restriction of the gifting concession to immediate family members.

Recommendation 5

The committee recommends that the tax arrangements applying to SDTs be changed so that:
the sale of a property that is owned by a special disability trust and used by the beneficiary as their principal place of residence be treated the same as any other person’s principal place of residence, that is, exempt of capital gains tax;
the transfer of property and other assets to a special disability trust is exempt from capital gains tax and stamp duty;
unexpended special disability trust income is taxed at the beneficiary’s personal income tax rate.

Response

The Government agrees in part to this recommendation.
The Government agrees to the recommendation to extend the capital gains tax main residence exemption to properties held in a Special Disability Trust that are used by the beneficiary as their main residence.  The Government will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
The Government does not agree with the recommendation to provide a capital gains tax exemption on the transfer of property and other assets to a Special Disability Trust.  To provide an exemption would mean that the capital gains tax law would treat taxpayers who transfer property and other assets to a Special Disability Trust differently from those who contribute using other sources of taxed income, such as wages.
Stamp duty is not an Australian Government tax and is a matter for State and Territory Governments to consider.  The Government notes that the Western Australian Government provides an exemption from stamp duty for properties transferred to a Special Disability Trust.  In addition, it has granted an exemption from land tax for families providing a residence for a family member with disability as well as concessions to land and water rates for such properties.
The Government agrees to the recommendation to tax unexpended income of a Special Disability Trust at the beneficiary’s personal income tax rate rather than the top personal rate of tax plus Medicare Levy.  The Government will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

Recommendation 6

The committee recommends that the allowable uses of special disability trusts be expanded to include all day-to-day living expenses that are met to maximise the beneficiary’s health, wellbeing, recreation and independence.

Response

The Government will request relevant portfolio Secretaries to revise the Social Security (Special Disability Trust) (FaHCSIA) Guidelines 2008, the Social Security (Special Disability Trust) (DEEWR) Guidelines 2008 and the Veterans’ Entitlements (Special Disability Trust) Guidelines 2008, within the provisions of the current legislation, to expand the list of examples of reasonable care and accommodation needs.
The Government agrees to give further consideration to amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 to expand what is a reasonable care or accommodation need.
The Government notes that the Disability Support Pension is provided to support a person’s day-to-day living expenses.  Any substantial opening up of the beneficiary eligibility criteria and allowable uses of Special Disability Trust funds may raise issues relating to the equity of income support for people with disability.

Recommendation 7

The committee recommends that unexpended income from a special disability trust be able to be contributed, on a pre-tax basis, to a superannuation fund for the trust beneficiary.

Response

The Government does not agree with this recommendation to enable a Special Disability Trust to contribute to a superannuation fund for the trust beneficiary as a “concessional contribution”, with the trust being able to claim a tax deduction for that contribution.
The Government notes that a change to implement that part of recommendation five above to tax the unexpended income of a Special Disability Trust at the beneficiary’s personal income tax rate will mean that a Special Disability Trust may, in any event, pay less than the 15 per cent tax imposed on contributions made to superannuation.
It also notes that superannuation may not be the most appropriate vehicle for supporting beneficiaries of Special Disability Trusts as superannuation is designed for retirement purposes.

Recommendation 8

The committee recommends that when a special disability trust is used to purchase a first home for the trust beneficiary, the First Home Owner Grant should apply and be payable to the trust.

Response

The Government does not agree with this recommendation for the following reasons:
One of the principles of the First Home Owners Scheme is that the applicant must be a natural person, which a Special Disability Trust is not.  This eligibility criterion was agreed to by all State and Territory governments and is provided for in each State and Territory’s enacting legislation.
The First Home Owners Scheme is administered and funded by the States and Territories consistent with the principles originally outlined in the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations and now contained in the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations.  A change to the principles in the Intergovernmental Agreement requires the agreement of all States and Territories as well as requiring each State and Territory to amend its enabling legislation.
To provide Special Disability Trusts with access to the First Home Owners Scheme grant may set a precedent for Special Disability Trusts to be given access to other concessions available only to natural persons.
The Government notes that the ‘natural person’ requirement of the Scheme does not necessarily preclude a beneficiary of a Special Disability Trust from accessing the grant.  Where beneficiaries are able to acquire property in their own name, they may apply for the grant themselves, or if subject to a power of attorney or a financial management/administration order, the grant may be applied for by the person holding the power of attorney on behalf of the beneficiary or managing their affairs under the financial management/administration order.

Recommendation 9

The committee recommends that the government review appropriate options to provide additional assistance to families establishing and maintaining a special disability trust including low cost legal and financial advice, as well as funding for development of long-term planning.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to this recommendation.

Recommendation 10

The committee recommends that requests for audits of a special disability trust be restricted to one external audit per financial year unless the Secretary of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs determines this restriction should be waived.

Response

The Government’s initial response to this recommendation is that it may have unintended consequences for families and beneficiaries in implementation.  The Government agrees to give further consideration to mechanisms for implementing this recommendation through amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 and/or amendments to the Social Security (Special Disability Trust – Trust Deed, Reporting and Audit Requirements) (FaCSIA) Determination 2006, the Veterans’ Entitlements (Special Disability Trust – Trust Deed, Reporting and Audit Requirements) Determination 2006, the Social Security (Special Disability Trust - Trust Deed, Reporting and Audit Requirements) (DEST) Determination 2006 and the Social Security (Special Disability Trust - Trust Deed, Reporting and Audit Requirements) (DEWR) Determination 2006.

Recommendation 11

The committee recommends that the single trust rule in Section1209M (6) of the Social Security Act 1991 be amended to allow two trusts for each beneficiary.

Response

The Government does not agree to this recommendation.  The change would apply to very few families.  It would add complexity and compliance costs for Centrelink administration as well as create additional costs for families, given the significant costs of maintaining two trusts.  It would also create additional compliance cost for the Australian Taxation Office given the Government’s agreement to extend the capital gains tax main residence exemption to properties held in a Special Disability Trust that are used by the beneficiary as their main residence.

Recommendation 12

The committee recommends that Centrelink be designated as the agency responsible and accountable for ensuring that special disability trusts are promoted and understood among families caring for members with disability.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to this recommendation.  It notes that Centrelink has not had prime responsibility for promotion or education of special disability trusts to date.  Additional costs of promoting awareness of Special Disability Trusts through Centrelink will need to be considered.

Recommendation 13

The committee recommends that the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in partnership with industry bodies and peak carer associations develop a training package for financial and legal advisers focussed on future planning for carers of people with disability, including special disability trusts.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to this recommendation.
The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is examining ways to better partner with industry bodies and peak carer associations within current resources.

Recommendation 14

The committee recommends that the government consider changing the name of special disability trusts, for example to disability support trusts.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to this recommendation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,38,1

Recommendation 1

The committee recommends that the special disability trust eligibility requirements in section 1209M of the Social Security Act 1991 be amended to:
Remove section 1209M(b);
Include eligibility requirements which effectively enable those with intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses to become beneficiaries of special disability trusts.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to an amendment to section 1209M of the Social Security Act 1991 and section 52ZZZWA of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 to make it easier for people with intellectual disability and/or mental illness to be eligible as beneficiaries for a Special Disability Trust.

Recommendation 2

The committee recommends that the asset value limit for special disability trusts in section 1209Y of the Social Security Act 1991 be increased to $1,000,000 and annually indexed according to a rate which reflects ordinary investment returns or the Consumer Price Index whichever is greater.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to an amendment to section 1209Y of the Social Security Act 1991 and section 52ZZZWK of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 to increase the assets concessional limit in the context of the overall taxation and social security concessions applying to Special Disability Trusts.
The Government notes however that the original limit of $500,000 is indexed and currently stands at $532,000 at 1 July 2008.  As the principal residence of the beneficiary is exempt as an assessable asset, consistent with the assets test under social security and veterans’ entitlement provisions, Special Disability Trust assets can currently exceed $1 million and remain within the current concessional limit.
In addition to the principal residence exemption, there is an assets test free area of up to $171,750 for a single homeowner or $243,500 for couples who are homeowners and $296,250 for a single non‑homeowner or $368,000 for couples who are non‑homeowners.
Increasing the assets concessional limit significantly, may raise issues relating to the equity of income support for people with disability and the need to balance equity considerations with the encouragement of private investment by those who can afford to contribute toward the cost of their own care.

Recommendation 3

The committee recommends that the provisions relating to the special disability trust gifting concession be amended to annually index the gifting concession limit to the rate applied to the special disability trust asset value limit.

Response

The Government does not agree to this recommendation.  The non-indexation of the current gifting concession aligns with broader social security gifting provisions.  Any change to include indexation of the gifting concession for Special Disability Trusts would therefore have broader implications.

Recommendation 4

The committee recommends that, if after adoption of the recommendations in this report there is no improvement in the uptake of special disability trusts after two years, options to expand eligibility for the gifting concession should be reviewed.

Response

The Government agrees in-principle to this recommendation.  It notes that there would be no budgetary impact given that the current $500,000 concession would be shared by a larger pool of contributors.  The Government also notes that a low take-up, despite the implementation of other recommendations, may not be attributable to the current restriction of the gifting concession to immediate family members.

Recommendation 5

The committee recommends that the tax arrangements applying to SDTs be changed so that:
the sale of a property that is owned by a special disability trust and used by the beneficiary as their principal place of residence be treated the same as any other person’s principal place of residence, that is, exempt of capital gains tax;
the transfer of property and other assets to a special disability trust is exempt from capital gains tax and stamp duty;
unexpended special disability trust income is taxed at the beneficiary’s personal income tax rate.

Response

The Government agrees in part to this recommendation.
The Government agrees to the recommendation to extend the capital gains tax main residence exemption to properties held in a Special Disability Trust that are used by the beneficiary as their main residence.  The Government will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.
The Government does not agree with the recommendation to provide a capital gains tax exemption on the transfer of property and other assets to a Special Disability Trust.  To provide an exemption would mean that the capital gains tax law would treat taxpayers who transfer property and other assets to a Special Disability Trust differently from those who contribute using other sources of taxed income, such as wages.
Stamp duty is not an Australian Government tax and is a matter for State and Territory Governments to consider.  The Government notes that the Western Australian Government provides an exemption from stamp duty for properties transferred to a Special Disability Trust.  In addition, it has granted an exemption from land tax for families providing a residence for a family member with disability as well as concessions to land and water rates for such properties.
The Government agrees to the recommendation to tax unexpended income of a Special Disability Trust at the beneficiary’s personal income tax rate rather than the top personal rate of tax plus Medicare Levy.  The Government will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

Recommendation 6

The committee recommends that the allowable uses of special disability trusts be expanded to include all day-to-day living expenses that are met to maximise the beneficiary’s health, wellbeing, recreation and independence.

Response

The Government will request relevant portfolio Secretaries to revise the Social Security (Special Disability Trust) (FaHCSIA) Guidelines 2008, the Social Security (Special Disability Trust) (DEEWR) Guidelines 2008 and the Veterans’ Entitlements (Special Disability Trust) Guidelines 2008, within the provisions of the current legislation, to expand the list of examples of reasonable care and accommodation needs.
The Government agrees to give further consideration to amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 to expand what is a reasonable care or accommodation need.
The Government notes that the Disability Support Pension is provided to support a person’s day-to-day living expenses.  Any substantial opening up of the beneficiary eligibility criteria and allowable uses of Special Disability Trust funds may raise issues relating to the equity of income support for people with disability.

Recommendation 7

The committee recommends that unexpended income from a special disability trust be able to be contributed, on a pre-tax basis, to a superannuation fund for the trust beneficiary.

Response

The Government does not agree with this recommendation to enable a Special Disability Trust to contribute to a superannuation fund for the trust beneficiary as a “concessional contribution”, with the trust being able to claim a tax deduction for that contribution.
The Government notes that a change to implement that part of recommendation five above to tax the unexpended income of a Special Disability Trust at the beneficiary’s personal income tax rate will mean that a Special Disability Trust may, in any event, pay less than the 15 per cent tax imposed on contributions made to superannuation.
It also notes that superannuation may not be the most appropriate vehicle for supporting beneficiaries of Special Disability Trusts as superannuation is designed for retirement purposes.

Recommendation 8

The committee recommends that when a special disability trust is used to purchase a first home for the trust beneficiary, the First Home Owner Grant should apply and be payable to the trust.

Response

The Government does not agree with this recommendation for the following reasons:
One of the principles of the First Home Owners Scheme is that the applicant must be a natural person, which a Special Disability Trust is not.  This eligibility criterion was agreed to by all State and Territory governments and is provided for in each State and Territory’s enacting legislation.
The First Home Owners Scheme is administered and funded by the States and Territories consistent with the principles originally outlined in the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations and now contained in the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations.  A change to the principles in the Intergovernmental Agreement requires the agreement of all States and Territories as well as requiring each State and Territory to amend its enabling legislation.
To provide Special Disability Trusts with access to the First Home Owners Scheme grant may set a precedent for Special Disability Trusts to be given access to other concessions available only to natural persons.
The Government notes that the ‘natural person’ requirement of the Scheme does not necessarily preclude a beneficiary of a Special Disability Trust from accessing the grant.  Where beneficiaries are able to acquire property in their own name, they may apply for the grant themselves, or if subject to a power of attorney or a financial management/administration order, the grant may be applied for by the person holding the power of attorney on behalf of the beneficiary or managing their affairs under the financial management/administration order.

Recommendation 9

The committee recommends that the government review appropriate options to provide additional assistance to families establishing and maintaining a special disability trust including low cost legal and financial advice, as well as funding for development of long-term planning.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to this recommendation.

Recommendation 10

The committee recommends that requests for audits of a special disability trust be restricted to one external audit per financial year unless the Secretary of the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs determines this restriction should be waived.

Response

The Government’s initial response to this recommendation is that it may have unintended consequences for families and beneficiaries in implementation.  The Government agrees to give further consideration to mechanisms for implementing this recommendation through amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 and/or amendments to the Social Security (Special Disability Trust – Trust Deed, Reporting and Audit Requirements) (FaCSIA) Determination 2006, the Veterans’ Entitlements (Special Disability Trust – Trust Deed, Reporting and Audit Requirements) Determination 2006, the Social Security (Special Disability Trust - Trust Deed, Reporting and Audit Requirements) (DEST) Determination 2006 and the Social Security (Special Disability Trust - Trust Deed, Reporting and Audit Requirements) (DEWR) Determination 2006.

Recommendation 11

The committee recommends that the single trust rule in Section1209M (6) of the Social Security Act 1991 be amended to allow two trusts for each beneficiary.

Response

The Government does not agree to this recommendation.  The change would apply to very few families.  It would add complexity and compliance costs for Centrelink administration as well as create additional costs for families, given the significant costs of maintaining two trusts.  It would also create additional compliance cost for the Australian Taxation Office given the Government’s agreement to extend the capital gains tax main residence exemption to properties held in a Special Disability Trust that are used by the beneficiary as their main residence.

Recommendation 12

The committee recommends that Centrelink be designated as the agency responsible and accountable for ensuring that special disability trusts are promoted and understood among families caring for members with disability.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to this recommendation.  It notes that Centrelink has not had prime responsibility for promotion or education of special disability trusts to date.  Additional costs of promoting awareness of Special Disability Trusts through Centrelink will need to be considered.

Recommendation 13

The committee recommends that the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in partnership with industry bodies and peak carer associations develop a training package for financial and legal advisers focussed on future planning for carers of people with disability, including special disability trusts.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to this recommendation.
The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is examining ways to better partner with industry bodies and peak carer associations within current resources.

Recommendation 14

The committee recommends that the government consider changing the name of special disability trusts, for example to disability support trusts.

Response

The Government agrees to give further consideration to this recommendation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,38,2

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-05-14,"—I seek leave to incorporate for the information of honourable senators the Leader of the Opposition’s response to the budget speech, delivered by Mr Turnbull in the House of Representatives earlier this evening.
Leave granted.

The speech read as follows—

Mr Speaker:
Australians are now paying the price for Labor’s reckless spending.
The enterprise and the energy of Australians coupled with the richness of our resources mean that with the right leadership our greatest days, our most prosperous days, should be in front of us.
But opportunities can be seized or they can be squandered.
On Tuesday night we should have had a Budget that laid out a foundation for recovery and growth.
We should have had a Budget that marked a path out of this downturn, offering confidence and hope for a better future.
Instead, what we were offered was a counsel of despair setting out no credible or convincing plan for economic recovery.
A Budget that just doesn’t add up.
A Budget so unbelievable that the Prime Minister is already running away from it - racing to an early election so that he can get to the polls before the full consequences of his mismanagement are felt by the Australian people.
Last year the Treasurer was filled with pride as he proclaimed a surplus built by others.
This year, he was so ashamed he could not bring himself, in a speech of 30 minutes, to even mention the $58 billion deficit he had created himself.
And he could not utter the words “$188 billion of net debt – the highest in our history – double the record under Paul Keating”.
That’s $9,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia.
The Prime Minister will run up more than twice as much debt in less than half the time as Paul Keating.
He says that this colossal figure of $188 billion is peak debt.
Mr Speaker, it is only a foothill at the base of what will be the Prime Minister’s towering summit of debt.
His Budget Papers boast for page after page of his national broadband network – $43 billion worth he says.
But the massive borrowings it will demand are not taken into account.
And who is to say it will be $43 billion?
The Prime Minister went on television to say it would be commercially viable and called on mums and dads to invest.
He did so without any business plan, any financial analysis – any responsible or reasonable basis to support what he was saying.
So what price the Prime Minister’s broadband dream?
Nobody knows – least of all the Prime Minister.
But we do know this – we will all pay for it and it will build that Labor mountain of debt.
And what about Rudd Bank – it will require $28 billion of Government borrowings – that isn’t to be found in the debt calculations.
And if all that is not enough – consider this: the Prime Minister is asking us to believe that between now and his $188 billion of “peak debt” there will be no new spending initiatives from his spendthrift Government.
Mr Speaker, there will come a time when Australians will look wistfully at $188 billion of debt and ask not when our debt will rise to that peak, but when it will descend to it.
And every single Australian will pay the price – it took the Coalition together with the Australian people ten years to pay off $96 billion of Keating Labor debt.
How many years, how many decades will it take us to pay off hundreds of billions of dollars of Rudd Labor debt?
The Prime Minister’s reckless borrowing and spending today is guaranteed to deliver higher interest rates and higher taxes in the future.
Because as we all know, debt has to be repaid with interest – whether it is a family’s credit card, or the credit card of the nation.
Already, self-reliant Australians who take out private health insurance are being asked to pay more in order to offset Labor’s reckless spending.
While the Coalition welcomes the Government adopting our proposal for an increase to the single age pension, the news was not good for all seniors, particularly those self-reliant Australians who seek to put money away for their retirement.
But that is the Labor way – making prudent and thrifty Australians pay for reckless and spendthrift Governments.
Labor blames this ocean of red ink entirely on the global financial crisis.
We can not forget that in November 2007 this Prime Minister was dealt the best hand of economic cards of any Prime Minister in our history.
All of Labor’s debt had been repaid – there was $45 billion of cash in the bank!
The Budget was strongly in surplus.
Unemployment was at historic lows and growth was strong.
Since November 2007 the Labor Government has chosen to increase spending by $124 billion – that is two thirds of the $188 billion debt we will accumulate in just four years.
And what we have got for it?
The same old Labor cocktail of higher debt, higher unemployment and higher deficits.
As the global downturn worsened late last year.
As it became more and more obvious that tax revenues were declining.
The Rudd Government embarked on the most profligate spending spree in our nation’s history.
The idea that a Government faced with a worsening financial climate would borrow $23 billion and give it away defies common sense.
They did not spend it on roads, or railways or bridges or ports.
They gave it away.
Most of it, naturally, was not spent, it was saved.
And so its impact on the economy was modest and short-lived.
In February when Labor presented its $42 billion economic stimulus package – so-called – we took the unpopular decision to oppose it and to offer a smaller and better targeted package, that would have more effectively protected Australian jobs.
Our advice was dismissed scornfully by a Prime Minister who always knows best. Who claims, repeatedly and untruthfully, that it’s his way or nothing.
The truth is that it didn’t have to be this way. Australia didn’t have to embark on this irresponsible, dangerous course of high deficits, high debt, and high unemployment. There was a better way forward, involving less debt, and less risk.

Our Measures

Our Plan for Recovery will be based on four key principles:
The protection and creation of jobs for all Australians.
Government should not incur one dollar more in debt than necessary.
Spending should be targeted at creating jobs and building economic infrastructure.
Private enterprise and small business must be supported as the drivers of economic growth.
As we develop and expand this Plan we have been meeting with small business people around the nation at nearly 50 Jobs for Australia Forums.
These enterprising men and women are the engine room of our economy.
We have listened to the challenges faced by small business in these difficult times and we have developed and will develop policies that will meet their concerns and respond to their suggestions.
At every forum whether it was in Darwin or Terrigal, Coffs Harbour or Burnie we heard concerns about the need for more effective incentives to take on and keep apprentices during these tough times.
Right around the country we heard complaints about the incredible burden of red tape – at Cleveland a young woman managing a small business told us of the elaborate five hour accounting exercise she was legally obliged to go through to calculate a diesel rebate – worth $27.
Or at Coffs Harbour, in the vital tourism industry, another woman told us of the incredible rigmarole she had gone through to establish a bed and breakfast and hire one part-time housekeeper.
And at every meeting there were concerns about cash flow – the Government’s 30 per cent depreciation allowance for equipment purchases was noted – but many said it was not much good to you if you were short of cash or didn’t need any new equipment.
Tonight, drawing on what we have learned from thousands of small business people around Australia, we propose a number of practical measures to support jobs and businesses, especially small businesses.
All of them have a modest cost – proving you don’t need to borrow recklessly to do the right thing by small business.

Tax loss carryback for business

If businesses make operating losses this year or next year, they should be able to carry them ‘back’ against previous year’s profits and recover, as a refund, up to $100,000 of taxes paid over the past three years.
This tax refund would bolster cash flows in difficult times. Because the tax loss carried back could not be carried forward the budgetary expense should be relatively neutral over the business cycle.

Fairer rules to deal with troubled businesses

Australia’s insolvency laws do not encourage the reconstruction and rehabilitation of businesses that hit hard times. Too many jobs, and too much value is lost when viable businesses are wound up or their assets sold in fire sales.
We support a change to our laws which will emphasise reconstruction of these businesses. Reform in this area, in these times, could save thousands of jobs that would otherwise be lost.

Cutting red tape and making it easier to do business with Government

The most consistent complaint we have heard from small businesses is excessive regulation and compliance.
The Coalition would reduce this burden to the lowest in the OECD, and join state and local governments to deliver a one-stop online portal for filings.
Many small businesses find the paperwork for Government tendering overly complex and inconsistent between departments and governments. Part of our reform will be to standardise and streamline procurement contracts and other processes.

Helping employers provide training for the recovery

We are taking up a suggestion we heard from many employers of apprentices in traditional trades who came to our Jobs For Australia Forums. They told us that two of the biggest barriers to apprenticeships are small business cash flow and wage costs. So we would direct a greater proportion of the incentives for those who take on an apprentice to the first two years of a traditional trade apprenticeship meaning employers will receive this support when they need it the most.
All of these measures are practical, pragmatic and job-focused measures that would greatly assist the economy in this difficult period.
They have been drawn from our first hand and ongoing engagement with small business – whether it is meeting in community halls around the country or on our www.jobsforaustralia.com website.

Budget Honesty

The sheer magnitude of the deterioration in our nation’s finances revealed by the Treasurer on Tuesday night raises a more serious and unsettling set of issues.
Labor has no strategy to return the Budget to surplus other than hoping that “something will turn up” – the something in this case being an incredible six successive years of above-trend growth of 4.5 per cent of GDP from 2011-12 – a scarcely believable boom.
Contrast it to the IMF’s more sober growth forecast for Australia in 2010 of 1.1 per cent.
Nobody believes this “best of all possible worlds” scenario is credible.
The recovery from this recession will not come in a rush – the days of cheap and easy credit that helped fuel the last boom are over, if not forever, for many, many years.
Australians deserve, and are entitled to expect an honest, objective and upfront appraisal of the nation’s circumstances – not to be buried beneath a daily avalanche of spin and media manipulation.

Commission for Sustainable Finances

We will appoint an independent Commission for Sustainable Finances to undertake a top-to-toe review of Commonwealth spending after the next election, to determine what levels of expenditure are sustainable and consistent with the need to address intergenerational equity.
The alarming expansion of spending under Labor makes this vitally important. Annual spending is projected to rise from $272 billion in 2007-08 to $342 billion in 2010-11 – the largest three year increase since the mid-1970s. The Commission’s task will be to help the next Coalition Government to identify and cut the waste in that spending.

Parliamentary Budget Office

The Coalition believes that honesty in fiscal policy would be served by the creation of an Australian version of America’s Congressional Budget Office which has for many years provided the Congress with objective and impartial advice and analysis on fiscal policy and the effects of new policies.
We would establish a Parliamentary Budget Office which would be:
Chartered to provide Parliament with independent, objective analysis of fiscal policy, including long-term projections of the impact of various measures on the economy, employment, real interest rates and debt levels.
Responsible to the Parliament rather than the Executive, much like the Auditor-General or Commonwealth Ombudsman.
Staffed with economic, accounting and actuarial experts, and overseen by a director with an independent tenure.
Governments never welcome greater scrutiny, and so I’m under no illusion that this proposal will be greeted with any great enthusiasm by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. But such a body would contribute greatly to a better-informed debate about fiscal policy alternatives and the consequences of different choices and trade-offs.
The Parliamentary Budget Office will be an invaluable mechanism in seeking to ensure that the damage done to this economy in just 18 months by this inexperienced and incompetent government never happens again.
2009 Budget Measures
Turning to the Budget measures themselves, the Prime Minister, in his desperate rush to find an excuse to go to an early election, has called on the Coalition to indicate how it will respond to the major savings measures in his Budget – the decisions that increase Government revenues or reduce Government expenditures.
Given the magnitude of the deficit, these so-called major savings measures are hardly heroic – in 2009-10 they amount to $ 1.5 billion, compared to a $57.6 billion deficit.
We in the Coalition showed our commitment to fiscal discipline in February by proposing a much smaller stimulus package and when that was rejected out of hand, by voting against the $42 billion package and its $14 billion cash splash.
Only this side of the House has had the courage to take a tough decision to restrain this debt and deficit blow out.
None of the savings measures in this Budget will make, by themselves, a material difference to the deficit.
We will consider them carefully and respond to them reasonably.
This deficit is already too big – we do not want to make it bigger.
But there is one savings measure in this Budget which we will oppose.
The changes to the private health insurance rebate are just the latest phase in Labor’s unrelenting war against private health insurance.
Labor hates private health insurance.
Labor hates it because it encourages self-reliance and because it offers choice.
Australians know that and that is why in the lead up to the last election the Prime Minister was asked time and time again whether he would change the private health insurance rebate.
Again and again he and his shadow health minister said they would not.
Never was an election promise given more emphatically and then broken so brazenly.
Every Australian knows that the cost of public health is growing as are the waiting lists for public hospitals.
Every Australian knows that as our population ages the need for more self reliance in the provision of health services becomes greater.
This broken promise will be a direct hit on the family budget of at least 1.7 million Australians and indirectly will result in higher premiums for all Australians – including those on very low incomes.
And it is just the beginning – the thin edge of the wedge.
And as private health insurance costs go up, more pressure is put on public hospitals.
The Prime Minister claims to be concerned about public hospitals and yet I see in his Budget’s Infrastructure document spending on health and hospital infrastructure receives less than ten per cent the amount allocated to his broadband network.
So much for priorities.
The private health insurance broken promise contributes $1.9 billion of savings over four years – when total revenues will exceed $1200 billion. That fact underlines the point that the Prime Minister’s attack on private health insurance is based in ideology, not economics.
There are plainly hundreds of opportunities for the Prime Minister to offset that saving if the measure is defeated – he could do worse than starting with his own foreign affairs spendathon in support of his UN ambitions.
But tonight I will make one suggestion of a suitable offset for the Prime Minister’s consideration.
One that would make for a healthier Australia and lessen the burden on public hospitals rather than increase it.
The Government could comfortably afford to retain the current private health insurance rebate without any cost to the published Budget outcome by increasing the amount of excise collected on tobacco by 12.5 per cent (or about three cents extra per cigarette).
Tobacco is the single most preventable cause of ill health and death in Australia.
So there’s a tough choice for a weak Prime Minister.
Raise $1.9 billion by making health more expensive and putting more pressure on the public hospital system or by adding about 3 cents more to the price of a cigarette and taking pressure of the public health system.
You see, Mr Speaker, budgets are indeed about priorities.

Conclusion

Mr Speaker:
History tells us that an addiction to debt and excess spending is in the DNA of the Labor Party.
Too many times, Labor governments both here in Canberra and in the states have taken us down this dead-end street.
This time, we were told, it was all going to be different.
Australians took on trust this Prime Minister and this Treasurer.
When they swore hand on heart at the last election that they were economic conservatives, Australians took them at their word.
They hoped this government would govern wisely and prudently.
And they genuinely wanted this Prime Minister to succeed.
They were prepared to give him every chance.
Yet, today, Australians see our national balance sheet drowning in red ink.
They see our nation’s future mortgaged for as far as the eye can see.
To repay the principal and interest on Labor’s $188 billion debt over the next 10 years will cost taxpayers $25 billion a year – our largest ever surplus, the Coalition’s last, was $20 billion.
And if the debt turns out to be higher – say $250 billion – then the repayments would be $33 billion a year.
Australians wonder how it could have come to this, in only 18 months?
Now, you might have expected a bit of humility, a bit of contrition, from a Prime Minister and a Treasurer who have failed this nation.
Instead, all we get are sanctimonious lectures about how the Opposition should either lock in behind this Government’s failed strategies.
Or provide Labor with the policy alternatives, with the map and compass, that will get them out of the mess in which they find themselves.
Mr Speaker:
Tonight, our job as political leaders is to build hope for the future.
For at least 60 years our proudest boast as a nation is that no generation of Australians has been left worse off than their parents.
That optimism, that confidence and certainty in what the future promises, is central to the success of modern Australia as a safe and prosperous place to bring up a family – the anchor of our society.
It is our responsibility, the members of this Parliament, to ensure that, whatever challenges we may confront, we will do all we can to ensure our children will have the opportunity to build an even better Australia than the one we know today.
Enterprise, opportunity and optimism – these are core Australian values.
They are core values of mine and of the Coalition.
They are essential building-blocks if Australia is to continue to fulfil its destiny as a strong, vibrant and prosperous nation
Yet, tonight, we cannot avoid the hard questions:
Will we be the first generation of Australians to bequeath to our children a lower standard of living?
To what extent are our actions today consigning the next generation of working Australians to higher taxes, higher interest rates and higher debt – a lesser opportunity to give their families what we ourselves enjoy in life?
And, when the time comes to answer to the Australian people for these failings, who will be judged the Guilty Party?
That day of reckoning is approaching for the Rudd Labor Government.
Its gross policy miscalculations have made much worse the impact of difficult global economic conditions.
The Treasurer admits it will be many years before Australians are as well off as they were before this Government came to power.
The Prime Minister has no idea how to fix the mess he has made.
He cannot even summon the courage to try.
The Prime Minister’s threat of a double dissolution and an early election proves to all of us what this Budget is really about.
It isn’t about protecting the jobs of Australians.
Least of all the one million Australians it says will soon be out of work.
It is about the job security of one man and one man only.
A Prime Minister frightened of the consequences of his mismanagement, now wants to cut and run before he is found out.
Mr Speaker, history tells us it always the job of the Liberal and National Party Coalition to repair the damage done by Labor governments; to rescue Australia from Labor debt.
It will not be easy.
But on this side of the House we are ready to take up that challenge – and to do so with the confidence and determination that comes from knowing that the Coalition has the experience and the expertise to get the job done
Mr Speaker, it is only a Coalition Government that can and will restore this great nation to prosperity.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,47,1
"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2009-05-14,"—I also seek leave to incorporate a speech in response to the budget by the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, Senator Barnaby Joyce.
Leave granted.

The incorporated speech read as follows—
",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,47,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-05-14,"—The budget has failed to show the path to the reduction of debt and with the forward projection of total liabilities of the net financial worth in excess of half a trillion dollars in 2012-2013 Mr Rudd and Mr Swan are sleepwalking.
Without a determined path to debt reduction Australia is on a path to destitution. The previous prediction of a forward budget surplus in 2008 of $21.7 billion has vanished and now there is a deficit of $57.6 billion and also little belief that can be left in the capacity of Labor to stay to budget. Even in November Mr Swan was predicting a surplus and six months later we are on the abyss.
In more recent predictions Dr Neil Hyden in February from the Australian Office of Financial Management said that the $200 billion facility would be fully drawn in 2012-2013 and now three months later we are being asked to consider that the limit will have to be extended to $300 billion. The cost of funds on this appears to be less than 5% which is just not possible if, in the same breath, the government believes there will be growth of 4.5% which would signal a return globally to a substantial increase in economic conditions. The economic turnaround would be contemporaneous with an increase in demand for funds and an increase in the cost of funds.
There is somewhere between $450 billion to $500 billion owed by governments within the sovereignty of Australia which the Federal Government has promised to repay and that means that somewhere within our Nation in the near future, at a conservative cost of funds of say 6% considering we’re at historic lows at the moment, we will have to find at least $27 billion a year just to pay the interest. Now they won’t find it so you know what they will do, they will just borrow more money to pay the interest. The demise will be uncomfortable.
In the budget regional Australia has been decimated in some areas such as funding for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry which has lost close to a third of its funding. Yet it is such industries as Agriculture that we will be relying on to refinance our Nation. Likewise leaks to The Australian newspaper about the allocation of funding to the Inland Rail have turned out to be not the case. Infrastructure on reducing port interconnectivity and bottle necks and traversing the coal, wheat, cotton, cattle industrial belt between Brisbane and Melbourne would be more conducive to economic growth that will allow us to repay our debts than new motorways on the coast for the family car.
Australia has compromised its future with Labor’s management and insistence on the perverse logic that retail expenditure on imported goods from an arrival in the mail of a $900 cheque will turn around a global recession in a service-based economy.
There is no evidence that this gift to Chinese manufacturing has helped Australia.
Instead of learning from their mistakes, the Rudd Labor Government pushes ahead with its plans to introduce a new tax. The foreshadowed Emissions Trading Scheme is completely counterintuitive to economic growth to pay our debts and keep Australian Working Families in work. It will be a boon for the carbon permit market but there will be nothing in it but debt for the producers of our nation’s vital food supplies.
Rural health only gets an extension of $9 million which means the Labor Government’s belief in ceiling insulation is 400 times greater than their belief in the delivery of basic health services to people away from metropolitan Australia.
Off the coast there is very little in the way of major road infrastructure however, it is inland Australia that produces the export wealth for our Nation.
Pensioners have been given an increase and this is something that the National Party has been calling for, for quite some time.
The Nationals have foreshadowed major cost reductions, such as a tier of the removal of a major layer of government, and while this does obviously become a galling point for so many it may become essential with the sale of major public assets to start reigning in the current debt which if it proceeds on its current trajectory will be terminal for Australia’s financial capacity.
We should not forget the position both Ireland and Iceland, and the trouble the Eastern European states have got themselves into. We should never gain any comfort from saying our position is not as bad as the United States as their position is extremely dire, however, as a nation their capacity to turn their financial position around is immensely more dynamic than Australia’s.
The budget is in essence a reflection of Mr Rudd’s attention with matters overseas whilst the finances at home have gone into freefall. His continual distraction with issues secondary are now seen in the state of the nation’s finances and the tokenistic nature of such things as the 2020 summit have come into absolute focus in that far from being able to predict what would happen in 2020 they could not predict what would happen 12 months ahead.
It is absolutely fundamentally important for the long-term stability of our Nation that the Labor Government and any that follows them grasps the nettle and makes decisive structural moves to reign in the debt. This has not been done in this budget so the task is still in front of us.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,47,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-05-14,"—At a time when the community is facing unprecedented environmental and economic challenges, this budget should be transforming Australia to a low-carbon economy. This budget should be, but is not, a green new deal for Australia. When the recession ends, Australia should be in place to reap the benefits of the global green jobs boom, not at the back of the queue. Instead, this budget is a clear demonstration of the Rudd government’s commitment to the old economy, a commitment that will delay Australians having the opportunity of the new jobs, innovative research, developmental opportunities, ecological security and social benefits that would come from a move to the new green economy. This is an opportunity that has been seized by governments around the world, as with the progressive decisions made by President Obama in his multibillion-dollar green new deal stimulus package for the United States.
Tonight I will set out some of the ways we Greens would grab this transformative opportunity with both hands. The Prime Minister has called on the Senate to pass this budget in its entirety. I say to the Prime Minister: this Senate is the house of review. It is the people’s backstop and innovator. We are not here to be a rubber stamp, and this budget is far from perfect. It fails single parents, the unemployed and the environment, so the Greens will responsibly scrutinise and improve it and we will be moving amendments in the Senate in later debate.
I do know that Australians do not want an early election, nor do we Greens, and we say to the Prime Minister: ‘Let’s work together to improve this budget in the same way that we Greens worked with the government to improve its economic stimulus package earlier this year.’ We are proud that through our effective work in the Senate we were successful in adding some $350 million for local green jobs to the government’s $42 billion stimulus package. It was a package which originally did not create many jobs outside the building and construction sector, and the Greens-inspired local jobs programs which went into it are now highlights in this budget. The millions of dollars for jobs in heritage, cycleway infrastructure and a range of community project grants will create thousands of jobs for Australians throughout the country, and, of the $60 million for heritage grants to be rolled out in the next year, $2 million has already been allocated to support important conservation restoration work at the National Heritage listed Old Government House in Parramatta, for example. The Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape in south-western Victoria, the first place included in Australia’s National Heritage List, has also received just over $360,000, and earlier this month these funds were provided to the Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners and the Winda Mara Aboriginal Corporations for the Budj Bim Tracks project—more jobs created in regional Australia.
In March we also came to an agreement with the Treasurer for improvements to the liquid assets tests so that people who were on lower incomes would get better access to income support when they became unemployed. Our negotiations also sealed an increase in funding for the bushfire research centre in Melbourne.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics plays a vital role in collecting and analysing social data and providing essential information for research and policy development. We went in to bat for it. Sixty million dollars has been allocated to it over four years in this budget. This is a significant improvement for this agency. Having said that, I note recent job losses in the Australian Bureau of Statistics and I would expect that this funding will ensure that the jobs cuts there will stop.
We are particularly proud that Australia’s 1.2 million age pensioners and carers, who have been struggling to make ends meet, have seen an increase in this budget. Single age pensioners, forced to live on less than $285 a week, have been particularly vulnerable. That is an income which the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer have admitted they could not live on. We have been campaigning for a minimum $30-a-week increase in the single age pension since before the 2007 budget.
Increased funding for the nation’s broadcasters is also welcome and long overdue. There is an additional $167 million to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in this year’s federal budget to increase Australian content and to roll out a children’s station, which will benefit millions of families. But we recognise that it will take much more than this to reverse the effects of a decade of neglect. There is an extra $20 million to SBS, which we welcome, but it is not even enough to remove the broadcaster’s reliance on advertising revenue, and we ask the government to look at better funding for this important alternative and creative component of Australia’s broadcasting. The Greens solidly back the ABC and SBS, and it is great to see that our public broadcasters, at least the ABC, have done better in the budget. But it is disappointing that the government has neglected smaller community broadcasters across the country.
Australian parents have been calling for action on paid parental leave for years. While the Greens are pleased to see a commitment in Tuesday’s budget to the introduction of an 18-week scheme, the fact is it will be delayed until 2011—that is after the next election—and will not require employer superannuation contributions to continue. It will not go well with the electorate. Senator Sarah Hanson-Young’s paid parental leave bill is currently before the parliament, and I urge the government to back our fully costed model for 26 weeks paid parental leave and to adopt this model before the next election.
We Greens welcomed the substantial increase in new rail projects, particularly the investment in metropolitan rail networks in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, but it is a pity that these initiatives do not extend to rail projects for Tasmania or the ACT or to getting more of the nation’s freight off roads and onto the rail network. It is an even greater pity that one of the projects simply services the coal industry in Newcastle, which the Prime Minister visited today. We note that many of the rail projects in the budget are scoping rather than construction, rather than getting things underway. The government should ensure that these projects or their equivalents actually move on to action and fruition. For example, in Melbourne the announcement of $40 million for preconstruction work on the east-west rail tunnel is a real but preliminary victory for the ‘No road tunnel’ campaign and the Greens, who have been very active in supporting it. But the cost of this project, if it is to go ahead, is put at $3.5 billion. The fact is that there is no funding for tollways in Melbourne in the budget, and that is real recognition of the community’s increasing call for low-carbon transport options, particularly of course public transport. The Greens will pursue more funding for extending existing train lines and building more tram routes.
Australians want greener and more affordable transport options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to improve public health and to reduce obesity but also to reduce the cost of transport—and I cannot help but think, with the massive allocations we are continuing to see for building prime arterial roads like the Pacific and Hume highways, and indeed the major thoroughfare in my home state from Launceston to Hobart, that the government should be looking expeditiously at providing space on these great arteries for a very fast passenger train network and for a cycleway linking the great cities of this country. It will be much more expensive to do this in retrospect.
I was speaking with a European ambassador today about the spread of these very fast trains in Europe. The most recent Spanish budget had €56 billion allocated to extend their very fast train network, which already services such cities as Valencia, Madrid and Barcelona. I can report to the Senate that these fast trains have taken 20 per cent of the air traffic out of the skies over Spain. I talked to people from France in recent days, and the 800-kilometre trip from Paris to Marseilles is now a matter of 3½ hours. It is faster than having to go to the airport through clogged traffic in both of the biggest cities of France, it is cheaper and it is much more comfortable. These trains are crowded—they are very, very attractive. We should look at that future for Australia as well.
The government has determined to keep its $4.5 billion tax cuts for the rich in this budget while at the same time ignoring those suffering real financial hardship. While the pension increase which I mentioned earlier is welcome, the Greens are disappointed that the government has failed to provide similar support for single parents or for the million or so Australians that the government expects may lose their jobs in the coming year. Unemployed people, whose incomes are even lower than those of pensioners, were ignored in the stimulus package cash payments back in March despite the Greens efforts to have them included. Now they are ignored in this budget. Unemployed Australians, increasingly out of jobs because of the recession, must try to scrape by on $227 a week. That is $90 less than the new single age pension rate of $317. It is a pittance, it is too hard, it is too punishing and it ought to have been increased in this budget. Not only have the Greens been calling for that increase but I have just pointed to the tax cuts as an alternative way of funding a reasonable increase. I will be pointing to more alternatives later in this delivery. The inequity in the income support system should be addressed. Based on 2008-09 data, the Australia Institute estimates the cost of an increase to the unemployment benefit to achieve parity with the pre-budget pension would be approximately $1.7 billion in 2010.
For the first time since the single mothers pension was introduced, pension payments to single parents will be paid at a different rate from other pensions. The Prime Minister has stated that he could not live on the pension, yet with this budget he is asking single parents—more than 85 per cent of whom are single mothers—to raise children on $285 a week. These children are effectively growing up in poverty, and this wealthy nation can do better—even in a recession. The Greens welcome changes to the eligibility for youth allowance, making it easier for many young people in education to access income support. We believe these changes should be brought forward to benefit students now, however. The tightening of the workforce participation criteria should not start until 2011 to ensure that young people who are planning to commence study in 2010 are not disadvantaged.
The decision to index the family tax benefit A against the consumer price index instead of being linked to pension indexation will hit those at the low end of the income scale, including more than one million children with parents in receipt of the family tax benefit A maximum rate. Instead of hitting these people, why did this Labor government not raise this revenue by reversing its tax cuts to the megarich? The government has also announced that taper rates will be increased from a 40c in the dollar to a 50c in the dollar reduction in a person’s pension, depending on how much income they make. This measure will also have the effect of lowering the rate at which the pension will cut out. That is very harsh; it is a harsh option for raising revenue when Labor could have raised contributions from wealthier Australians. This will affect pensioners, including old age and disability pensioners, to raise $1 billion or so when, again, there were better options. I will mention some of those very shortly.
When it comes to private health insurance—and I note the Leader of the Opposition’s comments a little earlier tonight—the Greens will move in the Senate to have money saved from means testing the private health insurance rebate allocated to public hospitals. We think it simply should not be put into consolidated revenue. We will also look very closely at the means testing of the private health rebate and the consequent increase in the Medicare levy surcharge—something that gives me some misgivings.
We will continue to be very vocal about Public Service sector job cuts, opposing the additional two per cent efficiency dividend which has already cost around 1,700 jobs in the nation’s Public Service. We welcome the government’s decision to in fact reduce this to the 1.25 per cent general efficiency dividend. But in the recession Public Service jobs should be retained rather than shed. We are pleased that there will be new Public Service jobs flagged in this budget in Centrelink, CSIRO, the Child Support Agency and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. But the decision to axe Land and Water Australia is a particularly nasty budget cut, in which not only will 51 public servants lose their jobs but a valuable research agency will be lost. Cutting this program for a saving of a measly $13 million at a time when climate change is creating the most significant challenges for rural Australia, not least amongst all Australians, is simply irresponsible and the government should think again about that cut.
The budget has no dedicated response to job creation in the form of labour market programs. While the government is spending big on major infrastructure projects, public housing and schools, creating building and construction centre jobs—and the Greens welcome that expenditure, in the main—there are no significant measures to create jobs in other sectors of the community. In the past, in tough economic times, it has been Labor governments that have instituted large-scale labour market programs for people who have lost their jobs as a consequence of the economic downturn. It appears now to fall to the Greens to try to get some of that back into economic planning in this country. Our changes to the economic stimulus package, which will create up to 10,000 jobs, show how a more targeted expenditure can create jobs as well as stimulate business. However, the extra $228 million injected into Adelaide’s desalination plant in the budget, on the agreement that it will double output from 50 gigalitres to 100 gigalitres, is concerning, considering we have seen a cut of $16.4 million over two years from water reform programs for the Murray-Darling Basin. Surely this money could have been better spent on water buybacks to give the Murray a bigger flow and the Lower Lakes the lifeline they need.
There is no worse demonstration of the old-style thinking of this budget than the massive expenditure on coal—almost double the amount to be invested in clean, renewable energy projects. In fact, that single coal project in the Hunter Valley, where the Prime Minister went today, will receive almost the same amount of money as the entire $1.5 billion Solar Flagship program over the next six years. This budget banks on coal mining and burning booming again. While it gives some much-needed support to renewable energy and energy efficiency, it remains locked into the coal-reliant past instead of forging a path towards a vibrant, carbon-neutral economy for Australia.
President Obama’s recent multibillion-dollar stimulus package points to the kind of priorities we need to emulate to set Australia on track to deliver a zero-carbon jobs boom. In President Obama’s package, funding to roll out renewable energy technologies was well over double the corporate welfare for coal. By contrast, the Rudd government’s budget support for coal is higher than all of the market-ready renewable technologies combined. The Obama package sets aside a much higher proportion of funding for energy efficiency than this Rudd budget. The most visionary aspect of the Obama stimulus is the massive injection of funding into an intelligent grid infrastructure—something that Senator Milne has been advocating in this place. Upgrading our grid is perhaps the most important investment our governments can make in energy. Building a high-quality, intelligent grid will save money for every Australian householder, every business and every factory. It enables much greater energy efficiency and it will modernise our outmoded energy network into cutting-edge technology that can repair itself, avoid blackouts and be open to being 100 per cent renewably powered.
The government has at least recognised that that grid investment is necessary, but it has put aside only $100 million, equivalent to only 1½ per cent of its expenditure on renewables and coal. Put that against Obama, who has set aside $11 billion, as much as his total investment in renewables and coal combined. Australia, 1½ per cent; the US, 100 per cent. The comparison is very stark. If this budget had followed President Obama’s albeit imperfect prescription, Australia would have invested $2 billion in renewable energy, $750 million in coal, $4 billion in energy efficiency and $2.2 billion in upgrading the grid. While renewable energy would have received slightly less direct funding, the indirect benefits from the grid upgrade, as well as the raft of supportive policies, would have driven investment many times further.
Of course, the Greens would rather see the coal sector invest its own profits in its infrastructure needs. The last figures I saw for the coal industry, which I remind senators has a very large component of overseas ownership and therefore drainage of profits out of the country, were $48 billion in income. This is an industry that has known about climate change coming for at least the last four decades and has no excuse for not having invested itself in the renewable component of its potential future to deal with the onrush of climate change. It should now not be falling back on, nor should it be given by this government, the very important billions that need to go into energy efficiency and renewable energy.
President Obama has been investing tens of millions of dollars in jobs-training packages to prepare the American workforce for the huge task of transforming its energy infrastructure. Instead of bowing to polluters’ demands, Obama is protecting the workers’ futures by preparing them for the jobs that are needed to deliver a renewable energy and energy efficiency boom. The Rudd government should take heed. The Greens will be doing all we can to ensure that the parliament does.
There are many opportunities in the budget to fund the fairer, jobs-rich, green economy I have touched on here tonight. The Greens share community concern about the $57.6 billion deficit. That is money that must be repaid and cannot therefore be spent on transforming our economy or supporting schools, hospitals, public housing or transport in the years ahead. However, in these extraordinary economic circumstances, a moderate budget deficit is prudent if the funds are spent on investing in transforming Australia’s economy and creating the jobs that would flow from the transformation. However, the government has chosen to prop up the old economy, in the main, rather than transforming to the new economy, where it should be going.
We have identified very large savings which can be made by redirecting funds from the old, polluting economy. Over the budget period of the next four years the Greens would save $35 billion in the following ways. Removing the tax cuts for people with incomes of more than $100,000 would save $4.5 billion. Maintaining the current rate of defence expenditure but not increasing it by the proposed three per cent above inflation—we are not a country threatened by any other country on earth—would save $7.3 billion. We would save $22.2 million per year on public funding of research into carbon capture and storage; there is $89 million. The $1 billion to be spent on the Hunter Valley coal project, as I have said twice earlier tonight, would go. The additional $280 million to be given to the biggest polluters under the government’s carbon pollution reduction program would follow suit. I might add that we do support Mr Turnbull’s call for higher taxes on cigarettes.
In addition, the Greens would make further substantial savings by abolishing some long-running industry subsidies that damage both the environment and the budget bottom line. In particular, we would remove the fringe benefits tax subsidy for company cars—including those used by public servants—to save about $8.2 billion over four years. A further $3.2 billion over four years would be saved by ending fuel subsidies to the aviation industry and $10.3 billion would be saved by ending fuel subsidies to mining, electricity, transport and related businesses, such as gas, water, waste, postal and warehousing. We are talking here about taking out the massive public subsidies there are for burning fossil fuels and putting that across to transforming the economy as well as to a social dividend, which I would have expected of a Labor government but which we are not seeing in this budget.
The Greens have economically sound alternatives to this budget. Our ideas are much more job rich, more environmentally sound and more socially responsible than those Labor has produced. This government has flagged changes to the superannuation system, the private health insurance rebate and the pension age. Many of its measures require legislation. We Greens will be looking at them all closely. We will be consulting widely with the community and we will work to ensure that best outcomes for Australia can be made in this Senate. As with our job-creating changes to the $42 billion stimulus package, we can and will help the government make this budget more productive for the taxpayers’ dollar.
We are a constructive entity in this Senate and this parliament and for this nation. We are an ideas bank that is badly needed by a new government which has failed to rise to the challenge of this new century. We are a component representing a vigorous and thoughtful part of the Australian community which is intent upon improving poor quality ideas and legislation and improving upon the failure to innovate and be at the forefront of world thinking and government decision making. We intend to keep our foot on the accelerator to ensure better outcomes from this government and better governance in the future. The opportunities that were wide open for this government to transform to a new green economy in this budget, and which were actually in some cases enhanced rather than made more difficult by this recession, have, almost without exception, been missed. The power of those who have invested in the last century’s thinking is time and time again expressing itself in the budget that the Treasurer delivered on Tuesday. This country can and should do better, and we Greens are going to keep the pressure on this government to ensure that that happens for the benefit of all Australians.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,47,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-05-14,"—On Tuesday night, the Treasurer delivered to an anxiously waiting Australian public a budget that was in deficit in more that just numbers. This is a budget that punishes incentive. This is a budget that withholds hope. This is a budget of broken dreams. For weeks now the government, through its carefully orchestrated leaks, has been sending the Australian public the message that this would be a different kind of budget to that which we are used to. Unlike previous budgets, the days of generous spending across the board were coming to an end.
This came as no surprise to anyone. Family First understood that Australia was in the midst of a global financial crisis. We understood that tax revenues had plunged dramatically and left a gaping hole in the government’s budget, while the unemployment rate had skyrocketed. We understood this very well because we have spent countless hours talking to those Australians who have been affected by the global financial crisis. We also understood that a government that was raiding the taxpayers’ kitty as if it were a bottomless pit was one day going to wake up and realise that, if it did not change its spending habits quickly, the money was eventually going to run out. We understood that we were going to have to tighten our belts and do our part for the economy.
But what we also wanted to hear from the Treasurer was how our individual sacrifices would eventually lead us out of this hole. We looked to this government to show leadership and bring forward a budget that was not only honest for these times but also gave us hope for the future, hope for better times. Instead of hope, Australians were left with a budget that took their simple dreams of a home, a family and a decent retirement and broke those dreams. Australians were left with a loud and clear message from the government that they were better off not having a dream for themselves or their families. Australians were handed a budget that punishes those who want to improve their lot in life—a budget that punishes incentive. It is a budget that takes the opposite view of the Australian ethos that if you work hard to build a good life for yourself and your family, you will reap your rewards.
On Tuesday night the government broke one of the most important dreams: the expectation of honest government. Australians, perhaps naively, had hoped that this time their government would be true to their election promises and that the election promise not to touch the private health insurance rebate would be honoured. But it was not. They tried to say it was a ‘change in policy’ and not a broken election promise, but who are they kidding? The cuts to the private health insurance rebate have left many Australians disillusioned not only because it exposes the Rudd government’s dishonesty but also because means testing the health rebate is exactly that: mean.
It is an unfair system because it looks only at the household or individual income and does not take into account how many children there are in the household. As any Australian parent knows, the cost to families can increase significantly depending on the number of children to be cared for. Under the government’s proposal, a couple on $149,000 a year with no children will be eligible for the full rebate while a family of five with a household income of $150,000 would have their rebate reduced. That makes no sense and undermines the family.
However, it is not only the government’s cut to health care which will have a serious impact on families. The decision of the Rudd government to cap the Medicare safety net for fees relating to pregnancy and IVF treatment has broken the most basic dream of all Australians—the dream of having a family. The government reforms will now see the costs involved in having children increase enormously, in some cases by thousands of dollars, for many people. This is hardly consistent with the commitment of the Rudd government to help working families. If the government has resorted to taxing mums then it has clearly lost touch with ordinary Australians. Over 11,000 babies are born to Australian families through assisted reproductive treatments each year. The government’s budget proposal would jeopardise those Australians who rely on this treatment to have children; this treatment is their only hope.
Having children is the greatest blessing in life. It should not be reserved for the rich. Birthrates are still below replacement levels, and families who have children are actually helping Australia. We have an ageing population, and this means the number of full-time workers we have to support our pensioners is decreasing. The government, however, has taken a short-term approach, making it less affordable to have children without a thought to the consequences that this may have in the future. It has shattered the dream of a family for so many Australians and failed to see the future consequences for our nation. Family First is also concerned that the drastic rise in out-of-pocket obstetric expenses will force many Australians out of the private system and into the public hospitals. We believe this move is short-sighted and will end up costing Australians money rather than saving money. This will place an even greater strain on our overstretched public hospitals because many people just will not have the money to afford these price increases. That means longer waiting times and even greater shortages of hospital beds for those who need them.
Family First welcomes the government’s announcement that it will be introducing paid parental leave. It would be an understatement of gross proportions to say that this decision is long overdue. Gone are the days when a family could easily be supported by one working parent. The rising costs of living have, sadly, made this a luxury most Australians simply cannot afford. As a result, many Australians have been forced to delay having families; for those who have not, the financial strain can often be incredibly demanding. This scheme will provide much-needed financial support to families wishing to have children but who have struggled to stay afloat on only one income. Most importantly, it recognises the inherent social value of raising children in the community. It recognises that it is not just those people who hold a full-time job who are productive members of our society.
The biggest winner of all, however, will be our nation’s children, who will benefit from having the care of their mother on a full-time basis, not only in the scarce few hours juggled between work and sleep. Family First is disappointed that the government has decided to delay implementing this vital scheme until 2011. Australia is already lagging behind 157 other countries which have paid maternity schemes, including places such as Chad, Mongolia and Rwanda, and we believe this issue is too important to wait. Given the numerous government backflips and broken promises which we saw in Tuesday’s budget, how can we be sure that the government will be true to its word on paid parental leave when the time comes? How can we be sure that this is not just some ploy to mask the bitter budget pill that all Australians were forced to swallow this week? If the government were serious about helping working Australian families, surely this would be the first item on its list of reforms.
The government cries poor and says it just does not have the money to fund the scheme now, but it has no problem splashing out $1.7 billion of taxpayers’ money to fund costly overseas military operations. We find the government’s priorities surprising. Family First is also disappointed that this scheme will leave stay-at-home mothers out in the cold. Those women who have made the choice to become full-time mothers will be penalised by the government and will not be eligible under the proposed scheme. Whilst they will still be entitled to receive the baby bonus, in some cases this will result in stay-at-home mothers receiving almost 50 per cent less than women who have recently exited the workforce. This sends the message to mothers that the Rudd government only cares about people who can pay tax and fill its coffers. This is not good enough. The Rudd government is telling those mothers who stay at home to raise their children that their contribution to Australia is not valued. Family First believes we should not punish parents because they choose to stay at home to take care of their children and our future.
This budget also puts at risk the dream of a safe and secure retirement. This will now need to be delayed by another two years for many Australians. These are the same Australians who have worked hard all their lives, putting money away for retirement only to see the retirement nest eggs fall sharply in the last 12 months. They are now being told by this government that all the hard work is not enough and that they need to work for another two years. Many hardworking Australians will be forced to forgo a decent retirement, as they will have to work till age 67.
Whilst the budget does go some way towards fulfilling a promise to Australia’s long-suffering pensioners that their dire position will improve, it is only single pensioners who are the real beneficiaries. A year ago, I stood shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of pensioners at a protest rally in Melbourne in solidarity with their plight and called for an increase for all pensioners. It was this pensioner rally that was the turning point in forcing the government to increase the pension. However, in this budget, married pensioners have been given the scraps and hush money, a token increase of only $5.07 each a week. That will barely get them a loaf of bread and a litre of milk. There seems to be a misconception by this government that, because married pensioners share a home, living must be cheaper for them. The Rudd government is sending pensioners a clear message here, and it is a disgraceful message: you are better off getting divorced and becoming a single pensioner if you want to survive in this budget.
Family First is also disappointed with the government’s decision to draw back on its first home owners grant. It has broken the simple dream of all Australians to one day own their home. We find it puzzling that the government would set up the Ruddbank and dole out up to $28 billion of taxpayers’ money to prop up the commercial property industry but cut back support to the residential sector for getting a home. It is a statement that the government is happy to help big business hold on to their assets but not to help young Australians get a start in life and aspire to the dream to buy their own home.
This is a budget of broken dreams. It is a budget that lacks courage and lacks foresight. Significantly, there is nothing in the budget to address the real issues of alcohol abuse and binge drinking which have plagued Australia. For too long, Australians have been held to ransom by a society ripped apart by alcohol fuelled violence and despair. Thanks to the inaction and lack of courage from the Rudd government, Australia’s binge-drinking culture continues unabated. The Rudd government has once again failed to invest sufficient money in critical areas such as alcohol prevention and education programs for our youth. Most importantly, it has again failed to break the link between alcohol and sport by de-hooking alcohol advertising and sport. I believe the government will look back in regret at this failed opportunity to tackle the blight of binge drinking in our community. If the government could look beyond the short term, it would see that binge drinking and alcohol abuse are costing us $15 billion each year. What better way for the government to reduce the budget deficit than by investing in our future to dramatically slash this $15 billion alcohol toll?
The government has announced a massive infrastructure spending program which will upgrade some of the country’s rail, ports and roads and create thousands of new jobs for Australians. Family First welcomes this policy direction and sees it as one of the more positive aspects of the budget. However, we are disappointed that the $750 million Peninsula Link road project in Victoria, a key infrastructure project that creates significant job opportunities, was not given any funding in this budget. This is a project that is ‘shovel ready’ and a road that will make an enormous difference to Victorians.
Family First is also concerned that not enough is being done to help Australia’s small businesses. Small businesses account for 95 per cent of all businesses in this country and are responsible for over 4.5 million jobs. They are the lifeblood of our community. If the government wants to be supporting jobs then helping small businesses should be the primary focus. Family First recognises the important tax breaks which have been included in this budget for capital investment and sees them as a good step. However, they remain just that: one step. The Rudd government must do more to protect small businesses from the full impact of the global financial crisis. One of the major problems being faced by small businesses is financing. Financing is not easy to come by. When the banks are willing to provide it, they extract a heavy price. We have seen the Reserve Bank slash the cash rate to the lowest level since March 1960. While not all of these rate cuts have been passed on to homeowners, the gap is even wider when it comes to business loans. If the government is serious about helping small businesses then it must look at taking decisive action to address this issue. The government must ensure that any rate cuts are passed on to business loans and overdraft facilities as well.
I understand that times are tough, and that is why we expect tough decisions be made by the government. Superannuation has been one of the biggest areas to take a hit. However, I find it remarkable that the one type of superannuation which has been left untouched is the excessive superannuation paid to politicians. This is the same outrageous superannuation that will see the Prime Minister one day leave parliament on an annual salary of over $166,000 for the rest of his life and the Treasurer with an annual salary of over $105,000. It is the same outrageous superannuation that sees politicians receive a whopping contribution of up to 69 per cent of their salary each year while ordinary Australians are asked to make do with nine per cent. It is the same outrageous superannuation that lets the pollies access their money immediately upon retirement, while the rest of us are forced to wait until 60—or maybe 67, if the government gets its way. All this, of course, does not apply to those setting the rules.
In a budget which calls for tough measures, it seems the only people who are not doing it tough are the pollies themselves. In fact, the Rudd government have actually boosted the money for politicians by generously awarding them an additional $90 per week for their electoral allowance. It amazes me that the Rudd government can implore Australians to knuckle down and do it tough and then have the gall to continue sticking their own snouts in the trough of perks paid for by hardworking Australians. It is a real smack in the face to all Australians who are struggling to stay afloat when they see their politicians feathering their own nests. Most incredibly, tucked away in this budget is a little gift for the Prime Minister himself: a boost to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet of $13 million and an injection of 65 extra staff. At a time when Australians are told to cut back and make do, this excess by the Prime Minister is obscene.
On Tuesday, the Rudd government delivered a budget that offers no hope and no incentive and crushes the simple dreams of many Australians to own a home and to have a family and a secure retirement. The Rudd government needed to be cost conscious, but, in doing so, it has failed to also be family conscious. It has forgotten that taxpayers are real people, not just another line on the balance sheet, so when you slug taxpayers you are also slugging hardworking Australian families.
The Rudd government has trumpeted that this budget is a nation-building budget. But nation building is about much more than infrastructure and roads. It is about building a nation of people who are connected, who have hope and a belief in where they are headed. It is about building our families and building our future. Nation building is about building a sense of unity and common purpose, particularly in challenging times. In this difficult economic climate we must be working together to support those who will be out of work and to assist those who will struggle in these tough times. Our focus must be on one simple thing: looking out for one another and rebuilding this nation not just with bricks and mortar but with human infrastructure.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2009-05-14,"—Last Sunday was Mother’s Day and each year thousands of women, men and children participate in the Mother’s Day Classic, the biggest community fundraising event for breast cancer research in Australia. One in nine women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime and only knowledge, awareness and investment in research will ensure this statistic improves. The Mother’s Day Classic is a fantastic community event that promotes awareness of breast cancer. It also highlights the importance of improving the quality of life of those suffering from the disease and how inspirational their stories and the stories of breast cancer survivors can be.
Overall, survival from breast cancer in Australia has been on the increase for several years. About 90 per cent of women aged between 40 and 69 years when diagnosed will be alive after five years. For younger women, the statistics are not so favourable. Survival is lower. Only around 82.4 per cent of those aged 20 to 29 years and 84.8 per cent of those aged 30 to 39 years will still be alive five years after being diagnosed with the illness. The bravery and strength of breast cancer survivors cannot be underestimated. Treatment is draining and sometimes invasive. It is at times like this when the support of family and friends is crucial for making these challenges that little bit easier to face.
I would like to take this opportunity to honour the memory of a dear friend of mine, Francesca, or Fran, Gwyther, who lost her battle with breast cancer in November 2008. Fran was a woman who left an impression on everyone she met. I was honoured and fortunate to know Fran during my years at the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, where she was a great support to my colleagues and me during some of the more difficult times. She was a tremendously talented woman, an expert in the printing and mailing industry. Fran was loyal and had enormous energy, integrity and a great sense of humour. Married to John, mother to three young children—Ellie, Kate and Mark—and successful in business with her printing and mailing company, G&G Trade Publishing, Fran lived a full life—a life full of achievements, family happiness and commitment to the community.
Never content with simply watching from the sidelines, Fran put her heart and soul into everything she did. The Boroondara and North Balwyn netball associations, where she was a multiple premiership coach, Balwyn Combined Football Club and Balwyn Primary School are just a few of the many organisations Fran devoted her time to. She approached her community commitments with enthusiasm and energy. Fran put her heart and soul into everything she did—whether it was parenting, sport, coaching or being a fan of the Carlton Football Club. Fran was passionate about the Carlton Football Club and was a proud member of the club. She attended games even on the days when her illness dictated she should have stayed at home. Fran was a member of the Women of Carlton group and, always true to her strong sense of social justice, Fran fought strongly for the rights of her fellow Carlton members.
Fran was a champion of working people and always fought for the underdog. She was a generous person who was always prepared to give people a fair go. Fran was never judgmental and helped many young people get a start in their working lives. Her desire to protect the rights of her peers and to speak her mind was apparent even during her school days. This was never more evident than when she called A Current Affair after the nuns at St Bede’s made her class let the hems of their skirts down because they were too short.
Running her own business for over 20 years gave Fran the opportunity to put her strong sense of integrity and social justice into practice. She was always open to giving people a chance and did whatever she could to help anyone she knew who was unemployed or struggling financially. Fran really understood the importance of self-respect. Giving people a reason to get out of bed and the opportunity to recognise they had something to give to society was more valuable to Fran than material wealth. Fran pursued not a life of riches but the richness of life. Despite her hectic schedule, Fran’s No. 1 priority was her family and friends. Being a mother brought her happiness and joy. Growing up, Fran had a close, loving relationship with her family and was the favourite of her father, Lennie, a hardworking and proud Italian migrant. She was a loyal sister to her two brothers and sister, and the friends she made during her years at school became friends for life.
The strong sense of fun and curiosity she had as a child remained with her until the end. It is heartbreaking when someone so young, so loved and so vibrant leaves us before we are ready to say goodbye. After a four-year battle with breast cancer, Fran remained strong and positive well beyond a time when she could have easily given up. Questions about how she was going were always answered with humour and a smile. I will never forget the way Fran embraced life with such energy and courage. Her commitment to the union movement, her commitment to her family and her commitment to giving the underdog a chance will always remain with me. My thoughts are with her family, who displayed incredible strength during this difficult time.
The premature loss of exceptional people like Fran is a reminder to us all that so much more work needs to be done in the field of breast cancer research. As one of the top five causes of death in Australian women and the leading cause of death in 45- to 64-year-olds, breast cancer is a mystery far from being solved. However, there have been some recent medical breakthroughs and encouraging initiatives to make the lives of Australian women with breast cancer that little bit easier. These initiatives do not make things any easier for Fran’s family, who have already watched a loved one lose her battle with cancer.
Fran’s story is a sad one but one of courage—a loving wife and mother and a fantastic friend to all who knew her. Vale, Fran. You will be missed by your family; you will be missed by your friends. Your family and friends paid their respects at a packed and overflowing St Bede’s church. You will always be remembered as a beautiful, intelligent and courageous woman. Thank you for giving me the honour of being your friend.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Breast Cancer</title>,Adjournment,48,1
