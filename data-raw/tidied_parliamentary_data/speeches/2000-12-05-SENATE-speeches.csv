"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-12-05,"—Yesterday Senator Chris Evans asked me a question in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care. I undertook to get an answer from the minister. I seek leave to incorporate the additional response in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
AGED CARE: EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUM-STAN-CES
Senator—My question is directed to Senator Herron in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care. Can the minister confirm that the government is drafting regulations for the Aged Care Act setting out the criteria by which the Minister will exempt nursing homes from the 1 January 2001 accreditation deadline? Will the Government commit to tabling those regulations before parliament rises? Given the deadline is now less than a month away, why hasn't the government finalised those regulations earlier? Does the Minister think it appropriate that the rules be changed so close to the deadline?
Senator ... - Madam President, I ask a supplementary question? I thank the Minister for his answer. I would appreciate his response as soon as possible. Can he also provide information as to how many nursing homes are likely to be affected by the exemption process?
SENATOR HERRON - The Minister for Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
From 1 January 2001, residential aged care services must be accredited by the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency to continue to receive Commonwealth residential care subsidies (sections 42-1 and 42-4 of the Aged Care Act 1997).
Exceptional circumstances to be determined by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aged Care (or his delegate) are provided for under the Aged Care Act 1997 but this should not be regarded by Approved Providers as an easy way out.
Facilities not accredited will be considered for exceptional circumstances. Facilities at risk of not being accredited are being case managed and contingency plans have been formulated on a case by case basis by the Department to ensure continuity of care for residents.
Decisions on exceptional circumstances will be made by the Secretary or his delegate.
Under the Aged Care Act, the Secretary is precluded from making such a determination in circumstances including where:
·	there is an immediate or severe risk to the safety or well-being of residents; or
·	the approved provider has not applied for accreditation;
·	or the Secretary has already made a section 42-5 determination, and the service has not subsequently met its accreditation requirements.
The Minister has made the Principles which activate the relevant section of the Act being section 42-5. These Principles will be gazetted on 8 December 2000.
With regard to the supplementary question, the question as to whether a facility will receive a positive exceptional circumstance is a question for the Secretary or his delegate, weighing up each case on its merits.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Nursing Homes: Accreditation</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,speech

That government business order of the day no. 1 (Gene Technology Bill 2000 and 2 related bills) be postponed till a later hour.
There have been very useful discussions between the parties on how to handle the Gene Technology Bill 2000, which has certainly consumed an enormous amount of time. Without a doubt, it is a complicated bill and there are a lot of issues involved. It has taken over 20 hours to date. The Senate sat to a very early hour this morning.
—A very late hour this morning.
—Yes. It depends on your benchmark, where you take it from. To attend breakfast with the WA Municipal Association at a quarter to seven, as I did, was—
—You are probably right. It was potentially a mutual feeling, Senator Faulkner. I was hoping for bacon and eggs and we only got pancakes, which was a bit sad. It certainly was a struggle to get out of bed. Having said that, we have had constructive talks with members of the various parties and the Independents at the other end of the chamber. We are seeking to find a consensual way of handling the remaining stages of the debate. I can indicate that it is unlikely we will proceed with any further consideration of it today. We expect that the Senate will adjourn on schedule at 10.30 tonight, which I know will be a relief for a number of Senate staff, parliamentary staff, clerks and other people. I do not want people to be confused by the way it says `a later hour of the day'; it is actually more likely to be a later hour of another day.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Government Business</title>,Business,14,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-05,"—That is a pity. I think we should be moving on with it now. I have carriage of the Greens amendments to the Gene Technology Bill 2000 and I am committed to dealing with them expeditiously. I realise the debate has been a long one, but it is an extraordinarily important bill. I think we should be continuing that debate while it is fresh in our minds. If we take it over until Thursday night, we will be debating other major issues in the meantime and much of the substance of the debate will have to be canvassed again. It would have been my advice to have it brought on now and I believe it could have been finished today.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Government Business</title>,Business,14,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-05,"—I echo the comments of Senator Brown. If we had gone into the Gene Technology Bill 2000 as the first listed item of business, as originally appeared on the red, I believe all parties would have made a solid attempt to expedite proceedings so as to finish that bill. We are of a mind to deal with the bill. We are already knee-deep in it, at the halfway mark. It is disappointing that we are not proceeding. I understand Senator Ian Campbell's concerns and some of the rationale behind this decision, but I want to place on record the disappointment that this is being moved, potentially, to Thursday evening. My understanding is that that is designed to accommodate a minister's overseas trip and I think, for that purpose, it is an unsatisfactory arrangement.
—You wanted to report progress on two occasions last night.
—The reason for seeking to report progress last night was that we were dealing with the bill until a quarter to four in the morning. As much as I would love to hear Senator Campbell's definition of reproductive cloning or what is an oncogene, it is a complex bill and I do not think people should underestimate the fact that it is a nine-page running sheet with which we are dealing. People are trying to make an attempt to get through it but it becomes a bit odd at 3 o'clock in the morning to debate some of those complex matters, of which I am sure the Senate has no understanding or idea. I am disappointed that we are possibly relegating that to Thursday. We will obviously talk with Senator Campbell about bringing it on sooner. I think we could have dealt with it tonight. I am sorry that we are not moving to do so.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-12-05,"—I move:
	(1)	That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the suc-ceed-ing provision of this resolution having effect.
	(2)	That the Interactive Gambling (Mora-torium) Bill 2000 be recommitted, and that consideration of the bill in com-mittee of the whole be an order of the day for a later hour.
Following the defeat of the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 in the Senate on 9 October, the government has been considering the consequences that have flowed since that time. The government remains very much of the view that it is highly desirable that there should be a breathing space in order to properly assess both the technical feasibility and the economic and social consequences of a possible permanent ban. The purpose of the moratorium, as expressed in the original bill, was to halt the development of the interactive gaming and gambling industries in Australia from going online while the government investigated those matters. Given the defeat of the bill, we have considered the other alternatives and one of those is amendments which we would seek to move to exempt wagering from the scope of the moratorium, those being wagering services equivalent to those offered online on 19 May 2000 and in traditional wagering formats. In other words, new forms of interactive gambling based on new forms of offline gambling such as spread betting—in other words, betting on outcomes after the beginning of an event—would not be exempt from the scope of the moratorium. We take the view that it is desirable that this moratorium be in place, if necessary with that exemption, and we therefore want to give the Senate an opportunity to consider those amendments.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-05,"—It is ironic that we deal with this matter of recommittal immediately after Senator Ian Campbell's motion. Senator Ian Campbell is quite rightly concerned, as I am sure everyone in the chamber is, about expediting the business before us and ensuring that we deal with potentially important and pressing pieces of legislation. This is not one of those pieces of legislation; this is a bill that was defeated because it was poorly thought out and because of some of its more questionable provisions, including whether or not it was constitutional and whether the retrospective nature of the bill was appropriate. It was defeated and if the government want to go back to the drawing board then they should do so, as opposed to a piece of legislation being defeated, thus sending a message not only to the community generally but also to the sector and the industry specifically.
I had an adviser from Senator Alston's office on the phone to my office suggesting that the government was given a commitment by the Democrats that we were going to agree to this recommittal. As the portfolio holder, I have given no such assurance and nor was I asked for it. I have just spoken to the office of our whip, Senator Vicki Bourne, and they were not asked to give a commitment. Her office maintains that she certainly did not give that assurance. We need to get on the record, to begin with, that at no time was there an official position sought from the Democrats—nor was one given—that would support the recommittal of this particular piece of legislation.
I would like something clarified. My understanding is that we are dealing with this matter today because Senator Alston has to leave Australia, thus it is his intention to debate the bill tonight instead of giving us the opportunity to continue on the government order of business and deal with a bill that we are halfway through, the Gene Technology Bill 2000. Even if people do not want to proceed with the Gene Technology Bill 2000, there are many other more pressing pieces of legislation that we could be getting on with as opposed to a piece of legislation that was, firstly, defeated and, secondly, needs a substantial rewrite before it is going to come to this place in a way that deserves debate or analysis. I would appreciate clarification from the government. Is it the case that we are expediting this matter today in an attempt to ensure that Senator Alston can go overseas? If he is so concerned about this piece of legislation, then he should stay here like the rest of us until not Thursday night but Friday morning. I suspect that is not going to happen. 
On behalf of the Democrats I say that this legislation should not be proceeded with. It is a controversial piece of legislation. It is one that the parliament has already closely divided on and yet it was still defeated as a consequence of some of the worst provisions in the bill. I mentioned the questionable use of the telecommunications power under the Constitution. I also mentioned the retrospective nature of this legislation and that it was legislation by press release, announced by the government on 19 May 2000. That was bad enough, but to have a piece of legislation defeated—and thus send a message to the industry and to the community that they can actually make some plans and have some certainty because of the defeat of that legislation—and to then reintroduce it in this hurried last week of the Senate session is quite scandalous.
Many of us were here last night, whether we were here debating the legislation or whether we were here for divisions and voting on the Gene Technology Bill 2000. There are some of us who probably have a higher legislative load than others. We expect to be here; we are going to be here till Thursday night or Friday morning. The minister should join us in that happy time together! If he is committed to this legislation, then he should stay here to debate it. If we have time to get through the parliamentary and the legislative agenda, then we can move on to this piece of legislation. I am quite happy to restate my views for the record in the context of a debate on this bill. I am quite happy for my party to vote on this legislation, as they have in the past. We will emulate the vote that we have had in the past. But it certainly does not constitute an urgent piece of legislation. It is not required in particular because of recent developments at the Darwin summit looking at the work and the progress that has been made in relation to formulating a consistent set of standards on a national level when it comes to interactive gambling in Australia.
We know that the states and territories have made progress in that respect. Perhaps the message that the bill sent last time was a good one: the states and territories had to get organised and the online gambling providers and the Internet industry had to do something about ensuring protections—both player pro-tection mechanisms and harm minimisation strategies. This bill does none of that, of course. It does not seek to enforce the recommendation of the Netbets inquiry—that is, the Senate select committee on IT inquiry—that examined these issues. Instead, it is a poorly thought-out piece of legislation that seeks to grab some headlines for the government and, in doing so, ensure that at the end of the year Senator Alston does not have to rack this up as a defeat.
This is not something that we should be dealing with in this pressing final week of the legislative agenda. I think most Australians, given the opportunity, would rather have a bill that dealt with the real social and other issues associated with gambling. Let us not be fooled: this is a bill that attacks technology and the Internet; it does not actually do anything for gambling or to resolve some of those problem issues associated with gambling.
The community would rather have that or get on with the legislative agenda, including the single largest debate on science and technology regulation in this nation's history. That is why we were here until 3.45 a.m., because we have a nine-page running sheet. I know that the government and the opposition at times dismiss us as the pesky crossbenchers. What we are doing is merely putting through the recommendations contained in a majority Senate committee report into that legislation. So let us get on with that legislation. This is not a necessary debate. The Demo-crat party room have discussed this this morning, so I am not sure where Senator Alston or his advisers were coming from when they tried to suggest that we support it. On the contrary—we will vote according to our principled positions last time. We seek to have this legislation deferred so that we can get on with the real business of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-12-05,"—I also stand to indicate Labor's opposition to the recommittal of this particular piece of legislation. It is very clear that the government is using an opportunity to revisit a debate that was fought and lost by the government in this chamber some time ago on the question of the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000. It is no secret, because there have been many reports in the press, that the government has persisted with negotiations with some members of the crossbench and is using this evening's opportunity in the chamber to recommit this bill in the committee stage in an attempt to amend the bill to a point of satisfaction for the required number of senators in this place to get it passed. 
I would like to reiterate Labor's opposition to this bill per se. We may well get the opportunity later this day to debate those issues more fully. I would like to lodge my disappointment with a government that is obviously not prepared to listen to reason on an issue of great importance—that is, the reputation that Australia has in the operation of the information economy and the role of the Internet in society. The government, instead, has chosen to identify the Internet as an effective scapegoat for the evils and social problems, rhetorically and very much in a real sense, for many people associated with the social harm from gambling. Despite all of the positive efforts made on behalf of the state jurisdictions, who are rightly charged with the responsibility of regulating gambling content on the Internet, and, indeed, the goodwill and efforts of many in the community to create a proactive environment of support and initiative to help those with gambling problems, it is persisting with this legislation.
A bit of background is that the National Office for the Information Economy has done a study on interactive gambling and the ability to actually regulate its banning on the Internet. My understanding is that that work finds that, whilst there may be some technical capability to ban it, in fact it is not possible to achieve what the government says it is going to achieve through banning this form of Internet content. Hence, we find the argument that somehow rendering illegal in the Australian jurisdiction the presence of gambling content will somehow protect Australian citizens, particularly problem gamblers, from Internet gambling is, in fact, a complete fallacy. Everyone who uses the Internet, particularly experienced users—and I certainly know that Senator Alston knows this—knows that, if you have access to the Inter-net, you have access to the plethora of unregulated gambling sites around the world. Making potentially regulated gambling sites illegal here in Australia is not going to protect the Australian community from the social harm that the government claims will be derived from online gambling.
The other thing to remember in consideration of this debate is that the purposes of bringing it back are, in fact, to tamper with the edges of the government's intent. My understanding, based only on media reports, is that the government's efforts tonight will revolve around actually splitting the definition of gambling into `gaming' and `wagering' for the purposes of, I suppose, not disenfranchising sections of that particular industry. I think this defies the principle that the government claims to have based its original arguments on. I suspect that I will get an opportunity—I hope I do not—later this evening to debate this further, but I would like to state now that Labor oppose this recommittal on the basis that the government was defeated in this place, the legislation remains flawed, as we described in our previous debates, and tonight's efforts to tamper with the legislation as it was presented previously just represent manoeuvring and dealing with various vested interests along the way.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-05,"—I hate speaking after both Senator Lundy and Senator Stott Despoja, who I think are two of the most valuable members of this Senate with a different point of view, but here I am. The estimates for this year are that the business of online gambling will be worth about $2.3 billion globally. It is in its infancy in Australia, but it is one of those options for entertainment and loss of money that is going to figure pretty largely in the Australian economy and social fabric in the coming decades until something even more instant replaces the Internet in the coming century. There are indications that interactive gambling online is going to be particularly attractive to young people and is certainly going to give people who would otherwise not go out in search of betting facilities the opportunity to do it covertly at home and, potentially, to use their money and property, and that of those around them, and get themselves into a great deal of trouble. 
I will not trespass further into the debate except to say I made a commitment in this place when this legislation was first before it to support the government in a moratorium on interactive online gambling if the government made the playing field level as far as the TABs were concerned. I understand that the government is going to do that in the amendment so that Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia will no longer be left out. People who want to bet will have the same facilities available in each state and territory during the moratorium period. Under those circumstances, I am prepared to support the legislation. I was then, and I remain now, of the same persuasion. That said, it is a very complex and difficult area but, if the moratorium is going to mean anything—and I have said I will support it—leaving it until after Christmas is not a sensible option. We are halfway through a 12-month moratorium period now, so logic says I would have to support this. Finally, I agree with Senator Stott Despoja that the Gene Technology Bill 2000 ought to be the priority in debate. We ought to be dealing with that now and with the interactive gambling legislation later on.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Recommittal</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-05,"—I rise to indicate that I will support the government's motion to bring on the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 for the second time for several reasons, one of them being that there has been substantial input into this sector by the industry. In some cases, companies have invested sums of between $14 million and $16 million in the development of their interactive gambling sites. I believe that it is unfair to the industry as a whole to leave it in this state of uncertainty if we rise from this sitting period without addressing this issue. Having said that, I clearly indicate to the chamber that I also believe that the principal piece of legislation we should be addressing at this point in time is that relating to the Gene Technology Regulator.
As the previous speakers have said, the issue of interactive gambling is very complex. One of the issues that has been raised with me is the $10 billion that has been referred to as the drop-out—in other words, the money that is not returned to the person who is punting or playing within the gambling industry. Only $1.7 billion of that relates to wagering. The government's bill in its original form would have penalised the TAB and wagering areas around Australia with the exception of New South Wales. Pauline Hanson's One Nation's approach to this bill has always been that the bill should treat those within the industry equally. I indicate to the chamber that One Nation will be moving one amendment to this bill, which relates to those businesses that were granted licences prior to the 18th.
The problem with gambling in this country is that it impacts extremely adversely, both socially and economically, on the people of this nation. But we need to target the areas of greatest exposure to problem gambling, and that is very fairly levelled at the sector of the industry relating to poker machines. For example, if a small country town or a moderately sized country town has 400 poker machines, and each one of those machines has somewhere around $10,000 per month going through it, that is not returned as winnings. In a single hotel, $200,000 can go out of the economy of that area because of poker machines. I believe that is the area we need to address in relation to gambling.
The government's bill, when it was originally brought into this chamber, would have still allowed one entity to continue to operate within Australia during the moratorium. So when the government speaks of a moratorium, it is not a moratorium that would stop all interactive gambling for the period of the moratorium. There is the difficulty, as Senator Lundy raised, that it would allow the Australian people to access overseas sites. If One Nation had a preference with this bill and there were to be a moratorium, it would be that all sites be excluded so there would be no access to any interactive gambling for a person residing within Australia. Those companies that have invested considerable amounts of capital into the industry should be allowed to operate overseas. One of the major companies that does operate in this area at this present time already derives 80 per cent of its turnover—its income—offshore. That would have two effects: it would continue to employ the people within the industry and it would also continue to benefit Australia in that a large amount of income would be coming into Australia from overseas. I indicate that I will support the government's motion to bring on the bill and will look to the government's support to also allow the other four or five entities that had licences prior to the cut-off date to be allowed to operate. I commend the government for recognising that the gaming sector, included in the original bill, should be excluded.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-12-05,"—I rise to speak on the Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000. I am sure honourable senators will be relieved to know that, given the discussion about whether the Gene Technology Bill should be dealt with at this time, I will not be talking about Dolly, the cloned sheep. Rather, I will be talking about the privatisation of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. The purpose of the Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000 has been canvassed in the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, which was tabled and debated in this chamber on 30 October this year. I will not go through all of the details of the bill because they are familiar to honourable senators. There has been a long history of discussion within the wool industry and in the parliament about the various changes that have been occurring in the wool industry over the last few years. I want to make a couple of brief comments. Firstly, this legislation will lead to the privatisation of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. It follows on from earlier legislation—the Wool International Privatisation Bill 1999 and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Amendment (Funding and Wool Tax) Bill 2000, which was passed earlier this year. 
The history of the wool industry, particularly in more recent years, is well known to honourable senators. It has been canvassed in the report on this legislation and on other legislation. It is a history of some upheaval in more recent years. This was brought to a head in November of 1998 when a motion of no confidence in the board of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation—I will refer to it as AWRAP for short—was carried by a large meeting of wool growers. I That led the then minister, Mr Vaile, to call for the resignation of all of the board members and the subsequent establishment of the Wool Industry Future Directions Task Force, chaired by former minister Ian McLachlan. The meeting at which that no confidence motion took place also carried resolutions requesting the minister to prepare a plan for the complete commercialisation of the Woolmark Company and further a reduction in the statutory wool levy from four per cent to one per cent. 
By way of explanation, the Woolmark Company was established effectively as the successor company or organisation to the International Wool Secretariat. The International Wool Secretariat, IWS, was set up some years ago. It was established with the involvement of the major wool producing nations of the world, namely, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The role of the IWS was to promote the use and production of wool throughout the world, particularly having regard to competition from other fibres and products. The Woolmark Company was the successor body to the IWS and, indeed, we are all aware of the development of the Woolmark brand and label. That is an important piece of history because I want to come back to one of the key issues involved in this legislation to privatise AWRAP. 
I spoke earlier about the establishment of the Wool Industry Future Directions Task Force, which was chaired by Ian McLachlan. That task force presented a report and recommendations. Those recommendations and that report have been the subject of a lot of discussion in this chamber and in the committee. There is no need to go into that in detail, but two key recommendations of that report were, firstly, that there was a need for wool growers to take control of their industry and the promotion and marketing of it and that that should come about by virtue of the privatisation of AWRAP with new company structures and, secondly, that there should be a new levy struck following a vote of wool grower members. Wool growers throughout the nation ultimately voted for a levy of two per cent, which was half what they had previously been paying. 
As I said, the legislation we are dealing with privatises AWRAP, and it does so by establishing a new company called Australian Wool Services, or AWS. That company in turn will have two subsidiary companies. The first one will be called CommercialCo. Effectively, it will take over the areas that were previously dealt with by the Woolmark Company. The second subsidiary company will be called R&D FundCo. It will be established to manage the funds raised by the new two per cent wool levy, which will also be topped up with contributions from government. Shares in Australian Wool Services, AWS, will be allocated according to wool growers' tax payments over the last three years up to 30 June this year. There will be two types of shares: A class shares, where votes will be allocated proportionate to wool tax payments over three years; and B class shares, where the allocation of shares will be frozen and based upon historical payments. 
As I said earlier, the issues surrounding this legislation were canvassed widely and in detail in the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, which was debated on 30 October. At that time we in the opposition and also Senator Woodley raised some concerns about the passage of this legislation. We made it very clear that we supported the principle of the legislation—that is, to move to a privatised company with greater grower ownership and control—but that we were concerned to ensure that that took place in an orderly fashion and with no issues still unresolved. Therefore, in our minority report, we indicated that we had concerns about issues surrounding the outstanding liability to the South African company, Cape Wools Ltd, which was the successor company in South Africa to the South African Wool Board. Senators will recall that, earlier in my remarks, I referred to the fact that the South Africans were a partner with Australia and New Zealand in Woolmark. In our report we indicated that we believed that this issue needed further examination and, in our view, should be resolved before this legislation was passed by the Senate. It was clearly not our intention to delay this legislation unnecessarily. We were conscious that the industry and the government wanted the legislation introduced as soon as possible to allow the new companies to start operation from 1 January next year. But, having recognised that, we were also very concerned about this outstanding issue, which was still unresolved at the time of the report being tabled. There were other issues that we raised concerns about, including the fact that we had not been provided with a range of documents such as constitutions and other agreements that would sit side by side with the legislation. 
I will now deal with the issues surrounding the outstanding liability to the South African company, Cape Wools. This issue was covered in our report, but at that time we were constrained because evidence presented to us by AWRAP, Cape Wools and industry representatives had been taken in camera and we were not able to release that evidence or comment upon it. We were also concerned, of course, that there were negotiations going on between AWRAP and the South African company, Cape Wools, to try to resolve this outstanding liability. I understand—and this is something that we will be asking the parliamentary secretary to report on in the committee stage or when she makes her closing remarks—that this issue is essentially resolved. That is the information I have been provided with, but I would like some confirmation on that in due course. But it is important to put some things on the record. 
As a result of concerns expressed in our minority report, Senator O'Brien and I, and Senator Woodley from the Democrats, were attacked quite strongly by some representatives of the wool industry. Indeed, in a media release issued on 19 October 2000 entitled `Woolgrower anger if legislation delayed', representatives of the Wool Growers Advisory Group made a number of quite strong and strident attacks upon us. The article said:
Federal politicians would be ignoring the wishes and the interests of woolgrowers if the legislation to privatise the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation (AWRAP) and The Woolmark Company was blocked by the Senate, according to the Woolgrowers Advisory Group (WAG).
The article further stated:
The three spokesmen said that any suggestion that the passage of the legislation should be delayed until the Cape Wools matter is resolved would be contrary to woolgrowers' interests.
""Nobody knows how long it will take to resolve the remaining contractual issues with Cape Wools. There have been discussions for three years and who knows how long the negotiations will continue.""
I interpose there to say that, whilst having made that statement that there had been discussions going on for three years, we were told during the hearings—and I will come to the evidence later—that the industry were really kept in the dark about this issue for quite some time. It had come to their notice only in recent months. It was also noted in the report of the committee that members of the committee, indeed the Senate, were unaware of this outstanding issue, and certainly we were not aware of it at the time we had debated the earlier legislation that I referred to. The article goes on to say: 
""As far as woolgrowers are concerned, it is `all systems go' for the privatisation to proceed.""
""The very suggestion that the privatisation be delayed until the government appointed AWRAP Board resolves the Cape Wools matter is exactly the sort of political interference and paternalism we're trying to put behind us.""
""Woolgrowers' message to Parliament is clear: pass the legislation. And let us get on with the job,"" Mr Nicholls, Mr Gooch and Mr Wolfenden said. 
Those gentlemen represent the Woolgrowers Advisory Group. Their in camera evidence to the committee has now been made public by decision of this Senate. I think it is important to put on the record what those same gentlemen said to our committee in camera, because it tells the true story and it refutes the attack made upon us in that media release. In evidence on 2 October, Mr Wolfenden, the President of the Wool Council of Australia, said:  
As most of the senators explored the issues with us, we found ourselves in a very unenviable position of having a public position and a private position. Obviously, our position publicly stands and that is what we endorse and we are not in any way stepping away from that. However, as you have all correctly identified, there are basically only four sources of money or ways to fund the South Africans: there is equity; there are assets with the company—selling them off; there is the levy; and then there is a contribution by others. What we are quite clearly putting on the table is that wool growers will explore what is a fair or reasonable contribution as to their liability of having to buy out a partner in IWS. Obviously, to buy out that partner or to give them equity, that is a benefit to Australian wool growers; therefore we are prepared to look at what is a fair price. I would have to say at this point that I have not had time to read the chronology of the AWRAP Cape Wools, to see whether that sheds any light on it. But we also believe that the parties to the agreement and the position of the government in that agreement, in that setting forward of a process, does make them party to this agreement and they therefore have a liability to this process.
I suppose that, within our own groups, we have talked about limiting the liability of wool growers to what is, let us say, fair. We believe that there is a liability on the government to examine the outcome of the settlement, accept that liability and look at how they can ensure that the privatised CommercialCo does have a future, because obviously there is some speculation that the size of the liability to South Africa is big enough to put at considerable risk the privatisation and the floating of CommercialCo.
Here are some further comments from Mr Gooch in evidence:
I do not think that the support will be totally unqualified ... I do not think that there will be unqualified support should the ongoing levy payers—
that is the industry or wool growers—
be involved in the process of repaying this liability. I think we have to find some mechanism where the liability should be quarantined to the participants in the original agreement. The participants in the original agreement were AWRAP, the Woolmark Company and, by virtue of their representation, the government ... If the ongoing levy payers were to be involved in the settlement, I do not think that the unqualified support would be there.
There are further parts of this Hansard that I could read, but time does not permit. But the position that was being put to us by the industry representatives, these industry leaders, in the in camera committee hearings was that, whilst they supported privatisation and whilst they wanted us to pass that legislation, at the same time they wanted us or the government—they could not really identify who it was—to give them a guarantee that any liability owing to the South African company should not have to be picked up by levy payers and, further, that it should be picked up by the government. They were concerned because at that stage nobody knew what the liability would be, whether it would be $1 million, $10 million, $40 million or $100 million—figures that we had been told—and that, if this went through and the new companies were established, they could end with a settlement or, if by this stage litigation had commenced, some determination that visited a huge liability upon wool growers to have to pay, and that threatened the viability of the company. It is for that reason—that uncertainty—that we said we believe this needed to be pursued further and this legislation needed to be delayed. In our view, there is clear evidence also, which I know Senator O'Brien will go to, about the lack of management by the minister on this issue which allowed it to run on. Our position is that we will be supporting this legislation, but we do so because we understand that this issue has now essentially been resolved—there has been agreement between AWRAP and the South African company; I hope that has been confirmed—but there are still other matters that we will take up through the committee stages. ",SENATE,<title>WOOL SERVICES PRIVATISATION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-12-05,"—There is no doubt that the Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000 is a piece of legislation for which many people have been waiting for a long time. There is also no doubt that there is general support in this place for the legislation. That is certainly the Australian Democrats' position. When we received the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee on this matter, I put on the record a number of things that I will perhaps repeat today. I do seek a couple of assurances from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. At that point I will indicate those and look for an answer from her. I indicate that the Democrats are in support of the bill and of its passage as soon as possible. It is not always the case that we get to vote on a bill that has had such scrutiny. We compliment the committee—which I suppose is complimenting myself—and the committee secretariat on the amount of work which the committee has done in teasing out the various implications of this legislation, but we have now reached a point that allows us to agree with the legislation both in principle and in the detail. However, I will still be seeking some explanations, comments and assurances from the parliamentary secretary. 
The Democrats remain committed to having the bill passed and to having the changes in place by 1 January 2001. I could probably make much the same speech that Senator Forshaw has made. I will not repeat what he said, except to say briefly that one of the main reasons why we had some hesitation in agreeing to debate the bill and also to pass it concerned the issue of Cape Wools and the possibility of a debt being passed on to either the new company, which would affect the equity of wool growers, or wool growers directly through some increase for a period in the wool levy. I have been given assurances that the agreement between AWRAP and Cape Wools, if it has not been finalised now, is as close as possible to being finalised. For that reason, we are prepared to go ahead with debating the legislation.
I am also given assurances that the issue which I raised, and which others raised in the committee hearings, about who would pay for any remaining debt, which was not answered at the time, has now been answered in the sense that there are sufficient assets of the old AWRAP company to cover any contingent liability. That does not answer the question of what that does to the assets of the new company, and there is a concern there, but a debt does exist. Quite clearly, it is a debt against the assets of AWRAP and, therefore, it is appropriate that the debt be paid out of those assets. I still would want to argue—although I know that the government would not accept this—that I believe there is a moral, if not a legal, responsibility on the government to also make some contribution to that debt. I know I am not going to win that argument. I believe the government was very much involved in signing off on the agreement which established the framework for the payment of the equity to Cape Wools. Because of that I believe there is a moral responsibility on the government to make a contribution. However, I expect that that argument will be hard to win.
There is no doubt that all of us who have been involved in this debate for many years are committed to the establishment of the privatised companies. We are certainly committed to seeing the wool industry get back on its feet, as it is beginning to do. I need to put it on the record that this is one point on which I parted company with the Labor Party in our minority report, because I do believe that the freezing of the stockpile and the subsequent legislation did lift off the wool industry something which was forcing down the price of the fresh wool market. At least Senator Crane and I agree on that. We can probably never prove that absolutely, but we welcome the rise in wool prices since that time. At that point I did have to disagree with the Labor Party's dissenting report, although I agreed with the bulk of it. I believe that subsequent events since the freezing of the stockpile and then freeing it up again and selling it under a different regime has meant that the wool industry in general has been able to enjoy higher prices at auction.
One of the things that I think are critical in this legislation is that, while it is called a privatisation bill, it is not privatisation in the sense that the company is being bought by stockholders who just have a financial interest. Rather, what it does is transfer equity from AWRAP into growers' hands. They will have direct control of their own industry and of the levy which they will be paying. That is very appropriate. Members in this place will know that the Democrats have not supported many of the privatisation moves made by this and previous governments but, in this sense of privatisation, we support very strongly the fact that growers will have control of their industry through these new bodies. 
I very much thank people who have endeavoured to provide information, including industry peak bodies, AFFA, the minister's office and others. I also thank the people who I have had most association with over the years, and that includes the Australian Wool Growers Association, who have played a very constructive role, along with other bodies and other people, in bringing us to this point. 
As I said before, it is very important that we have reassurance. I will listen if the parliamentary secretary is able to give us any more up-to-date information than I received this afternoon about the agreement between Cape Wools and AWRAP, but in any case we are reassured that growers will not be burdened with an unknown amount of debt and that that debt is now covered.
There would be no security for wool growers if the rate of the levy was in any way problematical. It is quite clear that growers knew what they were doing when they voted for a two per cent levy. They were committing themselves to further research and development in their industry, and they were very strong about that. They were very clear that the levy should be at the rate of two per cent.
One of the other questions I wanted to ask the parliamentary secretary—and I am sure the departmental officers will hear this—concerns the whole problem of the wool producers who have been infected with ovine Johne's disease, particularly where they have had to de-stock. If we operated on the basis of the legislation in establishing their equity, they would be severely disadvantaged or end up having no equity at all. I was going to move an amendment to try to correct this, but I have had some assurances along the way that this is covered in the bill or the regulations. It would be very helpful if the parliamentary secretary would confirm that those wool producers who have had to de-stock because of ovine Johne's disease will not be disadvantaged in the allocation of equity.
I still have some concerns which I know Senator Ferris raised very strongly in debate and in questioning staff. They concern the problem of the transfer of staff from AWRAP to the new companies. I am not going to be critical of any individual—clearly there are many very highly qualified staff who would make a good contribution to the new companies—but there is the question of the transfer of the culture with which AWRAP was burdened. Probably that answer has been given, but it may be helpful if the minister addresses that question.
I note that in the legislation there is a requirement that no secondary representative bodies be formed under the auspices of this new company. The Democrats continue to support producers' groups which are funded by voluntary levies. Sometimes statutory bodies which are assured of funding through compulsory levies can become complacent and not responsive to the concerns of their membership. I believe that is what prompted the reaction which resulted in the Goulburn event some time ago. Those bodies which are unresponsive to the reality of producers' needs and operate in this environment of complacency, with no direct link to an individual producer's problems, will find themselves under increasing scrutiny. I am pleased that there is in the act the requirement that the levy not be used to fund those bodies. 
I have supported very strongly the rise of voluntarily funded bodies in the wool industry, the sugar industry and, more recently, the dairy industry, because I believe that those bodies can be much more representative of people at ground level. I commend the legislation to the Senate, having raised a couple of issues, and look forward to the parliamentary secretary's assurances a little later in this debate.",SENATE,<title>WOOL SERVICES PRIVATISATION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2000-12-05,"—Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, I think it is appropriate that the Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000 is being discussed with you, as a former gun shearer, in the chair. I do not think it is likely to happen again, and it is very appropriate. The legislation comes before the Senate on a day when the government has announced a very commendable and well received package for those thousands of grain growers affected by the flood and also comes three days before the annual general meeting of AWRAP—I expect the last AWRAP meeting—in Melbourne on Thursday.  
This is important legislation for Australia's 45,000 wool growers. As we all know, it is a vital industry for regional Australia. It has always been so and will be so for the foreseeable future. It completes the decision of the government to get out of the industry as far as possible by handing AWRAP back to growers. Firstly, the government privatised the stockpile and its debt. That happened two years ago, and wool growers have already benefited from the return of the capital, the better management of the sales and the upward movement of prices. We now have before us the privatisation of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, which comprises the assets of the Woolmark Company, some real estate, intellectual property and some financial reserves. It flows from the growers' decision in 1998 to sack the board of AWRAP and also the recommendations of the McLachlan inquiry and the interested groups mentioned by Senator Woodley, including the Woolgrower Advisory Group, the Australian Wool Growers Association and the interim advisory board of the new Wool Services Company.
The details of the benefits are well known. There is universal support for these changes. The second reading speech sets the scene well; however, I wish to raise a couple of matters in the very short time allocated to me in this debate.
The first is the status of the eight per cent interest of the South African Cape Wools company, their share of ownership of  Woolmark. The value of this has been negotiated and I understand is in the process of being settled to the satisfaction of both Cape Wools and AWRAP. I have a message from the legal advisers of Cape Wools who say that they expect that the negotiations will be concluded tonight. As an interested observer, I have no problem with Cape Wools keeping an equity in the new company. It was, however, the value they placed on a cash settlement in terms of their interest in Woolmark which was inappropriate. I want to put on the record that the South African negotiators I met were very decent people, like most people in the wool industry, and I think that they would bring an extra momentum and value to the new company if they chose to stay in.
The other matter that I wish to raise is a matter of some urgency. We did expect this legislation to be debated last week, before the 30 November cut-off date for the registration of shares in the new Wool Services company. This opportunity to apply for shares in the new commercial company is obviously something which will have to be extended because I understand only half the growers have registered for their shares. Those with an interest in CommercialCo will have permanent shares and the R&D company will have a rolling register, but existing levy payers—those people who have paid up to 30 June 2000—will have shares in the R&D company as well, and, of course, they will have shares in the commercial company. As I said, only half of those entitled to register have done so; at the end of November about 22,000 remained to be registered. There was a problem with flood affected growers, and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation said that they would make allowance for those people to register late, and I expect that they will. Just one final point on the registration of votes: I think that, having paid tax, wool growers found it very annoying that they had to register for votes in this organisation. If that was an indication of the level of competency of AWRAP, then I think the decision taken by growers to sack the board a couple of years ago was entirely appropriate. I am sure that the new privatised body will be a much classier show than the previous body. I have every expectation it will be. I commend the government on this legislation and I thank the main participants, the Woolgrower Advisory Group and the Interim Advisory Board, including Tony Sherlock and Rod Price, for doing the things that needed to be done to help get this important industry back on track.",SENATE,<title>WOOL SERVICES PRIVATISATION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-12-05,"—Firstly, can I say we have now had an opportunity to consider the proposed regulations referred to in this Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000, together with constitutions for the new corporate entities and the statutory funding agreement between the Commonwealth and the new company. I thank the government—or, more accurately, the officers of the department, Mr Sutton and Mr Roseby—for getting us the material. 
Since 1998, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee has undertaken a number of inquiries into the reorganisation of the Australian wool industry. We consider it a key rural industry. There is no doubt that the wool industry has gone through a difficult period, but wool growers are a resilient lot and I am confident that this industry has a positive long-term future. As part of these inquiries, the committee has sought to clearly identify all the costs of the proposed changes in industry structures to be met by growers. The reason is simple: it was the government who was spending the money on lawyers and financial experts and the like, and on behalf of the industry we wanted to make sure that the money was spent wisely. 
In December 1998 the committee undertook an inquiry into the provisions of the Wool International Amendment Bill. The primary purpose of that bill was to freeze the sale of wool from the stockpile of Wool International. The vast majority of growers and grower organisations were opposed to the freeze. The cost to wool growers of that government decision was estimated to be in the order of $20 million. That was clearly an unwise use of growers' money. In May 1999, the committee inquired into the provisions of the Wool International Privatisation Bill. The cost of the conversion of Wool International was approximately $5 million. In April 2000, the committee inquired into the Australian Wool Research and Promotional Organisation Amendment (Funding and Wool Tax) Bill 2000. The committee was advised that the cost to wool growers of the privatisation of AWRAP would be approximately $23 million. This is a considerable amount of money for growers to have to meet. It has been an expensive process.
The decision to privatise AWRAP followed a successful motion of no confidence in the AWRAP board passed at a meeting of growers on 30 November 1998. That meeting also passed a motion requiring AWRAP to prepare a plan to enable complete commercialisation of the Woolmark Company, and it recommended to the minister that the wool levy be reduced from four per cent to one per cent and be directed solely to research and development. The then minister Mr Vaile asked for the resignation of all AWRAP board members and established the Wool Industry Future Directions Task Force chaired by Mr Ian McLachlan to review the structures for wool marketing and promotion and research and development. That task force reported on 30 June 1999.
The task force report identified two key issues: firstly, the need to obtain value for money in expenditure in research and development and promotion; and, secondly, the need to put wool growers in charge of their industry. In September 1999 the minister, Mr Truss, announced an eight-point plan for implementing the task force report. The plan included the establishment of a wool working party to conduct and report on a vote of wool growers regarding their preferred wool levy funding options and associated service models. The opposition supports the general thrust of the reform of the Australian wool industry. In fact, it has to be said that, when in government, the opposition initiated a number of these changes.
The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee inquired into the provisions of the Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Amendment (Funding and Wool Tax) Bill 2000 on 6 April. As we have done on other occasions, the committee questioned witnesses about the cost of the privatisation process. We considered it essential that both the parliament and wool growers knew both the nature and the quantum of the cost to be incurred by the process that they were being asked to endorse. Despite questioning officers from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the Office of Asset Sales and Information Technology on the matter of costs, the committee were not advised of an unquantified liability to Cape Wools South Africa through its interest in the Woolmark Company. Cape Wools South Africa was formerly the South African Wool Board. 
At a hearing on 8 September this year, the committee further pursued the matter of costs to the industry incurred by this process. We were provided with a schedule of costs, but at no point during these hearings was the extent of liability to Cape Wools South Africa specified to the committee. It has also become clear from later evidence to the committee that the vast majority of wool growers did not know about the agreement between AWRAP and Cape Wools. Mr Nicholls, a member of the Woolgrowers Advisory Group, told the committee:
With the South African issue, I do not believe that any wool grower—not every wool grower but effectively any wool grower—was aware of the extent of the possible residual interest by South African wools in the Woolmark Company and I do not believe that wool growers were aware that it could impinge upon the privatisation and restructuring process. I think its materiality was not put in front of wool growers, and I am disappointed that it was not put in front of wool growers as and when it was developed. 
Senator Crane also expressed concern that the agreement between AWRAP and Cape Wools was not brought to the attention of the industry. He said:
I think one of the amazing things about this Cape Wools issue, because it did appear last year for the first time, is that nobody in the industry, including those of us who do read annual reports, picked it up and questioned it.
Mr Nicholls stated:
I believe the wording was designed to ensure that the sensitivity was not detected.
Senator Ferris described it as a `snow job'. Senator Crane said the schedule of unquantifiable liabilities amounted to an `open cheque book'. This situation was entirely unacceptable to both the industry and the Senate, and somebody should be held account-able for, firstly, creating the problem and, secondly, attempting to cover up the problem. 
It is of considerable concern that AWRAP, while meeting its obligation to keep the responsible minister informed of significant matters to do with its operation, failed to properly inform Australian wool growers about its arrangement with Cape Wools. It must be noted that the circumstances surrounding the arrangements entered into by AWRAP with Cape Wools, and the financial implications of these arrangements for growers, only became public when details were leaked to the opposition. In particular, the failure of AWRAP to properly disclose the terms of an agreement with Cape Wools South Africa in its annual report is of considerable concern. Successive ministers also failed to meet their responsibilities to the parliament by not properly informing members and senators of the true state of the authority, as they were obliged to do.
The government was formally represented on the AWRAP board when the new membership agreement with the then South African Wool Board was signed in 1997. Mr Alan Smart, Acting Executive Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Group in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, was the minister's representative on the board until 20 July 1997. Mr Paul Sutton, who headed the Wool and Dairy Branch of the department, replaced him. Mr Sutton was also responsible for providing the minister with policy advice on the wool industry and the statutory authorities that served it. Mr Sutton was therefore both a member of the AWRAP board and also the minister's key policy adviser on matters relating to the operations of AWRAP.
On 16 June 1997, the then chairman of AWRAP, Mr Alec Morrison, wrote to the then minister, Mr Anderson—the current Deputy Prime Minister—seeking approval for IWS International, now the Woolmark Company, to assume the assets, liabilities and operations of IWS. The nature of the agreement with Cape Wools South Africa was specifically drawn to the attention of the then minister. Under the heading `SAWB put option', the AWRAP letter drew Mr Anderson's attention to the clause in the members' agreement that gave Cape Wools South Africa the right to require AWRAP to buy all of Cape Wools's shares in the AWRAP subsidiary. Mr Sutton told the committee:
What I can say is that there was a very comprehensive submission prepared by the AWRAP board for the government's approval of the whole incorporation process. 
Mr Sutton said the department had advised the minister to approve the arrangement and he had done so. So the former minister for primary industry—now the Deputy Prime Minister—had the detail of this obligation on AWRAP to pay out Cape Wools specifically brought to his attention. He was asked to formally approve the arrangement, and he did. But, as if that was not bad enough, Mr Anderson was given another chance to save Australian wool growers many millions of dollars, and that is a matter that I intend to raise in the committee stage of this debate. 
The next minister, Mr Vaile, then left AWRAP without an effective board from 3 December 1998 through to the appointment of Mr John Priest and Associate Professor Andrew Vizard on 28 April 1999. According to the 1998-99 annual report, the board did not meet until 21 May 1999. So this organisation, caught up in a dispute with Cape Wools involving a great deal of wool growers' money, was left by Mr Vaile without a board. The problems caused by Mr Vaile's failure to appoint a new board are clear from the chronology of events provided to the committee by Cape Wools South Africa. This is simply inexcusable, and I intend to pursue this matter also in the committee stage.
Despite the efforts of Mr Anderson and Mr Vaile to distance themselves and the government from a direct role in this mess, it is clear that the government has had a direct role all along. In fact, Mr Rodney Price, the Chairman of the Interim Advisory Board and the man brought in by the government to fix the Cape Wool problem, told the committee that he was an employee of the Commonwealth and he confirmed that the Commonwealth was a party to the agreement, because he told the committee, `They actually own AWRAP.' Successive ministers have had a personal knowledge of, and on at least one occasion a direct role in, both the terms of the agreement between Cape Wools South Africa and AWRAP and the processes followed in an attempt to settle this matter since 1997. 
The committee was also provided with an opinion prepared by Marcus S. Jacobs QC, who stated in part:
There are serious commercial issues—
relating to the conversion of AWRAP—
one of which may possibly involve Commonwealth liability notwithstanding the provisions of section 61 of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 and of which Mr Yarra—
who was the Director of the Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing—
may not have been aware when he gave evidence before the Committee on 2 October, and when he, at p. 65 of the transcript of that evidence, said that he expected that there would be no residual liabilities of the Commonwealth, when the new legislation was in place.
So on the face of it, it appears that, despite claims to the contrary, the Commonwealth might also have an ongoing legal liability in relation to this matter. As has occurred on a number of earlier occasions, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee was asked to recommend to the Senate that a bill be passed without having access to related material such as regulations. Senator Crane referred to the problems faced by the committee because it did not have all the information it required to make an informed judgment about the merits of legislation before it. He said that he hoped all the information could be made available to the committee prior to the legislation passing through the Senate.
—It has been.
—Senator Crane says it has been, but it hasn't. Nearly all that material has now been provided, some of it reluctantly. However, some of the material sought by the committee remains outstanding. 
During the debate in the committee stage, I will seek an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Troeth, as to why the government has chosen to withhold some information from the Senate. A number of industry representatives told the committee that it should recommend that the Senate pass the bill. Senator Forshaw has touched on this matter. Their support to progress the bill was not unqualified. I asked the President of the Wool Council, Mr David Wolfenden, whether the industry wanted the bill passed regardless of the liability that might flow from the dispute with Cape Wools. Mr Wolfenden said: 
Hopefully, you would like to knock it off if you thought the liability to wool growers was totally open ended or what ever it might be.
And we are supposed to draw a conclusion from that as to at what point we should draw the line and say that it should not be passed on. 
While representatives of the industry told the committee in the public hearings that the bill should be passed, the view put by the industry in the in camera hearings was far less clear. The Senate has taken the very rare step of requiring the publication of the in camera evidence given by industry representatives. In that evidence, Mr Wolfenden told the committee:
But we also believe that the parties to the agreement, and the position of the government in that agreement, in that setting forward of a process, does make them a party to this agreement and they therefore have a liability to this process.
I interpret that to mean that he thinks they should pay some of the bill. Mr Gooch, a member of the Woolgrowers Advisory Group, told the committee:
I don't think there will be unqualified support should the ongoing levy payers be involved in the process of repaying this liability.
I think we have to find some mechanism where the liability should be quarantined to the participants in the original agreement—
that is, Mr Gooch asked the committee to impose an obligation on the government regarding the Cape Wools liability. It is interesting to see the contribution on page 28 of the in camera Hansard of the committee proceedings of Monday, 2 October, where Mr Nicholls said:
The dilemma I have is that the Cape Wools issue has to be resolved. It is going to be resolved whether it is a statutory authority or a privatised company—in other words, whether or not we pass the bill. So the issue is: who is going to pay? With respect to that decision, quite rightly, wool growers are saying that it should not be future levy payers because it is not consistent with the purposes for which the levy will be raised, so you cannot use that money. David Wolfenden has correctly identified that there are some reserves, there are some assets that can be sold, but until this issue was put in the public arena, wool growers believed that the Woolmark Company was a viable business. They had questions about its robustness. If it were put in private hands and given a commercial focus, they believe there was a possibility of it being a viable business. Decisions by past board members and management have resulted in that being severely compromised. Are you going to pass the poisoned chalice over to class B shareholders? That is the issue. If you do, you will wear the acrimony of those wool growers, those voters, when they find that the boards that governments appointed destroyed their asset and they received no compensation.
These comments are hardly unqualified support for the passage of the bill. This is hardly surprising, given the comments that were made on the public record suggesting that opposition senators who had trouble making such a recommendation should change their position and agree to pass the bill. In other words, these gentlemen were not prepared to say on the record what they really wanted to tell the committee, but the committee felt there was no other option but to publish that for the industry.
As I said at the beginning of my contribution on this second reading debate, we on this side of the chamber have sought details of all costs to growers of the reform—and, as I pointed out, those costs have been substantial—but we have taken the view, in line with the attitude of the government, that they are costs that should be met by the industry. That continues to be our view in relation to the costs flowing from this bill. But it appears to me—and this clearly is the view of the industry—that, in part at least, the costs flowing from the Cape Wools settlement are not legitimate costs associated with the reform process but costs incurred through incompetence: the incompetence of the former AWRAP board and the two senior ministers, Mr Anderson and Mr Vaile. The industry is arguing that the government should be brought to account on this matter, and I am inclined to agree with them.",SENATE,<title>WOOL SERVICES PRIVATISATION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2000-12-05,"—It is with a great deal of optimism that I speak on the Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000. Surely, this legislation will bring to an end the industry uncertainty of the past 10 years and the enormous and unquantifiable damage that has been inflicted on wool growers around Australia and their families. Importantly, this legislation will hand back to growers direct ownership of a new company—Australian Wool Services. This will allow wool growers at last to have ownership of their own organisation delivering services to the wool industry. A strong, market driven and commercially based struct-ure with growers themselves as the shareholders will enable them to at last determine the direction for the industry. 
The lack of accountability and transparency that had existed within AWRAP and previous wool grower organisations will at last come to an end. I shall never forget the look of amazement on the faces of the growers that I spoke to in South Australia when I first talked to them about the newly disclosed Cape Wools debt, nor for that matter the look of embarrassment on the faces of the industry leaders and departmental advisers as they tried to justify—quite disgracefully, in my view—a single line in the annual report, which was the first public indication of the financial liability that growers had incurred without their knowledge. In my opinion, that was an absolutely irresponsible position. Perhaps within a day or two this acrimonious situation involving Cape Wools and the previous wool grower organisations, beginning with IWS, will be publicly aired and resolved to the satisfaction of growers. 
I remain cautiously optimistic that the new wool promotion body can rid itself of the perception that AWRAP spent far too much time promoting itself and paying executives rather than fulfilling its basic and most important purpose: to promote wool and increase returns to growers. I would also hope that the legislation before us will ease the frustration felt by many growers who are conscious of the fact that, while more than $8 billion has been spent on wool promotion over the last 20-odd years, demand and prices for wool have declined. 
During our committee inquiry into this legislation, I argued very strongly that the key to making this privatisation process successful was to ensure that a fundamental cultural change was made within the AWS, the new company. I firmly believe that all positions in AWS should be contestable within the first 12 months of the company's operation. In doing this, the company will more effectively demonstrate accountability and the discipline necessary to bring about long overdue cultural changes in both management and staff, allowing the AWS to become an industry representative body in the most basic sense. I am aware of the likely redundancy costs that may arise from this process. There is no doubt that too many wool growers have had to pay far too much money and endure a great deal of personal hardship over the years. It does seem a great irony to me that still more dollars may be required, but this company simply has to make a fresh start.
The historic wool grower meeting in Goulburn almost two years ago now—when the no-confidence vote in the AWRAP board took place—was a very clear indication of growers' anger. I am not sure that that anger does not still exist out in the paddock, but I often wonder to what extent it is understood by the peak wool grower body. That Goulburn meeting was a very important milestone in the process of corporate democracy within the wool grower organisations and the industry itself. I now believe that the passing of this legislation will be yet another significant step in the long and painful process of reforming and strengthening this truly great Australian industry. The pastoral area of South Australia, along with all producers of high micron wools, not only have had to contend with poor management of their industry, which has been quite eloquently discussed in this chamber today, but also have had a series of very poor seasons and now, for many them, a disastrous locust plague. I fervently hope that this legislation will finally remove much of the government interference that has plagued this great industry for so long and that it will be welcomed by growers everywhere as a significant first step in the rebuilding of this great industry.",SENATE,<title>WOOL SERVICES PRIVATISATION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-05,"—I rise this afternoon to indicate, on behalf of Pauline Hanson's One Nation, that I will be supporting the Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000. The general intent of the Wool Services Privatisation Bill appears to be directed to the general benefit of the wool growing industry by giving control of the industry back to the growers themselves. While I will not be moving any amendments to the bill, I have some concerns regarding the management of the proposed new organisation. Here again we have the control of another agricultural industry being handed over initially to an unelected board. We are presently hearing many complaints of a similar nature in the meat industry regarding the MLA, hence my concern that this same quango situation not be permitted to be perpetrated on the wool growing industry in this country. The problems arising from the undemocratic situation of `taxation without representation' must not be permitted to be implemented in the wool industry. 
All the issues that I raise here today could be very simply discarded purely by vesting the control of Australian Wool Services Ltd directly into the hands of the growers themselves, thus passing full responsibility for the management into the hands of a board directly elected by growers. This, however, does not appear to be the current situation regarding the bill, and I feel that this erroneous decision is neither in the best interests of the growers themselves nor in the true spirit of democracy in this country. 
Taking into consideration that the funds being used to finance the new structure for wool growers will be primarily funded by the growers themselves, I question the right of the government to impose such restrictive practices upon the industry. The claim will no doubt be made that the growers themselves indicated in Wool Poll 2000 how they wanted the industry to proceed. While, simplistically, this is correct, when I spoke to individual farmers and asked them more specific questions relating to the implementation of the bill, they showed a lack of knowledge of the finer detail and the consequences that would befall them with the introduction of this new piece of legislation. None were aware of the total lack of control and lack of accountability they, as growers, would have over this board. None were aware of the fact that they, the growers, would not be given the right to directly elect the board; that they, the growers, would not have the right to direct the board in the direction that they, the growers, wanted to go; and that they, the growers, would not be given the right to direct their funds in the areas they wanted them invested in. And so the situation goes on. 
Again and again we see this happening in agricultural industries within Australia and the consequential disastrous results of this line of thinking regarding industry within the country. The bill in its present form will perpetuate the economic rationalist destruction presently running rampant over all levels of public and private industry in the country. It is now becoming obvious to all what the end result will be.
I will be requesting further details from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on many aspects of the bill about which I have concerns. Some of those are related to the actual conducting of Wool Poll 2000. I will also have some questions regarding the actual structure of the board—the numbers that are envisaged to be on the board of Australian Wool Services Ltd, how many positions the growers themselves will actually hold on the board and what level of scrutiny the growers will have over the awarding of contracts arising from their industry. So, as I have indicated earlier, Pauline Hanson's One Nation will support the implementation of the Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000 but will be seeking clarification from the minister on many aspects of the actual function of the board.",SENATE,<title>WOOL SERVICES PRIVATISATION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,2000-12-05,"—As I only have seven minutes, I am going to have to deal with a lot of these things in one-liners, unfortunately. The first point I will make is that it is a great day for the wool industry, because, at long last—and it is something that I have worked for assiduously since I got into this place in 1990—the day has come when the wool industry will take control of itself and will run its own affairs. 
In terms of the Cape Wool decision, all I can say in shorthand to that is that it was a dumb decision, and the decision of the board of AWRAP to keep it secret was even dumber. I think that is the best way of putting it and keeping growers in the light. I reject totally the claims made by the Labor Party with regard to Minister Anderson. Minister Anderson did what was required of him under the legislation—legislation which was the brainchild of the Labor Party and brought in, I think, in 1993. They are the facts of the matter. 
I just want to deal now with the cost that was talked about by Senator O'Brien. If you want to look for a culprit who nearly drove this industry into oblivion, just look at the Labor Party and what they did to this industry between 1985 and 1990. What did they do? They jacked up the reserve price, taxed wool growers almost into oblivion and then collapsed the price—that is what they did. Remember, Mr Kerin went overseas; what did he say? `This reserve price is rock solid.' What did he do when he got back to this country? He collapsed it. What did that cost wool growers? You people talk about $20 million; what did that cost wool growers? Two billion dollars of equity was written off, $2 billion of debt—if I remember my figures correctly—and four million bales falsely bought into a stockpile under a price regime that was not sustainable. Who was responsible for that? The Labor Party were responsible for that, and they sent a lot of my best friends broke. So do not come in here and lecture us about price and what occurred, because you got it so badly wrong.
The committee that I have been involved in has worked assiduously since 1990 through a number of things—the Garnaut report, the McLachlan report—to correct this. We are now at a day of reckoning when some of these things will be corrected. So I say through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, when people in glass houses start throwing stones, they want to have a very careful look at their own record. Because it ain't very smart; it ain't very good. A lot of people were hurt—hurt to the point of not being able to recover.
I want a say a little more about the freeze of the stockpile. If there was an architect for the freeze of the stockpile, it was me. It was done for a particular purpose. It was done so that the wool industry could have some breathing space to get their house in order. What was a direct result of that first freeze of the stockpile? The price of wool went up very smartly. The election came, the freeze on the stockpile was taken away and the price went down. I do not have the graph here, but I can get it. The day after the freeze was put back in place, the price went up again. Nobody can measure the importance of that in terms of that extra money that went into growers' pockets because of it. I regret there was a gap in the middle, because some people missed out. But that was unfortunate; that was one of those things that happened in the process of an election. Keeping that freeze in place could not be done during the election. You have to look at these things in a sensible and constructive manner. I reject absolutely and totally that it was not the beginning of the restructure of our great wool industry, and I must declare an interest in the industry—I have been in it for 50 years now. The freezing of the stockpile was the beginning of the commercialisation. Where is the stockpile today? We have had a significant payout. It is a non-issue. It never gets mentioned because the little games that were being played by the people who were running it then on non-commercial lines were costing growers many dollars.
I have had access to information—and I think I tabled some of it in this place previously—that they were not always selling to the highest bidder. That was what was happening. That is why we had to freeze the stockpile. That is why we had to reform this industry. This is part of the process. It was begun by the growers. It was begun by the growers with the sacking of the AWRAP board because of faulty legislation introduced by the previous government. Some of them drove 1,500 miles across the country to sack that board. Why did they have to do that? Because the process of getting rid of the board did not allow for a proper proxy structure so they could do it in the way you could with a corporations company. I am sorry that I am a bit emotional here today, but I have heard some of the nonsense coming from the other side about their performance in the wool industry. They throw these accusations around the place, but they have done nothing to hold their heads up high about; in fact, they should hang their heads a little. 
We are still paying the price for the fact that that stockpile was allowed to run out of control by the previous administration in this country. It is something I believe we can now recover from. We are in the process of recovering from it. I only have to look at my own returns this year now we are getting some stability back into the industry. My heart bleeds for so many of those wool growers who should never have been forced out of the business by the bad policy—the terrible policy—that existed at that time. 
I want to acknowledge the reporting process and the work that the committee has done. There is nobody on that side, on this side or on the Democrat benches who can claim the credit in isolation from anyone else. You only have to read the Hansard. You only have to read the questions that I have asked about the secret and disgraceful evidence, if you can call it that, that was put to us when a group of industry people gave two positions to the committee. I said you cannot have your cake and eat it. Do you remember that? In the last paragraph I said:
It is useful having the information as long as you people understand that and do not come out and belt us tomorrow for not taking action yesterday.
They gave us information we could not use in our report. The moment has passed for the use of that evidence. In due course, what Cape Wools and what AWRAP—or, more correctly, Mr Price and Mr Sherlock—put on the record will be released, if I can read the views of the committee. I am absolutely certain that will be done. We decided the other day in our discussions that we would not release it at this time because it may jeopardise the finalisation of the deal between Cape Wools and AWRAP.
Finally, government senators voted in our committee structure for the process to go ahead. Time will tell but, if the wool services legislation had been passed quicker and had been dealt with before the deal was made, we could have had a situation whereby the valuation of the new AWRAP, the wool services company under corporations legislation, would have been lower than it was under the existing AWRAP. Therefore, between seven per cent and eight per cent of a lower figure is a smaller slice of the cake. I suspect at the end of the day that, because that legislation was not passed earlier, it could well cost the wool growers another couple of million dollars. Having said that, I think on balance that what has been done over the last two years or thereabouts will put the wool industry on a much firmer footing. I do not want to hear any more nonsense—I will be disappointed to hear any more—comparing the cost of this government to the wool industry with that of the previous administration and the billions of dollars that went down the drain between 1985 and 1990.",SENATE,<title>WOOL SERVICES PRIVATISATION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Troeth, Senator Judith",LP,2000-12-05,"—The purpose and the operation of this Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000 have been thoroughly canvassed in the House and here in the Senate. I do not intend to go into detail on these matters other than to say that the conversion of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation—known as AWRAP—and its subsidiary, the Woolmark Company, to Corporations Law arrangements does give wool growers ownership over the organisation which delivers their industry's services. The government's role will be significantly reduced to oversighting the statutory funding mechanism and ensuring accountability for the funds provided to the new companies. That is what wool growers have been calling for. Passage of the bill will allow it to proceed.
I propose to deal briefly with some matters and then move to those questions that have been asked, which I will endeavour to deal with in my speech during the second reading stage and in the committee stage. If I have not got up to dealing with any of those matters or there are further questions, I will endeavour to deal with them then. The minister has already responded to the issues raised in the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee's report during the debate in the House of Representatives. I think the minister has made it very clear that none of the proposed amendments to the bill are necessary. The statutory funding agreement prohibits the new company from funding agripolitical activity. The shareholder eligibility regulations make it clear that no-one can be forced to receive shares against their will, and the government has instituted a review into the coverage of the wool levy to include non-shorn wool. I do not intend to go over that ground again, but I am happy to answer specific questions on the report's findings. 
The opposition have made it clear that they will not support the bill until flesh has been put on what they describe as its bones. This flesh has now been provided to the Senate committee in draft form by way of the constitutions for Australian Wool Services Ltd and its subsidiaries, Australian Wool Innovation Ltd and the Woolmark Company. The statutory funding agreement, referred to as the contract in the bill, provides the details of accountability and reporting requirements to be placed on the new company for it to receive the wool levy. The Senate committee has been provided with the key regulations flowing from the bill, which set out the eligibility requirements for shareholding under the new arrangements. They provide for the new levy to replace the existing wool tax. They set the rules for polls to determine the future rate of wool levy, and they determine the formula for calculating the Commonwealth's matching contribution for eligible research and development projects.
As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry advised on 1 November, the legal position of the Commonwealth in relation to the Cape Wools liability is clear. The Commonwealth will transfer the liability to the new company so as to ensure that the interests of all parties are not altered as a result. Importantly, under the AWRAP Act, Cape Wools would not be able to access AWRAP assets within the Wool Research and Development Fund. The conversion arrangements continue to take this into account. The Cape Wools liability exists now as a liability of AWRAP. If it is not privatised, the liability remains a liability of AWRAP. If it is privatised, it continues as a liability of Australian Wool Services. The liability is manageable and the industry is quite clear that it should not delay the privatisation. The liability is no greater than 8.3 per cent of the value of some intellectual property that AWRAP fully owns, and it is the value of this intellectual property that is in dispute.
The management of AWRAP's liabilities will ultimately be a commercial matter for the new company structure to address. I understand that negotiations are proceeding well with Cape Wools, and the government has every confidence that Mr Tony Sherlock, the AWRAP chairman, and Mr Rodney Price, the chairman designate of the new company, will conclude the negotiations with the South Africans on a reasonable and satisfactory basis. I would simply say that the parliament should respect the wool growers' publicly stated wish that this matter be left in the capable hands of Mr Price and Mr Sherlock. Progress continues on the establishment of the dual-class shareholder register. As of this week, around 35,000 wool growers have applied for shares in the new company. That is a very encouraging result, and it sends a clear message that wool growers are strongly supportive of these arrangements.
In relation to the boards of the new companies, Mr Rodney Price has been appointed chairman of the inaugural board, and the minister expects to have discussions shortly with the IAB on the final nomination of board members. Appointments to the inaugural boards will be made in consultation with the Wool Growers Advisory Group. After the establishment of the new companies, board appointments will of course be made under Corporations Law procedures and accountable to the companies' shareholders. The IAB and the Wool Growers Advisory Group continue to work tirelessly in developing the new arrangements. Once again, I pass on the government's thanks for their efforts to date. The spirit in which this whole process has been undertaken is a testimony to how industry and government, as well as public and private sectors, can work.
The momentum to meet the 1 January 2001 target for the establishment of the new arrangements continues to build. Passage of this legislation now will make that objective all the more achievable. Further delays will put pressure on the range of activities which are currently running parallel but are ultimately subject to passage of this bill as they approach resolution in the lead-up to the first day of private sector provision of wool industry services. Over three-quarters of Australian wool growers have now registered interest in the new company. If we delay passage of the bill, it has the effect of preventing wool growers from receiving shares in their new company—something that they have been calling for for some time now. 
I will now deal with some of the questions that have been raised in speeches during the second reading debate and, as I said, if there is anything I do not have time to cover or if there are further questions, I am sure we will be able to deal with those in committee. Firstly, Senator Harris remarked on what he considered the undemocratic nature of the appointment of the board. As with other agricultural industries, that board will be elected after the first annual general meeting of the new company. But I must say to you that, in my experience of dealing with this and other agricultural industries, you may find that growers do not necessarily want what you would call a representative board. They want a board that has a wide base of skills, and that is something that any truly competitive private sector commercial board needs in this day and age. We would not want a board, for instance, composed entirely of wool growers. We need another much wider aspect of business experience, commercial dealing, intellectual property aspects and other aspects of board experience brought into this. I imagine that that is what wool growers will be looking at when they move to elect a board.
Senator Woodley also had some questions, firstly, regarding the provision for those growers who feel that they have been disadvantaged because of their experience with ovine Johne's disease. This matter, Senator Woodley, has been raised with the Interim Advisory Board, and it has already undertaken to consider this matter compassionately. The constitution of the new company enables the board to consider such exceptional circumstances and, with that particular aspect of the sheep industry at the moment, I imagine that it would move to do so.
Senator O'Brien also made a couple of comments which I would like to deal with. For instance, he referred to the fact that the Cape Wools business was a cost of conversion. The Cape Wools liability existed irrespective of the conversion. As I think even you pointed out, it was a line item in an annual report, regardless whether anybody actually took it up. So it was a matter that existed whether or not we then moved to conversion. Therefore, it cannot be considered a cost of conversion. I should also tell you that Mr Sutton was not appointed to the board of AWRAP—you referred to Mr Paul Sutton—until after the minister agreed to the conversion of the IWS to AWRAP, at which time he was the departmental adviser. Therefore, he had no conflict of interest, as was implied by you. I would like to point that out.
I will now deal with some of the other questions. I think Senator Sandy Macdonald made a point regarding the wool grower response to wool share. I have already indicated the number of applications that have been made. In relation to the supply of documents identified in the Senate committee inquiry, regarding the offer by Mr Price to forward a statement of accounts ending September 2000 to the committee, I am not aware of this matter but I can ask the department to follow it up. Again, if Mr Sherlock has promised a summary of matters relating to AWRAP and Cape Wools, then we will also follow that up through the department. Some other questions may come up in committee as well. I might leave it there for the moment. I am sure that, as you suggested in your earlier remarks, we will be dealing with some of these other matters at a later stage. I commend the bill to the Senate and I thank honourable senators for their comments.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time. ",SENATE,<title>WOOL SERVICES PRIVATISATION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-12-05,"—I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated on 5 December. I seek leave to move government amendments (1) and (2) to clause 5 of the bill on sheet EV235 together.
Leave granted.
—I move:
(1)	Clause 5, page 5 (after line 23), after paragraph (3)(a), insert:
	(aa)	a service to the extent to which it relates to betting on, or on a series of, any or all of the following:
	(i)	a horse race;
	(ii)	a harness race;
	(iii)	a greyhound race;
	(iv)	a sporting event;
	(ab)	a service to the extent to which it relates to betting on:
	(i)	an event; or
	(ii)	a series of events; or
	(iii)	a contingency;
		that is not covered by paragraph (aa);
 (2)	Clause 5, page 5 (after line 28), after subclause (3), insert:
	(3A)	Paragraphs (3)(aa) and (ab) do not apply to a service to the extent to which:
	(a)	the service relates to betting on the outcome of a sporting event, where the bets are placed, made, received or accepted after the beginning of the event; or
	(b)	the service relates to betting on a contingency that may or may not happen in the course of a sporting event, where the bets are placed, made, received or accepted after the beginning of the event.
	(3B)	Paragraph (3)(ab) does not apply to a service to the extent to which the service is:
	(a)	a service for the conduct of a lottery; or
	(b)	a service for the supply of lottery tickets; or
	(c)	a service relating to betting on the outcome of a lottery; or
	(d)	a service for the conduct of a game, where:
	(i)	the game is played for money or anything else of value; and
	(ii)	the game is a game of chance or of mixed chance and skill; and
	(iii)	a customer of the service gives or agrees to give consideration to play or enter the game; or
	(e)	a service relating to betting on the outcome of a game of chance or of mixed chance and skill.
These amendments seek to exempt from the moratorium a service to the extent to which it relates to betting on, or on a series of, any or all of the following: horse race, harness race, greyhound race, sporting event; a service to the extent to which it relates to betting on an event, or a series of events, or a contingency that is not covered by paragraph (aa). The amendments are designed to exempt wagering services that allow bets on a sporting event after it has commenced. In other words, the new moratorium will have the same coverage as the bill of introduction, except that wagering services that do not allow bets after a sporting event has commenced will be exempt. Interactive gaming services such as Internet casinos are still subject to the moratorium. The amendments specifically provide that services relating to betting on a horse race, harness race, greyhound race, sporting event and betting on any other event, series of events, or contingencies are excluded services for the purpose of the moratorium. The only interactive wagering services falling within the moratorium are those that allow betting on a sporting event after the event has commenced. Wagering on a non-sporting event after it has commenced is not captured in the new moratorium. Wagering on a series of sporting events after the series has commenced is also not captured; for example, betting on the result of a tennis tournament after the tournament has commenced is not affected.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-12-05,"—What we are witnessing here tonight with the reintroduction of the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 is coalition hypocrisy on a major scale. The coalition so desperately want to pass some kind of legislation about gambling online that they have sacrificed any claimed principle in order to garner crossbench support. The Senate has already held this debate but, nevertheless, the government have pushed aside other critical legislation scheduled to be debated tonight in order to placate a directive that I understand to be directly from the Prime Minister to get something through, whatever it is, on interactive gambling this week in the Australian parliament. It is no secret that Senator Alston is not around tomorrow, so this is the last-ditch effort the coalition have to actually deliver on long-held rhetoric. 
For the record, in March 2000, after extensive submissions and evidence were presented, the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies released the Netbets review of online gambling in Australia. In September, the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee released its report into the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000. Despite the plethora of documents, reports and submissions, the coalition have chosen to ignore the evidence and continue with their objective: to attempt to make Internet gambling illegal. On the one hand, we have a minister alleging that Australia is a new economy and that we are technologically savvy and capable of being a world player in e-commerce and online transactions. On the other hand, Senator Alston is in the chamber tonight trying to make activities that are perfectly legal offline illegal when they are online. To make the hole the minister has dug for himself even bigger, he is now claiming that separating wagering from gaming somehow solves the problem of Internet gambling. Some sort of road to Damascus conversion was obviously experienced by Senator Alston in the period since we last debated this bill. 
Under these riding instructions that seem to have come from the Prime Minister, Senator Alston is now being forced to reintroduce this bill, which totally contradicts the government's previous position. This resubmitted bill, with the amendments outlined by Senator Alston, contradicts the previous claim that a moratorium on Internet gambling must encapsulate all forms of interactive gambling. I remind the coalition and senators what Minister Alston said when he first presented this bill on 9 October:
As I understood it, it is being suggested that there is somehow some valid distinction between gaming and wagering. Each of them involves putting money on an outcome or, if you like, having a bet. One is a mechanically determined outcome; the other is a real-life event. Beyond that, they each involve the outlay of money based on some element of chance, and in that sense they both constitute interactive gambling. The government's view is that, to the extent that through the Internet, the television set or otherwise it is possible to generate a new industry that caters for either or both of those streams of chance, they should all be put on hold for the period of the moratorium in order to make a judgment about what is a sensible approach.
That was clearly the government's position. In fact, they contended amendments put forward by the members of the crossbench at the time to give effect to the separation of gaming and wagering. The government made it very clear, in that principled approach that they were claiming they were taking, that a moratorium encompassing all online gambling was warranted. But it seems now that that has all been disregarded.
It is no wonder that the development of e-com-merce and the use of the Internet in Australia are being retarded under the Howard government. There is no doubt that the perception of this kind of legislative treatment of issues relating to the Internet does impact on Australia's international reputation as being a nation capable of dealing with the challenges of the future. Interactive gambling happens to be the profile victim at this point, but we have seen it previously with sexually explicit material and other issues.
I turn to the basics of the argument for opposition to this bill. What the coalition is proposing is technically unfeasible and unworkable. During the last debate, Senator Alston was repeatedly asked to explain the technical feasibility of preventing all Australians from accessing interactive gambling sites, which is what the implication of all the government rhetoric led Australian citizens to believe. We are still waiting for the minister's response. We are still waiting for the government to explain how harm minimisation and consumer protection will be afforded to Australian citizens if they are unable to access regulated, transparent and legitimately operated sites. We are still waiting for the government to explain how sending Australian punters offshore to unregulated and dodgy sites on the Internet will somehow deal with the complex issues of gambling in society. We do know from a variety of expert sources that this legislation would simply drive potential problem gamblers offshore to these unregulated sites. We know that there are over 800 unregulated offshore Internet casinos worldwide. Issues such as personal security, including credit card details and other private information, are not guaranteed by these operators. 
Labor's position, on the other hand, is that simply turning your back on Australians who are forced offshore to bet online is a negligent and unproductive approach to the problem associated with gambling. The Labor Party are concerned about gambling and we are aware of community concerns about gambling. We are conscious of community apprehension about the social dysfunction stemming from problem gambling, but the bill does not address these issues. We know from the Productivity Commission report into gambling in this country that the vast majority of social harm is associated with the availability and use of poker machines. The rhetoric and concern expressed by the government belongs appropriately in those directions. But do we see activity from the federal government in this area? No. For all of their concerned rhetoric, we see them targeting this issue of interactive gambling and applying what is an incredibly flawed and unjustifiable approach to managing these problems. As I have said all along, this bill is really about censoring Internet content. It is about making something illegal online that is legal offline. If there is a problem with content accessibility and potential social risks, let us look at those issues and evolve a workable practical framework that addresses them. I will speak a little later about the role that the states have in regulating gambling content.
Our principal concern is that the bill does not address the broad issues of gambling in Australia and the possible problems associated with sports betting. That is why Labor have consistently approached this bill for what it is—a bill about the Internet and Inter-net censorship. The flaws in the legislation are numerous, and for the umpteenth time I will go through the specific points con-cern-ing our opposition to it. In the first place, it does not deliver strong workable regulation of interactive gambling, which is the most practical and effective way of ensuring minimal social harm. In fact, all the evidence shows that this legislation will exacerbate problem gambling online in Australia by barring access to regulated online gambling services that do provide built-in safeguards. We heard about those safeguards at the various committees—that there are more improved methods of safeguarding problem gamblers online than there are offline.
Secondly, the bill does not extend current regulatory and consumer protection requirements that apply to offline and land based casinos or clubs to online casinos and similar facilities. We have not seen any activity at all by the coalition in the intervening period to encourage the states to proceed stridently down this path. The government has sat back on its laurels and has not even tried to apply the most effective means of avoiding the problems that could be derived from interactive gambling. It is absolutely ridiculous for the coalition to argue that consumer protection and harm minimisation are needed for one type of technology when it ignores it for the other. Additionally, the opportunity that exists for the coalition to deploy serious and meaningful preventative strategies is being completely and continually ignored.
Thirdly, the proposed moratorium would damage Australia's reputation as a leader in providing effective consumer protection laws and strong workable gambling regulations. There is no secret that, in terms of Australia's reputation, almost single-handedly Senator Alston has allowed Australia to develop a reputation as a global village idiot when it comes to addressing issues of social concern related to technological change in the Internet. 
Fourthly, by singling out one particular form of gambling—and I refer now to the amendments—in an attempt to create the impression that it is placating community concern about adverse social consequences, the Howard government is sustaining a position of hypocrisy. Fifthly, the Productivity Com-mission report into Australia's gambling industries acknowledged that the Internet does in fact offer a greater level of consumer protection and safeguards than other forms of gambling. 
Sixthly, by separating wagering and gaming, the coalition will in effect divide the industry and create a whole new tier of winners and losers. Operators such as Lasseters Online, Southern Cross and others will have their business operations damaged by this bill. The coalition has not applied any consistent assessment to the operation of existing businesses and has never paid any regard to that. Whilst that is not the motivating issue behind our concern, there is no doubt that it should be a consideration at least in the principles guiding any legislation dealt with in this place and as a factor in the coalition's understanding of the problems. 
Many of the online operators already comply with strict state and territory guidelines which will ensure that problem gambling is addressed and the maximum harm minimisation measures enforced. Yet other online operators, such as those involved in racing and sports wagering, will be allowed to continue without restriction. This artificial division highlights the hypocrisy of the government's position and their willingness to do anything to pass legislation regardless of how detrimental and flawed it is.
I would like to conclude by reiterating Labor's position. This legislation will not stop problem gamblers from betting online, because there is nothing in the legislation that prevents people in Australia from accessing gambling sites. It will not stop Australian punters being ripped off or having their personal details misused. This bill will prevent the creation of a regulated online gambling industry. This bill does not address the social issues such as problem gambling, domestic violence or family breakdowns that arise from that. In fact, it is misleading in that it gives the impression that it will solve some problems when the majority of the real causes of many of those issues continue to be ignored. And this bill does not provide harm minimisation or consumer protection. 
What will address these issues is a workable, coordinated legislative framework, something the coalition refuses to acknowledge and refuses to take leadership on in guiding the states to a uniform regulatory environment. The Labor Party maintains that the principal objectives of gambling regulation should include consumer protection, ensuring a quality gambling product by financial probity checks on providers and their staff. It should provide education for punters, the general public, and athletes who are actually performing out there in the sports world. It should minimise any criminal activity linked to gambling and be strident in preventing illegal activities. It should contain the social costs of gambling by limiting access and ensuring that funds are available to assist those with gambling problems. It should maintain and protect a significant revenue base for governments, with universal standards for all operators and examination of internal protocols with the aim of achieving multilateral achievements on sports betting. It should limit the exploitation of monopoly market positions and ensure that some of the benefits accrue more directly to the local community.
We have called on the coalition to provide mechanisms to exclude those not eligible to gamble under Australian law rather than implementing a moratorium or ban which will allow minors to bet on unregulated offshore sites. The coalition should implement problem gambling controls such as exclusion from facilities, expenditure thresholds, no-credit betting and the regular provision of transaction records. If they were serious about addressing interactive gambling issues, they would have coordinated the development of a co-regulatory regime through the ministerial council comprising the relevant state ministers addressing all of these issues.
Our position is that the existing regulatory requirements for land based gambling and gaming agencies should be extended to include online gambling in casinos, which would be required to meet the same licensing, auditing and probity requirements. Without a national regulatory framework, Australia's reputation as a leading regulator of gaming and gambling will be diminished and Australian citizens will be open to unscrupulous manipulation.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-12-05,"—I rise as the Democrats' technology spokesperson, following on, probably appropriately, the contribution of Senator Lundy, representing her party in the area of IT. She has correctly identified that the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 deals primarily with an attack on technology and is a bill in relation to information technology issues. It has the word `gambling' in the headline but, as we have heard in contributions in past debate and have revisited in the debate today after the recommittal motion, the government has failed to take advantage of a rare opportunity to do something about the pressing social issues associated with gambling. 
In the context of this process—not only the bill but the process leading up to it—Senator Lundy quite rightly identifies the fact that in the last few months the federal government has not really done anything in relation to this issue. The states and territories and the industry have been working to ensure that some progress has been made and in many respects people in that industry and in the states and territories have, if they had not previously, now embraced many of the recommendations referred to in the Netbets inquiry. I am not sure how many people in the chamber currently were involved in that inquiry apart from Senator Lundy and me, but perhaps we have lived with this issue a little longer than even those who are the staunchest advocates of the legislation before us today. We have an understanding of what was required in the industry in terms of national and consistent legislation—or frameworks, standards or guidelines, more appropriately—and had an opportunity to look not only at the technical and technological issues but at some of the pressing social issues which I think everyone has a concern about.
As most people in the chamber would know—I hope—the Darwin gaming summit of senior gaming officials from the Australian states and territories, Norfolk Island and New Zealand concluded recently with a range of harm minimisation and player protection measures in line with the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies Netbets report recommendations. The idea was to strengthen the national model considered by state ministers in 1997. 
It is worth again putting on record the fact that the industry we are dealing with at the moment has on balance much stronger protections, regulations and standards than land based gambling and most casinos. As I indicated in the last debate, the Democrats are waiting for the government, in the same way that they have set their sights on online services, to set their sights on doing something about land based gambling. It is no surprise that the pokie industry is among the strongest supporters of this legislation—surprise, surprise; I wonder why!—because it might get rid of a competitor. I am personally not interested to giving a great big fillip to the pokie industry in Australia, but I am not quite sure why those people on the government side who purport to have such a commitment to ruling out the problems associated with gambling are moving legislation that is favoured by so many other aspects of the gambling industry.
Senator Lundy mentioned that the ALP had a consistent position. The Democrats have a consistent position, too. This is a free vote for our party room, and we are proud of that fact. We too will be voting in a consistent manner this time; I do not think that is any surprise to anyone in the chamber. We all have concerns about gambling issues. I acknowledge the right of at least two of my colleagues to send a message. Because they feel frustrated and because all of us feel frustrated about the lack of progress and the lack of leadership that has been shown, specifically from the federal government, in resolving some of the problem issues associated with gambling, they feel strongly about sending a message not only to the states and territories but also to various aspects of the gambling industry. 
I think in many respects that has happened, and that is why this legislative debate seems less relevant to me than it did a few months ago—not only because of the outcomes of the Darwin gaming summit. At best this government could claim, `Well, we have sent a bit of a message to the states and territories and they have got their act into gear a bit better than they had previously.' But we cannot deny that progress has been made. There is a strong argument that states and territories have a better understanding of some of the need for regulation or legislation in this area, that they have been so-called experts in wagering and gaming regulation and that they should have a pivotal role in determining a national world's best practice arrangement when it comes to regulation. That goes to the heart of this debate as well. 
Legislation by press release—just talking in a procedural sense—is unacceptable in this country. I think all of us as legislators should reject that notion. Similarly, in the Netbets inquiry the majority report signed off on the notion of a moratorium, but a moratorium with very clear conditions and provisos: that this was a consultative process and it would not simply be a top-down, overwhelming, mandatory approach by the federal government without consultation. Yet that is what we have seen. No wonder there has been bad faith generated between the states and territories and the federal government on this matter.
When we first had this debate, the Democrats put forward amendments, and I will put forward similar amendments tonight but not necessarily the same amendments or with the same intention—although one of my amendments seeks to get rid of the retrospective nature of this legislation. We came up with what we thought was a technologically savvy solution to this problem—an e-solution, if you like—supported by all my colleagues. There is one thing all nine of us agree on and that is that this bill has not been good enough. If it really were to achieve the objectives set out by the government, then it has to be improved markedly in a whole range of areas that we have put on record before, some of which Senator Lundy has mentioned today. 
We recognised that there were unworkable elements to this bill. There was the notion of the retrospectivity of the bill, to begin with. But we put forward an intermediate, three-month, non-retrospective moratorium for the express purpose of establishing a national regulatory system with the states and the territories. It was a technologically sympathetic solution to a technological problem. We proposed a moratorium, effective from the date of royal assent, to provide an opportunity for the states and the territories to negotiate with experts from the industry and to negotiate a world's best practice set of regulatory standards for wagering and gaming services. We made it clear in those amendments that, if the states and the territories did not come to an agreement within this time period, the federal minister was to enforce the standards agreed to by a majority of the states and/or territories at the end of the three-month period. The minister's power, I might add, to stipulate to the states what is required was limited solely to endorsing the agreement of the majority. I believed at that time, and still do, that the federal government should not be able to dictate to the states and territories how to regulate online gaming and wagering services. This should be a consultative, cooperative process that results in nationally agreed standards and a framework.
It has been mentioned in the debate that we aim at becoming a knowledge economy and a techno-savvy nation. This legislation, a bit like the online services bill, flies in the face of the rhetoric that is perpetuated by the government. With the ubiquity of the Net, we should not be looking at use of the telecommunications power under the Constitution. We should not be using this in a way that seeks to impose federal government agendas on the states and territories. Of all people, this particular minister should share that view. In light of the Darwin developments, and given the progress that has taken place, the need for further interference on a federal level—or further federal government stimulus, if you like, even including the Democrats' moratorium proposal—is questionable. I hope the minister will report in detail on that progress so that it is on the record that there have been these developments involving other countries and the states and territories. I think that has made not only this legislation but also some of the amendments questionable indeed. The original piece of legislation was a significant message to the states and territories and the wider industry, and its effect is seen in the productive and progressive outcomes of that Darwin summit. 
The Democrats maintained in the Netbets inquiry, and continue to believe, that a ban on interactive gambling services is not technologically feasible. We know that the findings of the Productivity Commission and the Senate inquiry did not recommend a ban for that very reason. Yet the government seems stuck on this idea, and the only reason we can ascertain that it is pursuing this legislation is for a cheap win, in the form of superficial news headlines banning gambling. I have no doubt that this is what has motivated this move tonight—that is, it is a stunt. It is a case of a 20th century legislative instrument being applied to a 21st century technological application. It is about an attack on technology—that is how we have to view this. The latest attempt by the government to produce inquiry recommendations to ban interactive gambling—that is, the NOIE inquiry—will not report until a few months into 2001. So we still have a period of uncertainty and indecision not only for the industry but generally.
The government recognises that gambling registers in the community as a concern, and we all know that in the chamber. It also registers as an industry that needs pulling into line; certainly nobody denies that that is the public perception. But the public has not been fooled in the context of this debate. The community recognises that interactive gambling is not where the majority of dangers lie in relation to current gambling operations and that it will not take off out of control due to the technologically specific protections which the Net can provide. It is arguable, of course, but I certainly believe that those protections are much more enforceable and stronger than those associated with land based gambling and other gambling. The government's bill has provided an impetus for the industry and the states and territories to get moving on interactive gambling—which, I should note for the record, already has higher player protections than land based operations. Again, I ask that the government turn its attention to some of the real problem areas of gambling, but I think it would be a very brave day when we see this government take on some of its mates, casino friends and indeed the pokie industry at large. I hope that the high standard of services that are being provided for Australian online gambling acts as an impetus towards the real community concern regarding gambling—that is, land based gambling.
This bill was, the first time around, and is, the second time around, a poorly thought through bill which fails to recognise the manner in which the Internet was established and operates. A ban will only facilitate the proliferation of unregulated or poorly regulated sites offshore. We also recognise that this bill provided a rare opportunity for the Senate to address some of the social issues and impacts of gambling on the Australian and international communities. At the time of the first debate, I, on behalf of my colleagues, and other colleagues registered our concerns through the debate and through the Senate inquiry—concerns relating to things like licensing arrangements for land casinos, alleged licensing `for the boys' in some cases, possible corruption in the industry and the social impact of the possible proliferation of gambling in whatever medium. Specific concern was raised by my colleagues about the lack of transparency of online gambling licence applications and the fact that the accountability and transparency of licence applications and their assessment and approval were not extensively examined in the Senate inquiry. That was referred to; certainly Senator Woodley contributed on that matter. While we have wide-ranging concerns about current online and land based gambling operations, we recognise that a ban is not the answer. The social consequences of gambling are a concern, and these multifactorial issues will not be addressed by a moratorium on interactive gambling.
It has been acknowledged that online gambling is estimated to account for only 0.6 per cent of all Australian gambling activity. So I believe that government and Senate time would be much better focused on the issues surrounding the other 99.4 per cent, as this is where community concern lies. I am particularly disappointed that this bill has been brought on in the last sitting week of the year when we have pressing legislation to attend to—not simply stunts. Again, I register my concern, and possibly that of the rest of the crossbenchers, at the fact that the Gene Technology Bill 2000 is continually being put off for debate. There are pressing matters before the chamber in relation to other legislative and regulatory frameworks; I would note the one relating to gene technology as the most pressing, but the government cannot seem to put that off enough. I think there are better ways in which we could be spending our time. The government should look at the progress that has been made in relation to the Darwin summit and, instead of just attacking technology, it should do something positive.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-12-05,"—I rise to speak tonight on the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 and to raise a point that I have raised previously—that is, I have grave concerns about the level of gambling within Australia. I believe that this bill is not directed to correcting that problem. If the government is sincere in its agenda of controlling problem gambling, the obvious path to pursue would be to challenge and ultimately reduce the prevalence of the one-armed bandits, the poker machines. However, this bill does nothing to redress this glaring problem and goes off on another tangent, blaming the wagering and Internet industries. While I would be only too happy to support a true and genuine solution to the problem of gambling, I feel that this bill, unless amended, falls short of the mark. Wagering is an Australian institution, and nothing that we do will stop Australians from placing a bet. I have no wish or right to interfere with that pastime.
The government has put forward amendments under great pressure to alter the present bill to accommodate the present wagering industries. I make no distinction between making a bet on the Net and placing that same bet on the phone. Any suggestions inferring that there is a difference are purely pedantic. Pauline Hanson's One Nation placed amendments before the Senate the last time this legislation was being heard, and they were voted down by the government and the Labor Party. Now the government is putting forward some of those same amendments in an attempt to have the bill pass through the Senate tonight. I have no problem agreeing with those amendments, as I feel they will go some way to addressing some of the foolishness and futility of this piece of misguided, moralist legislation.
The major problem I have with the bill is the way it is set out and the covert way in which it undermines legal businesses which have, up until this piece of legislation, complied with all the prerequisites of the laws of their states and this country in setting up perfectly legitimate businesses. These enterprises have invested millions of dollars in their ventures, only to be told, after receiving their licences, that they will be suspended from operating their perfectly legal operations and that legitimate businesses will have to stop. This suspension and the possible subsequent banning of these operations will lead not only to the loss of millions of dollars in investment but also to the loss of hundreds of direct and indirect jobs.
This will impact most severely upon Tasmania—more than on any other state in Australia. I look forward to the support of the Tasmanian senators in supporting their state and their constituents. My current information shows that at present there are approximately six businesses—and they are substantially Tasmanian—which, under the provisions of the bill, have paid $30,000 application fees, have signed contracts for leasing their premises and have invested in multimillion dollar contracts to suppliers. I have not yet even mentioned the $300,000 yearly licence paid to the Tasmanian government. If you multiply $300,000 by six, that equals $1.8 million that will be forfeited by the Tasmanian state government on an annual basis if these operations have to cease. This raises the subsequent consequence of legal action being justifiably brought by these businesses against the Commonwealth government for what is essentially a breach of contract. These businesses have not done anything wrong, underhand or untoward. They have simply followed the rules, and now the government have shifted the goalposts. 
Overall, this industry would generate approximately $350 million in IT industries, to the benefit of technology as a whole. Australia has the best monitoring and rules of operation guidelines in the world. It has a report card second to none. The rest of the world is following Australia's lead. Yet, unless this bill is amended, here we are so arrogantly throwing away the investments, the jobs and the export dollars. If this bill progresses in its present form, I will not be held responsible. The bill defies logic, it defies any sense of justice and, to a degree, it demonstrates a gross ignorance or misunderstanding of the industry and the technology. One Nation feels that it will be incumbent upon the government—should the gaming provisions of this bill proceed without any recognition of the costs that are being imposed on the six businesses that I have spoken of previously, which have complied with all the licensing requirements and paid all the licensing fees, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of dollars that have been paid for research, leases, infrastructure and the loss of pending jobs—to refund to these businesses the licence fees they have paid and that compensation should be put in place prior to the end of the moratorium.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-12-05,"—I begin my contribution to this debate by seeking leave to incorporate a letter from Senator Alston to me. I have circulated this to the Labor Party whip and Independents. 
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
4 December 2000
Senator John Woodley
SG.55
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Senator Woodley
Thank you for your note of 4 December regarding the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000 (`the bill'). As you know, the Government is currently considering recommitting the bill in the Senate sometime this week.
Based on your discussions with my Office, I am writing to confirm that:
1. The Government is predisposed to a ban on Internet gambling. However, if at the conclusion of the moratorium period, a ban is found not to be feasible, and subsequently is not imposed, the Government will, at the very least, urge the States and Territories to enact a uniform, national set of regulatory standards, formulated in consultation with the Commonwealth.
2. The Government is considering introducing amendments to exclude from the scope of the moratorium wagering services equivalent to those offered offline on 19 May 2000 and in traditional wagering formats. However, these amendments will not permit the introduction of more interactive, ball-by-ball style micro-wagering, given its potential to impact significantly on the incidence of problem gambling. Despite the proposed exclusion of wagering from the scope of the moratorium, the Government remains committed to investigating the feasibility and consequences of banning new forms of interactive gambling, including new forms of interactive wagering.
3. The Government is prepared to provide in principle support for two initiatives that were discussed at a recent COAG meeting. Those initiatives relate to:
·	A national research program into problem gambling, jointly funded by the Commonwealth and States and Territories; and
·	A national advertising campaign about the potential dangers of gambling, jointly funded by the Commonwealth and States and Territories.
Although funding for these proposals would need to be considered as part of the Budget process, the Commonwealth would be sympathetic to providing funding for both of these initiatives.
As you know, the aim of the Government's 12-month moratorium is to halt the development of the interactive gambling industry in Australia while the Government investigates the feasibility and consequences of banning interactive gambling. Although predisposed to banning new forms of interactive gambling, the Government will make a final decision on a permanent ban after considering the findings of the NOIE report.
In addition, the Commonwealth will continue to work with the States and Territories through the Ministerial Council on Gambling, to ensure a concerted national effort on problem gambling. In addition to the initiatives outlined above, these efforts would focus on ensuring a coordinated national approach to a range of preventative and ameliorative actions, including those already being undertaken in all States and Territories, to address problem gambling. 
Yours sincerely
RICHARD ALSTON
Minister for Communications,
Information Technology and the Arts
—I thank the minister for the letter because I believe it places on the record the government's commitment to a ban on Internet gambling, if that is feasible—and, of course, that would also be my first option—or, if that is not feasible, the possibility of national standards being established and a commitment to a number of harm minimisation activities. Because of that, I believe the letter is very germane to this debate. I will range fairly widely over the issue, as other speakers have done, and, in that way, I hope to speak once only, as well as speaking to the amendment which has been moved by the government.
One of the issues which has been raised by other speakers is that this legislation is very poor. What puzzles me is that if the legislation is so poor, why is the gambling industry so frantic? If the legislation is ineffective, why on earth would the gambling industry be so concerned about making sure that it is defeated? The two things do not figure. I certainly say to Senator Lundy, who I listened to very carefully, that it is almost a case of: why do you protest? Do you protest too much? If this legislation were as ineffective as some speakers have said, then you could simply vote for it and allow its ineffectiveness to take effect.
—It is actually damaging.
—My problem, Senator Lundy, is that I do not care if the gambling industry is damaged. I have no commitment to the gambling industry whatsoever because I have spent all of my life involved with the victims of the gambling industry—probably more so than anyone else in this chamber. Because of that, I have no commitment to the gambling industry whatsoever.
—It doesn't help them.
—In fact, the problem is that calling it an industry is itself is a misnomer. I would not call it an industry because that gives it too much credibility; it is a gambling octopus which continues to expand—and that is the problem.
On the other issue which Senator Lundy raised, which was, `Why would you simply tackle this particular aspect of the gambling industry?' there is a very obvious answer: because this is a further extension of the gambling industry, which has continued to expand over the whole of this last century and goes back almost as far in history as one can imagine. I have had a lifetime opposition to gambling, I make no secret of that. It is because of the victims of gambling that I have dealt with over at least 40 years. 
The main issue that we are dealing with at the moment is the amendment of the government on wagering. I have to admit that I am not very attracted to this amendment because it does extend gambling to another one of the particular facilities for gambling. I am not attracted to it at all, but I am also able to work out what the numbers are and know that I do not want the bill to be defeated by lack of support for this amendment, so I will support it.
—Surprise, surprise! Where's your principle now?
—I want to put on the record now a number of statements which I think spell out very clearly the position that I want to take. I will read from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 9 November by Royce Millar and Tim Costello, which says:
The States' handling of gambling explains a great deal about the size of the industry. Unlike countries such as Britain and Ireland, Australian States have total responsibility for gambling regulation. Even in the US, where the States also regulate gambling, the Federal Government has played an important role with a long-standing ban on gambling advertising. Unlike our own Federal Parliament, Washington looks set to proceed with its ban on online gambling.
They go on:
What is clear is that the countries with national gambling policies and regulation, such as Ireland and Britain, have been best equipped to withstand the temptation to turn to gambling as an economic panacea. It is interesting to note that in Ireland—the spiritual home of the great Aussie gambler—there are no casinos and only a handful of antique poker machines. Despite warnings that it would be shunned by the world for its lack of ""world class"" gaming facilities, Ireland is now the economic miracle of Europe. 
—They sure as hell haven't tried to ban the Internet.
—I want also to place on record a statement by the National Council of Churches, which represents all of the major churches in Australia, including the Anglican Church, the Roman Catholic Church and so on. This is what they say:
The following well attested facts demonstrate the nature of the Council's concerns about gambling.
. The last two decades have witnessed an expansion of gambling facilities in all the States of Australia. This expansion has been in the availability of gambling at local, centralised and electronic venues. The local expansions have been mostly in places of entertainment such as hotels and licensed clubs. The centralised locations are in the form of casinos, while the electronic venues occur through the Internet.
. Significant commercial interests have entered the gambling industry and increased its economic and political power.
. The licensing of gambling venues has increased the income of State governments to such an extent that they now rely on it for a significant proportion of their budgets.
. The availability and promotion of gambling has diverted resources from other uses, particularly from families.
. Persons susceptible to problem gambling (2.1% of Australians and 15% of regular gamblers) have increased availability and encouragement.
. Controls on the involvement of criminals in the gambling industry remain inadequate.
Finally it says in the recommendations:
... the Executive of the National Council of Churches in Australia makes the following statement.
. The Executive supports the moves of the Commonwealth Government to seek a greater regulation of Internet gambling. It endorses the proposed moratorium on new licences. It rejects the claims by some State governments that, since people will gamble, the income should stay at home.
. The Executive supports moves that will decrease the accessibility of gambling. These moves include, but are not limited to:
. the reduction in the number of gambling venues and gambling machines;
. increased information about the risks of problem gambling;
. the removal of ATMs and credit facilities from gambling venues;
. increased publicity at gambling venues about the winning odds of specific methods of gaming, particularly gaming machines;
. increased provisions for community control.
It goes on to say:
. The Executive supports those policy and practice changes that would reduce criminal involvement in the gambling industry.
. The Executive urges governments to consider seriously the extent to which their dependence on revenue from gambling inhibits their capacity to act responsibly in its control.
Let me finally say that I commend the government for its initiative. This is, as far as I can find out, the only time any government in this country has acted to actually limit gambling facilities rather than to extend them. That is the objective which I would support wholeheartedly.
—What is your problem, Senator Lundy? I know you have been raving on there.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Why don't you address your comments through the chair, Senator Woodley. Senator Lundy should stop yelling.
—The problem was that Senator Lundy was speaking most of the time that I was speaking, but I really was not able to take account of her interjections so I was doing that at the end.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-12-05,"—It is my turn in the firing line, but I am sticking to my guns: I said that I would support the legislation if the amendments which we have before us from the government were made, and so I will. The problem with the earlier version that the government had was that it excluded Tasmanian, Western Australian and Victorian TAB facilities from the opportunities available during moratorium for betting on horses and sporting events that were available to New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, the North-ern Territory and the ACT. That discrimination is overcome by the amendments. I take heed of what Senator Stott Despoja said when she said, `Well, this is only 0.6 per cent of the gambling problem in this country.' I cast my mind back to the time—I have forgotten the exact date, but I think it was 21 September 1964—when 0.6 per cent of the gambling revenue in the country was coming out of poker machines. I dearly wish that we had legislated then to do something about it. 
—To do what? Ban them?
—Well, I would have supported a ban on poker machines, Senator. Would you? 
—Senator Brown, if you want to debate the issue with Senator Stott Despoja, could I recommend that you do so outside the chamber.
—What she said, Chair, is that she would have supported it. 
—Be consistent.
—Why don't you address your comments through the chair, Senator Brown, and ignore the interjections of Senator Sherry.
—I normally would not need any protection from Senator Sherry, but if you can provide that, Chair, I would be very happy. He is having a flamboyant evening. Gambling is a huge problem in this country and we have to, as legislators, look to put a curb on it. Now what we are not doing here is banning it. 
—Well, ban it.
—Well, Senator Sherry, despite your—
—You should cease your interjecting, Senator Sherry.
—Despite your protection, Chair, Senator Sherry has been saying that we should ban it. I would not jump to support him in that straightaway, but I would say that that is an option coming down the line. The other option, of course, is to do what Senator Lundy and Senator Stott Despoja have been supporting—and our senator from the Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, Senator Harris—and that is to bring in a very strong regulatory suite which is going to have that effect. I think this whole debate has absolutely promoted that option and put it in the fast lane. The Darwin outcome is part of that evolving regulatory system. I can tell the chamber that I will be looking at which of those two options is the better over the coming months. We have here, though, a moratorium in place while that decision is made. I might say to Senator Stott Despoja that, if this is an attack on technology, it is the exact same attack that was going to come through your three-month moratorium that was an alternative—
—Non-retro-spective. Not the same use of the constitutional telecommunications power.
—It doesn't matter what the time or what the constitutional validity is, it is, nevertheless, an attack on technology. Look, I do not accept that. It is very easy to say that anything that regulates the Internet is an attack on technology. Are we to say that we will put no protection in there from people who might use the Internet to defraud people through abuse of their credit cards? Is it an attack on technology to try to do something about that? To try and stop online shoppers from being robbed: is that an attack on technology? Of course it isn't. The fact is that the Internet has become part of our modern way of life. It is going to become even more a part of it. It is part of even the way we think, these days. But like every other aspect of life, it will—and should— attract the attention of regulators when it has the potential for harm. It has got a huge potential for good but it also has the potential for harm. 
Gambling is one of the opportunities for those who would want to very rapidly accrue wealth to themselves at the expense of other people in the community. I am not in favour of banning gambling per se, but I am in favour of regulating it. I am not sure that making it available in the lounge room of every home in Australia, regardless of whether there is supervision or not, is a good thing. You see, one of the problems here is that it is just not like other gambling. It makes gambling much more accessible, much more instantly available. It also makes it available covertly. I walk past the Queanbeyan Leagues Club late of an evening quite frequently on my way home and I would frankly feel quite embarrassed about going in there. I would think about who I was going to run into if I was to take $5 in to have a smack on the pokies. People who might feel a little bit embarrassed can go home and do it, no problems. No-one is going to be watching you; you can get away with it. It is a new attraction for people who might be inhibited by social circumstances not to gamble through the currently available avenues for gambling. I will be supporting the amendments and, if they pass, I will be supporting the legislation.  
Let me finally say this. There has been some support for this move from the retail sector of the community. I want to make it very clear that gambling itself does not just siphon money out of the community—it siphons jobs and it siphons wellbeing. It takes other people's jobs away. It is not just the gambler that is involved here, and it is not just the problem gambler. It is taking money out of other areas of the economy upon which people depend for their livelihoods and which give other people sustenance. We have to take that into account. I cannot see how interactive gambling online—gambling at the click of  a mouse—is going to be any different to poker machine gambling in gaming houses when it comes to that fact. We have to weigh that up.
It will be an interesting six months while we await action from the Commonwealth. The action, when it comes, will be in the run-up to the next election. It will test us all in this place to keep our minds open to the best resolution to the question of whether we put a ban on Internet gambling—whether we have limited restrictions on it or whether we have a regulatory regime implemented nationally which will assuage the people's fears that gambling on the Internet could be a very deleterious component of the future of our society.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-12-05,"—I am not going to belabour the point. I was privileged, if I can use that term, to serve on the committee which reported to the parliament in its Netbets report last year. Or was it this year? Time flies. Yes, it was in March this year.
—The chamber is not receiving second reading contributions. It will be out of order; there is no doubt about it. I hope you will declare me to be out of order, Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot, because we had an early morning this morning and it is now five minutes to 10.
—Very difficult, Senator Harradine, but I probably could.
—On the running sheet, we are now dealing with clause 5, government amendments (1) and (2). Before I say anything further, I think I should declare an interest. I do have a TAB account and have had for some years—not that it has done me much good. I will be supporting the amendments that have been put forward by the government in respect of gaming. When this legislation was previously before us, I had an amendment of similar intent. I thought I would just mention that to the committee.
Whilst I am on my feet, I should mention that, in respect of those institutions, licence holders for whom licences had already been issued prior to the operative date should also be exempted, and this would cover Federals in Tasmania and various other organisations. I have had a look at Senator Harris's amendments in respect of that matter. It is my opinion that they do that job better than my amendments. When the time comes, if you do not mind, I would prefer you to call Senator Harris rather than me.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-12-05,"—I would like to speak on the government amendments to the Interactive Gambling (Moratorium) Bill 2000, which has been reintroduced today. I do so on behalf of the Democrats and as the Democrats' spokesperson on social security and welfare issues. There is no doubt that everyone in the chamber, whatever their position on this bill, would recognise that problem gambling, almost by definition, is a problem. It is a significant problem not just for the people and the families of those who do get caught up in uncontrolled gambling but also for the community as a whole in terms of the economy and the extra broader social damage that occurs. I am sure all of us are genuine in our attempts to redress that issue.  
The big concern I have about this bill and the government amendments is that they do not redress that issue. They attack one area which, whilst always able to do more, goes further than any other in the gambling regime in trying to redress those problems and to minimise the damage. Possibly some people in the chamber would like to ban all gambling or to severely restrict all forms of gambling. That is not a position I hold personally, and it is not a position that the Democrats hold, but I recognise that some people have a genuine belief in that regard and I respect that belief. The rest of us are trying to redress and acknowledge the causes of problem gambling and to regulate and make changes in a way that will minimise—ideally prevent—that damage. That is what we should be focusing on in any debate on the impact of gambling.
In my background—which is not just in the political arena of this chamber and other aspects of parliamentary research for more than 10 years but also in the welfare area—I frequently saw the consequences for people who got caught up in uncontrolled gambling, or problem gambling or whatever label you wish to put on it. There are many people throughout the community who we all should acknowledge do an enormous job in trying to address the consequences of that activity, but we need to look at not just the consequences but also the causes. Lashing out in a knee-jerk type of way and saying, `Look at the consequences for someone who was not able to gamble responsibly. We should therefore stop this particular aspect of gambling to make us feel like we are doing something about it,' is at best a hit-and-miss approach to addressing the concerns that we all have. 
As well as talking with many people who work with the victims of gambling, I have also talked with—and continue to talk with—many people who deal with the causes of problem gambling. Without fail, all of those people say that Net gambling is not the area we need to focus on at the moment. They also say that this approach not only is farcical but is counterproductive. I can cope with the farcical political stunt that does not make an impact either way, but my real concern is that this is counterproductive. Whilst there may always be room for improvement, work is being done to try to minimise, to restrict, to control and to prevent the damage from problem gambling on the Internet. I accept that it is quite likely this area of gambling will expand. The big issue with this bill, as has been said many times and which these amendments do not address, is that it not only will not prevent that but also will take out the one area which does more than any other to try to minimise that harm. Those people who still want to gamble through the Net will be able to. They will continue to do so if that is what they need to do. If they have a problem, they will particularly continue to do so. If they are driven—if they have an addictive personality that needs to gamble and are particularly driven to the accessibility of the Internet—they will continue to do so. 
This bill will not change that one way or the other. What it will do is to kick the knees out from under the one area of Net gambling that has led the world in trying to minimise or prevent that damage. It will cut that away and will leave it open for all those people—it is still a small number, but I accept it could be a larger number—to continue gambling in that way without those protections. They will be subject to all those areas of potential exploitation that Senator Brown quite rightly expressed concern about. Not only is this bill a knee-jerk stunt—and this amendment is an attempt to cover up that knee-jerk stunt—but it is a step backwards. 
I appreciate and acknowledge the initial attempts of the Democrats when this bill was first debated to get genuine funding commitments from the government at state and federal level to address the harm minimisation. I thank the minister for the commitment he has given. I hope that, unlike other commitments this government have given, as we outlined in this chamber just last night, they will give it in writing—and that it is not just a letter to individual senators but a commitment to the Senate and the people of Australia as a whole. But we saw just last night that a commitment to the chamber as a whole and the people of Australia as a whole is still something we cannot rely on from this government. But I hope they will deliver on extra funding for harm minimisation. That would be good, but we cannot forget the fact that this bill in operation would cut away from an area where there is a deliberate conscious attempt—partly in relation to the pressure the Senate exerted last time we dealt with this bill—to limit the damage that problem gamblers face. 
Senator Brown is not in favour of banning and neither am I—some people may be and I respect that—but he is in favour of regulating and so am I. This bill does not regulate; it removes regulation, and people who wish to gamble on the Net will be subject to using sites that have less regulation. Senator Brown—I am not picking on you, but you argued in a logical way—addressed the danger of Net gambling being more accessible. The Net is in the home. It is more accessible than walking down the road to the pub—that is true. That is why we need stronger controls. That is why the Internet gaming industry in Australia has worked, partly in response to pressure from this chamber, to put in place those controls. 
But what is even more accessible is putting a bet on the phone. It is much easier to pick up your phone and use your phone account to place a bet. It is a much bigger hassle—it is not that big a hassle but it is a bigger hassle—to log on through your modem, do your load in, hope the thing does not crash, log on to the Net, go to the site and put in your codes, and then you have your bet account limit as well. Phone betting is much easier and much more accessible. We are not touching phone betting. Not only are we not touching phone betting through these amendments, which I am addressing; we are also—
—We are extending it.
—This amendment extends the evil that the government is saying it is trying to restrict. That is how farcical it is. If we are looking at trying to prevent the small minority of people from having easy access to spending their money when they lose control, when they get stuck in that cycle, we have a duty to try to protect them. We have a duty to try to recognise what leads them into that difficulty. We have a duty to try to ensure that they have an opportunity not to end up there, not just for their sake and for their family's sake but for society's sake as a whole. But the most accessible form of betting is picking up the phone. You are at home. You can pick up the phone. You can watch television, particularly if you have pay TV. There are horse races all over the place. That is part of what pay TV relies upon— people who gamble through that. The majority of people gamble on horses. I gamble on other things occasionally, not particularly often. Personally, I cannot understand the interest people find in horse racing, even leaving aside the issue of exploitation of animals—but that is people's choice. Why, as these amendments seek to do, is it somehow or other okay to gamble on horse races, harness racing, greyhound racing or sporting events through the Net, as we have always been able to do over the phone? It defies logic. I understand that the government wants to get the bill through, and it will do what it can to get the bill through. I understand that. But in terms of those who are looking at supporting this amendment, the logic quite honestly defies me. 
Turning to the specifics of the amendments, I am sure the minister would be relieved to hear that I would like to ask him a question to clarify the content of the amendments, partly for the benefit of those who may well have to deal with this legislation if it goes through, as it looks like it may. The amendments talk about sporting events covered in amendment (1), paragraph (3)(aa). Amendment (2) clause (3A) says that paragraph (3)(aa) does not apply to a service to the extent to which:
(a) the service relates to betting on the outcome of a sporting event, where the bets are placed, made, received or accepted after the beginning of the event;  
If someone is wanting to put a bet on who will be the highest scorer in the second innings for Australia in the next cricket test and the event has started but obviously the second innings has not started, does the event mean the test match or does the event mean the second innings? If you are talking about who is going to bowl the next over and you want to place a bet on who is going to bowl the next over, is the event the over, is the event the cricket match or is the event the start of the innings? I have read through the explanatory memorandum as well and it is not clear to me. I am quite genuinely, even though I oppose the amendments and oppose the bill, trying to understand where this line is being drawn. For those people out there who are existing service providers in this area or indeed future service providers who want to have Net betting in relation to sporting events, I think it would be helpful for the minister to clarify exactly where that line is, what the definition of when the event begins is and what the event is. I note that that paragraph does not apply to services for the conduct of lotteries, lottery tickets et cetera. Are there clear definitions of what exactly is a lottery and a lottery ticket? I would appreciate it if the minister could answer those questions.
In conclusion, coming back to my initial point about the major areas—and many people have made the point in the debate tonight, as all of us are concerned about minimising harm in terms of gambling—all of us know that the big problem in Australia at the moment is poker machines. As others have said today, the big winners out of this bill going through will be the pokie industry. The big winners will be the area that everybody acknowledges is the worst in terms of the impact on the community. I will mention briefly an article in the Canberra Sunday Times. I commend the local health minister in the ACT, Michael Moore, who pointed out that just in the ACT alone the Canberra Tradesman's Union Club donated $590,000 to political, union and lobby groups last year. This was part of an attack on the ALP and how much it takes—my being cross-party in relation to this. The Canberra Labor Club donated $248,000—almost a quarter of a million dollars—in one year. Look at the financial power of those clubs, and that is just clubs. 
Senator Brown mentioned retailers—exactly. They are not concerned about the social damage of gambling; they are concerned about losing their cut of the take. That is what they are concerned about. The pokie industry are a bit more sensible. They have not been right out front on this; they have been doing all the lobbying behind the scenes, but they know they stink enough that they would not dare to stick their heads up in public. The clubs are a bit less so and the retail industry has gone a bit further out front. But the impact is the same. That is not a concern about social impact; that is a concern about them losing market share. I have even had lobbying from newsagents saying, `This is not fair. People will not come here and buy lottery tickets.' I can understand that, but they are not people who are concerned about the social impact of gambling. I would like to specially commend those who are. I do not wish to besmirch all clubs—some of them are being responsible. I do not mean to besmirch all newsagents. My local newsagent in Wilston in Brisbane specifically has a sign up saying, `We will not take credit cards or EFTPOS for people buying scratch-it tickets.' I think that is a really laudable activity. They recognise, through their activities in taking money from people, those people who are just having harmless fun. They identify people who act responsibly and those who do not and recognise that they have a responsibility. I think that is the sort of area we need to focus on. Having said all that, I hope the minister did hear my questions about the amendments, and I would quite genuinely be interested in any response or clarification he can make.",SENATE,<title>INTERACTIVE GAMBLING (MORATORIUM) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-12-05,"—Looking at the amendments we are considering in committee, if you look at the possible configurations of the voting outcome and the calculations that the government and we as a Labor opposition have to make in respect of supporting particular amendments, I cannot help but be reminded of a game of Russian roulette of whether the bill will pass or fail—more so for this legislation than on most pieces of legislation that we see in this chamber.  
For those in the chamber who are not aware, I worked at Wrest Point Casino for 3½ years. In that time there was one thing I did learn from a personal perspective: do not gamble. Senator Woodley does not have a monopoly on the moral, the ethical, the economic, the social considerations and outcomes and tragedies that result from gambling. I used to see it every night and every day—people who were losing money who could not afford to do so. Gambling is a zero sum game—so is drinking, so is smoking and so are a number of other social activities in our community. The difficult judgment we have to make as legislators is: can we effectively outlaw these activities? If we do attempt to outlaw, will it be done effectively and comprehensively? Then, are those outcomes of outlawing or prohibition for the better or worse? One country attempted to prohibit alcohol for an extensive period of time—the United States. I think most people who have looked at that experiment would come to the conclusion that the outcome was much worse than allowing alcohol to be consumed in a controlled, regulated manner. 
We had a referendum in Tasmania on whether casinos should be legalised. I still have a copy of the referendum questions and the debate and the predictions that were made if casinos—in this case one casino—were to be legalised in Tasmania. Some of the claims that were made—
—It was the end of the world. 
—It was going to be the end of the world, Senator Calvert. You can recall the arguments for and against: we were going to have the Mafia move into Tasmania; Sandy Bay, which is the suburb in which the casino was built, was going to be a Las Vegas with row after row of houses of ill repute; and the retail industry was going to be devastated. Nevertheless, the majority of Tasmanians voted to proceed with a legal casino. If people looked back objectively, I think they would come to the conclusion that that development and the successive developments that have occurred have been to the benefit of Tasmania overall.
You only have to read the Productivity Commission report on gambling in this country to be deeply disturbed by the dreadful impact of gambling on many individuals and families in this country. But if we were to outlaw gambling, to prohibit gambling, would it result in a better community overall? I would suggest it would not. If you prohibited smoking or alcohol, I would suggest it would be the same: it would not result in a better social outcome. As legislators, these are the difficult dilemmas we sometimes have to face. What we are presented with tonight is not a prohibition on gambling; it is an attempt to prohibit interactive gambling. It is an attempt. It will not be successful because, if the legislation is passed, people will simply move offshore through the Internet and carry out their gambling there. That will be the practical outcome of the legislation if it is passed. We know that is what will happen. Those people in moving offshore will move into an area where there is very little regulation—certainly far less regulation than has been implemented, or proposed, by the various jurisdictions within Australia. That will be the effect of it. That seems to me to be a very impractical outcome.
What is of interest is that the government states that it wants to ban interactive gambling, but that is not what we are presented with. What we are presented with is an attempt—we know an impractical attempt—to prohibit interactive gambling, but there are exemptions to this proposed prohibition. Excluded from what will be an ineffective prohibition are services relating to contracts that, under the Corporations Law, are exempt from a law relating to gaming or wagering and services that the minister determines are exempt services. But, since we last debated this, we have gone a further step. Apparently the government has done a deal with Senator Brown. It is okay for Senator Brown to support a piece of ineffective legislation purporting to ban interactive gambling as long as the Tasmanian TAB is saved. So we add another exemption in order to pass a piece of legislation that is going to be ineffective anyway and is going to drive offshore those people who want to use this particular service. I can understand Senator Brown having a Tasmanian perspective, but where is his concern for Federal Hotels—a company which, on balance, has made a significant positive contribution to the Tasmanian economy? Where is his concern for Federal Hotels who have invested $15 million? They are a major Tasmanian company, but that will be money down the drain and it will have a serious impact on the bottom line of that company. That is just one example.  
This legislation we are presented with is monumental hypocrisy. It is monumentally impractical. If we are fair dinkum and want to deal with the social problems of gambling, as I am sure we all do, the way to go is to regulate gambling and provide positive programs for those people who are harmed by it, not try to prohibit it in an impractical way.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-12-05,"—I will just address a few issues before I come to answering Senator Bartlett's question. There does seem to be quite a serious failure to comprehend the nature of this legislation. I noticed that Senator Lundy said that this bill does not address problem gambling. Indeed, Senator Lundy seems to be blissfully unaware of the fact that COAG has addressed these issues in recent times and that the Ministerial Council on Gambling has devoted quite a deal of time and energy to addressing these very concerns. So let us be clear: this bill is not about tackling the problems that derive from poker machines or casino activities; it is about nipping in the bud an industry—that is still very much in its infancy—for a period of time in which we will be able to make some longer term judgments. In other words, we will be able to look at the report of the National Office of the Information Economy on the technical feasibility and consequences of a permanent ban and we will also be able to look at the social consequences. Those are all issues that should be examined at this stage. 
It is also a bit disappointing, but not surprising, that people like Senator Stott Despoja want to dismiss this sort of activity as a stunt—which, I presume, not even all the members of her own party would agree with, let alone those of goodwill and good intent who have a different view. So I do not quite know why she feels that she has the high moral ground on this issue. She seems to think that somehow the states are moving rapidly. She asked me if I would acknowledge what progress the states have made. I think even Senator Stott Despoja found it necessary to say that the act has provided some impetus for the states and territories. Quite clearly, they did nothing from 1997 until quite recently. I was asked what emerged from the Darwin summit. My understanding is that what really emerged was an agreement to draft a national code, which is hardly, I would have thought, the sort of thing that Senator Stott Despoja professes to aspire to in terms of a uniform solution involving harm minimisation. So if you ask me what the states and territories have managed to do in the last six months or so, the answer is basically that they have licensed quite a number of new players. But, beyond that, they have not really taken any significant action.
—It is all very well for you to accuse other people of stunts, but when you ask me to acknowledge what the states have done and I tell you, you take exception. I will not go any further. Senator Bartlett asked me about the intent of the amendments in relation to what in common parlance these days is called `spread betting'—in other words, where you bet on a ball by ball event or whether Shane Warne's next ball will be a googly or a flipper. Those are contingencies that occur after the commencement of the event, which in cricket is the first ball bowled once the match starts. On page 4 of the supplementary explanatory memorandum the distinction between `an event' and `a series of events' is explained by way of an example: 
... in the case of the game of cricket, the `event' would be characterised as a single cricket match. However, the test series would be characterised as `a series of events'.
In other words, even though the first test had started, you could bet on the outcome of the second test; but you could not then bet on other contingencies that might occur during what is normally a five-day game but these days seems to be a 2½- to three-day game. What we are concerned about here is allowing sporting activities to be exempted in terms of interactive wagering, but not those new services which have not really got off the ground and any events which are generally described as spread betting. Senator Lundy also does not seem to be able to distinguish between casino-type betting and sports wagering. I simply— 
—The whole thrust of this assertion that somehow this is just a hopeless compromise to get the bill through under any circumstances ignores the fact that there is in many people's minds a qualitative distinction between sports betting and casino-type activity. If you do not know the difference or you do not think there is a difference, I am not going to spend much time trying to paint the distinction. But I would have thought—
—Why didn't you support Senator Harradine's amendments last time round? Think about it.
—A lot of people would say that betting on sporting events is a fairly Australian characteristic; but, if you are talking about a casino-type activity, that is a particularly mindless form of exercise that does not involve any skill or judgment but in most instances enables you to lose a lot more money, more quickly—
—I am just explaining the distinction to you. I am not asking you to have a side bet on who is going to vote for what. I am simply saying to you that you should not pretend that somehow there is no qualitative distinction. I would like to acknowledge the constructive role played by Senators Woodley and Allison. The following excerpt of the letter I wrote to Senator Woodley has already been incorporated into the Hansard:
Based on your discussions with my Office, I am writing to confirm that:
1.	The Government is predisposed to a ban on Internet gambling. However, if at the conclusion of the moratorium period, a ban is found not to be feasible, and subsequently is not imposed, the Government will, at the very least, urge the States and Territories to enact a uniform, national set of regulatory standards, formulated in consultation with the Commonwealth 
2.	... Despite the proposed exclusion of wagering from the scope of the moratorium, the Government remains committed to investigating the feasibility and consequences of banning new forms of interactive gambling, including new forms of interactive wagering.
3.	The Government is prepared to provide in principle support for two initiatives that were discussed at a recent COAG meeting. Those initiatives relate to:
·	A national research program into problem gambling, jointly funded by the Commonwealth and States and Territories; and
·	A national advertising campaign about the potential dangers of gambling, jointly funded by the Commonwealth and States and Territories.
Although funding for these proposals would need to be considered as part of the Budget process, the Commonwealth would be sympathetic to providing funding for both of these initiatives.
I acknowledge that both Senators Woodley and Allison clearly share the government's concerns in relation to the potential quantum increase in accessibility of new interactive gambling services and the associated potential increase in problem gambling. I am very conscious of the fact that very strong representations have been made by the Chief Min-is-ter to the government in very recent times, particularly to the Prime Minister. I am also aware that Senator Tambling has come under a great deal of pressure and, as a result, has certainly expressed to me and to other colleagues some of the issues that he bel-ieves need to be closely examined. The gov-ernment has done that, and I think the way in which the amendments have been put forward should ensure that the right balance is struck. So I commend both amendments to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2000-12-05,"—Earlier this week I was pleased to learn that the federal government would pay 19 former employees of the Victoria Knitting Mills in the Sydney suburb of Alexandria, which is part of my duty electorate of Sydney, at least some of the entitlements owed to them by their former employer who became insolvent. The issue of employee entitlement is one in which I have a particular interest. I have taken a close interest in the plight of workers whose employer goes broke, owing wages and other entitlements, as part of working at the bar in recent years as an insolvency practitioner. It is a matter in which I have both some experience and a particular interest. These 19 workers at Victoria Knitting Mills received more than $70,000 under the federal government's Employee Entitlements Support Scheme—
—It is a good program, Senator Abetz—a program which provides assistance to employees who have lost their job since 1 January 2000 as a result of their employer's insolvency and who lost some or all of their employee entitlements. It is an example of the federal government leading the way and making a real difference to the lives of ordinary Australian workers who, through no fault of their own, have been affected by the financial failure of their employer.
The government is delivering on the complex issue of employees losing their entitlements following business insolvency and it continues to provide real help to people who need it and who have little to offer but their labour. The liquidator for Victoria Knitting Mills, Mr Geoffrey Reidy, from the firm Rodgers Reidy in Sydney, is distributing the money among the employees. Let me give you a picture of the people who will benefit from this payout. An average payment for each of the 19 claimants is around $3,727, with the highest payout being $8,628. One of these employees worked for the company for 23 years, and eight employees gave more than 15 years service.
By mid-November this year the federal government had paid more than 1,000 workers who were otherwise left without their entitlements when their employer failed. In total, the scheme has now paid out more than $1.8 million. Typically, the federal government scheme has delivered to employees up to 50 per cent of the entitlements owed by their insolvent employer. But workers would have received double what they had been paid under the scheme, sometimes up to 100 per cent of their entitlements, if the states had contributed their fair share to assist workers in need. The contrast is stark. In this case, the Commonwealth is paying these 19 former Victoria Knitting Mills employees an average of almost 40 per cent of their entitlements owing at termination. If the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr, cared enough about these workers to pay the New South Wales government share, they would be paid on average about 80 per cent of their entitlements owing at termination.  
For 13 years, federal Labor turned its back on these workers. Now it encourages its state counterparts to follow suit, it would appear. During the federal Labor government's 13 years in office, it failed to provide meaningful protection for workers whose entitlements were not paid on insolvency. No more evidence of this failure is required than the plight of the workers who have, since Labor left government, discovered that there were no federal laws or schemes in existence to protect their unpaid entitlements on the insolvency of their employer's business.
Labor's record of inaction is pitiful. No Labor Prime Minister, no Labor cabinet and no Labor industrial relations minister—Mr Willis, Mr Morris, Senator Cook or Mr Brereton—ever succeeded in establishing a national scheme to protect worker entitlements on insolvency. It does not appear that any Labor Prime Minister, Labor cabinet or Labor industrial relations minister paid out one cent of Commonwealth money to fund unpaid entitlements to employees where debts were owed to them by their private sector employer. Labor did not seek the agreement of the states on a proposal for the establishment of a national scheme to protect worker entitlements, despite the existence of a joint federal-state Labor ministers council. 
Labor did not even commit to a national scheme to protect worker entitlements in its self-proclaimed accords with the ACTU. During the life of the Labor government there were eight separately negotiated accords with the ACTU. The accord record on employee entitlements speaks for itself: Accord Mark I in 1983—no mention of worker entitlements on insolvency; it was the same for Accord Mark II in 1985 and Accord Mark III in 1987. In Accord Mark IV in 1988 again there was no mention of it. In 1989 there was no mention of it in Accord Mark V. In 1990 there was no mention of it in Accord Mark VI. 
In Accord Mark VII in 1993 we got the first mention—after 10 years of government and four days before the 1993 election—of worker entitlements on insolvency. But there was still no commitment to providing a national scheme or a safety net; there was only a modest change to priorities to allow employees to receive payment before the Commissioner of Taxation but, of course, after secured creditors. It was not nearly a solution to the problem. Accord Mark VIII was not much better; it recorded a second mention of worker entitlements on insolvency after eight accords over 13 years. Labor's only commitment to the trade union movement on this was that the government would `examine and, if practicable and desirable, move to improve the protection of employees' entitlements in the event of insolvency of the employer'. In other words, after 13 years of government Labor was not even convinced that it was desirable to do anything about the problem, let alone propose a solution.
Over the period of this inaction, thousands of workers and their families were owed millions of dollars. They went without their entitlements without the Labor government taking action to provide a safety net. The ACTU's own figures estimate that 17,000 workers each year are not paid entitlements on insolvency and that the average amount of money owed to workers who are left with unpaid entitlements on insolvency is $7,000 per person. If this is right—and data is not readily available on this issue—during Labor's 13 years 221,000 workers were left unprotected by Labor, losing some $1.25 billion in unpaid entitlements. Yet virtually nothing was done. 
Labor's failure is even more contemptible given that Labor induced an economic recession in 1990 which left nearly a million Australians unemployed and caused thousands of businesses to go into insolvency. Even with the wreckage of recession around it, Labor did not act to protect employee entitlements. Apart from its failed accords with the ACTU, Labor missed other opportunities to deal with the problem. Unfortunately I will not have time to go through them all. Labor's only legislative actions on this issue were in 1985 and 1993. In 1985 the Companies Act was amended to give limited priority to retrenchment payments after unpaid wages and entitlements in respect of annual leave. In 1993 the Corporations Law was amended so that priority for money owed to the Commissioner for Taxation was ranked behind employee entitlements, but this amendment provided no effective solution to the problem because it left employee entitlements ranking behind those of secured creditors.
Every employee during and after Labor's recession who was sacked but owed money when their employer went broke continued to be denied their unpaid entitlements when secured creditors ranked above them. Labor's record in government on protecting employee entitlements exposes the gulf between Labor's rhetoric and practice on workers' rights. We hear a lot about it now but there was not much action when Labor was in a position to do something about it. The Employee Entitlements Support Scheme is the most far reaching extension of the social security safety net undertaken by a government to protect workers who are left stranded when a company fails. It is the only scheme operating to protect workers' entitlements. Workers and their families have every right to vent their disappointment at the states and the federal opposition who left them significantly out of pocket, through no fault of their own. It is an enduring pity that others do not share the coalition government's commitment to working people in need.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Companies: Employee Entitlements</title>,Adjournment,18,1,speech
