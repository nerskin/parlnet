"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-25,"—In commencing my address on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  I must address some of the inaccuracies given in the chamber yesterday by Senator Bolkus, who tried to say that, because of the Environment Protection and Diversity Conservation Act, the Democrats were responsible for RFA regions being excluded from the Environment Protection Act. He is trying to rewrite history by saying that it needs to go on the Senate record. I think the rebuttal needs to go on the Senate record too. No doubt the motive for this is so that the speech can be circulated to conservation groups in an attempt to show that Senator Bolkus has actually done something on the environment. I challenge Senator Bolkus to read the record himself. That blood is not on our hands, because it was Senator Bolkus who directed the Labor Party to stand with the government and vote down our attempts to make RFA legislation subordinate to national environmental legislation.
Turning to the main body of my remarks, I rise to speak on this bill as a very strong supporter of a viable forestry industry based on plantations, selective logging of regrowth forests and long-term sustainable forestry based on ecologically sound principles. The Regional Forest Agreements Bill must be 
 described as one of the most significant environmental decisions this parliament will make. Trees, like people, are long term. Governments, both state and federal, will be judged by future generations for the actions taken on this legislation.
This bill presents ethical and constitutional issues as well as potential legal and financial difficulties for the Commonwealth and for the taxpayer, which should be resolved to the satisfaction of the Senate before it considers passing the bill. Legally, this legislation sets a disturbing precedent. It says that the community can know that an agreement has been reached but not know what the specific terms of the agreement are and that the normal powers of the community's representatives, the parliamentarians, are going to be circumscribed in relation to their knowledge of these agreements. That is not a transparent democratic process and, regardless of the political views of senators in the chamber, should not be one that is supported.
There is a lot of talk about certainty in the context of this legislation, but there is no environmental certainty under the RFA process. The Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement process, for example, has been an unmitigated disaster. It was supposed to bring an end to the divisiveness and conflict of the forest debate, but our televisions tell us nightly that the opposite is true. The WA RFA was supposed to be supported by 400 scientists, but no-one can find them. It was supposed to manage forests, but one-third of its coverage is for cleared or non-forest land. As things stand, the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement, controlled as it has been by the discredited Department of Conservation and Land Management, known as CALM, and other special interests, has served up an RFA which fails to meet the needs of and opportunities for the forestry industry for forest conservation, for forest management and for sustainable forest development in Western Australia.
This agreement has had no final public scrutiny. It has not been a transparent exercise. Right from the outset the Court government, through CALM, has been absolutely determined to conceal the extent and the 
 impact of native forest destruction. Contrary to the impression given, less than seven per cent of the total log volume extracted from our native forests ends up as value added produce. Eighty-three per cent of the total log volume ends up as woodchips, industrial charcoal and forest waste. In years to come, historians will condemn CALM executives and their political and commercial allies for the wanton destruction of this irreplaceable resource. The view which I express here is one which splits all the major parties. Unlike the misguided but well-meaning land clearing policies which produced the salinity disaster in Western Australia, the RFA fiasco is different in that the Court government and CALM—I always describe them as Genghis CALM because of their split personality—know exactly what they are doing. State and Commonwealth ministers have made themselves complicit in the concealment that CALM has carried out. The lack of transparency is increased by the absence of the community, tourism interests, independent scientists and non-exploitative government agencies from the formal RFA process.
Public emotion is running high in Western Australia in protests for and against the RFA policy. It has split country from city but has also split country person from country person and city person from city person. It has split political parties. It has split businesses. It has split the society. Thousands and thousands of people have taken to the streets to voice their opposition to logging of old-growth forests. Survey results show that 87 per cent of Western Australians want to see old-growth forests protected and an end to woodchipping and clear-felling. Hundreds of vociferous loggers have voiced their support for woodchipping and clear-felling old-growth forests. This is not an issue which will die with this bill, and this bill will in fact exacerbate the situation.
We have seen an unprecedented divide in political circles in Western Australia, with the National Party alienating itself from its coalition partners by calling for greater protection for forests and the Labor Party split but at least warning timber industry workers that they must accept change. Longstanding 
 Liberal supporters have joined the protest marches. Our state environment minister, Cheryl Edwardes, is all at sea and the only lifeline that the federal coalition threw her was forestry minister Wilson Tuckey. Now she sometimes says wryly, `Wilson is just being Wilson,' so even those two cannot get along.
During the RFA review period, I am told that some 30,000 submissions were received from concerned Western Australians. Of those an estimated 25,000 submissions directly opposed the logging of the remaining 10 per cent of WA's old-growth forest. Even if we accept that some of those submissions were simply form letters and were manufactured by rote, nevertheless the television stations, the newspapers and the discussions that people are having in their kitchens and in public places all indicate acute Western Australian disquiet over this process.
It is our federal and state governments' duty to pave the way for our forestry industry to be self-sufficient. Long-term, sustainable industries create employment and will see regional towns in the South-West of WA thrive well into the future. Plantations are the way of the future for the timber industry and there is a great deal of work to be done in replanting many denuded areas of Western Australia. The community is right behind a sustainable forestry industry; it is not right behind the clear-felling or logging of old-growth forest.
Plantations have been productive in WA for the past 25 years and now account for two-thirds of the timber used in paper production, a fact largely unknown by the public. We should be grateful for what I think was a conservative government in WA that, way back then, began the plantation industry. Unfortunately, the conservative and Labor governments that followed did not continue with investment in and encouragement of this industry on a sufficient basis. Thankfully, they are starting to really get behind the plantation industry again.
However, despite the commercial success of plantations, the WA government maintains the provision of subsidies for the clear-felling, commercial users of native forests. Every dollar of welfare to native forest users under 
 mines the competing, inherently superior and community supported plantation based forestry industry. It is understandable, of course, that organisations currently receiving extensive subsidies will resist any measures that threaten to reduce them. It is also understandable that the Department of Conservation and Land Management, CALM, which benefits financially from logging old-growth forests, would be very reluctant to sever its cosy arrangements with the big timber companies. But this co-dependence should never have been allowed to develop and must now stop.
Who do we think actually funded all those trucks and workers to stay outside the state parliament of WA for a week or more? It was not the unions and it was not the workers; it was the companies. There is a lot of money tied up in this and there is a lot of concern in the companies that the basically unsustainable subsidy system will be eroded by public pressure. CALM—or Genghis CALM, as I prefer to call it—is in the outrageous position of being responsible for both the conservation and the exploitation of forests. In 1996 the Democrats put out an issues paper believing that that department should be split to reflect these two conflicting policies. Thankfully, the Court government is finally starting to recognise the wisdom of that and hopefully will move to do just that. It is impossible for any organisation to fairly administer a resource with such conflicting imperatives. There is no question that CALM must be divided into two clearly differentiated bodies to avoid these profound conflicts of interest.
Increasing the use of plantation timbers would do much to preserve native forests, protect biodiversity and reduce social conflict, and it is likely to do so while boosting employment, contributing to gross national product and fostering regional development. Fewer than 2,000 people are directly employed in the native forest timber industry, not 20,000 as some in the government would have us believe. Many more people are already employed by the plantation industry, and this number would escalate if the industry were allowed to flourish as it should.
A media release of 22 July 1999 from the Western Australian Forest Alliance indicated 
 that there are currently about 1,500 direct jobs in the native forest based timber woodchip industry. It said that, by maximising the use of WA's pine and blue gum plantations and by developing a low volume, high value jarrah and karri furniture industry based on regrowth forest, government and the private sector could create over 3,000 new jobs, most of them immediately and without destroying any more old-growth forests. The new jobs that it outlined were 800 in pine processing, 400 in a new woodchip export industry based on blue gum plantations, 1,500-plus jobs in the value added jarrah, karri and marri furniture and fine woodcraft industries and 800 in plantation based pulp mills. That is a total of 3,000 new jobs, and the Western Australian Forest Alliance is firmly and fully supportive of a sustainable forest industry.
No matter how you look at it, natural old-growth forests are worth far more standing up than they would ever be worth chopped down. One of the reasons I support accrual accounting is that I hope that governments will start to produce balance sheets which properly indicate, in the valuation of the state and federal resources, the value of our forests. In America people pay big tourist dollars to see giant trees. In Western Australia people pay big tourist dollars to see giant trees, yet our government makes sure that most 350-year-old giants are cut down for charcoal or woodchips. Tourists will pay to enjoy the forest over and over again, but a smelter or a woodchip mill will see magnificent old-growth trees once and once only and then they are gone forever.
Clear-felling does not generate employment. With today's modern equipment it takes three men three days to clear-fell 100 hectares of forest and another handful of men to cart the logs away. By the end of the week those men are again looking for work. Let me repeat that: it takes three men three days to clear-fell 100 hectares of forest. That is not sustainable employment.
Woodchipping currently accounts for almost half of the logs taken from the South-West of Western Australia and yet, so I am advised, directly and indirectly employs less than 80 people. Timber industry workers at the centre 
 of the logging debate are being manipulated by the big timber industry players and the companies into thinking that the end of logging old-growth forests means an end to the forestry industry. It does not. Timber towns are blaming the antilogging groups for the breaking of the social fabric of their communities, but it is strange that communities in the drylands where there are no forests are experiencing the same social problems that all country and regional towns are experiencing. To blame it all on the old-growth forest antilogging movement is entirely wrong.
No doubt the same fears and arguments were raised when slavery was stamped out. No doubt the people of Albany thought their town would die when whaling stopped, and I expect some people thought society would be ruined when women got the vote and equal pay. Really, this is an issue that society needs to manage a lot better than it is at present. All those things I mentioned have come to pass with none of the feared consequences, and I think that forest management is in the same category. I do not think it is an easy problem to solve, because if it were it would have been solved, but affected workers deserve every form of assistance possible in moving into a largely plantation based forestry industry.
This is a problem that must be solved. The Dutch Ministry of Public Works have refused to buy karri timber from Western Australia for canal linings because the results of their study into CALM failed to demonstrate that old-growth karri forests in Western Australia are sustainably managed. Other foreign countries and organisations are starting to take similar action. There will be commercial pressure, not just public pressure, on governments and on these companies to change their habits.
City councils in Perth and in New South Wales have boycotted companies that are involved in woodchipping Australia's native forests. Some estimate that Boral will lose between $5 million and $10 million a year as a direct result of its woodchipping interests. In these matters the government should be a leader, not a follower. It should recognise the 
 social, economic and forestry trends which require it to end the days of woodchipping, logging and clear-felling of old-growth forests.
The issue of logging versus antilogging in old-growth forests will not go away; that much is clear from the intensity of the debate, the diversity of the protesters and the passionate nature of the issues. The RFAs have been touted by governments as the last word on forests. It has been claimed that, once the agreements are signed, they are ironclad guarantees about what will happen in forest areas for up to 20 years. But according to the consultant Alistair Graham, even after the Tasmanian RFA was signed `by some of the highest ministers in the land', he said, the officials are still blithely going on, destroying thousands and thousands of hectares by changing the boundaries of the maps that were behind the documents which the minister signed. That kind of activity becomes an issue of accountability and proper auditing.
The financial impact statement from the explanatory memorandum of the national RFA bill says, `There will be no direct financial impacts from the passage of the RFA  bill.' Any costs and savings will be the result of the establishment, implementation and operation of the RFAs themselves. But we know that this bill enacts the RFAs and that they will be very expensive. It is disingenuous to state that the bill itself has no financial implications, because the financial implications are filtered through the RFAs. I remind honourable senators that the Commonwealth is liable to pay any compensation that is required to be paid to a state in accordance with the compensation provisions of an RFA. That is in clear contrast, as I understand it, to the statement in the explanatory memorandum, which I read earlier.
It seems to me that this bill has direct financial implications and that the explanatory memorandum is therefore misleading the Senate. I think that is a question the parliamentary secretary should address in her response. I believe the Senate should regard this matter gravely and all senators, whatever side of the forest debate they feel closest to, should separate their feelings on that issue 
 from the sheer accountability problems of this bill. Do we accept a bill given to us with the assurance that there will be no direct financial implications and pass it, knowing full well that there are extraordinary and unlimited financial consequences?
We as the parliamentarians of this country cannot stand by and let one of our most precious resources slip through our fingers, neither can we commit ourselves to unlimited and unknown levels of financial compensation to an industry that has already benefited handsomely from state and federal government assistance for decades.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate on the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . The bulk of the criticisms raised by non-government speakers about the bill focuses not on the bill but on alleged deficiencies in the regional forest agreement process itself. I must say at the outset that the government rejects those criticisms. The RFA process represents the most rigorous and scientifically based assessment of our native forest resource ever undertaken, including the biodiversity it supports and the regimes required to ensure ecologically sustainable management of that forest resource on a regional basis. It does not end with the signing of the RFAs. We should not gloss over the fact that RFAs are designed to provide both a blueprint for ongoing improvement in the management of our forests and a basis for an internationally competitive and ecologically sustainable forest products industry.
RFAs provide for a world-class national, comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system and will clearly identify those forest resources available for multiple use, including resources available for sustainable timber harvesting. RFAs and the comprehensive and transparent process that lead to them provide industry, environmental interests and the community with unprecedented certainty. However, it is clear that industry and environmental groups alike are concerned that future governments might simply walk away from such agreements. These concerns are under 
 standable. That is exactly what previous governments have done when it suited them and what the current Western Australian government appears to be doing right now.
To address these concerns, the government has introduced this bill, which underpins, as far as the Commonwealth government is concerned, its commitment to the RFA process and its outcomes. This bill provides RFAs with the legislative backing to ensure that all Australians can have confidence in the long-term management of Australia's forest estate as far as the Commonwealth is able to do.
Clearly, control of native forests and lands rests largely with the states. However, through the RFA process the Commonwealth has been able to work with the states to ensure that, across all of Australia, adequate levels of native forest reserves are protected. At the same time, the RFA process ensures that the remaining forests are managed on a sustainable basis. The Commonwealth cannot stop individual states from unilaterally taking action outside these arrangements, but the Commonwealth can examine whether the state has breached the RFA and, if so, it can consider what action it might take to remedy the situation within the terms of the RFA. This legislation ensures that the Commonwealth will continue to ensure that its commitments made under the RFA are met.
In summary, the RFAs themselves remain the focus of the Commonwealth government's policy approach. It firmly believes that community and investor confidence in forest industries will be secured by strong RFAs which provide for ecologically sustainable management of our forests. This bill will add to that confidence. This is not to say that the government is putting all its eggs in one basket. Much has been said about the current capacity of plantation sourced wood to replace wood sourced from native forests. While these comments represent a simplistic assessment of the real situation, they also fail to acknowledge the great initiatives being undertaken through Vision 2020 to treble the area of plantations in Australia by the year 2020—a vision which is well on track.
As outlined in the second reading speech, the government is also taking action to facilitate industry development and higher value adding, particularly through the action agenda process, so that this country can play a positive role in the provision and utilisation of a sustainable resource in an international marketplace. That is why a vital and sustainable native forest industry is needed right now to ensure that we have a viable and sustainable forest and wood products industry into the future with both native forest and plantation based components. I have already stated that this bill provides a broad legislative base for RFAs, with each RFA including provisions appropriate to the region concerned. Consequently, the bill is concise, and it has been drafted to ensure that it can accommodate the necessary flexibility within and between individual RFAs.
One of the main objectives is to provide legislative rigour for RFA termination and compensation provisions. The bill will ensure that the termination of an RFA will have no effect unless done in accordance with the RFA's termination provisions. It will also ensure that the Commonwealth is liable for any breach it makes of an RFA while it is in force, even if the agreement is subsequently terminated or expires. The bill provisions will mean that the Commonwealth will not be able to agree to water down termination or compensation provisions in the future without legislative amendment. The bill also provides that the termination and compensation provisions in the RFA at the time of the commencement of the legislation, or the provisions which apply at the commencement of the RFA itself, whichever is later, will continue to apply.
The other main objective of the bill is to remove certain Commonwealth controls and restrictions which in the past have been used as an indirect means to attempt to control timber harvesting. Time and again the government of the day has been involved in a highly emotional and highly politicised imbroglio surrounding the issue of licences to export hardwood woodchips derived from native forests, as if this Commonwealth action could in any meaningful way ensure either sustain 
 able levels of harvesting within a state or that that harvesting was undertaken in an environmentally friendly manner.
That process is in stark contrast to the RFA process, which is based on comprehensive scientific assessments of the environmental, heritage, economic and social value of forests in the region. Such comprehensive assessments conclude the Commonwealth's environment and heritage obligations in relation to forestry operations in the RFA regions. For that reason, the bill exempts RFA forestry operations from specific trigger provisions contained in current Commonwealth environmental and heritage legislation. Therefore, contrary to the claims of the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens, there is no abrogation of the Commonwealth's powers in this respect.
I welcome the opposition's support, at least in principle, for the bill. However, the opposition has foreshadowed a number of amendments to the bill. The government will not be supporting those amendments on the grounds that they are constitutionally invalid, unworkable or do nothing to improve the effectiveness of the legislation. For example, the opposition will be proposing a mechanism so that parliament can disapprove RFAs before they are able to be signed and obtain the protection of the bill. The main concern appears to be that if the Commonwealth is going to exempt the operation of Commonwealth legislation on forestry operations under an RFA, it must be confident that the replacement regime is just as rigorous.
Without going into any detail at this time, we believe that this proposed amendment has serious deficiencies, both constitutionally and practically. The government also believes that adequate scrutiny by parliament is achieved through acceptance of the measures recommended by the majority report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, which recently reviewed the bill. That report recommended that, while the bill should be passed without amendment, each RFA should be tabled in parliament after it is signed; that the first five annual reports of the operation of RFAs should be tabled in parliament; and that the 
 ABS be requested to, when compiling its annual survey of employment, compile comprehensive employment information for each RFA region.
The Minister for Forestry and Conservation, the Hon. Wilson Tuckey, MP, has already publicly welcomed the recommendations of the majority report. We agree that, in the interest of transparency and accountability, completed RFAs should be tabled in parliament. We believe that the Commonwealth parliament should focus on monitoring the implementation of all RFAs, and so agree that the annual report should be tabled in parliament. We also agree that better information on employment impacts is an important part of monitoring the implementation of RFAs, and the Australian Bureau of Statistics will be consulted about how it might best contribute.
I am also intrigued by the amendments to the bill to be moved by the Australian Greens. In his minority report, Senator Brown recommended that the bill be opposed. He is now proposing that the bill be passed with certain amendments. Is this a dramatic about-face? No, not when you examine those proposed amendments. Contrary to the national forest policy statement, which was adopted by all states and territories and the Commonwealth, it is still the Australian Greens' unbending goal to prohibit all logging from native forests. That goal is anathema to the government, and we will oppose the Green amendments. We will, however, be proposing our own amendment, consistent with the recommendation of the majority report, to establish a forest product advisory council; its functions and constitutions to be prescribed by regulation. I commend the bill to the Senate.
—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Brown be agreed to.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1999-08-25,"—When Judie Stephens's grandson Jackson was three months old, he sustained a very serious head injury in a motor vehicle accident that killed both of his parents. The current expenditure for Jackson's 24-hour care, rehabilitation, active observation and equipment is between $3,000 and $4,500 per week. That is why I want to draw to the attention of this chamber today the practical benefits of structured settlements. Generally speaking, common law practice provides that compensation in cases of serious injury can be awarded either as a tax-free lump sum or as periodic payments subject to income tax. The tax-free nature of the lump sum payment makes it the preferred option for many claimants, but it requires responsible and complex management if it is to provide for the long-term care of the disabled party. Structured settlements, on the other hand, provide a secure income for the beneficiary for life—an income that can pay for ongoing medical care while promoting the independence of the claimant.  
It is my firm conviction that legislation that enables seriously disabled accident victims to access tax-free structured settlements would be a responsible step forward for the management of disability care. The structured settlement proposal is designed to benefit both accident victims and all taxpaying Australians. Structured settlements would be available to any seriously injured individual who is entitled to common law compensation payouts. Such settlements are the way of paying common law compensation periodically. So, instead of a single lump sum, claimants can receive a smaller up-front lump sum payment combined with ongoing tax-free periodic payments for the rest of their life. This arrangement would offer seriously injured people greater long-term financial security and would reduce the risk of seriously injured accident victims becoming reliant on government welfare.
Structured settlements are supported by international precedent, with the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Canada undertaking the necessary taxation reform to introduce tax-free structured components of compensation awards. Wherever common law damages for personal injury are paid, a structured settlement can be used. It includes motor vehicle accidents, work injuries, medical malpractice and public liability but excludes statutory periodic payments. 	During the settlement negotiation process, either party can suggest a structured settlement and, if both parties agree, the case can be settled on this basis.
The design of each structure will depend on the individual needs of the injured party. However, overseas experience indicates that usually about one-third of the compensation is paid to the claimant as an up-front lump sum and the rest is then used by the defendant insurer to purchase an annuity for the injured person. The annuity funds the periodic payments, which are normally payable for the life of the injured person, and they are indexed to inflation. There is usually a minimum guarantee period, and if a claimant dies before the expiration of that period the payments will continue to be made to the claimant's estate or to the nominated beneficiary. After the 
 defendant insurer purchases the annuity, it obtains a full release from liability and can close its file. The annuity is owned by the insured person, who has an ongoing relationship with the provider. As previously stated, tax-free structured settlements have been adopted in the USA, the United Kingdom and Canada. The relevant compensation and taxation laws in Australia are nearly identical to those in the United Kingdom, making the English model the most appropriate for Australia to adopt.
The sad reality is that lump sum payments are too frequently an inadequate form of compensation. Those in receipt of lump sum payments are often at the mercy of ill-informed or unscrupulous carers, and poor investment choices often result. Large sums of money are difficult to handle and a false sense of wealth and security can lead to a rapidly diminishing resource. Lump sum payments must be particularly well managed if they are to provide for the long-term interests of the claimant—a significant responsibility to be borne by the beneficiary or their carer. The difficulties involved in managing large sums should not be underestimated. It would be difficult for any one of us, if paid our lifetime's income in one lump sum today, to manage that money so that it lasts as long as we live. The problems can only be magnified when the money is paid to accident victims who are already having to deal with the enormous physical and emotional stress caused by their ongoing disabilities.
Even if a lump sum were to be invested and spent by a claimant carefully, it may not last. This is because the assumptions on which the sum was calculated may not prove to be accurate. Lump sum settlements are calculated based on assumptions about future interest rates, inflation and, sometimes, the claimant's mortality. The solution is not simply to shift the risk of inaccurate assumptions from claimants to defendants but to shift the risk to the life insurer from whom the structured settlement is purchased. Life insurers are able to make realistic, market based predictions and are better placed to handle the associated risks. When lump sums are exhausted, the severely disabled beneficiary often becomes 
 reliant on social security and Medicare to meet the costs of their care, rehabilitation and living expenses. Thus the problem of the lump sum payments paid in inappropriate circumstances affects every one of us. Once the money is gone, it is only a matter of time before beneficiaries turn to the government for support.
A 1997 report by Coopers and Lybrand conservatively estimated that in any one year recipients of lump sum payments cost the Australian government $225 million. This figure was achieved by calculating the current cost of social security and Medicare for lump sum beneficiaries and deducting it from the total taxation revenue collected from periodic payment recipients. Thus, despite a loss of taxation revenue, the government would actually save money by implementing a structured settlement scheme.
While accident victims could now request payment of their common law compensation in the form of periodic payments, this does not happen. Injured people tend to prefer lump sums because of their tax-free status and defendants tend to prefer lump sums because they avoid any ongoing administrative costs. Under a structured settlement scheme, ongoing administrative costs are undertaken by the provider and the compensation is finalised at the time of settlement, and the disincentive of ongoing administrative costs for the defendant is thus avoided. Unless the law is changed to encourage structured settlements, the status quo will remain unchanged. That would be to the detriment of many claimants, many defendant insurers and certainly all taxpayers.
Many interest groups regularly approach the government and request tax breaks. We know a certain degree of caution needs to be adopted when we deal with such requests. Structured settlements are, however, a special case on the basis of strong policy and economic grounds. The special tax treatment would only be available to those who have suffered personal injuries and who have elected to receive their compensation periodically. This group of people would be relatively small and comprised of seriously injured people. Few other interest groups seeking tax concessions will be able to justify their call for tax breaks 
 on such a significant social justice basis, nor is their proposed change likely to be revenue positive for the government.
I believe that, through the introduction of structured settlements in Australia, the government has the opportunity to benefit both individuals suffering severe injury and all Australian taxpayers. All compensation stakeholders—injured people, insurers and lawyers—support this reform which will greatly improve the compensation system in Australia. There are a number of people who have been quoted as giving unanimous support for structured settlements: the New South Wales Law and Justice Committee in 1996, the Victorian Law Reform Committee in 1997, and an NRMA submission to the Law and Justice Committee in 1998. With those few words, I encourage everyone in this chamber to show support for what would be a vitally important initiative.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Compensation: Structured Settlements</title>,Matters of Public Interest,1,1,speech

Senator Lundy and her colleagues have as yet failed to nominate any single project that they would regard as less than deserving of support.
I do not know what this `16 shonks tipping competition'—a fax from the office of John Faulkner—is meant to be. One has to presume that this is just a sick joke to fill in time because there is nothing much else happening in opposition. It says:
Remember—16 ticks only. This is not preferential; it is first past the post. First correct entry receives a gold shonk buster certificate signed by Kim Beazley. All other correct entries receive a bronze certificate.
This puts it in context, Madam President. This has now become a little joke for insiders. This is not a serious policy issue at all. What Senator Faulkner has done is demonstrate to the public at large that this is really a game that is being played.
Until today, of course, we did not know the extent to which they thought this was a joke, but we now do. Quite clearly, if it is to be re-elevated to an item of seriousness, the challenge is for the opposition to point to any one of the projects which they allege is a shonk. Rather than playing mickey mouse tipping games and getting some third-rate prize from Senator Faulkner—let alone the current leader, Mr Beazley—I would have thought that, if they wanted to be serious contributors to the debate out there, they would go out and visit some of these programs.
I assume that Senator Conroy has made his peace with Mr Barresi, and he has rung him up and apologised for getting his name wrong. There are a lot of things the opposition can do if they are serious about this issue.  
—Are you a coward?
—But now that we have the `16 shonks tipping competition', I think it says it all. This issue is no longer taken seriously even by the opposition.

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-08-25,"—Madam President, I am happy to meet Senator Cook in the gym tonight.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! We are waiting to proceed with question time.
—Now that Senator Cook has finally got rid of that yacht, I presume he has a bit more time to come down and demonstrate his credentials. The fact is that we have made it plain on a number of occasions that we are not going to get into the business of identifying particular projects or their rankings.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! There is far too much noise in the chamber. I am finding it difficult to hear. The Senate will come to order.
—Thank you, Madam President. We have made it very plain that we are not in the business of putting numbers alongside these projects, either by money or by points. All that would do is cause embarrassment to both the winners and the losers, because it would compromise their capacity to raise funds from the commercial sector and, indeed, from the community and municipal sector.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-08-25,"—Yesterday Senator Woodley asked me why Ansett Australia had withdrawn from the aircraft study being done by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Airconditioning Engineers. I have an answer which I would like to read part of.
Ansett have provided advice that they agreed to participate in that project believing that it was officially endorsed by the Federal Aviation Administration of the USA. Ansett subsequently learned that this was not the case. Ansett could not spare the aircraft operationally because their priority focus was modifying the BAe 146 aircraft fleet to overcome the odour problem for the benefit of customers and staff. Ansett's BAe 146 modification program is so advanced that their fleet is not representative of the world's BAe 146 population and therefore not appropriate for the study of the type that was proposed by that American society.
Ansett are one of 65 BAe 146 operators worldwide. It is true that Australia has a high number of reported problems, but Ansett inform me that that is because Ansett Australia is the only airline in the world that has a compulsory reporting program. I should also mention that, in a recent court hearing about Ansett's flight attendants' claims in relation to the BAe 146 fumes, the court accepted evidence that there was no toxicity in the fumes coming into the cabin. Ansett also advise me that they have demonstrated their complete commitment to corporate responsibility in this matter in ways unmatched by any other operator in Australia. In fairness to Ansett, I seek leave to incorporate the full text of the answer which they have given me.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Question 1
Ansett Australia is one of 65 BAe 146 operators worldwide. Of those, five operate in Australia.


Ansett Australia
operates 11 BAe 146 aircraft
National Jet Services
operates 21
Southern Airlines
operates 2
Airlink
operates 12
Australian Air Express
operates 3
If it is true that Australia has the highest number of reported problems, it may be because of the number of BAe 146 aircraft operating in Australia and because one of those operators, Ansett Australia, is the only airline in the world that has a compulsory reporting program.
Question 2
Ansett Australia has withdrawn from participating in a study being done by the American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) for three reasons
1.	 Ansett agreed to participate in the project believing that it was officially endorsed by the Federal Aviation Administration of the USA Ansett subsequently learned that this is not the case
2.	 Ansett could not spare the aircraft operationally because its priority focus was modifying the BAe 146 fleet to overcome the odour problem for the benefit of customers and staff.
3.	 Ansetts BAe 146 modification program is so advanced that its fleet is not representative of the world's BAe 146s and therefore not appropriate for a study of the type proposed by ASHRAE.
Question 3
Ansett has demonstrated its complete commitment to corporate responsibility in this matter in ways unmatched by any other operator in Australia or overseas.
.	 Ansett has proactively liaised with CASA and BASI on the issue.
.	 Ansett aircraft modifications include engine and auxiliary power unit enhancements to prevent oil leaking into the air conditioning system and modifications to the air conditioning system to improve airflow in the cabin.
.	 Ansett has rigorously collected and analysed data and can produce overwhelming medical evidence to confirm the safety of their aircraft fleet for crew and passengers.
.	 Ansett will naturally continue to comply with all regulatory requirements.

Leave granted.
—The government would like to place on record, having spoken to the other parties—and we understand the Democrats will be supporting this motion—the following comments.
On 17 August 1999, the government announced that Transfield Thompson-CSF Pty Limited had been selected as the preferred purchaser for ADI Limited. The preferred purchaser is now undertaking final due diligence which will be completed in the near future. The Commonwealth will continue the negotiations and, subject to a satisfactory outcome, execute a share sale agreement. 
 Details of the transaction will be announced when the final contract is entered into.
Following the proposed sale, the Office of Asset Sales and IT Outsourcing will complete a post-sale report. The Australian National Audit Office also plans to complete an efficiency audit in relation to the proposed sale, as it does with all asset sales. The audit office will provide its report to the parliament.
It would be inappropriate for the Senate to consider reviewing the proposed transaction during confidential and commercially sensitive negotiations, which should be concluded by the end of next month. The Senate inquiry could seriously jeopardise the Commonwealth's position in the current daily negotiations. It would also be highly unusual for a Senate inquiry to precede an ANAO inquiry and it could constrain or taint the independence of the ANAO. The government would welcome a Senate inquiry subsequent to the sale and will fully cooperate with an inquiry at that time, but we will not support an inquiry at this time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee</title>",Committees,9,1,speech

That the Senate take note of the document.
I will not delay the Senate, but I do not want a report as important as this to go without notice. This is about managing pest and disease emergencies in Australia and the enormous impact that pests and diseases can have on this country. Indeed, the report itself points out that an outbreak of foot and mouth 
 disease, which, as we know, affects cattle, sheep, goats and pigs, could cause a fall of about 3½ per cent in gross domestic product, a one per cent increase in unemployment and a loss of $2 billion a year in export earnings if it were to occur. I think the report is important reading for people who are involved not just in agricultural industries but in the protection of Australia's environment because the two things are inseparably vulnerable to the import of pests and diseases.
Two aspects of this, I think, are incredibly important. There are moves being made to deal with ballast water but, if you walk to Constitution Dock in Tasmania—and I know you have done that often, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson—and look at the bottom, at the moment the shallows are littered with massive, carnivorous sea stars. They are now called Pacific sea stars. They have come from Japan. They are eating everything else in the vicinity, and they will end up eating each other. They are cannibalistic when the food supply is down. It is apparent that those sea stars were introduced in ballast water on a woodchip ship some time in the past—and this is not the first time it has happened. It just shows how vulnerable we are to increasing world trade and the movement of people, and how industries have a wider responsibility in the movement of goods and stock into and out of the country.
I think it is incredibly important also that we look at the potential for disaster coming out of the deliberate importation of species to this country. The CSIRO can speak for itself on this but, in the past, it has been the agent for introducing, quite deliberately, species into the country which are now costing millions, if not billions, of dollars per annum to try to control. I understand that, for trial, grasses are still being brought into various parts of northern Australia to see how they will go in our arid climate. The problem is that, if they are no good for stock, they can very well get away, compete with native grasses and create havoc not only for natural ecosystems but ultimately for the economic wellbeing of industries dependent on the grasslands.
The precautionary principle there needs to be absolutely employed. There is no room for 
 experimentation any longer in this country. We have seen the disasters too frequently, and to get a quick potential advantage out of trying some new species brought in for commercial reasons is simply unconscionable in this day and age. I am glad this report is out but I would like to see even stronger measures than those recommended here to bolster the improving way in which we deal with our rapidly increasing problem, the movement in and out of the country of goods and people, threatening ecosystems and our economic wellbeing.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,14,1,speech

"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-08-25,"—by leave—I would like to concur with Senator Brown's remarks and add to them by raising another issue that is very relevant to the disease emergencies that Australia could face, particularly in relation to the importing of salmon and trout in the raw state.
At present, Australia is being taken before the World Trade Organisation because of our restrictions on imports. Canada is saying to Australia that they require the same import procedures as New Zealand. At present, New Zealand is required to remove only the gut of these fish to bring them in, and there are no restrictions whatsoever on the packaging or 
 on material extraneous to what is put on the market. Canada is required to remove the heads and bone, and when the imports come to Australia they are required to impound the packaging and all of the water used in the processing, and that must be disposed of according to special criteria.
The problem is that neither of those two procedures will protect Australia from being exposed to the 20 diseases that the import of those raw products can bring to Australia. Even if those raw products are frozen and brought into Australia, 14 of those diseases can survive the freezing process. We run the great risk of exposing all of our native fish, all of our fishing industry and our recreational fishermen to extreme dangers if these pathogens get into our streams.
Canada is a classic example. They were free of these same diseases until they imported fish from Europe. They are now in the same position as the rest of Europe. Australia is free of all of these 20 diseases. It would make good sense for the government to continue with the bans that were put in place in 1964 when all raw fish was banned from being imported. The New South Wales Department of Agriculture has also likened this disease to foot and mouth disease if it escaped into Australia. And, as the senator has already pointed out, the economic possibility of that is quite serious.
In concluding, I would just ask that, when we receive reports like these, the Senate is aware of the requirements that these reports and the particular functions that need to be carried out. I ask, particularly in this case, that the Senate takes note of the possibilities of importing disease with the salmon and trout in their raw state.",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Auditor-General's Reports</title>,Documents,16,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-08-25,"—by leave—I would like to concur with Senator Brown's remarks and add to them by raising another issue that is very relevant to the disease emergencies that Australia could face, particularly in relation to the importing of salmon and trout in the raw state.
At present, Australia is being taken before the World Trade Organisation because of our restrictions on imports. Canada is saying to Australia that they require the same import procedures as New Zealand. At present, New Zealand is required to remove only the gut of these fish to bring them in, and there are no restrictions whatsoever on the packaging or 
 on material extraneous to what is put on the market. Canada is required to remove the heads and bone, and when the imports come to Australia they are required to impound the packaging and all of the water used in the processing, and that must be disposed of according to special criteria.
The problem is that neither of those two procedures will protect Australia from being exposed to the 20 diseases that the import of those raw products can bring to Australia. Even if those raw products are frozen and brought into Australia, 14 of those diseases can survive the freezing process. We run the great risk of exposing all of our native fish, all of our fishing industry and our recreational fishermen to extreme dangers if these pathogens get into our streams.

After debate on the motion for the second reading has been adjourned, I will be moving a motion to have one of the bills listed separately on the Notice Paper . I move:
That these bills may proceed without formalities, may be taken together and be now read a first time.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—I return to this important amendment, which is to give the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  its own definition of `comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system'. As I was saying this morning, the bill simply leaves that to whichever RFA is drawn up in whichever state—different definitions around the country. That is of itself not good enough. I have introduced an amendment and a definition here which meets the requirements of everybody taking part in this debate. It brings into play the definition from the national forest policy itself in regard to protecting biodiversity, that is, the variation of plants and animals in our forests, the old-growth forests that are left and wilderness where wild forest remains intact. I would like to go through those three things to point out why it is important that this definition be in the bill and not just left to regional forest agreements which, under this bill, we in the parliament are unable to see or change.
Firstly, biodiversity means the diversity of species, both plants and animals, that are in our forests. The proposal is that 15 per cent of the original distribution of each forest ecosystem—each type of forest there is—should be protected. Surely we can spell that out. Where forest ecosystems are vulnerable to extinction, then at least 60 per cent of their remaining extent should be reserved. That is what the national forest policy says. That is what we should be writing in here. And the ecosystems of all remaining rare and endangered forest that is listed as such should be 
 reserved and protected. That is commonsense. All parties agreed to that in the process of evolving this legislation.
When we move to the requirements on old-growth forest itself—this means intact old forests, which are in short supply in this country after 200 years of exploitation—the national forest policy aims are that old-growth forest, where it is rare and depleted—and it is usually down to less than 10 per cent of its original distribution—should be protected wherever possible. The forest ecosystem should be protected; that is commonsense. For other forest ecosystems, 60 per cent of the old-growth forests identified at the time of the assessment would be protected. This leads on to wilderness, and it was agreed by everybody that 90 per cent, or more if possible, of the high quality wilderness that is left—that is, areas over 8,000 hectares—should be protected in reserves. So let us say so. It is really important.
Let us look at the picture in Tasmania and elsewhere where these regional forest agreements have been signed. If you look at biodiversity in Tasmania, there has been no recovery plan—flouting these laid out guidelines. Through you, Chair, I ask the parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, to come back to me on these statements of fact, as I have them. There is no recovery plan yet adopted for Astacopsis gouldi, the giant crayfish. This is the largest freshwater crayfish in the world. These animals are really spectacular. They grow to much more than a metre in length—up to a 1½ metres in length—and they weigh up to four kilograms. But they are very vulnerable to changes in their ecosystem. In particular, they are very vulnerable to mud coming down streams. The biggest worry there is logging roads going into regions like the Tarkine wilderness and, moreover, the forest being cut off the steep hill slopes. The eroded mud goes down into the streams and suffocates the ecosystem in which these amazing animals live.
There has also been logging of habitats in the north-east of Tasmania which has led to very heartfelt community protests because it is threatening the north-east forest snail, which is a large orange-coloured native snail 
 with a big shell on its back. It is a beautiful animal which has been listed as endangered. In addition to that, the Simson stag beetle—the sort you sometimes see in large brochures—is also threatened in this region and is listed as endangered. What has happened under this process since the regional forest agreement was signed the year before last? The state government has failed to identify the critical habitat of these species. It simply has no definition of where they live and where they do not, despite the state legislation calling for that. The forests concerned are being logged and turned into pine plantations. Is that the promise, the balance, that the government is talking about in this matter? If it is not, then let us make sure that at least we have written into this legislation the promise of the government that the national forest policy would be upheld, because that would prevent this sort of breach of the whole spirit of these regional forest agreements.
In East Gippsland the regional forest agreement has failed to take account of scientific data on owl populations. This has been a matter of discussion both locally and across the state of Victoria. The regional forest agreement ignored the impacts on biodiversity of the clear-felling of the forests and the loss therefore of the older trees which have the hollows in them which are absolutely crucial for the nesting of species like the large owls, despite the fact that the areas which are being clear-felled have been listed or are required to prevent the threat to flora and fauna under state laws. Two of the seven crucial habitats in East Gippsland for the endangered tiger quoll—the native tiger cat; a marsupial—have been lost to logging. And 6,500 hectares of forest previously protected was allocated to woodchipping, including 3,500 hectares of crucial habitat for large owls like the powerful owl, the sooty owl and the masked owl and some of the habitat for the spotted-tailed quoll, which faces extinction on the mainland.
With that sort of thing, how can Australians, who are in the main—to say the least—concerned about the protection of endangered species including the forests themselves, be expected to have any faith in this legislation which locks into place the destruction of these 
 habitats for 20 years, with the federal minister for the environment handcuffed, effectively, and unable to do anything because the power has been given to the states as far as the environment is concerned? In the Central Highlands of Victoria the regional forest agreement has failed to protect the state's fauna emblem—Leadbeater's possum—because there are going to be high intensity burns over and adjacent to much of that possum's territory, and salvage logging will be allowed within its critical habitat—the dragging away of logs from that habitat that is important to the very emblem of Victoria. The regional forest agreement failed to put in place scientific recommendations from the world expert in this matter, Dr David Lindenmayer, that would have reduced timber supply by less than 15 per cent. What is the response to the criteria agreed by this government that would protect such species? No new national parks at all and no new state parks to protect these habitats in the Central Highlands of Victoria.
The old-growth criteria look at the trees themselves and the tree communities. The Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Wilson Tuckey, is on the public record as saying that the 60 per cent target for old growth—that is, protecting what is left of the remnant old-growth forests of this nation—is suddenly optional. It is no longer the amount that was determined and agreed to be protected; it has suddenly become optional. Amongst other things, he has done that to try to welsh on the arrangement with the New South Wales government. Therefore, there is an avenue there for protection of less—or indeed none at all—if people want to engage in this shifty type of process with the key types of rare forest that Australians were led to believe would be protected under this process.
Of course, it is the species which are most sought after, most profitable for the loggers—like the tall Eucalyptus regnans in Tasmania and Victoria—on which the targets have specifically not been met. The Tasmanian RFA, especially with respect to tall forest, has simply failed. The RFA is good at saving forests the loggers never wanted, because they are not large—the snow gums on the central 
 plateau or the stunted forest in infertile soils—but when you get to the grand giants of the forest it is a different matter altogether.
Let us look at the biggest of the lot: Eucalyptus regnans—the Latin name meaning `the king'. It is the tallest true hardwood tree on earth. Of the original 100,000 hectares, 13 per cent remains as old growth. Only one-third of that has been formally reserved—one-third of the 13 per cent. So we are down to four per cent or five per cent—well short of the target of 60 per cent. I correct that: 35 per cent has been protected, about half of the target of 60 per cent. Another third has been targeted for total destruction by logging, with a similar situation for other tall forests. That is simply cheating on the community expectation that there would be some form of balance here at least; that when you got to the most important because they are the most rare—and in this case, the most awesome of Australia's forest remnants—they would get special protection. It is not so here. In the main, they are not being adequately protected or they are being handed across to the woodchip corporations.
I have given some questions to Senator Troeth in past days to help ascertain exactly what the situation is as far as the grand forests of Tasmania are concerned. We are talking here about forest trees scraping 100 metres high. These are the second tallest trees in the world after the giant redwoods of California. They are the tallest flowering plants and the tallest hardwoods on the planet. They are the single tallest giants of the forests in the whole Southern Hemisphere. So I ask Senator Troeth: how many of these Eucalyptus regnans, the kings of the forest, have never been logged—both old growth and regrowth? And how many of the wet Eucalyptus obliqua forests, also giants, have never been logged? Add to that: Eucalyptus delegatensis. Here we are looking at three species which are absolutely awesome giants. They are the ones, by the way, that attract people in their thousands and create jobs in regional and rural areas simply because of their magnificence. I would like a response about the figures on how many of these particular species remain.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,—Senator Brown actually placed those questions on notice in the Notice Paper  to Senator Hill. No doubt Senator Hill will be answering those questions in due course.,SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—I am now putting them to the parliamentary secretary, who has the advisers here who have that information. We cannot proceed sensibly in this place if that basic information—the fate of the forests, which is what this bill is about—is not available to her. Senator Hill will no doubt be consulting exactly the same people the parliamentary secretary now has direct access to. We are not going to be able to progress in terms of getting these definitions right or in terms of a debate about why we should have these definitions if the parliamentary secretary does not have the information about how the definitions that have been evolved in this national forest policy are being kept up by the legislation. We were told that the legislation was going to make sure that, where there is rare and endangered old-growth forests, it would be implemented to give them protection over the years ahead. Surely the parliamentary secretary is going to be able to tell us what is left of these three species in Tasmania—the three grandest species of the lot—as a benchmark, so that we can know and she can tell us with reassurance that they are going to be protected, as this legislation says they will, as the national forest policy says they would and as the definition I have put forward would ensure.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—Chair, you will have to agree that this is totally unsatisfactory. I can ask ministers any questions I like but, when it gets to dealing with legislation, the government representative on key questions is expected to inform the committee. You cannot just say, `Well, 
 they've been asked of somebody else and I therefore don't have a responsibility.' It is a process where Senator Hill, who is not the minister for logging, might be seeking the information from Senator Troeth. But Senator Troeth has an obligation, a responsibility, to have this key information for this committee to consider. We are rapidly getting into the position here where the senator has said, `Look, I'm in charge of this legislation, but other ministers have the information. I simply do not know.' We cannot allow that to stand. I ask the parliamentary secretary if she is prepared—if she says Senator Hill has the information and she does not know—to get that information from Senator Hill and have it available to the committee before the day is out.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—This is a question of Senate process. I have already indicated that, as these questions have been placed on notice to Senator Hill, that is the avenue through which these questions will be answered.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—It certainly is a process that has gone off the rails in the hands of this inadequate government representative. We are dealing with this legislation and we are dealing with it now. Is Senator Troeth going to tell the committee that vital information for this debate will be supplied to the Senate after the debate is over? It is not a question of `if'—that is what she is saying. That is a deplorable way in which to treat Senate consideration. For those people listening, the question here is: how does the Senate work when a responsible representative of government who has carriage of this bill, who has advisers in the box, who has access to all the information of the government at her fingertips, says, `I'll give you the information after the debate is over.' That is simply a default on a responsibility so far as parliamentary process is concerned.
It is not satisfactory, and I will be asking this question again during the course of this debate. As Senator Troeth knows, we are not going to finish here today. She is indicating that we are not going to get this information 
 this afternoon because she is not going to ask for it. She is going to have overnight to ask for it and I will be back to it. It is not satisfactory to the majority of Australians, who expect representatives to be informed, to find that a ministerial representative comes here without information that is crucial to these questions and, moreover, says in an inherently defiant way to the committee, `I'm not going to supply this information until after the debate is over.' Whatever we might think about logging in Australia, that is a clear-felling of proper democratic process. It is deliberate obfuscation and it is unbecoming of a person charged with the responsibility to conduct an informed debate in this place.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—Senator Brown has misrepresented the case. I have not said that I will not supply the answers to his questions until the debate is over. I have already indicated that Senator Brown asked the questions and it is printed in the Notice Paper  that the questions were to Senator Hill. Therefore, Senator Hill is the minister responsible who will supply those answers, and that should be Senator Brown's expectation.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, you might care to rule on whether asking questions of Senator Hill in any way prevents the parliamentary secretary giving answers now. This debate is now. If the parliamentary secretary wants to put off the debate until Senator Hill provides the answers, I will be the first to support her, but I am not going to support a situation in which Senator Troeth says, `I'll give this committee'—not just me as the person who happens to be asking these questions but the committee—`fundamental information about the protection of forests in this country after this debate is over.' We have had too much of this in this debate. We have had too much withholding of information. We have had too much secrecy. These are the people's forests, and the people have a right to be informed about their fate. For a ministerial representative to say, `I'm not going to inform this parliament until the debate is over,' so that 
 the debate has to be effectively blinkered, is just reprehensible.
—Senator Brown, I am ready to rule on the subject. You are entitled to ask the questions even though the questions have been placed on notice. As to the manner in which the parliamentary secretary responds, that is her prerogative.
—Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. That leaves Senator Troeth totally exposed as being responsible. She has yet another chance here, after that ruling, to provide us with this information. A simple call to her ministerial colleague, if he has got the information, would be enough. What I do know is that that information is in the government's bailiwick; it has that information. It is, to say the least, a rude way to approach the debate in here to say, `I've got the information, but I'm not going to give it to the Senate chamber until after the debate is over.' I could say that means a vulnerability, that means that the government is not prepared to get into a fair dinkum and informed debate on this. That is pretty obvious. But I think it is worse than that. It is an affront to senators debating this issue if information which is available is denied in the course of the debate.
Senator Troeth or the government needs to look at democratic principle. As Ralph Nader said on a visit to this country many years ago—you might remember this, Mr Temporary Chairman Watson, because these words were uttered in Launceston—information is the currency of democracy. Here we have a democratic debate on behalf of the people on a matter that is of high public interest. The government has the information, but the government representative at the desk is saying, `Yes, but I'm not going to give it to you until after the debate is over.' That is a failure of responsibility, and it says that the government is not prepared to defend this untenable position—handing across Australia's forests for 20 years to the woodchip corporations—in light of the information that is available to it. People will have to judge that for themselves.
I have never struck this situation before in parliamentary debate. As far as I am concerned, it is a new low. I would not be making such an issue of this if this were not so important. Senator Troeth might think it is not important. It is to me, it is to the people who elected me, it is to my state and it is to many people employed in industries whose jobs depend on keeping those trees vertical, keeping those grand heritage trees there for people to enjoy into the future. For this deliberate withholding of information to come so early in this debate really shows that the government is being cavalier not only with the information but also with the interests of the people of this nation.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-25,"—I must echo the words of Senator Brown and concur that in a debate as important as this, where the government is arguing so strongly that its legislation is balanced and fair in both environmental and economic terms, it must be prepared to prove that when asked to do so in terms of simple questions. It does not matter to me that the answers to these questions might be difficult for the government. I feel that Senator Brown, having asked those questions, can rightfully expect answers, and I do not think that procrastination on this matter from a ministerial representative is acceptable.
—The question is that the amendment be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—I have not yet had the opportunity to comment on Senator Brown's amendment, which he moved before lunch.
—I'm waiting too.
—I do not believe that Senator Forshaw has either and I am sure—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—that we would not wish for either Senator Forshaw or me to lack the opportunity to put our remarks on record. Senator Brown did appear to become slightly distracted from the original thrust of his amendment.
This proposed amendment attempts to establish the JANIS criteria as the inflexible benchmark that all RFAs will have to meet. This is clearly—I would point out to Senator Brown—not contemplated by the JANIS report itself. At page 8 of that report the underlying principle in applying the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve criteria is clear. This is what it says:
To ensure that the nature conservation effort is focused on regional priorities, and not based solely on meeting criterion percentage targets, it is desirable that an overall regional assessment of forest conservation needs to be carried out. Flexibility in the application of reserve criteria is needed, in consideration of differing regional circumstances, to ensure that the CAR reserve system delivers optimal nature conservation outcomes as well as acceptable social and economic outcomes. Therefore the criteria described in section 6—that is, biodiversity, old-growth forest and wilderness criteria—are to be considered as guidelines rather than as mandatory targets.
The bill's definition of the CAR reserve system allows for that flexibility while the comments about the CAR reserve system—contained in page 5 of the explanatory memorandum to the bill—ensure that the principles concerning comprehensiveness, adequacy and representativeness—as detailed in the JANIS report—are consistently applied to all regions. Therefore the government strongly opposes this amendment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-25,"—The opposition is not prepared to support this amendment. In saying so I would indicate that what has just been put by the parliamentary secretary is a reasonable interpretation. Whilst we have some differences with the government on many of these issues, the facts are that the proposed amendment by Senator Brown is very inflexible. For instance, both the national forest policy statement of 1992 and the subsequent JANIS criteria that were developed out of that statement do not accept that all reserve systems would necessarily be dedicated. Senator Brown's proposal is that a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system in relation to an RFA means a dedicated reserve system. So, firstly, there is a problem there.
Secondly, as the parliamentary secretary alluded to, the terms `comprehensive, ad 
 equate and representative' are in fact defined by the national forest policy statement and are repeated in the JANIS criteria. Senator Brown's proposal would be a significant straitjacket, an inflexible restriction, on the approach to be adopted in applying those criteria during the course of developing an RFA.
We have to say that the government's own definition, on the face of it, is somewhat inadequate. A definition that merely refers to what can be found elsewhere in another document is often not the most illuminating way of writing definitions in legislation. This one says:
comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system, in relation to an RFA, has the same meaning as in the RFA.
Obviously, the layperson picking that up would say, `That is a bit circuitous. I have to go off elsewhere to find the appropriate meaning.' Whilst that is an inadequacy in the definition, the fact is—as we have said and as we have identified in our amendments—that these are principles and terms which are to be found throughout the national forest policy statement, which in turn is clearly understood by the parties. On that basis we will accept the definition as proposed by the government and we cannot support the proposition of Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—What a pity that Labor as well does not want a definition which means anything. In this case both Labor and the government have resorted to the word `flexibility'. You know what that means: as soon as a woodchip company jumps up and down about their wanting to knock down another bit of forest, the terms and definitions protecting rare and endangered species and great pieces of wild forest become flexible, and more of it goes west.
What about the flexibility the other way round? A little later in this bill, I think when we get to section 7, there is provision to cover the woodchip companies if they do not get what they want because a future federal minister in responding to public concern protects some forest. Is there flexibility for that? Not on your life. Then we get a com 
 pensation clause so that the taxpayers have to pay millions of dollars across to the woodchip company, which is aggrieved because it cannot knock down a forest because there is a rare and endangered species in it. There is no flexibility at all. That is the pathology of this legislation. It is all weighted to give this voracious industry what it wants over 20 years and the environment has to take a back seat, regardless of the feelings of the majority of people, not least those who live in these areas.
So I do not accept this flexibility from either side of the chamber when it is not honoured throughout. It is a flexibility against the environment, but there is no flexibility when it comes to the interests of the big woodchip corporations that, I note in passing, make major donations to the electoral coffers of the major political parties in this place, not without the intention of gaining influence.
I want to come back to the comment of the parliamentary secretary. Senator Troeth said that this legislation has to be flexible because of regional circumstances. Let me come back to the giant freshwater crayfish in regional north-west Tasmania—that is the only place where it is found. It is the largest freshwater crayfish on the face of the planet. It is an ancient animal. It is a stunning but very vulnerable animal, and its biggest threat is logging because logging cuts it off from its food source. That is the only region involved. Can Senator Troeth explain why there is no recovery plan, as would be required under national forest policy, to protect such species and why there is no plan to stop logging of its habitat? In fact, logging has accelerated.
And while the parliamentary secretary is getting advice, Mr Temporary Chairman McKiernan, I again draw your attention to this photograph of the Tarkine Wilderness aflame from end to end under so-called ecologically sustainable logging. I have now distributed this photograph around the chamber, and I seek leave to have it incorporated into Hansard with the label `Ecologically sustainable logging in the Tarkine Wilderness in Tasmania'.
Leave granted.
—Senator Brown, I am just checking on the matter of incorporation. We are not certain about the technicalities of incorporating photographs into Hansard , but that can be handled by the technicians.
[For technical reasons, the photograph was unable to be reproduced in Hansard]",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—With regard to Senator Brown's questions, that is a question for the Tasmanian government to undertake in its arrangements for its own RFA.
Senator Brown interjecting—
—Senator Brown, you have said several times in your comments that that is a matter to be handled by the state in its own arrangements with regard to the RFA. In my own state of Victoria I know very well the wide scope and the long-term nature of the consultations that went on about environmental and ecological sustainability. Anyone who had a view on that, as far as the eventual nature of the RFA, was encouraged to put that in the consultations that took place. I am satisfied that every element of that was taken into consideration with the framing of that RFA. Similarly, that is for the Tasmanian government to take into account when the final nature of the Tasmanian RFA is determined, or has been determined. It is not a matter for the Commonwealth to deal with. That is all I want to say with regard to that.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—That is quite wrong. This is national legislation that is to tie in agreements made between the state and Commonwealth authorities. Suddenly the government says, `Oh well, we've brought up the issue that we can't really look at species and tie down their protection through a specific definition that the Greens have come up with because, regionally, the circumstances might vary.' So I ask Senator Troeth, `What about the specific situation of a fantastic, endangered animal, the world's largest freshwater crayfish, in a regional area? How do you deal with that?' And immediately the government ducks and 
 says, `We don't deal with it at all; that is a state government responsibility.'
This legislation is to ensure, to write into law, the protection of rare and endangered species in this country—in forests, where half of them exist. That is why we need it to be specific, because the government manoeuvre here is to get rid of the federal power of intervention and to hand it back to the states. But it is saying that the quid pro quo is that we will write into this legislation, and into these regional forest agreements, absolute protection of rare and endangered species.
But what we have uncovered from the government itself, and from Senator Troeth herself, is that you can have no faith in that at all. First of all, a rubbery definition is required—unfortunately, Labor wants to support that—which has to be flexible; in other words, it can be altered down the line. Nothing is certain about that at all. And, secondly, we are to have faith in state governments as far as forests are concerned when the minister divests power back to the states—unfortunately, the Democrats supported legislation for this just six weeks ago—to intervene and protect heartland areas of Australia's forests, including rare and endangered species. What we are finding here is that, really, this is a handback to the states under flexible arrangements whereby the states can operate as they did in the bad old days in the 1970s, before federal law started to be introduced and built up to protect the nation's prime heritage.
Specifically, we have come to the point where the government has revealed that it does not give guarantees for rare and endangered species. All those people who took part in this process of evolving the regional forest agreements, who felt that this was going to give the balance that Senator Troeth talks about—assurance of the woodchip industry's interest on the one side, and assurance of the environment on the other—have been duped. When it comes to protecting rare and endangered species and intact forest ecosystems, suddenly we have to be flexible.
Senator Troeth interjecting—
—Senator Troeth shakes her head and says, `Yes, that is the case,' but 
 when it comes to the woodchip corporations there is no flexibility at all. Protect a tree in future, using federal powers and compensation. Taxpayers' money will be used to protect taxpayers' trees in the interests of the big corporations. It is two faced, it is duplicitous, it is not balanced, it is not fair, it is not publicly responsible, and it uses double standards.
I am not speculating. This is coming out of the mouth of the government representative herself to try to avoid a Greens amendment which says, `Let's be specific here. This is legislation for 20 years, not just for tomorrow. This is lock-down legislation with no comeback, because there will be no federal powers after this.' They do not want to put in a Greens' definition. Senator Troeth is right: I would protect what is left of our old-growth forests in this country.
At a library function at lunchtime I heard a brilliant dissertation from independent expert Judy Clarke on the plantation establishment in this country, which is there now—grown and ready to be cut—for all Australia's wood needs and job creation. The plantations are ignored in this process. It is honing in on our native forests, totally unnecessarily, in the interests of the big corporations, and it does not protect the environment. There is not only a breach of promise here; there is no promise at all.
Senator Troeth now uses the word `flexibility' when it comes to protecting the environment. In other words, `Leave it to the woodchip corporations.' That is the bottom line. That is not acceptable to the Australian community. It is totally unacceptable to the majority of Australians, who have had enough of that and who know that this can be a win-win situation—that the alternatives are there for the industry. But to these rare and endangered species down to their last habitats there is no alternative.
Let us look again at East Gippsland. I will go outside the questions that are on notice. My office tells me that Senator Troeth got the questions we are talking about two days ago. They did not go just to Senator Hill, as they have done in the past; they went to Senator Troeth herself. What has she done in the 
 meantime? Nothing. She is using the fact that the questions also went to Senator Hill to deliberately deny this debate the information that is essential for an intelligent outcome.
Earlier on I referred to the north-east forest snail in Tasmania. It is a huge orange-coloured snail with a big carapace on its back. It is on the endangered list. Senator Troeth might find that mirthful but I do not and nor do the locals, who are worried about its viability. It is a fascinating thing for tourists who go to that area, and it is a job creator, strangely enough. Mr Temporary Chairman McKiernan, you may have seen those cartoons which say, `The closer we get something to extinction, the greater the value.' That is one of the unfortunate equations in the circumstances we find ourselves on this planet at the end of this century.
Coming back to this snail, there has been huge publicity about it. It has been front-page news in the Examiner in Launceston, and elsewhere. It has motivated a lot of people. Local residents are involved to try to stop the bulldozers moving in on its endangered habitat. Can the parliamentary secretary assure this chamber that, under this flexible definition—we are talking about a very regional creature indeed—the protection of the remains of the habitat of those endangered species will be guaranteed?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—The RFA and each RFA for each region will provide the framework within which endangered species are to be protected, consistent with Commonwealth legislative protection. The Commonwealth will ensure that the state undertakes its responsibilities within the terms of the RFA. We are not aware of any breach of existing RFAs in relation to endangered species.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—Thank you. That has helped us to move along a little. The parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, has just said that the regional forest agreement in Tasmania will provide the framework for endangered species like the one I referred to. Could the parliamentary 
 secretary tell the chamber what that framework is?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—We do have a copy of the Tasmanian RFA, but I am not aware of the detail.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—I have a copy of the RFA and I am not aware of the detail either, because there is no plan in there for the protection of that species. It is just a handover to a state government. As far as this endangered species is concerned, Forestry Tasmania and the state government are about to change the rules. They are about to cut out the area that is inhabited by this endangered species which the loggers want and say that the loggers can have that and it will still be all okay. That is flexibility a la Senator Troeth, who obviously does not know the first thing about this species despite the repeated visits she has had to Tasmania in the capacity which is so important to this debate.
We know that some 3,500 hectares of crucial habitat for large owls in East Gippsland have been allocated to woodchipping. As far as the masked owl, the sooty owl and the powerful owl are concerned, can the minister say what the framework is for protection of these magnificent species in East Gippsland to ensure, in particular, their habitat, without which they will not survive?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—That will be laid out within the framework of the Gippsland RFA. Again, I repeat to Senator Brown: we are not aware of any breaches of that RFA insofar as the Commonwealth has responsibility. I suggest to him that, if he has particular concerns with the Tasmanian RFA that he has just detailed, that is something for him to take up with the Tasmanian government, which now has the responsibility for implementing that.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—What an appalling situation we are getting to here. The Commonwealth is divesting itself totally of its responsibility to protect rare and endangered species and their habitat and is saying, `Fall back on Jeff Kennett' or `Fall 
 back on Jim Bacon'—with their record on their environment? At the same time, it is asking us to move towards passing legislation here which further removes the power of the federal environment minister. So much of it was removed with the government and Democrat vote just six weeks ago. It is asking us to pass legislation which will further trammel that power to protect these species which are part of Australia's wildlife heritage.
But even so, Senator Troeth says to me, `This is now a matter for the Tasmanian government under the RFAs.' That is not so. If you look at the environmental impact assessment provision of the RFA in the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement and go to section 32 under `Threatened Species and Communities', it says:
Where threatened species are listed under the Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 (Tas.) and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992—
a Commonwealth piece of legislation—
any new or revised Recovery Plans will be jointly prepared and funded and implemented cooperatively by the Parties to meet the requirements of both Acts.
So the framework here, we discover, is not a state responsibility. The minister did not know that. Maybe she should go back to her advisers and find out what the facts are, because in effect the Senate has just been misled by Senator Troeth. Section 33 says:
The Parties will seek to improve outcomes of Recovery Plans for species listed under either the Threatened Species Protection Act . . . or . . . Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 . . . by developing multiple species Recovery Plans where appropriate.
The parliamentary secretary says that the RFA in Tasmania will provide the framework for endangered species. Wrong. It does provide for that, but it requires action—and I am talking about a Regional Forest Agreement that was signed by Prime Minister Howard and the Tasmanian government two years back.
Here we have the opportunity for the Senate—and therefore the people of Australia—to be informed about the necessary protection of rare and endangered species. These species—magnificent mammals, birds and fish—are in Western Australia's forests. 
 They are also in south-east Queensland, and right up both sides of the Great Divide in New South Wales and in East Gippsland. The parliamentary secretary gave information a while ago that it was a state matter. Has she been advised that in fact it is not, that it is a Commonwealth responsibility? Having said that there is a framework for endangered species that applies in East Gippsland and Tasmania, can she tell us what the framework is that her government has been developing with state governments?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—Of course there is a joint responsibility. When the Commonwealth and the states sign the RFA agreement, that joint responsibility is undertaken by both of them. Senator Brown seems to be deliberately misunderstanding what I am trying to tell him. Each of these RFAs is developed with a regional focus and a regional framework to take account of regional differences.
The Commonwealth responsibility, as a co-signatory to that agreement, still remains. Obviously, if there has been a breach of that agreement, in not looking after the areas which are specifically designated in that agreement, that would need to be brought forward in a formal way. I am not aware, as I stand in this chamber, of any formal notification that has been issued of any breaches of any of those agreements that we have spoken about. Of course, the Commonwealth will play its role in the furtherance of any notification of breaches of those agreements if and when they occur. To the best of my knowledge, no notification has been lodged. That is the situation as it stands at the moment.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—We are talking here about rare and endangered species of Australia's animals, birds and forests, and the parliamentary secretary is saying that action will take place when notification of a breach of an agreement has taken place. That is not what I am talking about. I am talking about the government spokesperson's earlier assurance that this legislation had in place the framework for protecting these species in the first place. I 
 am not talking about breaches down the line. I want to know about the plan to protect these species now.
What I am saying is that they are not going to be protected under this double standard legislation, and there is a clear case for it in north-east Tasmania, where endangered species are now having their territory carved and reassessed under state legislation and diminished so that the loggers can get a part of it—a vital part of it at that. The Commonwealth has role to see that does not happen. But Senator Troeth appears not to know about the endangered species, not to know about the case that is involved, not able to give details of the framework that she talks about, and not able to give any indication that the Commonwealth is involved at all, let alone that it is standing by its responsibility.
I am pushing this specific case because here we are getting a glimmer of the double standards—the flexibility that the parliamentary secretary talks about—which are going to leave the woodchip industry as arbiter through this legislation when the powers are handed away by the Commonwealth, and I cannot allow that to pass lightly. I cannot allow that to pass lightly because we are dealing here with the time-honoured forest heritage and the wildlife of this nation—half the species of which are in the forests targeted by this legislation. As I said earlier, the government wants to throw away its responsibility for those forests and species and give them to the woodchip corporations—and under a double standard where there is no guarantee that the habitat of these species will be protected. But when it comes to the woodchip industry's interests, if you so much as protect a tree in the future through Commonwealth action, they get the compensation. The taxpayers lose again; remembering, of course, that the taxpayers are the owners of these forests.
This brings me to the issue of an indigenous interest in these rare and endangered forests. I had a call from the Deloraine Aboriginal community at the end of last week, and people there told me with some anxiety that they had just learned that a new area of forest is to be cut down on the slopes of 
 Quamby Bluff, which is part of an area of enormous indigenous significance, in what is called the Great Western Tiers in post-invasion times in Tasmania. My understanding at the start of this week was that the indigenous people who had not been informed about what was going to happen to their forests were seeking a meeting with Forestry Tasmania in the immediate lead-up to the bulldozers moving in.
I ask Senator Troeth, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman: is this standard? When forests in indigenous communities are targeted by the big woodchip corporations—which are centred in the cities, not out in the bush—and by Forestry Tasmania and CALM in Western Australia, where is the guarantee in this legislation that these communities will be involved? Where is the guarantee that these communities, which do care about rare and endangered species and which have had to live through the destruction of habitats which has led so many species towards extinction, will be involved—if not on that matter, then on any matter at all as far as the future of forests in this country is concerned? Why isn't their interest written into this legislation as at least a brake on the future destruction of forests as the Commonwealth moves through this legislation to divest itself of any responsibility for what happens in the next 20 years?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—I think that Senator Brown has obviously not taken any notice of what I have been saying with regard to rare and endangered species. I have said that there can be clauses written into each separate regional RFA to deal with any threatened extinction or threatened endangering of rare species. But I would like to place some facts on the record, in comparison to some of the myths that Senator Brown is tending to perpetuate. I will quote from two letters written to the Hobart Mercury  newspaper in Tasmania on Tuesday, 16 March 1999. One letter is from Mr Simon Orr, who is a senior planner in forest management in Forestry Tasmania. With regard to the rare giant freshwater crayfish, Mr Orr says:
The reports about the rarity perpetuate a furphy. This crayfish inhabits almost all watercourses emptying into Bass Strait, as well as others such as the Arthur River. There are many thousands of this species in existence. A recovery plan—
for your information, Senator Brown—
is being developed for this species as an outcome of the RFA.
I hope that answers your question on that. I might add that Mr Orr has also said, as the final paragraph of his letter:
One only wonders at the motivation of those who perpetuate misinformation about this species to the media and the public.
The second letter I would like to quote from comes from the same issue of the same newspaper, and it is a letter from Mr Kevin J. Bonham, from the Centre for Environmental Studies at the University of Tasmania in Hobart. He says:
I am astonished that green groups are claiming that the north-east forest snail is threatened by logging in the Cascade forests. Had they read my report on this snail, a public document based on a two month study, they would know it is neither rare nor threatened.
He goes on:
It is relatively common and very widespread. This snail is nowhere near qualifying for threatened status and should be de-listed so that conservation resources and attention can go to species that need it.
I am particularly interested in his last paragraph, where he says:
Unfortunately, greens seem more interested in excuses to block logging than the facts, and are running an ignorant public campaign against the snail's de-listing, in a shabby attempt to pervert the assessment process.
I put that on the public record.
In regard to the involvement of indigenous groups in the consultative process, every community in Australia cares about rare and endangered species. In the consultation process that I mentioned, with every RFA that now exists and for the ones that are yet to come, every community has the opportunity to contribute to public debate on and the public assessment of this process. In that way, every community group is contacted, every community group has an opportunity to voice 
 its concern and then, and only then, is the RFA drawn up to cater for those concerns.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—The parliamentary secretary gets into deeper and deeper water because she does not know about this issue. First of all, let me refer again to the letter from Mr Bonham. One thing that was not stated in that letter was that he was employed by Forestry Tasmania to do that study. However, he gives the game away by saying that this species should be de-listed. He is employed by the agent of the loggers and says that this species should be de-listed. I ask Senator Troeth: why was it listed in the first place? It was listed in the first place because scientists working in the field believed—and they still believe—that it is threatened with extinction and that the logging is certainly not going to diminish that threat. You do not have to be a scientist to recognise that that is the case.
What is happening in Tasmania—and this is a very good example—is that the loggers, post signing of the regional forest agreement which is supposed to protect the environment, now want the area which is the habitat of this species. So Forestry Tasmania gets in a consultant who says, `Let's change the boundaries.' If Mr Bonham were a scientist in the full sense of the word, he would not be resorting to calling ignorant those with a different opinion, let alone those in the scientific community who have a different point of view.
The same applies to the earlier reference. A major endangered species is being taken closer to extinction because the logging industry wants flexibility—it wants the habitat of that species. Some corridors, bits and pieces and rocky outcrops will be left. When a complaint comes in further down the line—as Senator Troeth says is now the public's responsibility—it may, as often happens, be too late. As far as Astacopis gouldi—the giant freshwater crayfish, the biggest crayfish in the world—is concerned, two years after the signing of the regional forest agreement, in the north-west of Tasmania logging is a major threat to the survival of this species and there is no recovery plan. When are we going to 
 have it? Will it be 10 years? Will it be 20 years?
In the meantime, logging roads are being driven deeper into the Tarkine and into the river catchments elsewhere in north-west Tasmania. As I said earlier, the process is to cut the forests and then firebomb them with incendiaries dropped from helicopters to kill rainforest species so that nothing is left alive—nothing with fur, feathers or leaves. Then, at the end of its process of so-called ecologically sustainable logging, the woodchippers' agents come in with 1080 poison to get any creatures that stray onto the genetically modified, fast growing crops which replace the ancient ecosystem.
The lie is that this is ecologically sustainable logging. As far as this endangered, world famous freshwater crayfish is concerned, this legislation and the regional forest agreement open up the forests of the Tarkine and elsewhere to roading and logging in the headwaters of the stronghold of this species, with consequent erosion and mud siltation which cuts off the food supply. Senator Troeth is no different from a freshwater crayfish when it comes to depending on a food supply—and no imputation is meant either way. It is an appalling situation. I am not talking about some pre-existing situation. I am talking about the outcome of a regional forest agreement. We bring here a definition which locks down the requirement to protect these species—the outcome of the national forest policy—and the government and Labor as well, for goodness sake, say, `We will not support it. We want flexibility for the woodchippers.'
Let me come back to a specific question which I asked earlier. I told the members of the Deloraine community that I would ask this question in the Senate. Now that the parliamentary secretary has had time to consider it, I would like her to tell the chamber what the immediate logging plans on Quamby Bluff are, what the impact on its forest ecosystems will be, and what reassurance she can give the chamber that there will not be a recurrence of this situation where logging becomes imminent without the local indigenous community being informed.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—As Senator Brown would be well aware, I do not have access to that information.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—It appears that the parliamentary secretary does not have access to any information and, where she has got it—we have heard this in committee this afternoon, Mr Temporary Chairman, and I am sure you have had an ear glued to it—she will not give it. I have never seen the situation in this place before where the government could get the information and it has not. A phone call would get the information about the indigenous community. I will come back to it tomorrow and I expect the parliamentary secretary to know. The parliamentary secretary talks about grassroots communities in regional Australia—here is one which has a right to know what is happening in their neighbourhood when the interstate based woodchip corporations move in. It is simply unsatisfactory that, in this important debate, the government says, `We don't know' or, even where it does know, it says, `We're not going to tell the Senate.'
Earlier, I referred to the situation in East Gippsland, where the state's emblem, Leadbeater's possum—we have all seen that magnificent, cute little animal of which I think even Jeff Kennett would be proud—is facing extinction because it has a very limited habitat. Through the regional forest agreement, its habitat is now under threat. This is an extraordinary circumstance where, even with the state's emblem, the federal government wants to tie its hands behind its back.
We have not got the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  through yet. I ask the parliamentary secretary: what effort has been made, what plan has been put into place under the Central Highlands Regional Forest Agreement, signed a long time ago, to protect the Leadbeater's possum from the high intensity burns which are going to be part of logging and woodchipping in that region, with, of course, death and destruction to everything in its way, and to salvage logging which is occurring in the critical habitat? Can the parliamentary secretary say why the recom 
 mendation of Dr David Lindenmayer, the expert in this field—we are supposed to be dealing with science here—which would have reduced the cut in the region by 15 per cent, has not been taken up?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—If Senator Brown requires detailed information about RFAs, we will be happy to make that information available as and when it becomes available.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—I do require it. I require it now for this debate, and so does the rest of the chamber. I am a representative in here. The people would want this debate to be based on information. Senator Troeth knows that and the government knows that. What we have heard this afternoon is a farrago of blocking and refusal to produce information or even to attempt to get it. We have even heard this representative say that where information is available she is not going to produce it for us.
Let me analyse what is happening here. I will go back again because it is very important to understand the dynamics which led to a government, which is supposed to govern for all of us, turning its back on the wishes of the majority of the people of Australia as far as wild forests are concerned when there is an alternative of a plantation based industry for our jobs right now, in 1999, and for all the wood needs of this nation in the future.
I want to highlight that this government is in the business of trying to deny the Australian people the rationale for handing across to the woodchip corporations the effective control of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of hectares of what is left of our native forests in this country over the next 20 years. The thing that has Western Australia on the boil at the moment is the imminent loss of magnificent remnants of forest and the species that live in them. This representative may not care. Except for two members, the government benches are empty as we are having this debate. The government may not care but the people out there do.
At lunch time, I was talking about this with a scientist. We strayed from science and said, 
 `What is it that bonds people to forests? Why do people become activated about them?' The reason is that we are creatures of the forests ourselves. We are derived from this wild planet. Our ancestry is there. We have a relationship with it. It is in our creation, in our genetic structure, whatever it is. That is why when you ask school kiddies, `What is it that you like to watch on television?' they so often say, `Nature programs.' That is why Senator Troeth, like me, puts pictures of wilderness on the wall, not pictures of chainsaws and bulldozers.
I cannot understand why this government is not responding to that public concern and growing alarm at this end of the century when so little of this forest resource is left. It is inspiring, it is beautiful, it fires the imagination and makes people feel good. I know, as a doctor, that it is a much better entity to have than a dozen tranquilliser factories.
That natural equation, because it is not quantified, is left out of this. There are people sitting in board rooms in Bunnings in Perth, in North Forest Products down there in St Kilda Road and in Daishowa in Tokyo who, when they see forests, think dollars. They have money in mind. Sure, they have pictures of forests on the wall, but these are somebody else's forests. So they are happy to get stuck into them, and the last thing they want to hear is that there is an alternative to this ongoing slaughter through the plantation base that is already in Australia. That is what we should be dealing with—the translocation of this industry into the inevitable future, which is the plantation based future.
We saw what happened in 1994 before the big loggers blockaded this parliament. So many of those people are now out of work because the woodchip industry has dispensed with them. The politicians, at the behest of the woodchip corporations which were behind that, went to water. If you look at the record, a fortnight before that an interesting phenomenon occurred. The government at the time was a Labor government. After a huge public outcry about the imminent distribution of more woodchip licences to these big corporations, on 21 December—I think it was—the then minister handed those corporations their 
 licences. People did not want it, but the woodchip corporations did.
In the last six months it has been uncovered that, on that very day, three of those big woodchip corporations wrote out massive cheques to the big political parties in this parliament. It is a corrupt process. It is wrong, and it comes out of secrecy and behind-doors negotiations. I am embarrassed to be in this chamber when a government representative gets up and says, `I am not only not going to supply information, I am also not going to give it to you where I've got it.' A simple phone call to the minister for the environment would have obtained that information. Instead we were told, `I am going to deny this chamber that information.'
I am dwelling on this because this whole system is rotten to the core. It is corrupt. I reiterate what Ralph Nader, amongst others, has said—that information is the currency of democracy. When governments say not only that they do not have information on much of this but also that they are not going to give it to you where they do have it—that is a flagrant violation of that principle. It is not just political opponents who have a right to get their noses out of joint over that, it is people as a whole. It is an alarming thing to hear in a debate like this. I again ask the minister: is there some way in which that plan by Dr Lindenmayer to protect the Leadbeater's possum can be invoked under this system, so that Victoria's faunal emblem is not pushed a step closer to extinction by the burning of those forests and the salvage of so-called leftover logs in the region—part of the habitat of that species?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—As I have indicated before, if and when that information becomes available, we will pass it on to Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-08-25,"—I indicate clearly and strongly that the Democrats support this amendment by Senator Brown, quite simply, because it is sensible and appropriate. In his amendment he speaks of the essential nature of having biodiversity criteria in relation to regional forestry agree 
 ments. That makes great sense to me. I know from my own experience during a recent trip to the south-west forests of Western Australia, where I visited both the Manjimup and Pemberton areas, that the great concern there amongst a great many people, including locals in the area, is about the extinction rate of the numbat and the chuditch or native cat, as it is sometimes referred to—the Latin is Dasyurus geoffroii —to the extent that the head of the Small Business Association in Perth, Western Australia, is arguing very forcefully on behalf of his constituency for an end to logging in old-growth forests because of the way in which it benefits business.
 Time and again yesterday and today we have heard that it is the timber workers who have the most to gain from continued logging in old-growth forests. Yet the evidence is very much to the contrary. It is the preservation of these important natural historical areas that attract the most people in terms of tourism, ecotourism and the service industry which supports that. Senator Brown went on to talk about having old-growth forest criteria and also wilderness criteria within the RFA. I sew that into what I said earlier and, again, argue that the future of the forests, if we are really serious about the preservation of the forests and jobs, lies in the preservation and protection of those forests and not in their continued destruction.
The timber industry, or rather logging as such, is not an industry as I see it but an obscenity. The challenge we have before us now is to have a serious and considered debate about the real prospects that exist for plantation timbers and removing ourselves once and for all from the destruction of our native forests. It is not just Senator Brown or the Democrats who are arguing that but overwhelming numbers in the general community. Nowhere is that more clear than in Western Australia, where polls show consistently that 80 per cent and increasingly greater numbers of people are saying, `Enough! No more.' To that end, Senator Brown's motion has the full support of the Australian Democrats.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—I do not want to leave a couple of questions 
 without having assurances from Senator Troeth on behalf of the government. I come back to the Aboriginal concerns. There is an immediate one—in Quamby Bluff, near Deloraine in Tasmania. People are very alarmed that there is going to be logging, including clear-fell logging, on land that is very important to them. I ask the parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, who clearly does not know anything about this, whether she will find out and give the chamber an assurance that the Aboriginal community in Deloraine will be consulted before that logging proceeds and that the concerns they have about that logging will be taken into account and acted upon. While the minister is getting information on that last question, I again ask about the reserve situation in Tasmania.

Can Senator Troeth say what is the extent of the areas in Tasmania of these so-called reserves we have heard so much about that is subject to potential mining?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-25,"—We are going to get a reversal of role. I will get that information and inform the chamber. I do not want to press the government repre 
 sentative any more. She is making an art form of not giving information, even where it is apparently on the public record. So I will find that out and I will give it to Senator Troeth before the debate is through, in a part of the process of trying to inform her about this portfolio for which she has responsibility.
A moment ago Senator Troeth dismissed a very important question which I had about the Quamby Bluff issue. My office and I, directly, had calls last week about the imminent logging on this bluff, which, for your information, is an outstanding part of the backdrop of scenic northern Tasmania, probably snow-capped at the moment. The integrity of the forest below the dolerite cap on that bluff is very important for the scenic amenity of Deloraine, Meander, Jackeys Marsh, Golden Valley and so on.
The government member at the table said that this issue would be determined `at a local level'. Can she tell us what that means? Here is the federal government saying, `We don't know. We have no responsibility.' This is the government that assures Australians that the RFA process is going to create protection for special parts of the environmental amenity. Does it mean the state government is going to determine it? Does it mean Forestry Tasmania, with their appalling record of destruction, is going to determine it? Is the forestry office in Deloraine going to determine it? Or is it going to be left to the local woodchip contractor to determine the fate of the interests of the indigenous people on Quamby Bluff? Let us have a little bit of specificity about this, if the minister does not want responsibility.
There are people alarmed about this down there. This is not just something that is being invented. It is part of the process of logging which is alarming communities right around the country. But here there is an indigenous community that feels it is being left out. Its rights are being trodden on. It is not being informed and the parliamentary secretary says, `Oh well, that will be determined at a local level.' That is not good enough. I will not accept it. I would expect that Senator Troeth is able to tell this chamber, and therefore reassure those people, that they are going to be consulted, that there will not be logging 
 until their interests have been heard, let alone addressed, and that they can be reassured that they are not going to lose out. Because they are being denied information, like this chamber is by Senator Troeth tonight.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-08-25,"—Earlier in my remarks on this amendment, I spoke about flexibility. That is the whole point of the framework that this Commonwealth legislation provides: that each RFA can then determine at the local level—which is what I thought Senator Brown would be most concerned about—the level of detail and the specific arrangements that are to be made for each community. He is extending this argument far beyond its logical extreme. I would point out to him that any arrangements in Quamby Bluff—which is obviously better known to him than it is to me—will be determined by the local community at the local community level.
I am sorry if he does not accept that and that he wants the Commonwealth to put a totally inflexible framework around it, which is what he is advocating in this amendment which we have spent so long in debating. The fact is that each RFA will be taking into account local conditions at the local level. His local community in Quamby Bluff should be satisfied with that: that this government is making arrangements to do exactly that.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This review was prepared by Peter Ford, First Assistant Secretary, Information and Security Law Division, Attorney-General's Department. It deals with the next stage in the issue of interception. Interception is an issue that this parliament has been dealing with for 20 years now and it has, over that time, sought to establish the proper balance between what is a legitimate intrusion into people's privacy in the attempt to gather intelligence for policing purposes against the right that we all have to carry out our lives in privacy.
It is a big issue, and it is an issue that we ought to take on board. The issue of interception is founded principally on the precept that people's telephones should be kept free of tapping and that people should be able to carry on conversation, to be intimate and to discuss issues without other people intruding. But, because of the law enforcement obligations that we have, we as a parliament have allowed certain organisations to intercept telephones, mainly for the purposes of gathering intelligence for the proper putting down of criminal acts or possible criminal acts.
This report follows a number of other reports and it makes some suggestions about how this parliament should allow further telephone tapping or, I suppose, further communication tapping and what protections ought to be accorded to people who want to use the phones. A number of recommendations are made. Recommendation 9 says:
The issue of resourcing the agency coordinator function should be considered following the conclusion of the review being conducted under the Telecommunications Act.
That deals with the resources that should be available. The last recommendation, recommendation 12, says:
Section 55(2) of the Interception Act should be amended to remove the need for Australian Federal Police involvement in interceptions at a PABX switch.
That is something that I would be against. The idea of having the Australian Federal Police there is to indicate that this is a Commonwealth activity, that this is a Commonwealth power that has been exercised—the power to intercept a communication—and that the Commonwealth should have responsibility to some extent for doing that, and that is right. If we are going to allow an intrusion into people's privacy then we as a federal body ought to take responsibility, which we do through the Australian Federal Police. That was a very big principle when a lot of this legislation was developed, and it should be a principle that remains.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-08-25,"—The Meander River system in Tasmania's north feeds a large number of rural properties, the towns of Deloraine and Hadspen, the Trevally Dam and power station and the beautiful Cataract Gorge and ultimately exhausts into the Tamar River saltwater estuary near Launceston. For many years, local residents in the Meander Dam Action Group have vocally championed the potential of this river for water storage purposes. The building of the 43,000-megalitre Warners Creek Dam, upstream from Deloraine, has been mooted many times over the past two decades. It is now time to push harder than ever before to see this wonderful vision taken through to reality.
The area has a history of drought with resulting productivity losses for farmers and the ramifications multiplied in opportunity cost to the rest of the community. The state of Tasmania has a high level of rainfall, but in many areas the distribution is outside the main production season, and this must be corrected. The voluminous flow of fresh water out to the sea over the winter months must be stemmed for ultimate use during the growing and harvesting months of spring and summer.
The benefits of the Warners Creek Dam to the whole community and to the state, I believe, are absolutely enormous. They include: the improved environmental flow of the Meander River; the elimination of discolouration and improved health of the river; the ability of the agricultural industry to feed off the dam; and a boost to employment during 
 the construction stage and from the resulting higher productivity as a result of irrigation. There is also increased tourism potential, the opportunity for environmental friendly electricity generation, recreation and fishing opportunities and a clean and pure town water supply for Deloraine, Hadspen and sections of the city of Launceston where growing areas ensure a bigger demand for water.
Water storage is a critical issue for the development of Tasmania's rural industries and in turn the creation of wealth and jobs. Without increasing the availability to farmers of access to reliable water storage, our rural industry will continue to be at the mercy of droughts and dry spells, leading to fluctuating production, hardship for the farmers and the community and a loss of confidence.
The 1998 year is a case in point where the effects of El Nino were particularly evident. Significantly reducing major fluctuations in production of our rural products is an important consideration for both domestic and export markets. Reliability—the ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately—is the key to obtaining and maintaining all markets for our excellent quality produce. Tasmania relies significantly on its rural production and resultant downstream processing to create both wealth and employment. Stability of and improvement in the area's water supply during the summer months is one of the most important steps the community can take in ensuring real long-term economic and employment gains.
I refer to a report undertaken two years ago by the University of Tasmania which estimated that the Deloraine area produced 14 to 15 per cent of the state's overall milk production and 15 per cent of the state's agricultural production. If, as a result of a strategic water storage policy, the Deloraine area was to increase agricultural production by 20 per cent, then the rural industry as a whole could create 480 full-time and part-time jobs statewide and community wages could rise by $2.25 million statewide.
The potential for new, high value agricultural production is perhaps the dam's most critical short-term immediate gain. The environmental effects are just as important. Flood 
 ing during the heavy rainfall months of winter means that land is frequently out of use for seeding and planting. Therefore, the land suffers reduced utilisation in the flood zone. Physical damage occurs and soil is lost through erosion. The cost of maintaining fences is high and stock losses and stock stress frequently occur. Recreation facilities are also flooded, homes are spoiled from invading water and businesses suffer reduced takings because they are inaccessible.
Major works have been undertaken to prepare the site for construction of the Warners Creek Dam. I have been there and seen that. Successive governments have promised funding. Unfortunately, none have delivered. With the input of approximately $14 million in funding, construction can begin and ultimately enrich the Deloraine region and Tasmania's reputation as a reliable, quality producer of agricultural products.
Tasmania is also suffering an energy shortage. If we are to attract investment to our state, we must cater for increased energy demand. With construction of the Warners Creek Dam, I believe the opportunity is there. It is a valuable add-on opportunity. The electricity industry in Tasmania is run and managed by the wholly state-owned Hydro Electricity Commission through its various agencies. The significant difference in Tasmania's electricity industry from those of the mainland states is that 99 per cent of Tasmania's electricity is provided by hydro-electric power, a renewable energy resource.
The Commonwealth has provided a financial incentive for the development of commercial renewable electricity generating capacity. As the greenhouse gas issue becomes globally important, the construction of the Warners Creek Dam would be a perfect place to commence increasing Tasmania's energy capacity. Perhaps the `no dams' campaign has run its course. I certainly hope so. Maybe it is now appropriate, for a host of good reasons, for Tasmania to build a number of mini-hydro stations, adding quite a few to the existing network.
In order to survive, Tasmania must shed its so-called `no development' or `green disease'. To move the state from being an economic 
 backwater, projects such as the Warners Creek Dam, which holds so much promise, must be constructed. I urge the Tasmanian government and all others to do all that is possible to financially assist in this project.
As a senator from Tasmania—just as you are, Mr Acting Deputy President Sherry—I advise the Senate that I am actively promoting the dam's potential to my federal colleagues so that ultimately, with local, state and federal government cooperation, the Warners Creek Dam in the north of Tasmania can eventually become a reality.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Warners Creek Dam</title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech
