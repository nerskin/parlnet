"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2003-10-13,"—I spoke on Thursday about the fact that the Prime Minister's proposal is an assault not only on our Senate but also on the Australian democracy—the Senate being the strongest brake that our country has on the absolute power of an executive government. We have, and we continue to see, a Prime Minister with 43 per cent of the vote in the last election wanting 100 per cent of the power when it comes to setting the legislation that becomes the law of this country. The point that I was up to was for the Australian Greens to give a word of warning to the Australian Labor Party in relation to this particular debate.
If the Labor Party believe that they will be advantaged as much by this legislation as the coalition at a point when the Australian Labor Party may be in government then they have been hoodwinked. The reason for this is that in the joint sittings of parliament that would have occurred after a 1990 or a 1993 election the Australian Labor Party would not have had a majority. Meanwhile, the Howard government would have had a comfortable majority in all joint sittings throughout the time in which Mr Howard has been the Prime Minister. This pattern is likely to continue into the future, with the Australian Greens or other minor parties winning at least one Senate seat in each state, the Australian Labor Party winning two and the coalition winning three at ordinary half Senate elections. Clearly in the future this legislation is set to advantage the coalition far greater than the Australian Labor Party.
Another word of warning needs to be issued on the conflict around the Senate's power to block supply. It has been suggested—and mostly by the Australian Labor Party—that, as well as allowing a joint sitting of parliament to occur without a double dissolution election, the Senate should not be able to block any budget or budget related bills. This raises the obvious question of what is a budget or budget related bill. To date we have seen no explanation put forward by the advocates for that position. Almost every bill in the parliament and in the Senate is about the spending or collecting of money. The government could easily ensure that all legislation falls into that category. In fact, if the government of the day—whatever colour they were—knew they could get their legislation through without any debate, without any amendment and without any capacity to block, then surely that is what we would see. In fact the drive to put all legislation into a money bill is exactly the same drive that is pushing this proposal by the Prime Minister to be able to get legislation through without any scrutiny, without any check and without any review.
I would like to give an example that Senator Ray used in the chamber when speaking on this issue in June of this year. In a question that he asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate, he suggested that a bill to privatise Telstra would be a budget bill but, for example, the ASIO legislation that passed the Senate earlier this year would not be a budget bill. It would be very easy for the government to make the ASIO legislation into a budget or budget related bill by simply bringing into the legislation the increased spending that would come about because of the increased power given to ASIO in that legislation. These issues have been further elaborated on in a letter from the Clerk of Senate, Harry Evans, in which he states: 
Unless there is some clear and judicially enforceable distinction between `budget and budget related' bills and other bills, which has not yet been revealed, Senator Ray's proposal would effectively be no different from that of Mr Howard: the government would have power to pass any laws virtually by decree.
At this point I will seek leave to incorporate that letter from the Clerk of the Senate which was circulated to whips last week.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
17 June 2003

CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Senator Brown
Proposed constitutional alteration
Senator Ray's suggestions
You asked for a note on the proposed scheme of constitutional alteration in relation to the powers of the Senate advanced by Senator Ray in debate in the Senate yesterday as an alternative to Mr Howard's proposal. 
Mr Howard's proposal is that, whenever the Senate fails to pass government legislation, the government should be able to hold a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament to pass that legislation. 
The flaw in this proposal has been readily identified: it would allow the government (except in the unusual circumstances of a government majority of only one or two seats in the House of Representatives) to pass any and all legislation without regard to the Senate. With this power, a government could pass legislation designed to avoid scrutiny of its actions and to perpetuate itself in power, for example, by altering the electoral law.
Senator Ray asked in the Senate yesterday how, under Mr Howard's proposal, a government could be prevented from dismantling accountability mechanisms, for example, by effectively abolishing the office of Auditor-General as was done by Premier Kennett in Victoria, effectively abolishing freedom of information legislation, and tampering with the electoral law. Senator Ray's proposal is that “budget and budget related” bills should be able to be passed by something like Mr Howard's proposed mechanism, but that other legislation would still require the consent of the Senate. The specific example given by Senator Ray is that the bill to privatise Telstra would be a “budget or budget related” bill, whereas the government's ASIO bill would not. 
The unanswered question posed by Senator Ray's proposal is: what are “budget and budget related” bills? Senator Ray has not put forward a definition. He says that the category would go beyond “supply” bills. Judging by the examples he has given, his category of bills would include those which appropriate money or which raise revenue. It is not clear whether all bills which appropriate or raise money would fall into the category, or only bills which appropriate or raise significant amounts of money, or only bills which are announced as part of the government's budget.
The problem with this is that many bills appropriate money or raise revenue, and the government could easily ensure that all of its legislation fell into this category. Any bill could be announced as part of the government's budget. Any bill could include appropriation provisions or revenue-raising provisions. To take the examples mentioned by Senator Ray, a bill effectively dismantling the office of Auditor-General could appropriate a large sum of money for contract auditing for departments and agencies. A bill to dismantle the freedom of information legislation could contain appropriations to allow departments and agencies supposedly to upgrade access to their files and administer their own freedom of information applications on a decentralised basis. A bill to change the electoral law could be accompanied by a restructuring of the Electoral Office with appropriations for that purpose. The government's ASIO bill could easily have contained special additional appropriations for security. All of these bills would then be “budget or budget related” bills, and could then be passed by the proposed mechanism for eliminating the Senate from the legislative equation. 
Presumably a provision distinguishing between “budget and budget related” bills and other bills, inserted into the Constitution, would be justiciable. If it were not, the government could ignore the distinction in any event. If it were justiciable, the validity of bills passed at a joint sitting would depend on whether the constitutional distinction between categories of bills had been observed. Unless the distinction could be very clear, this would be a very fertile field for litigation. Every bill passed at a joint sitting could be challenged in the High Court on the basis that it was not a “budget or budget related” bill. The likelihood is that the High Court would give up attempting to determine such a political question, and would defer to the government's prescription, so that every bill declared by the government to be a budget bill would be held to be a budget bill.
Unless there is some clear and judicially enforceable distinction between “budget and budget related” bills and other bills, which has not yet been revealed, Senator Ray's proposal would effectively be no different from that of Mr Howard: the government would have power to pass any laws virtually by decree.
Reference was made in the debate yesterday to the other scrutiny functions of the Senate, for example, through the estimates hearings. I suggest that, if the Constitution were altered to allow the government to pass any laws without the consent of the Senate, the Senate's scrutiny activities would not last long. The government could simply pass a law establishing a system of statutory joint committees (controlled by the government) and then announce that, for reasons of efficiency, it would no longer cooperate with any separate Senate committees.
Opportunity should be taken to refer to a point made by Senator Hill in his speech yesterday. He said that the kinds of abuses mentioned by Senator Ray did not occur in periods when there were government majorities in the Senate. Over the past 50 years, only two governments have had party majorities in the Senate, the Menzies government from 1951 to 1956 and from 1959 to 1962, and the Fraser government from 1976 to 1981. During those periods, there were government backbenchers in the Senate who were famous for their willingness to vote against their government when it attempted any assaults on the Senate or accountability. When the Fraser government proposed a Constitution alteration in 1977 to alter the term of the Senate, nine government senators voted against the proposal and succeeded in having it defeated at the referendum. The Coalition's control over its senators was then relatively weak. Since those times, it appears that all governments have controlled their Senate backbenchers to the same extent as their House of Representatives members.
Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance in relation to this matter.
Yours sincerely

—I also take this opportunity to acknowledge that in the President's gallery sits a range of Greens MPs, all of whom have been elected on a system of proportional representation in New Zealand, in the ACT, in New South Wales, in Tasmania and in Western Australia. As the Prime Minister noted in his document that was tabled in the parliament last week, it is proportional representation that allows a diversity of voices to be represented in our parliament.
I think it is pertinent that today, whilst we debate the Senate proposal put forward by the Howard government, we have in the President's gallery six representatives from the Greens in New Zealand, where an electoral reform campaign has taken place over and beyond the last decade to bring in a system of mixed-member proportional elections, whereby the members who sit in the house are elected on the basis of proportional representation. The campaign in New Zealand came about not because of the will of either of the two major parties in the parliament of New Zealand but because, once the debate was allowed to occur in the community, people were able to recognise the inherent flaws that existed in the electoral system and the way in which the voices of women, the voices of Maori individuals in New Zealand and the voices of other disadvantaged groups were not represented in the parliament. There was a community groundswell, and the trade unions and people who were involved in a wide variety of groups came together and were part of a push in New Zealand that changed the system and brought the capacity for all the voters of New Zealand to have their views reflected in the composition of their federal parliament. 
Now, whilst we have this debate in Australia, we have a tremendous capacity to learn from the experiences of our neighbours on the other side of the Tasman in order to ensure that we bring the voices of all of the community into our parliament—and not just into this chamber, the Senate, but also into the House of Representatives. We can do this by following up the Greens' proposal that was launched some time ago to introduce a system of proportional representation into the House of Representatives. In the Greens' paper a number of options were outlined, one of which was the MMP system used in New Zealand and another being the Hare-Clark system used in Tasmania and the ACT. There are also parliamentarians from the Greens in the gallery today who represent those electoral systems and the capacity for a diversity of voices to be represented in those parliaments.
I now move to the issue of the terms of election for senators in the Australian parliament. This has become part of the debate not because the Prime Minister has raised the issue but because others have wanted to limit the capacity the Prime Minister currently has to manipulate and call elections for his own political advantage. We saw a clear example of that in the last federal election when the MV Tampa came over the horizon and then an election was called based on the political climate that had been created in Australia, the fear and division that had come as a result of the political campaign around that issue—a climate which clearly advantaged this divisive government in terms of putting their proposals through the parliament. So we need to ensure that, if we are to go down this path of reform, we remove the capacity for prime ministers to manipulate the situation. That is again a word of warning to the Australian Labor Party, about when the government come back and say that they want the capacity to continue to set the timing of elections and to use their ability to manipulate the political climate we are working in.
It is also pertinent to recognise the role this Senate has played in looking after and upholding the rights of working people to collectively bargain and organise, the role this Senate has played in protecting the sick and elderly from facing 30 per cent increases on their essential medicines and the role this Senate continues to play in exposing the fundamental flaws behind the government's higher education legislation. For all of these things, this brake, this restraint on the power of the executive government of the day would not be possible under the Prime Minister's proposal. Let us recall that over 98 per cent of the bills voted on in the Senate over the last 30 years have passed. The Senate has been cooperative. But when we look the other way to see what pieces of private members' legislation have been passed by the House of Representatives, we find a big zero in terms of the capacity of the House of Representatives to recognise the plurality of voices that are represented here. 
The role the Senate has played is what good democracy is about. It is not about the tyranny of the majority. It is not about rubber stamping the Prime Minister's power. Yet this is exactly what the Prime Minister wants with the so-called reform. The Clerk of the Senate was right when he said last week in response to the proposal before us—(Time expired)
 (Senator Ferguson)—Before I call Senator Sandy Macdonald, I acknowledge the presence in the President's gallery, as mentioned by Senator Nettle, of a group of Greens parliamentarians from a number of states, the ACT and New Zealand who are visiting Canberra for meetings this week. I welcome them to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2003-10-13,"—This is an important debate. It is a discussion about section 57 of the Australian Constitution, which deals with resolving deadlocks between the House of Representatives and the Senate. Governments are elected to govern by having the numbers in the House of Representatives, but the Senate is an integral part of the parliament. It is essentially a house of review, still intensely political, no longer really a states house but operating in the governing process, sometimes with high levels of bipartisanship. This is particularly so in the accountability role that the Senate plays in the committee process which has developed year on year—and I think we would all be aware of that. In my brief time here I have seen the committee process gain in power and prestige. I think Australia is fortunate to have this chamber.
Because our Constitution was drawn up before the reform acts in the United Kingdom in, I think, 1911 or 1913, which substantially limited the power of their unelected upper house, our Senate retains the power to block supply—though I understand there was always a convention that the House of Lords did not block supply. The Senate does not have the power to initiate money bills or appropriation bills. The power of the purse is what government is all about; and that belongs, quite rightly, to the House of Representatives. With the power to block, however, ipso facto the Senate can amend almost all legislation, including matters which are of a budgetary nature. I give the examples of the pharmaceutical benefits schemes or the disability pensions arrangements which were flagged in the 2002 budget. This may be good in certain circumstances, but ultimately governments are made and unmade in the House of Representatives. Governments have programs and they are entitled to carry those programs forward, especially if there has been an intervening election. After all, if you think there is a degree of cynicism in the community amongst ordinary people that you should not trust politicians then how much more will this be reinforced if a political party or a government says it is going to do something, has an election and is then frustrated by an opposition or by loopy Independents or by other minor parties that will never ever have the responsibility of government.
After 7½ years there are a number of examples of where the government has been frustrated. The opposition and the Democrats point to the great majority of government programs having been passed—I think Senator Harradine said it was 95 per cent of the government's program or legislation since the last election. But that is really not the point. I give two examples—firstly, the sale of Telstra. The government has stated its intention to sell Telstra if and when services have been raised to a satisfactory level, and there are a number of other provisos as well. It said that in the 1996, the 1998 and the 2001 elections. Whether you agree with the sale or not, the government's program has been up in flashing lights for seven years and the Senate still frustrates the government although it has a clear mandate to sell Telstra. The government retains the right to place conditions on the sale of Telstra but I do not think anybody out there would be under any misapprehension that the intention of the government is to sell Telstra for all the good reasons that have been put on the public record. Governments should be entitled to carry forward their programs, especially if they have been as honest as our government has been on this particular issue. There are some surrounding issues but they are being addressed and I think the government's program is clearly known and it should be allowed to carry that program forward. 
The other example was of course the new tax system. We fought an election on this legislation and after we were returned by the Australian people the Senate decided what parts of the total package were acceptable. I do not consider this to be good government. Others may have a different view. They may say: `We improved the legislation and ensured that you were re-elected at the next election. If you had imposed the total tax package as it was you may not have been elected.' I do not believe that and it is not the point that I am making. The principle is: governments are elected to govern. It is a mark of the remarkable nature of the government's tax changes—and congratulations to Peter Costello and the work that he did—that we now have a tax system which is a substantial improvement on what it replaced despite the fact that it was tampered with by the Senate. It should have been adopted in its entirety. The Australian people had voted for a government which, when it was returned, was then not able to do what it said it would do and had campaigned on. 
I have no problem with either of the Prime Minister's options. I do, however, believe that, before option 1 operates, legislation under consideration should be introduced into the Senate within the first six months of a government's term. Then, after a double rejection, the legislation could be passed by a joint sitting. But having been introduced early—as I say, within the first six months—it would be better understood. Almost certainly it would have been part of a previous election campaign either as part of a party's manifesto or as known government policy, and if that particular party was in government and was to be returned it could then exercise option 1. This will also be appropriate, I consider, for option 2, which is substantially the Lavarch proposal. I have no problem with option 2 either. An early introduction in the previous term would also be helpful for understanding that particular piece of legislation.
I make a couple of final points. In the 1980s the present opposition—as they were then, the Labor government—introduced a number of microeconomic reforms that were good policy and good for Australia. The coalition supported that program—let us never forget that. The difference now is that Labor has supported little if any of the programs we have consistently been re-elected on, be it on tax, on workplace reform, on changes to broadcasting or on the sale of Telstra. The other difference in the Labor years was that the Labor government was almost assured that their program would be supported by the Democrats, a party of the Left that found no difficulty, at the end of a little posturing, in supporting the main thrust of a Labor government's program. We do not have that luxury. Certainly, in recent times, we cannot rely on the Democrats. Less and less can we rely on the Democrats and, if only they would listen more often to my colleague Senator Andrew Murray, we might be able to rely on their support more often. The position of the Democrats, unfortunately for good government in Australia, remains increasingly unclear on many issues.  
Whilst at the time that the Constitution was drawn up it did provide a method by which a constitutional impasse could be reconciled, it remains a cumbersome way to settle a constitutional deadlock. It was a clever constitutional way at the time in 1901 but it uses a sledgehammer to squash a pea. There is nothing in terms of the Prime Minister's option paper that alters the term of a senator and nothing that changes the voting methods. Both of the Prime Minister's options provide simpler, easier methods for resolving deadlocks in the legislative program. This is not a grab for power by this or any other government. It is an opportunity for all of us to make a commonsense change to a Constitution that after 100 years requires a little tweaking. It needs some review and I applaud the Prime Minister for putting his option paper out into the community and I look forward with interest to hearing the debate not only in this chamber—part heard at this time—but also in the community.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-10-13,"—Let me first say that I welcome this debate; I think it is an important debate for Australia to have. I do hope that we arrive at a situation where a series of questions are put to the Australian people at the next general election. If my expectations are correct, I would think it will not be the kind of result that the government would like. I want to refer to an excellent report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters into the 2001 federal election, which has an even more excellent set of supplementary remarks by Senators Andrew Bartlett and Andrew Murray. In there, on pages 271 to 272, are some observations which I intend to repeat here:
In 2001 Australia's only two major parties, the Liberal and Labor parties, secured 74.9% of the HoR vote, up from 74.5% in 1998. The Labor Party secured a primary vote of 37.8%, and the Liberal Party 37.1%.
Of the minor parties, the National Party (13 members) and the (Northern Territory) Country Liberal Party (1 member), gained representation in the HoR, with 5.6% and 0.3% of the national vote respectively. Three Independents were successful.
Of the minor parties not represented in the HoR, the most notable were the Australian Democrats 5.4% and One Nation 4.3%.
Overall, over 18% of voters, nearly one in five, were not represented in the HoR at all, having given their primary votes to political parties and independents other than the Liberals, Labor or the Nationals.
Federal election after federal election shows that one quarter of all Australian voters are not major party voters. These voters largely remain unrepresented in the HoR.
This situation has led to campaigns to make the HoR more representative, with suggested reforms ranging from full proportional representation, to a `top-up' party list system to adjust unequal outcomes.
The Australian Democrats have previously proposed that the present system be adjusted for the HoR with a form of `mixed member proportional voting', which provides a compromise between the competing principles of local representation and fair representation.
There have been moves towards proportional voting systems in recent years in unicameral parliaments such as New Zealand, and the new parliaments of Scotland and Wales.
Although nine political parties—
and those nine are the Liberal Party of Australia, the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party, the Australian Labor Party, the Country Labor Party, the National Party of Australia, the Australian Democrats, the Australian Greens, the Australian Progressive Alliance and Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party— 
are represented in the two Federal houses of Parliament, many commentators still focus on bipartisan not cross-party politics. Australia is still commonly described in two-party terms.
Australia is a multi party system, but its political discourse often exhibits a two-party mentality.
Typical of multi party democracies, the Australian Federal Government is comprised of a coalition of parties—
that is, the Liberal Party of Australia, the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia: three parties—
Like many democratic governments too, its power is disproportionate to its support.
57% of voters do not give their primary vote to the Government in the HoR. Conversely and disproportionately however, it holds 54.7% of the HoR seats.
The nearly proportional representation nature of the Senate (within States and Territories) provides a useful and desirable democratic counter to the distorted nature of HoR representation.
This is reflected in the Government's share of votes and seats. In the Senate the Government had 41.8% of the national primary vote in 2001, and held 46.0% of the seats.
The role of the Senate as a brake on the excesses of an unrepresentative House of Representatives continues to be the subject of attack. There are powerful organisations and individuals who still seek to make our parliamentary democracy less democratic, less accountable and less progressive, by making the Senate less proportionally representative and more subservient to the HoR.
It is the Senate, free of the dominance of the Executive, which preserves the essence of the separation of powers, not the HoR. It is the Senate that protects the sovereignty of the people, not the HoR, which is dominated by representatives of a minority of voters with a majority of seats.
After the 2001 election 95% of Australians were represented by their party of choice in the Senate. In contrast, over 18% of the HoR were not.
Next, I want to refer to the excellent publication that in my opinion should be given to every senator and member both past and present called Platypus and Parliament: the Australian Senate in Theory and Practice by an American Stanley Bach, which has just been published this month. I will refer to a few items that he mentions and I will also quote from a paper that Campbell Sharman put to the Senate in December 1998.
Governments lack the democratic legitimacy for total control of the legislative process. Governments are generally elected with well under 50 per cent of the popular vote. The Senate's involvement makes the legislative process more inclusive, democratic and representative. Sharman writing in 1998 said:
The present situation in the Commonwealth Parliament requires governments to compromise so that a larger group than the governing party, perhaps even a body of parliamentarians representing a real majority of voters, supports a proposed measure. This means that, quite apart from any amendments that may be required, legislation is closely scrutinised and the government of the day and its supporting bureaucracy must publicly justify every proposed law to a legislative body whose support cannot be taken for granted.
Around 25 per cent of voters are non-major party voters and the Senate is the only place where they are effectively represented. Sharman said:
... minor party and independent senators speak for a quarter of the electorate and that, whatever principle of representation is used, they have a right to be heard and make their opinions felt. To undermine the legitimacy of the Senate is to deny a substantial portion of the Australian electorate the only effective voice they have in parliament.
If the Australian people wanted the government to control the passage of legislation through the Senate, they would vote in government majorities in the Senate. Only a powerful Senate can operate as an effective house of review and as an effective house of accountability. Sharman said: 
The problem is, what is the use of review if it doesn't include the ability to insist on change? And one person's commitment to a reasonable amendment is another's stubborn refusal to see sense. The whole point of reviewing legislation is to take control of the reviewing process away from the government of the day. Otherwise, the reviewing process is of limited use and subject to partisan control by the governing parties. This is graphically illustrated by the ineffectiveness of lower house committees in reviewing legislation.
The Senate has a superb committee system which does a great deal to promote the accountability of the government for its legislation and for its activities. The Senate's various accountability functions would be undermined by reducing its powers. This is Sharman again:
It should be noted that the removal of the Senate's power to block legislation would have major consequences for all its other functions. Its committee system, its scrutiny of bills, and its power to keep governments accountable for their actions would all be seriously impaired. A house of review is not a house of review unless it has teeth. To pretend that the reviewing function would continue to work effectively if it were entirely dependent on the sweet reasonableness of governments is a fantasy.
With the executive dominance of the House of Representatives, the Senate is the only opportunity for effective review, as Bach argues:
... the Senate is all that stands between the Australian people and an electoral parliamentary dictatorship.
The public supports the role of the Senate in holding the government accountable. Bach cites surveys conducted by Goot showing that there is no consensus that the Senate should refrain from blocking bills or that its constitutional power should be curbed. Goot concludes:
... all the evidence points to a better educated, more politically aware electorate, welcoming the check on executive power and wanting the Senate to stay.
Sharman says:
... talk of reforming the Senate to remove its potential to force governments to compromise is mind boggling, and could be ignored if it were not taken seriously by sections of the news media. Here we have an institution that is working in precisely the way most of us want our legislature to operate, the only disgruntled players being the government of the day and those interest groups who believe they can do better lobbying the government than persuading minor parties in the Senate. It is the last institution that needs reform, and I hope that there is enough vocal support for its activities to ensure that no government would be rash enough to try to change it.
When Mr Howard went to the election in 2001, he was asked about the two greatest achievements of which he was most proud. At the time, he said they were the passage of the industrial relations reforms in 1996 and of A New Tax System. The proposition put is often code for saying, `Let's get out of the way those minor parties and Independents who represent 25 per cent of the Australian electorate and let's have a system where we have Labor versus Liberal.' If Labor had been in the majority in the Senate in those years when those two major reforms Mr Howard is so proud of occurred, you would not have the 1996 IR reforms and you would not have A New Tax System. There are many members of the community who say that might be a good thing, but the idea that a minority government—and it is a minority government democratically; it does not have 50 per cent plus one of the vote—should not be required to negotiate its outcomes where necessary with other parties which hold substantial shares of the electorate's vote in their own right, and my memory records that the Democrats had well over a million voters supporting them in 1996 and just under a million in 1998, is frankly a denial of the principle of majority representation. That is the first point I would make. 
The second myth that has already been floated is that the bills that are passed—98 per cent of all bills are passed of which about a third are amended—are, in the words I think of the Treasurer, `non-contentious legislation'. That is absolute nonsense. I have frequently had members of the government backbench, sometimes even ministers, and members of the National Party come to me—and I know it has also happened to my colleagues—with pleas to take up issues which they have not been capable of winning support for in their own party room. I have had that happen from the caucus I might say as well.
—And the Labor Party.
—Exactly that is why I said `caucus': it is the Labor Party. That is perfectly reasonable because, with a top-down executive situation where the Prime Minister and his cabal tell the cabinet what to do and the cabinet tries to tell the party room what to do, legitimate views on, say—let us choose a good one—the ASIO bill need to be expressed by other parties to get a good compromise view out. There are many members of the Liberal Party and the National Party who are extremely pleased when the minor parties and the Labor Party oppose, reform or adjust legislation. That is a proper part of the democratic process. I will say to you that, although Labor opposed the GST with great vehemence—wrongly, I thought—there were numbers of Labor people in the state legislature and even in this legislature and Labor ministers who came up to me and said, `Well done,' and they were very pleased that we did it.
—Name them.
—That is perfectly natural—there are many points of view in the major parties. I do not think I will name them, Senator Marshall; it might damage my sources. The point about reform and amendment is that it has a far wider supporting mechanism than otherwise you might see. In the case of the Cole royal commission, I note that there are very strong donors to the Liberal and Labor parties—construction companies and others—that are saying to me, `By the way, please pass these things entirely.' Whenever I deal with tax legislation, there are community members who ask us to pursue it. I must say, to the credit of government senators, when they are required to look at legislation objectively they do so and they often make some substantial improvements to what the government intends. 
So what are we really talking about then with this debate? We are talking about those bills which the government cannot get compromise on and which they say damage their ability to operate as a government. One of the areas they pick on is industrial relations. I smelt that this lot was coming along so on 18 September I put out a briefing note which I boxed. It was on two issues that week—one was unfair dismissals and one was workplace relations legislation from 1996 to 2003. You will note in my earlier quotes that Professor Sharman says we have to keep an eye on the media and their reporting of these matters. I think we do, too. In the end, they are frequently employees of Mr Murdoch and Mr Packer and I do not regard those people as friends of the Senate. I have noted that some of the media commentary in these areas is remarkably ill informed given the material that is available to them. Let us test this proposition that the government have not been able to get through their IR legislation.
Of those bills put to the Senate from March 1996 to September 2003, 13 workplace relations bills have passed into law and, in theory, 11 have not passed. In fact, 13 proposals passed and three proposals did not pass. The 11 reduced to three because six bills were attempts to exempt small business from federal unfair dismissal provisions, two bills related to an attempt to add to existing secret ballot provisions and two bills that did not pass subsequently passed in another form, thus leaving just three rejected proposals—unfair dismissals, secret ballots for protected action and termination of employment. 
The coalition employ Chicken Little rhetoric with respect to IR. They claim the Senate holds up their workplace relations agenda and that the coalition's 1996 workplace relations law needs radical change. They cannot have it both ways. Existing workplace relations law makes a major contribution to Australia's economic performance. That being so, the federal workplace relations law cannot simultaneously be regarded as seriously defective. It is a fact that we now have lower unemployment, lower interest rates, higher productivity, higher real wages growth and lower levels of industrial disputation than in the past. Working days lost per thousand employees is the lowest ever at 30 days. Simultaneously they are telling us that the laws are awful and we have to change them in a massive way.
The other thing I would remind many people who are not thinking clearly of is that it is the government not the Senate that decides the legislation that is put before this place. All those IR bills stacked up have never been put to the Senate. I would remind people who talk about obstructionism of the point made by Senator Bartlett the other day that well over 40 private senators' bills are not addressed by the government and the history of obstructionism of the House of Representatives to private senators' bills is well over 80 per cent rejection, which makes the house of obstruction very definitely the House of Representatives.
Let us return to the federal unfair dismissals area. When the Prime Minister was asked what area was being held up, this was the only one that he nominated. The annual total of federal unfair dismissal cases reduced from 14,707 in November 1996 to 7,129 as at July 2003. The number of employed persons in that time has gone up by 1.2 million; the number of unemployed persons has fallen by 153,000. The proposition the government puts is that getting rid of the unfair dismissal provisions for federal employees would produce up to 80,000 jobs. According to the government there are 600,000 small business employees, so the ridiculous proposition the government puts is that 80,000 jobs will be created from exempting small business employees—approximately 600,000 of them—from access to the regime. The figures do not stack up. The facts do not stack up. This is a debate about attitude, rhetoric and lies.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-10-13,"—I rise to speak on the government's Senate reform paper released last week. I want to speak not so much on what is in it but what is not in it. Alfred E. Smith, the former Governor of New York in the 1920s, once said:
All the evils of democracy can be cured by more democracy.
I think that is an important benchmark by which we can and should judge this Senate reform package. The key question must be: does it expand or improve our democracy? Indeed I note that the reform paper itself said on page 8:
The solution must be to develop a model which more faithfully reflects the will of the people and the intentions of those who drafted the Constitution.
I think the answer is that this paper fails to improve or enhance our democracy. 
From the government's point of view, the Senate is frustrating the will of the people as reflected by the election of the government in the House of Representatives. This raises the question of how representative the House of Representatives is. In 1998, the British government established a royal commission into its electoral system headed by Lord Roy Jenkins. That commission concluded that single member constituency elections, while encouraging a direct relationship between member and electorates and encouraging strong governments, also had `a natural tendency to disunite rather than unite the country' by exaggerating movements of public opinion with mammoth majorities by excluding the supporters of third parties and by `geographically dividing' parties by denying representation in very large regions. The commission recommended a `mixed member' system, combining elements of single member electorates and proportional representation as a means of overcoming these concerns. Such models have been adopted in recent years in the Scottish, Welsh, London and New Zealand parliaments.
I think the concerns identified by the Jenkins commission equally apply to the Australian House of Representatives. Of the last 21 elections, the House of Representatives electoral system has produced the wrong winner on five occasions. That is, the party that won the majority of the two-party preferred vote failed to win the majority of the seats. Kim Beazley, Andrew Peacock, Gough Whitlam, Arthur Calwell and Bert Evatt are in a select club of Prime Ministers that should have been. An electoral system that produces the wrong result in 20 per cent of elections is a huge threat to national security and unity—far more even than the boat people who keep sailing over our horizon. What would have happened in 1998 if Kim Beazley, having won 51.3 per cent of the two-party preferred vote, had denounced the election result, claiming that the result was not free and fair? What would have happened then in terms of our national unity? 
The House of Representatives distorts the will of the people by the nature of its electoral system. Of its 150 members, only 63 won a majority of first preferences at the last federal election. Out of 150 members of the House of Representatives, 87 members sit in their seats in the full knowledge that the majority of people in their electorates would have preferred to be represented by someone else. That is an extraordinary outcome.
Further, the House electoral system denies representation to around one in five Australians who vote for minor parties. At the last federal election the combined votes of the Democrats, the Greens and One Nation was around 16 per cent of the vote, the equivalent of the populations of South Australia and Western Australia combined. If we were to deny representation to the people of South Australia and Western Australia on the basis that New South Wales and Victoria had the majority of people then I am sure those states would have something to say. Yet, when it comes to the notion of denying the equivalent of South Australia and Western Australia in terms of political parties, for some reason that is okay and still within the will of the people.
The electoral system did not produce a single win for these parties, despite the fact they got between 16 and 20 per cent of the vote—although I should note that the Democrats got within four per cent of winning Boothby and the Greens subsequently won Cunningham in a by-election. By contrast, the Senate more accurately reflects the voting will of the Australian people. No party has won a majority of the vote in a Senate election since 1975. As a result, no party has held a majority in the Senate since 1981. Minor parties continue to be underrepresented in the Senate, but not to the same degree as they are in the House. Over the 1998 and 2001 Senate elections, minor parties won around 24 per cent of the vote in the Senate but won only 16 per cent of the seats. 
The Senate may not be perfect, but it more accurately reflects the electoral will of the people than the House of Representatives does. Any test of proposals for constitutional reform should be based on the benchmark: does it make our nation more democratic? Given the House of Representatives is formed on a less democratic basis than the Senate, increasing the power of the House vis-a-vis the Senate would make our nation, as a whole, less democratic. In fact, because the support of the people is needed for any constitutional change, a reform that fails the test of making the nation more democratic is almost certain to fail at a democratic referendum. The Australian people will not accept increasing the power of the Prime Minister at their expense, particularly when the system that produces the Prime Minister falls well short of world's best practice in electoral systems and electoral fairness.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-10-13,"—I am keen to speak briefly on this issue, not because it is not important but because, rather than echo much of what has been said on this topic—much of which I agree with, particularly from those of us on the crossbench—I want to touch on some issues which I feel perhaps need some further discussion and which have not been fully covered in the debate and discussion so far. The particular issue I want to go to is the question of mandate and what that means to both houses. I think that mandate is very much at the core of the Prime Minister's intervention in this debate and very much at the heart of how the Australian electorate feels about the Senate and the collision sometimes between the House of Representatives—or government, more particularly—and the Senate.
It is worth nothing that the political make-up of the Senate chamber in 2003 is such that 54 per cent of the political parties represented here are not of the government. More than half the Senate is not of the government, yet the government expects that 100 per cent of the time ought to be used to address government legislation—or, at least, 99 per cent of the time. Further, there is an implied argument there, sometimes stated more specifically, that the government ought to have 100 per cent of its legislation passed by the Senate; that the Senate ought to act as a rubber stamp rather than as a house of review and, on occasion, as a house with the opportunity to prevent the passage of particular government legislation or amended government legislation.
I note, for example, that like the federal parliament the ACT Legislative Assembly has a four-day sitting week and that every Thursday is dedicated entirely to private members' business. So 25 per cent of the time in the ACT Legislative Assembly is dedicated to non-government business, yet only a miniscule fraction of time in this place is dedicated to private members' business—despite the fact that more than half of it is constituted by non-government members. Since 1901, only eight private senators' bills have become law, although 58 of those have passed the Senate. So the House of Representatives record for blocking Senate bills is 86 per cent. Two of the bills which became law were Australian Democrat bills. One was legislation that banned tobacco advertising while another Democrat bill became the basis for the first World Heritage legislation which ultimately was used to save the Franklin.
Currently in the Senate we Democrats have a range of private senators' bills, including the ABC Amendment (Online and Multichannelling Services) Bill, the Air Navigation Amendment (Extension of Curfew and Limitation of Aircraft Movements) Bill; the Anti-Genocide Bill, introduced by me; a bill dealing with the ABC more broadly; the Charter of Political Honesty Bill; the constitutional alteration bill, dealing with appropriations for ordinary annual services of government; the Corporate Code of Conduct Bill; the genetic privacy bill; the Patents Amendment Bill; the Parliamentary Approval of Treaties Bill; a reconciliation bill; the Republic (Consultation of the People) Bill; the State Elections (One Vote, One Value) Bill; and a bill addressing uranium mining in or near Australian World Heritage properties. Private senators' bills from we Democrats that have been discharged from the Notice Paper include the Public Interest Disclosure Bill, the Electoral Amendment (Political Honesty) Bill and the Freedom of Information Amendment (Open Government) Bill. 
Private senators' bills that we have introduced into this parliament in the year 2002 include the Ministers of State (Post-Retirement Employment Restrictions) Bill, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Boundary Extension) Amendment Bill, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (Scrutiny of Board Appointments) Amendment Bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Paid Maternity Leave) Bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Invasive Species) Bill and the Public Interest Disclosure (Protection of Whistleblowers) Bill.
This year, Democrat senators have introduced private senators' bills such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Protecting the Great Barrier Reef from Oil Drilling and Exploration) Amendment Bill; the Electoral Amendment (Political Honesty) Bill, which was revised from an earlier bill; the Sexuality Anti-Vilification Bill; the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval for Australian Involvement in Overseas Conflicts) Bill; the Textbook Subsidy Bill; the Freedom of Information Amendment (Open Government) Bill, which, again, was revised from a previous bill; the National Animal Welfare Bill; and the Financial Management and Accountability (Anti-Restrictive Software Practices) Amendment Bill.
The point I am making here is that, very often, Independent senators and/or minor party senators speak for a constituency, and they raise an issue or wish to address an issue which is not being thoroughly addressed by the major parties and which goes to the heart of what we would argue is mandate. I can accept and understand that if a bill were to be debated and passed in this place it might not be supported in the other place. I understand that; that is the way our democratic processes are structured and that is the way the numbers may fall. But, as it happens, if a bill passes this place it does not get to the point of being debated and voted on in the House of Representatives because it is suffocated at the point of entry and there is no debate.
I would argue very strongly that, if we are going to have a comprehensive and sensible debate about Senate reform, we must address the fact that the Senate is largely constituted of non-government members and that they too have a mandate to prosecute their agenda and their issues, not by forcing the passage of these things through the House of Representatives—if the numbers are not there, that is not going to happen—but, at the very least, by having the opportunity to have them debated. It is the proportional representation in this place which gives the Senate its strength, its colour and its character and which makes it genuinely representative of the Australian people—ironically, rather than the so-called `House of Representatives'. 
So, within the broader debate about the role and function of the Senate, let us not forget the opportunity and the right for those of us who are non-government members, and who constitute the greatest number in terms of the political dynamic in this place, to also move on those issues in which we have a key interest, in which we feel passionately and which we believe we have a mandate to pursue.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-10-13,"—I rise to contribute to the debate on the discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution. It is not a bad idea to identify and understand a problem before you set out to solve it. So what exactly is the problem in respect of which the amendments of section 57 are proposed? A Senate deadlock occasionally frustrates the government of the day but the historic fact is that the will of the people is not frustrated. History shows that the Senate deadlocks mostly occur when the government of the day has lost touch with the people and is pursuing an agenda to which the people are opposed. 
Look at the most famous case: the deadlock of 1975, of which our present Prime Minister was a beneficiary. Although the chant `We was robbed!' can still be heard at ALP barbeques, the fact is that the government of the time was pursuing an agenda to which the people of Australia eventually showed they were opposed. When given the opportunity they breathed a sigh of relief and dismissed the Whitlam government. One can say the government of the day was frustrated in 1975 but the people of Australia were not. The Senate gave the people an opportunity to be heard when the government of the day had stopped listening. It is one of those remarkable twists of fate that the current Prime Minister was one of the greatest individual beneficiaries of the events of 1975. In 1975 section 57 was put to the test and it worked very well from the point of view of the Australian people and from the point of view of the Prime Minister. 
Look at what has happened on another five occasions when there have been double dissolutions. The most recent occasion was 1997, over the Australia Card. The Hawke Labor government was returned but did not pursue the divisive issue of the card. In that case the existing process in section 57 served the people well by forcing the government of the day to listen to the people. Did section 57 work? Yes, it did. The time before that was in 1983. The Senate had refused to pass 13 bills and the Fraser government called a double dissolution which removed that government from office. This is another fine example of the Senate empowering the people.
In 1974, six bills were deadlocked. A double dissolution was called and the government was returned. A joint sitting was called and the bills were passed. Once again, section 57 worked. On this occasion it worked from the view point of the Australian people as well as the government of the day. In 1951 a similar situation had arisen in relation to just one bill. A double dissolution was held and the Menzies government was returned with a majority in both houses. Section 57 had worked again. The only other time section 57 was put to the test was in 1914 when a single bill was deadlocked. The double dissolution brought about a change of government. Section 57 had worked again.
In 102 years of federation, section 57 has been put to the test six times and it has worked every time from the point of view of the people. So where is the problem with options 1 and 2 that are put forward in Resolving deadlocks: a discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution? Why are they being put forward as solutions? The problem is solely one for governments, because on the majority of occasions when there has been a double dissolution the government which called it has been defeated. These were not occasions when the government was being frustrated in carrying out the will of the people; these were occasions when the government of the day had become the master of the people, not the leader of the people. It is the job of a government to lead but it is not the job of a democratic government to impose its will on those who elected it.  
In a democracy leaders lead by persuading the people to their point of view, not by imposing their point of view. I therefore put it to you that the present section 57 is working well. `Yes,' you may say, `but that is only from the point of view of the people and not from the point of view of the government.' Let me remind those in the chamber that any change to section 57 will not be decided by us in backrooms of parliament but by the Australian people in the homes, factories, farms and offices that cover our land. If ever I have heard of an impossible selling job, it is the job which will be faced by this government in selling this scheme to the people. Of the 200 government bills passed by the parliament each year, only a handful—less than two per cent—of the government's bills are either rejected outright or amended in such a way that the government will not accept them. Many bills pass with amendments and, when the government compromises with the other parties, this produces better laws. At present, there are just four bills that the Senate has rejected outright.
Let me remind representatives of the media, who should be listening to this—and it is ironic that we do not even have a single media representative in the gallery here today—
—They are probably listening though.
—Yes, they will be listening. Let me remind those media people who are listening to the debate that the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill 2002 is one of those bills. That bill would have removed restrictions on overseas ownership and allowed Murdoch and Packer to further monopolise ownership of the Australian media. This is the sort of legislation that the Senate blocks. Let us hope that the media is not asleep at the wheel during this debate. The first casualties of the Prime Minister's Senate reforms, if they get up, will be the members of the press gallery, their media organisations and our public broadcaster, the ABC. If these reforms are supported, the Liberal Party will be able to force the media ownership changes it so desperately wants.
How different would our country be if the Senate could not stop bad legislation? Think of the larger agenda of the government: a utilitarian grid of industrial relations legislation, the complete privatisation of Telstra, the full-blown privatisation of our health and education system, farmers strangled by deregulation, doctors struggling with Medicare, increases in GST, and the erosion of privacy and civil liberties. Without the Senate, the government of the day, or any future government of our nation, would have carte blanche. The Senate is the only protection that the Australian people have against major political parties running amok with bad legislation.
Let me remind the chamber of some comments by the National Party that have been raised on the issue. The National Party's national conference over the last weekend was told:
If you want native title fixed up and unfair dismissals fixed up then you'll have to `depower' the Senate.
The Nationals conference passed a motion, and I would like to put that motion on the public record so that the Australian people are fully aware of the fact that the National Party wants to depower the senate. The motion, as reported by Brendan Nicholson in The Age newspaper, reads that the National Party: 
 Acknowledges the need to develop a mechanism whereby any impasse between the House of Representatives and the Senate can be resolved in a manner which present constitutional and legislative structures do not provide.
Labor's position, explained on their web site, is very clear. They want reform of section 57 to be considered in the context of two related reforms: firstly, the removal of the Senate's power to block supply; and, secondly, a move to fixed four-year terms for the House and all Senators. The worrying issue here is that the Labor, Liberal and National parties all agree that the power of the Senate should be radically altered, presumably to progress their own party political agendas.
The current bills that the Senate has rejected could hardly be called critical or essential. They are not bills that are vital to the continuation or smooth operation of the government. The government's prized reforms have been passed by the Senate, albeit not supported by One Nation. Consider the privatisation of Telstra, the implementation of the GST and the Workplace Relations Act. The passage of such legislation proves without a doubt that the Senate is not obstructing the government's so-called reform agenda.
The Australian public is not comfortable with a government that has control of the lower house and control of the Senate. The people have shown this with their voting preferences in recent years. Large numbers of Australians do not share the Prime Minister's view about reforming the Senate because they do not share his views about power. As Harry Evans, the Senate Clerk, pointed out in his paper “Reform” of the Senate the aim of the proposed reforms to the Senate is closely related to the mandate theory of government, strongly supported by the Prime Minister—but not when he was in opposition. Let us look very clearly at the mandate that the Prime Minister claims. Fifty-eight per cent of the Australian people did not vote for the coalition. So, if anyone has a mandate, it is the opposition and the crossbenches, and this is what the government is scared of.
The Senate is not rejecting the government's legislation. The government is the body that administers all aspects of our Australian society. What is being rejected is the Liberal and National parties' policies and ideology parading as legislation. The Prime Minister can talk until he is blue in the face, but he does not have a mandate, because he does not have a majority. He does not have automatic consent and he does not have a green light to go ahead with everything that he wants. Changing the ground rules when you cannot get your own way 100 per cent of the time will not curry favour with the electorate. To claim a mandate is an affront and an insult to Australians.
Let me turn to the discussion paper. We have a chapter titled `The minority-led Senate'. This title begs the question: why have the Australian people chosen to turn to minor parties? The answer is that the Liberal, National and Labor parties no longer fulfil the true function that the Senate was originally created to perform. If there is to be any reform of the Senate at all, why not implement an antideadlock process which consults the people, not the parliament?
One Nation's policy since the formation of our party has been to support citizen initiated referenda, or CIR. This process would resolve any so-called deadlocked bills. If a bill is rejected by the Senate twice, have a referendum on it. Put the bill to the people and ask the people whether they want it passed or not. We would soon see that the Senate is not blocking important bills and frustrating the will of the government at all; we would soon see that the Senate is only reflecting the wishes of the people. 
One Nation welcomes debate on improving the effectiveness of the parliament. However, any proposed changes must genuinely enhance the ability of the parliament to represent the will of the people and not give the executive government more power. Just because a government is democratically elected does not mean it has carte blanche to do whatever it wants to do. An elected government must accept defeat on certain issues and on certain legislation. That is the democratic process; that is the Senate acting as a brake on bad legislation.
The debate over section 57 is a solution looking for a problem that does not exist. The Senate is the only mechanism that Australians have to stop the privatisation of education and health, the sale of Telstra and legislation that would increase the concentration of media ownership. If a bill cannot stand up to the scrutiny of the Senate, including the scrutiny of the committee inquiry stage which seeks public input, it is simply bad legislation and in all probability should be rejected.
Australia's democratic process is based upon the election of representatives, who `re-present' the will of the people. Just because a certain number of representatives combine to form a government does not negate their responsibility to represent the wishes of voters. The Prime Minister has accused the Senate of being obstructive, but his approach is destructive. He wants to destroy the faith that the voters have in the Senate. The Senate allows the voters' wish to override bad legislation and political party policy. The only way for this to continue is to preserve and protect the Senate in its current form. The introduction of a citizen initiated referendum on bills that are defeated twice by the Senate would improve our parliamentary process and ensure it is reflecting the wishes of the majority of Australians.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-10-13,"—As many speakers have already noted, the question of Senate reform is a very important one. I do not intend to speak for long on this topic today, as the debate that the Prime Minister has begun has some distance to go. Indeed, it will not be a debate that is conducted solely or even chiefly in this chamber or indeed in this parliament. In speaking today I am making only an initial contribution. I suspect that my thoughts will firm up after further studying the proposal and listening to various responses such as those from senators in this place and I expect to be making further contributions to national debate on this matter.
The Australian Constitution is a dynamic document. It was designed to be that way by the founders of this nation, who were as far-seeing and highly proactive a group of people as have existed. That has always been to our benefit. Indeed, we do not honour our founders sufficiently nor do we give them enough credit for designing in the closing stages of the imperial 19th century—through an original consensus that itself delivered a sense of national destiny—a document that throughout the century of our independent nationhood has been central to managed process of change.
We can look everywhere around the globe and see societies that do not function with half the efficiency of ours. We can examine other national experiences and see that Australia's egalitarian tradition is indeed unique and immensely robust. We can put other systems of government under the microscope and establish, I believe beyond argument, that our system provides the Australian people with direct, democratic benefits that far outweigh those found anywhere else. In this chamber itself we have among us minor party senators and Independents who often make a fine contribution—and I underline that point—to the process of government. Democracy is not meant to be easy. It is a very difficult system of government. It requires, among the many elements desirable for progress and motivation, high levels of goodwill. Australia's experience is overwhelmingly one of high levels of goodwill in the business of the people's right to govern themselves. 
That is the starting point for any argument about constitutional change or, in this instance, reform of the processes of one of our national houses of parliament. It is true that the proposals canvassed in the discussion paper released last week by the Prime Minister are not radical. I accept that for some there are persuasive arguments for radicalism. The Australian Democrats are an example. They face a battle for electoral relevance with the emerging strength of the alternative Green vote. They seek to defend the turf they have carved out of the political landscape over the past quarter century. But, as in so much else, a radical Australian Democrat agenda for Senate reform runs counter to the public interest.
We have a system that works, and Australians sensibly want to keep it that way. Much is made from time to time of the fact that the Australian Senate is unique in the parliaments that have sprung from the British tradition in that it is a fully elected chamber. But I believe it is right to place limits on the power of an upper house to frustrate the policy of a popularly elected government which has the confidence of the lower house. Our Constitution does this. Section 57, which governs how a dispute between the two houses over legislation may be resolved, provides a mechanism—a mechanism that is in need of some repair. I stress here that it is repair, not reinvention: radicals, please note.
Students of Roman history will recall the vast disputes that corrupted the senate of that imperium. It is perhaps worth reflecting that it was not until very late in Rome's history—the year 339—that the patrician veto exercised through the senate was abolished. Two millennia later and in an entirely different world, conditions are vastly different. Politics in our country are profoundly democratic, and the Roman experience is of academic interest. Our practical purpose now is to find a way of retaining the Senate as a powerful and responsible house of review while providing a means for the government of the day to enact legislation on which it has campaigned for election. There is no argument, beyond the sort of sorry rhetoric that we have heard from Senator Faulkner and others in this place, between the major parties of Australian politics on that point. The fact is that federal governments in this country are presently formed by either the Liberal Party with the National Party in coalition—but not exclusively in that way—or by the Labor Party.
The proposals for reform that are being canvassed do not offer any future government carte blanche to railroad things through the Senate. The insurance policy that the Senate has always offered the people against excesses by the executive via the lower house would remain very firmly in place. Moreover, the minor parties are now a fixture in Australian politics. I think the Democrats are right to say, as Senator Bartlett has, that the Australian electorate is comfortable with having a party in the Senate in the balance of power role when that party acts responsibly. I stress the words `when that party acts responsibly'. To that extent, Australian politics has changed over the past quarter century perhaps more than in the preceding three-quarters of a century. In a democracy the people rule—they vote and they rule. To put it plainly, the political battle is fought and won by argument, and the people's vote seals the bargain. 
In the context of reform of Senate process—and it is reform of process that we are debating, not reform of the Senate: a very important distinction that we must not lose sight of—we are now in a political battle. The Labor Party has proposals that would link reform of Senate process to far-reaching reform—and I use that term loosely in this context—of our parliamentary system. Fixed terms for parliaments in our system of responsible government are not necessarily to be regarded as a sensible reform. They could injure the vital dynamic of the parliamentary system. Our executive is not only responsible to parliament but also actually part of it. We do not have a congressional system as in the United States, where Congress does its thing and the President sits in the White House and works out how to deal with the outcome, and vice versa. At this stage, I believe, Labor would be well advised to reconsider its attachment to fixed terms for the national legislature, certainly to the extent of examining the option with an objective eye instead of political spin. For me, and I believe for the overwhelming majority of Australians, the bottom line is that the Senate must retain its power of review.
At this point I am inclined to favour option 2 in the discussion paper: a joint sitting following an ordinary election. This would be a cautious reform of the section 57 provisions that would resolve issues without the expense of a double dissolution. It would reinforce the natural desire of any democratic government to negotiate the detail of its policy through a genuine house of review. It would put pressure on the government of the day to look favourably on Senate suggestions and amendments. There is always pressure on a government to listen carefully to Senate argument and to improve its legislation as a result. Indeed, it was this democratic premium that prompted me to call for the reintroduction of an upper house in my maiden speech to the Queensland parliament in 1989, when I was in that place. Let us have the national debate that this discussion paper is designed to both generate and inform and then reach our conclusions individually and collectively.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-10-13,"—I too rise to join this debate about the Prime Minister's discussion paper Resolving deadlocks. The first point I want to make is that there is no deadlock. The Prime Minister's discussion paper on the Senate is a fiction. In his case for change, the Prime Minister says:
... it is virtually impossible for a government to obtain a majority in the upper house, no matter how large its majority is in the lower house.
That is a nonsense, too. A party needs only to win 50 per cent of the Senate vote to deliver it the majority of seats. I would argue that if there was so much anxiety about the government not having a majority in the Senate then we would not have 25 per cent of the voting population voting for neither the ALP nor the coalition.
The point is that the Australian people have not, for some time now, seen fit to give any government absolute power. The election result that followed the constitutional crisis of 1975—triggered by the coalition blocking supply—showed that people expect the parliament to use its powers to check governments that overstep the mark. I do not agree that the coalition should have blocked supply, and the Democrats would not join the opposition to do so, now or ever. The point I want to make is that a sizeable chunk of the voting public does not have the same qualms. I would argue that there is little point in having a parliament if all it can do is pass the government's legislation unamended. For one thing, most of the amendments moved in the Senate are moved by the government. Very often the government itself recognises errors in drafting, poor policy or just things they did not consider, usually because they have consulted inadequately. 
The Senate does the government's consultation for them. It consults with anyone who wishes to make a contribution to the debate, and it does this through its excellent and comprehensive committee system. Bills are examined by these committees if they are complex or contentious, or where senators simply determine that they need to know more about their implications. In fact, the Senate has a procedure that gives us time to scrutinise legislation. When the government wants to exempt bills from the so-called cut-off, the Senate has to agree. In recent times, a quarter of all bills that the Senate has dealt with have been brought to the Senate late by the government. I would argue that it is the government that frustrates the orderly scrutiny of legislation, and it does this now routinely. The gloriously democratic feature of the Senate is its practice of drawing upon the advice of academics, experts, unions, representative bodies, people directly affected and ordinary individuals who might just have a view.
The amendments put and agreed to in the Senate since I have been here, I would argue, have probably kept this government in office. Some would say that might not be a good thing. Telstra would have been sold despite the fact that at every poll that has been taken in this country more than half the population say they disapprove. Commonwealth public servants would be worse off, losing their pensions. That is just to name a couple of things. Employers would be entitled to dismiss employees even when it was unfair. The sick would be charged more for medicines even though promised cost-saving reforms to the PBS have been forgotten. People on disability support pension would be joining the long queues of unemployed people going through the government's so-called activity tests.
I refer here to seven bills that have now been twice rejected by the Senate and that are now triggers for a full Senate election. Nowhere in this document is there mention of these seven bills. The Prime Minister says that a huge amount of legislation is being stopped in the Senate. The paper says there is a permanent veto on the government's legislative agenda. Others in this place have already pointed out the vast number of bills that are passed and the fact that these seven represent a very small percentage of bills in this place.
The paper says there has been a pattern of frustration. No doubt that is so. I, too, get frustrated when the government cannot see the most obvious flaws in its legislation. Take the ludicrous decision to impose an excise on alternative fuels from 2008 without any thought for what this might mean for the sector. The government will probably reverse this decision, but only because the Democrats in the Senate have put the case that Australia needs a diverse fuel mix. Unless you have realistic targets and determine what will be needed to achieve them, you can forget the industry. It will just go. There will be no more LPG, CNG, LNG, ethanol or other biofuel industry in our transport industry. Why was the decision made when anyone in the alternative fuel sector, if they had been asked, could have told the government what the consequences would be? The answer is arrogance. We are facing a government that is frustrated by being presented with the truth, a government that wants only to hear its own version of reality.
We have heard a lot about the politicisation of the Public Service. People who know that alternative fuel is better for air quality, greenhouse emissions, local jobs and the incomes of farmers are silenced because the decision was made for other reasons—free market ideology, party donations from petroleum companies, ignorance, disputes between ministers, payback, political expediency. That is what this decision was about. This is just the most recent example of the government getting it wrong. Thankfully the Senate puts aside much of this by calling for the evidence. 
The government's arguments for reform are hollow. The government says there is a need to rebalance the relationship between the two houses and ensure that, where the houses are deadlocked, the parliament as a whole may reconcile the differences as expeditiously as possible. We think that any rebalancing should change the House of Representatives so that their debate has some purpose, some effect, instead of being simply a rubber stamp, with more rhetoric than substance in what is said. We also think that it is time the government stopped being obstructionist about the documents that are ordered to be provided by the Senate. In the last Labor term, 1993-96, there were 53 orders, 92 per cent of which were complied with. In the 1998-2001 parliament, there were 56 orders, only 73 per cent of which were complied with. Since 2001, that rate of compliance has dropped to 44 per cent.
The government could also provide more days for sitting. The last two years have been the shortest non-election sitting years since the mid-1970s. Recently we lost another two days to estimates. The government is unwilling for us to deal with legislation on the days that we are recalled to hear the US and Chinese heads of state on 23 and 24 October. Despite this, the Senate has passed an enormous number of bills. The average for 2001-03 is the same as the number we dealt with in 1999, when we had 19 extra sitting days.
It seems obvious to us that the government wants to push the Senate to deal with its unpopular bills at the end of this session—in the dead of night when it hopes that there will be less scrutiny. But even then there will be no deadlock. The Senate will continue to do its work as it has always done. We in the Democrats will continue to play our constructive role in the passage of legislation. We say the Prime Minister should rethink his discussion paper. It is fundamentally flawed and it is seriously misleading.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,1,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-10-13,"—I will speak very briefly in the 1½ minutes that are left before question time, and will continue when we bring the debate back on. With regard to the government's paper—the Prime Minister's paper, as it is called—the executive summary at paragraph 3 says:
It has been the bedrock of stable democratic government in this country for over 100 years.
Then the Prime Minister sets out his case for changing all of that. At page 6 of this document, it says:
First, the introduction of proportional representation in 1948, taking effect in 1949, has fostered the development of minor parties.
This has been a valuable evolution in the representative character of the Australian Parliament.
It then proceeds to set out the case for why we should not have it. That is all very interesting. It is a shame that so much good paper contains so much nonsense.
Over the years, governments have wanted—and have had at different times—control of the Senate in the parliament. But people have rejected proposals to reduce the power of the Senate—indeed the control of the Senate, and it changed in 1983 for the better—because governments have consistently lied to the public. Prior to an election, governments promise certain things. Who could forget this Prime Minister's core promises which became non-core promises over time? There was the issue of what was a core promise and what was a non-core promise. All of those things add up to lies to the public. 
—This is the claim of what is supposed to be a popularly elected government—a government that says, `Look, we were elected on a popular basis to put in place the policies that we took to the people.' They are often changed—I take Senator Brandis's interjection—and the general public of this country are often lied to. That is why this Senate is constructive in the way it is and that is why it should remain constructive in that way. It is the only way the Australian public are going to be assured that this place will keep a check on governments of the day to ensure that they actually do deliver what they promise the general public of this country prior to a general election. That has not been the case in the past, and history has proven it to be so, regardless of which party has held power in the parliament. The crossbenches have a very important role.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-10-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ludwig today relating to the Australian Federal Police and counter terrorism.
Today we have seen from the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison—or perhaps the junior woodchuck now—that he has been sidelined by the Attorney-General. It seems that the new Attorney-General has decided to beef up the national security aspects of the Attorney-General's portfolio, as reported in the media today. Of course, this is again policy on the run, with no thought of administrative arrangements and no thought of what is currently occurring within the justice portfolio and on counter-terrorism issues. We have a minister who, without concern, has decided to cause a nightmare. 
Minister Ellison has told us that the Attorney-General is now to adopt an oversighting role. It appears he will oversee all of both justice and customs and Attorney-General's—a lot for any one minister. Minister Ellison has failed to tell us what he will be left to actually do in his portfolio. If the Attorney-General is now going to garner all of the role of Minister for Justice and Customs, Minister Ellison will effectively be on a vacation in Nauru. It seems to be an implicit acknowledgement that there is a need for an office of home affairs, or at least an acknowledgement from this government that there is a need for a structured, strategic plan for how to deal with national security rather than the Attorney-General deciding policy on the run or in media correspondence—for instance, a newspaper stating there is a plan or that a plan has been written on the back of a napkin. It is obvious from the lack of answers given by Senator Ellison today that the idea has simply popped into the imagination of the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General has failed to, in any substantive way, deal with how he is going to ensure that there is a co-ordinated and structured plan on national security. 
The entire notion of national security has been transformed as a result of terrorism. Clearly, we must rethink how we look at national security issues. The government—and, in particular, the Attorney-General—has attempted to grandstand on the issue of national security, but it is not a new issue. This issue has been around for some time. What we find is that the government is still making policy on the run in this matter. It has had over two years to develop a co-ordinated action plan on national security but it has failed. The new Attorney-General has been thrown into the fray to beef it up—at least, that is what he has told the media—but we do not have any solid evidence of how he is going to beef it up, what the administrative arrangements in the department are going to be, or how he is going to split up the portfolio of justice and customs. 
We heard from Senator Ellison that the Attorney-General may have a role in customs, but what in truth is the government doing about security at wharfs, at ports and at airports, and how and who will look after it? Will the Minister for Justice and Customs no longer be the relevant minister to deal with that? I find it amazing that the new Attorney-General has seen fit to announce his intentions in an offhand manner in a news article in today's media without a thought as to how this can best be achieved, without knowledge of the workings of the counter-terrorism procedure currently in operation and without considering projects such as Project Merida, which I mentioned during my question and which is well under way. In fact, Project Merida is supposed to be finalised by the end of this year. It has been listed as a piece of legislation to be dealt with in the spring sittings this year. One doubts whether the government will be able to bring it in, with the Attorney-General making the offhand remarks that he has.
I suspect that the minister has not considered the effect this will have on legislation nearing completion. The APS and the Australian Federal Police—the one-act, one-agency model of Project Merida—is almost complete. But we now have a side wind coming in by way of the Attorney-General saying, `I need to beef up national security so I am going to make a few strategic decisions.' As I have said, it seems to be that he is making plans on the back of a napkin. The government has been unable to define where it sees the obligations of the Department of Justice and the Attorney-General on national security. What is to happen to the APS? What is to happen to the sky marshals? What is to happen to the APS cost recovery model? Even the Prime Minister is completely confused about the issue.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2003-10-13,"—The first question that one has cause to ask when listening to the commentary of Senator Ludwig is: where on earth has he been during the past 12 months? We have enacted a number of very significant, broad-ranging and very powerful pieces of legislation—all of which I am sure he recalls and all of which have gone a very long way to securing our country in the face of the ravages of this blight of terrorism.
Sadly, when Senator Ludwig uses the word `grandstand', it is clear that the word is at the forefront of his mind, because what we have seen here this afternoon is nothing more or less than a monumental grandstand. Obviously, the strategy committee over on the other side of this chamber did not have much to talk about! The new Attorney-General is simply saying that terrorism, the broad range of legislation that is afoot and the suite of legislation that is available for use in terms of security and protection of our country need to be brought to the forefront of the Attorney-General's primary considerations. Who could complain about that? Who could complain that the new Attorney-General is focusing and refocusing and continuing to be vigilant on such a crucial and vitally important subject?
So where has Senator Ludwig been and what is this complaint all about? There has been an article in the weekend press, and Senator Ludwig wants to make some sort of mileage out of the fact that the new Attorney-General is announcing that he will be focusing very much on security and the administration of the various legislative heads that are at his disposal in dealing with this blight of non-state asymmetrical actors out there, particularly in South-East Asia. What has happened here is clearly that the opposition do not have any particular matter to raise in terms of a deficiency, maladministration or a complaint no matter how broadly based other than to say that there is a change of ministerial responsibility. If there has been, it happened yesterday, so what are we doing talking about it? We are talking about it because Senator Ludwig does not have anything else worthy of discussion in this chamber. 
It is apt that here we are 12 months from Australia's worst ever terrorist attack and we have enacted an outstanding suite of legislative countermeasures to deal with this absolutely terrible blight of terrorism and of mindless violence against innocent civilians. In looking at what the response has been and the suite of measures that the government has put into place, every Australian citizen can see very clearly and very tangibly that the response has been a good response and that the two ministers in question have been vigilant—indeed, Senator Ellison has done an absolutely outstanding job in responding to what has been a most difficult situation. So where is the criticism of the administration of our security countermeasures and our border control? There is no criticism. The opposition is simply responding to an article—responding to something that a journalist has put together—because there is no real issue underlying the sorts of complaints that Senator Ludwig has brought to the chamber. It is a very sorry and sad situation when the Labor Party must use terrorism and the legislative framework that this government has set up as some sort of grandstanding to try and score some cheap political points during question time. Is the opposition saying that there is nothing more worthy at the forefront of their minds today than simply raising a change in priority?

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-10-13,"—I rise to express my concern at the government's continuing inept handling of this country's national security, as evidenced by the new Attorney-General's express statement this morning, and as further evidenced by the Minister for Justice and Customs' contradictory statements in the Senate today. Let us put it on the record. I quote the Sydney Morning Herald this morning: 
One of Mr Ruddock's first moves has been to take over control of the counter-terrorism functions of the Australian Federal Police, which had been overseen by the Justice and Customs Minister, Senator Chris Ellison.
It is an explicit statement that functions are being taken by the Attorney-General and taken from the Minister for Justice and Customs. This statement was directly contradicted by Senator Ellison within the last hour in question time in this place when he said that his view was that, just as the previous Attorney-General had oversight, so would the new Attorney-General. That is what Senator Ellison said. Basically Senator Ellison said that it is business as usual, whereas Mr Ruddock made it very clear that he will take over the oversight and control of the antiterrorism functions of the Australian Federal Police.
You have contradictory statements from the two ministers who are responsible for this area. We are left with a critical, outstanding issue—that is, who is telling the truth and, as a consequence, what is actually changing, if anything, in the administration of counter-terrorism in this country? Is there a reorganisation going on? If so, what? If there is not, why did the new Attorney-General raise this issue and, in doing so, claim that he was going to be taking over responsibility in a very critical area? We just cannot walk away from this contradiction, Senator Johnston. It is a contradiction that needs to be addressed and we need to get to the guts of why this contradiction is appearing at this particular time.
It is not just of concern to us: I would maintain that it is of greater concern to those foot soldiers in the field—in the AFP, ASIO and other organisations—who woke up to the news this morning that they would have a new line of command to a new Attorney-General as opposed to the Minister for Justice and Customs. 
Despite what the government may say about this, there is one direct consequence and one clear outcome of this contradiction—that is, that the position of the Minister for Justice and Customs is well and truly undermined. His authority is well and truly undermined. Why? Because the Attorney-General, in essence, was saying across the nation this morning through the SMH that, in effect, he does not have sufficient confidence in the Minister for Justice and Customs to allow him to continue to have direct responsibility for the counter-terrorism area in the Australian Federal Police. He has basically said, `Look, I'm Mr Toughie; I'm coming in—get out of my way.' It is not good for stability and the lines of command for authority in these critical areas to have such mixed messages.
There is one clear primary concern, as far as I am concerned, from our side of parliament—that is, two years after the World Trade Centre attacks and one year after the Bali bombings, this government still cannot get the lines of command and responsibility in their counter-terrorism response settled down. They are still arguing as to who has responsibility for what. This comes on top of strangers entering high security facilities with false IDs. It comes on top of a 13-month period to interview top al-Qaeda suspect Abu Dahdah. It comes on top of this government not being able to get the national security hotline number listed in the White Pages. It comes on top of security cameras not working in a number of high security facilities. That is why we are concerned about who has responsibility. This is a government that may run the themes out in the community, but in terms of organising the shop and organising administration, it goes from one stumble to another.
What motivates Minister Ruddock to make these statements? There are three possible reasons. The first possible reason is whether there has been a grab for power going on here, one that the junior minister does not know about. If there is, it is not good enough. That is not the way to run an administration. If there is not, there is still at least a very clear intent by the new Attorney-General that has a destabilising impact. The second possible reason for these statements is that this minister may have in fact identified a need for change, something that the opposition has been proposing for quite a while now—a ministry for home affairs with direct responsibility. If he has come to that conclusion then that is a strange way to do it, but we would welcome this late conversion. The third possible reason is, as most people suspect, that this is an Attorney-General playing politics. He knows how to send coded messages and he knows how to exploit fears for political purposes. Is he about to embark on doing that again with this very critical area of national security? All those possible motivating factors should be of concern to this parliament, and I am sure they will be of concern to the Australian people.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-10-13,"—You can always rely on Senator Bolkus, when given the chance to stand up in this Senate, to go too far, and he has. He has probably spoilt it for the previous speaker. If there was any point to be made, Senator Bolkus, as usual, has spoilt it. He simply goes too far when he makes the suggestion or the claim that this government's security alert systems—the security of the nation—have collapsed or are in a shambles, all because of a ridiculous power play between a senior and a junior minister. It is an absurd proposition. It is simply untrue, and to make it—as Senator Bolkus just has—at the time of the Bali memorial is typically irresponsible, reckless of him in his duty as a parliamentarian and highly insensitive, because both sides of parliament should be united in the security platform of this country; it should not be a matter of division at all. Quite frankly, where there has been division it has come from the opposition. It is very untimely to raise this matter in the parliament, at least this week. 
As I said, it is an absolutely absurd proposition to say that now, based on an article in the newspaper—no less than the Sunday Age, what credibility!—all of a sudden all the efforts of the government's counter-terrorism actions since September 11 are in some sort of disarray. It is disrespectful, it is untrue and it is scaremongering at its worst, at the worst possible time. In fact, this government has sought to go even further than it has already, though satisfied with the actions it has taken up to this stage of coordinating agencies such as ASIO, ASIS, AFP and the defence and special forces. They are all properly coordinated and all cooperating, but this government has, in its time, sought to go further in the security of this nation and its citizens, but it has been blocked by the opposition.
An example of this is the ASIO bill. It was dragged through every possible committee in the Senate, delayed and ultimately rejected. The full powers that ASIO required—and this government's judgment of what powers were necessary for ASIO to act—were denied and rejected by the opposition. They were watered down to the extent that we had to accept a sunset clause on those powers—those new powers given to ASIO will terminate within three years, I believe. Who could possibly think that the war on terror will be finished in three years? We all know that we need at least a decade of dedication to the war on terror. What absurdity the parliament has placed on the powers of ASIO. The opposition has brought delay and frustration to the government's efforts in relation to counter-terrorism.
Nevertheless, the government believes that all agencies are cooperating and all ministries are cooperating. All it seeks is the cooperation of the opposition in regard to counter-terrorism. Not only do we in the parliament have a vested interest in the security of Australia, but also we have a Prime Minister, uniquely, with a personal interest in this. Let us not forget that our Prime Minister was in Washington on September 11, which began the war on terror. He has a personal and emotional involvement in this war on terrorism—as it was so dubbed by Mr Beazley. We have a Prime Minister who is not going to allow, as the opposition will try, this issue to become a dispute between a senior and a junior minister. It is an absolutely absurd proposition. It is an opportunistic proposition, and it is made at the wrong time.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>National Security</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2003-10-13,"—I rise to take note of answers given by the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, in response to questions asked by Senator Ludwig. As has been mentioned here today, a report in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald relayed an interview with Mr Ruddock in which he foreshadowed heavier focus on national security in his portfolio of Attorney-General's. This was said to be on the order of the Prime Minister.
It is useful to go over the chronology of events in relation to security matters and the way that responsibilities have been switched around between ministers over the past few years. At the end of this chronology, senators will be aware—it is pretty obvious—that the government is simply not up to scratch when it comes to security arrangements.
The rearrangement that we read of this morning is the third rearrangement of security responsibilities in the past two years. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, took on board Labor's 10-point plan released in October 2001 and followed many of Labor's suggestions regarding security arrangements, including increasing funds to ASIO and security organisations and extending counter-terrorism capabilities. Because the Attorney-General at the time, Mr Williams, was not hitting the mark, the Prime Minister appropriated those responsibilities in October 2002. He said: 
To ensure that the Commonwealth optimises its arrangements for strong policy coordination between the Commonwealth, States and Territories, I have asked my Department to take on the lead role for counter-terrorism policy coordination. The Attorney-General's Department will continue to have responsibility for operational coordination on these issues.
Just seven months later, the Prime Minister set up `Security Central' in his own department, Prime Minister and Cabinet, rearranging the defence branch on 23 May this year. He told the media:
It is in no way a de facto homeland security department, we don't need a homeland security department, and our coordination arrangements in this area do work very well.
Today we read that the Attorney-General, Minister Ruddock, will be pillaging the former responsibilities of Senator Ellison in order to boost his own security powers. To be quite blunt about it, it seems that Senator Ellison has been rolled. It is ironic, because on 10 October 2001 the Prime Minister said:
... can I tell you the thing that really matters is what you do, not how many ministries you have or how many bureaucrats you have or a turf war between shadow ministers.
That is exactly what we have here—a turf war between two ministers, between Minister Ellison and Minister Ruddock. This has been played out to the detriment of the security of Australians. Mr Ruddock's pronouncements that were reported today will mean more administrative arrangements, more confusion, more chance of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing in order to protect Australians. This underlines again that Australia needs one senior cabinet minister in charge of national security, running a department of home affairs, instead of the rearrangement of responsibilities every three months as this government has been doing.
The ALP announced in the 2001 election that we have a plan to create a cabinet level minister for home affairs. This responsibility would have covered and overseen all Commonwealth security functions outside those provided by Defence, including law enforcement, counter-terrorism, aviation security and telecommunications interception. We also would have set up a coastguard to protect Australia's maritime borders 52 weeks of the year. It is this initiative that the Australian people need in the new climate that we live in post September 11 and October 12. We need a cabinet minister to have responsibility for these issues.

Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The 2001-02 Defence Annual Report covers a period of climactic events affecting Australian and world security. The terrorist attacks of 9-11 and the rise of non-state adversaries are causing nations to evaluate and reconsider their national defence strategies and priorities. Australia is not alone in this challenge.  
The review of the Defence Annual Report provides an opportunity to scrutinise the performance of Defence not only in delivering key services but also in how it is reacting to new security threats. Defence has recently established a Special Operations Command. A key component of this is the new Tactical Assault Group East and the Incident Response Regiment. A key challenge faced by Defence in providing these new capabilities is the provision of highly trained personnel.
The Australian Defence Force, particularly the Army, is subject to high operational tempo, which has implications for personnel, training and equipment. The committee examined how Defence is managing Army personnel and equipment. A key defence procurement program is the replacement of the FA18 and F111 combat and strike aircraft. The government has committed funding to the systems design and development stage of the Joint Strike Fighter, the F35, program. A decision on whether to purchase the F35 is not required until 2006. The committee examined the F35's capability, the transitional arrangements from the existing aircraft to the F35, and possible Australian industry involvement opportunities.
Financial management and performance reporting of defence outcomes and outputs are key requirements which ensure transparency and accountability to the parliament. The 2003-04 portfolio budget statements are an improvement over those of the previous year. Further improvements, however, are possible. Through the review of the 2001-02 Defence Annual Report, the committee recommends that the Department of Defence should (1) include in future portfolio budget statements cost data on the ADF reserve forces, including total cost data and cost data by service; and (2) respond to the measures proposed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute to improve Defence budgetary transparency, discussed on pages 99 to 105 of the ASPI Defence Budget Brief 2003-04.
In addition, the Department of Defence should provide information in its annual report: indicating and giving reasons for the key changes to defence capability which are identified in the next Defence Capability Plan; detailing the Army's personnel deficiencies and the measures being undertaken to address these problems; detailing the work and performance outcomes of the military inspector-general, military justice, of the Australian Defence Force; giving a description of the role, structure and function, including transition to new functions, of reserve forces, and the extent to which Army is blending them with regular units; and outlining Australia's role in the Joint Strike Fighter program, the projected cost, transitional arrangements and progress with Australian industry involvement in the program. The Department of Defence should include performance targets and objectives in its report. Subsequent annual reports should report outcomes against those targets and objectives.
The committee concludes that the implementation of these measures will enhance transparency and parliamentary accountability of defence operations. In conclusion, and on behalf of the committee, we would like to thank all those who have contributed to the review of the 2001-02 Defence Annual Report, and I thank the committee members for their input. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Through the review of the 2001-02 Defence Annual Report, the committee recommends that the Department of Defence should (1) include in future portfolio budget statements cost data on the ADF reserve forces, including total cost data and cost data by service; and (2) respond to the measures proposed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute to improve Defence budgetary transparency, discussed on pages 99 to 105 of the ASPI Defence Budget Brief 2003-04.
In addition, the Department of Defence should provide information in its annual report: indicating and giving reasons for the key changes to defence capability which are identified in the next Defence Capability Plan; detailing the Army's personnel deficiencies and the measures being undertaken to address these problems; detailing the work and performance outcomes of the military inspector-general, military justice, of the Australian Defence Force; giving a description of the role, structure and function, including transition to new functions, of reserve forces, and the extent to which Army is blending them with regular units; and outlining Australia's role in the Joint Strike Fighter program, the projected cost, transitional arrangements and progress with Australian industry involvement in the program. The Department of Defence should include performance targets and objectives in its report. Subsequent annual reports should report outcomes against those targets and objectives.
The committee concludes that the implementation of these measures will enhance transparency and parliamentary accountability of defence operations. In conclusion, and on behalf of the committee, we would like to thank all those who have contributed to the review of the 2001-02 Defence Annual Report, and I thank the committee members for their input. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Campbell, Sen Ian (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",LP,2003-10-13,"—by leave—The statement that I read is on behalf of Peter McGauran MP, the Minister for Science. The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Brown and agreed to by the Senate on 9 October 2003, and it relates to the provision of working documents of the independent working group which operated in 2002 to produce a report for the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council on `Beyond Kyoto: Innovation and Adaptation' as well as certain related correspondence and records of meetings between employees or representatives of Rio Tinto and the Minister for Science, his department or the Office of the Chief Scientist between 1 January 2002 to the present.  
I wish to inform the Senate that, in relation to item 1, the document was not provided in response to question on notice 1374 because Rio Tinto had advised that it had been provided as a work-in-progress to the working group for discussion purposes only and that it would be inappropriate to distribute it outside that group. In light of the Senate order, Rio Tinto has been invited to provide comments on whether it considers that its or Roam Consulting's commercial interests could be prejudiced by the tabling of the document. It would be reasonable to await consideration of any response before deciding whether the document should be tabled. In relation to items 2 and 3, in the time available it has not been possible to identify and examine all relevant documents. I propose to make a further statement when that process has been completed.",SENATE,"<title>EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TRAINING: ROAM CONSULTING</title>",<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,13,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-13,"—by leave—The request for documents by the Senate is on a very important matter. They are documents about the interrelationship between Rio Tinto and the government which has led to the disbursement of many millions of dollars in the field of energy and minerals. To be frank, they relate to the position of the Chief Scientist who works half-time with the government, advising the government and various working groups including the one the minister mentioned, but also as chief technologist for Rio Tinto, one of the biggest coal and aluminium producers in the country.
The questions are very clear. On point 1, the minister has indicated doubt that this document will be forthcoming because it is a work-in-progress document going to a working group which was deciding on the very matters that I have just talked about. If it is good enough for a working group to have a document which is making decisions about allocations of public moneys and/or energy policy in this country, it is good enough for this Senate to get that document. It is an argument that goes without countermanding, as far as the Greens are concerned. For the government then to move that it wants to provide a blind here by asking whether Rio Tinto or Roam Consulting could be tempted to say, `Yes, this is commercial-in-confidence,' as a means of preventing that coming before the Senate, is a form of behaviour which I do not accept, and I do not think the Senate should accept that either.
—It's a basic courtesy basically. You may not believe in a basic courtesy.
—We will see where the courtesy goes. On that, and the other two components of these documents requested by the Senate last week for this afternoon, the minister has simply said that the other documents are under consideration. That is not good enough.
—You haven't given them enough time.
—Responding to that interjection, the minister gave the Senate no time at all. It would facilitate the matter a great deal if the minister does give an indication to the Senate of the time required. Is it a day, is it a week or are we to be led down the path of this taking months? That is not acceptable. I ask whether the minister can give the Senate a time such as Wednesday night or Thursday night of this week for these documents to be prepared. We are prepared to be reasonable about that, and I think that is perfectly reasonable, but to simply say `Some time into the future' is not what such an order is about, and the minister owes it to the chamber to put when that time will be. I am sure that if we do not get that there will be a consequent motion. ",SENATE,"<title>EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TRAINING: ROAM CONSULTING</title>",<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,13,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2003-10-13,"—by leave—This question of the Chief Scientist's relationship with Rio Tinto has now been raised on a number of occasions. The opposition supported the return to order on the basis that I do think there are legitimate questions that ought be asked and answered—and I waited for Senator Ian Campbell to rise and I did not see any indication that he was rising. The Greens are basically asking the government whether they are seeking extra time to respond to this return to order, and I think that is a reasonable question, and it would be reasonable for the government to respond.
On the substantive question of whether there is a conflict of interest between the Chief Scientist and a major corporation for which he works part time, there is quite clearly a perception of a conflict of interest. I maintain the view, and I have stated it publicly, that I have no reason to doubt the integrity of the Chief Scientist. I have had no evidence put before me to suggest that the Chief Scientist has behaved improperly. I do think, however, that responding to these matters is one way of at least putting the case, and I would have thought it was in the government's interests to respond properly and thoroughly to what is a reasonable request for information.
I am led to believe—in fact, I know—that the Chief Scientist is a man of great professional stature within the scientific and research communities in this country. I know that he is a man whom the government relies on quite extensively for advice in a range of policy areas. For instance, he is the author of a report on a research mapping exercise which sets down the research capacity for this country as part of the government's forthcoming statement on Backing Australia's Ability II. The Chief Scientist has within his grasp the capacity to influence the direction of policy in this country. It is not therefore an unreasonable question to ask: is there pressure being brought to bear upon him from a major corporation that may well benefit directly from the decisions of government in these matters that are under consideration by the executive? What I say, however, is that it does not automatically follow that the bloke has acted improperly simply because he has a job with Rio Tinto.
The policy position that we argue is that this appearance of a conflict of interest which clearly exists ought to be resolved by making the position full time thus removing the circumstances whereby these questions can be raised. I am advised that Rio Tinto—and I have yet to confirm this with the Chief Scientist but I understand that he has confirmed it in other quarters—are paying him something like $700,000 a year and that the Commonwealth is probably paying him in excess of $200,000 a year. If it is true that his salary is of that size—and I say to you that has to be confirmed—I would like to confirm it. I would like to confirm it at Senate estimates but I cannot, because the government denied the Chief Scientist the capacity to appear before the Senate estimates, despite the fact that he was listed in the PBS as an officer reporting directly to the minister. When I raised this issue I was told that this was a mistake in the PBS, that the reporting line was not accurately recorded, that he was a consultant to the government. We have a situation where, under this government, a major public office appointment—namely, the Chief Scientist—is presented to this parliament as a consultant, not as a public servant. That is wrong; that is not appropriate. 
Now we have a situation where the government is appearing—and that is what I want clarification on—to deny the parliament basic information about the relationship between advice tendered and a major corporation. If it is the case that the Chief Scientist has provided advice based on Rio Tinto data and that has not been declared, then I think there is a serious problem. It is not to say that the advice is wrong; this is where I differ with the Greens. I think it has yet to be demonstrated that the advice is, in itself, wrong. The nature of scientific argument is that people will put a view from time to time—and I think that is very worthy and appropriate—which is challenged. The difference here, however, is that the source of the information has not been declared. 
In this particular case with regard to coal, I think the fact that there was such a controversy and that there were people on the other side of the argument from the Chief Scientist, including a range of authorities of very strong repute—namely, the Department of Energy in the United States, for instance—and a range of other sources, who lead me to the view that there does need to be further inquiry. That is why I say this is a reasonable request for documentation and information, and I trust that the government will treat it as such and now respond appropriately. I say, however, there is a more substantive structural problem in the way the government has sought to position this officer within the Public Service as a consultant, not as a public servant, and that the position is on a part-time basis. Under the Labor government this was a full-time position as it was regarded to be of such importance. This is a policy position that the government should now take.",SENATE,"<title>EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TRAINING: ROAM CONSULTING</title>",<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,13,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2003-10-13,"—I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade entitled Review of Foreign Affairs and Trade Annual Report 2001-02, together with the Hansard record of proceedings. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to this report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to have my tabling speech incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The report read as follows—
Mr President, I am pleased to present this report on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade.
This report comprises a review of the Annual Reports for 2001-02 of relevant portfolio agencies. The review was conducted on behalf of the Full Committee by three of its Sub-Committees—Foreign Affairs, Trade and Human Rights. The Defence Sub-Committee's report of its annual report review was tabled earlier. 
The review is the second that the Committee has undertaken. 
Annual reports of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade portfolio agencies stand referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for any inquiry the Committee may wish to make in accordance with a schedule tabled in the House by the Speaker.
The Committee decided early in this parliament to conduct reviews of relevant annual reports primarily with a view to making an active contribution to the processes by which the Parliament holds the Executive and its agencies to account.  
Its first review examined the annual reports 2000-01 from the Department of Defence, DFAT, AusAID and Austrade. It held two public hearings as part of this review, one convened by the Defence Sub-Committee and the other by the Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee. The reviews were wide ranging and gave the Sub-Committees the opportunity to survey policy, operational and management issues; to seek status reports on key issues of interest and to follow-up issues canvassed in earlier committee reports.
For this second review, the Committee decided to focus on the performance of agencies in delivering outcomes rather than focussing on subject matters of interest. The Committee also decided that the reviews should concentrate on a limited number of issues rather than the broad sweep approach of the previous year.
The Sub-Committees elected to develop separate programs of review. 
Foreign Affairs
The Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee held a half day public hearing calling representatives from DFAT, AusAID and also from the Australia-Indonesia Institute. 
DFAT's Annual Report 2001-02 described the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US as having had far-reaching consequences for DFAT's work in delivering consular and passport services. The Sub-Committee acknowledges this impact and commends staff for their dedication at the time of the crises and since. Although the Bali bombings occurred outside the period of this review, the Committee considers it appropriate to also acknowledge the undoubted impact of this crisis on staff and to express appreciation to all those involved in responding to that situation.
Not surprisingly, the issue of travel advisories received considerable attention. DFAT advised that it was working closely with the travel industry, particularly travel agents, as a means of disseminating travel advice. We look forward to hearing of any developments in this area.
Other matters examined in this review included support for businesses, services to State and Territory governments for overseas visits programs, support for policing in East Timor, and the Virtual Colombo Plan. 
We also examined the annual report of the Australia-Indonesia Institute with a view to achieving a broad understanding of the scope of the Institute's work, which is also of relevance to our current inquiry into Australia's relationship with Indonesia.
Trade
The Trade Sub-Committee held a half day public hearing calling representatives from DFAT and Australian Trade Commission (Austrade). In conducting the review of DFAT's trade portfolio, the Committee focused on Austrade, and trade promotion within the Department with particular reference to trade development through the Market Development Group, and trade policy coordination and business liaison.
In reviewing Austrade, the Committee focused on two main themes: client satisfaction and export impact.
In terms of measuring client satisfaction, Austrade has a range of mechanisms in place. Austrade has been working with the Australian National Audit Office to develop a robust system to accurately gauge client satisfaction and to audit Austrade's client satisfaction survey process. The Committee was also pleased to see that Austrade achieved quite acceptable performance in the region. For example, Austrade achieved 85% client satisfaction in Northeast Asia and 82% in Southeast Asia.
The Austrade Annual Report indicates that the export impact of their activities is $15.35 billion, double their target of $7 billion. This figure includes the value of goods exported with `light' Austrade involvement as well as where Austrade was more actively engaged. It is worth reiterating that while assessing Austrade's export impact is inherently difficult, the Committee pointed out that every effort should be made to ensure ambiguity is avoided.
The Committee also reviewed the overlap of state export promotion agencies and Austrade to identify where such duplication is wasteful and where it is complementary. The Committee was satisfied with Austrade's efforts to address this challenge through the `national trade consultation' process.
In conducting the review of DFAT's trade portfolio, the Committee focused trade promotion within the Department, with particular reference to trade development through the Market Development Group, and trade policy coordination and business liaison. 
The Market Development Group (MDG) coordinates the efforts of a number of portfolios and agencies on Australia's bilateral market access and market development priorities. The MDG focuses on high-priority, short-term opportunities identified in consultation with business.
The Committee reviewed the role of the Trade Development Division within DFAT. This division plays a key coordination role within the Department, including managing a range of consultative processes including the Trade Policy Advisory Council and the National Trade Consultations.
The Committee also reviewed the transparency of WTO negotiation requests as part of the WTO negotiation process and the value of pursuing bilateral trade concessions in light of the WTO multilateral negotiation rounds.
Human Rights
In conducting the review the Human Rights Sub-Committee focused on the AusAID 2001-02 Annual Report with particular reference to Australia's engagement with multilateral organisations, governance and health. The Human Rights Sub-Committee held a half day public hearing calling on representatives from AusAID.
Multilateral Organisations
Australia makes significant contributions to multilateral organisations. The Committee reviewed the efficiency and effectiveness of AusAID's monitoring of the relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of the multilateral agencies and the outcomes of Australia's contributions to them.
Overall, AusAID satisfied the Committee of the efficiency and effectiveness of its performance monitoring processes and utility of accountability mechanisms, and that contribution to forecast outputs appear to have been met.
Nevertheless, the Committee feels that it is crucial that Australia's relationship with multilateral organisations is accountable and transparent to all stakeholders. In the interests of transparency the results of these processes should be made publicly available. There should be ongoing efforts to develop and refine appropriate accountability mechanisms and processes to ensure funds continue to be spent in the interests of Australia's international development goals.
Governance
The promotion of good governance in the region is one of AusAID's key result areas. In the period under review, governance accounted for 20 per cent of aid expenditure, with the aid program undertaking 307 activities with governance as the primary focus, with a cost of $308.3 million. Expenditure in other sectors that contributed to governance was a further $180.5 million.
In order to evaluate the performance of AusAID's governance activities, the Human Rights Sub-Committee selected for examination programs targeting the promotion of effective governance in PNG, Indonesia, Solomon Islands, East Timor and China, with reference to their relevance to the work of the Human Rights Sub-Committee and to Australia in general.
In assessing AusAID's performance according to AusAID's own performance evaluation methods, the Sub-Committee concluded that AusAID employs a wide range of evaluation methods that include both in-house and outsourced expertise, and is satisfied with the evaluation mechanisms employed.
Nevertheless, there are some matters of concern to the Sub-Committee. Governance remains a serious issue in the region which has a negative impact on regional security, as seen in the rapid deterioration in economic performance and security in the Solomon Islands. In this regard, the Committee supports:
	a vigorous, focussed approach to good governance;
	the continued focus on governance with appropriate ongoing funding; and
	the conduct of regular, independent and comprehensive reviews of AusAID's governance programs.
Health
Improving health outcomes in the region is a key result area of Australia's aid program. In the period under review, health accounted for around 13 per cent of expenditure, with the aid program undertaking 224 projects aimed at improving health outcomes, totalling $197.2 million. A further $83.4 million was spent on projects that contained a health component. 
In view of the rising incidence globally of the HIV virus and AIDS, the Committee resolved to focus on AusAID's efforts in relation to the pandemic. Indeed, a major effort has been made by AusAID in regard to sexually transmitted diseases (STD), including HIV/AIDS. 
In order to measure the effectiveness of AusAID's efforts in relation to HIV/AIDS, the Committee selected for review:
	the operation of the Global Aids Initiative, to which Australia has committed $200 million over 6 years;
	the HIV/AIDS prevention and care project in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (one of the poorest areas of China with the second highest number of HIV cases in the country); and
	strengthening of the capacity to mount and expand effective responses to the HIV/AIDs epidemic in China in central and local government levels through the Australian co-financed Health Nine World Bank project.
As one of the most populous nations currently in the grip of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, activities undertaken in China were selected for review to seek sample indicators of the effectiveness of AusAID-administered activities. The United Nations and World Health Organisation estimated in mid 2002 that 1 million people in China were living with HIV/AIDS.
The Sub-Committee explored these initiatives in some detail and is encouraged by the government's serious commitment to combating HIV/AIDS in the Asia Pacific region and AusAID's implementation, monitoring and evaluation of targeted programs and projects.
While many projects are in their early stages, the Committee will maintain a watching brief on the progress of these initiatives. 
Conclusion
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the agencies involved in this exercise.
The review exercises that the Committee has undertaken in the course of this parliament signals the Committee's interest in enhancing its scrutiny role. It is an important process and one that the Committee will continue to develop.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-13,"—I move:
That Amendment 46 of the National Capital Plan (Gungahlin Drive Extension-Black Mountain Nature Reserve), made under section 19 of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 be disallowed.
I move this disallowance motion because it, again, is a direct infringement on the important environmental amenity as laid down in the Walter Burley Griffin view of Canberra nearly a century ago and is part of an attrition of that natural amenity which we ought not be allowing when there are alternatives. I am indebted here to Save the Ridge campaigners, in particular to John Lowey, for providing information. I will take that information to explain to the Senate why this disallowance motion should be supported. The reasons are that the draft amendment, which I am moving to disallow, would severely impact on areas of high conservation value to the national capital—and I will come back to that. The environmental process undertaken so far of the areas affected by the draft amendment is at best questionable. The draft amendment is therefore inconsistent with the goal of the National Capital Plan as stated in the source legislation itself, which is to ensure that Canberra and the territory are planned and developed in accordance with their national significance. 
Draft amendment 41 was required to permit the proposed Gungahlin Drive extension to be built from the Barton Highway to Belconnen Way. This area includes remnant grassland adjacent to the suburb of Kaleen and dry sclerophyll woodland through the O'Connor and Bruce ridges adjacent to the Australian Institute of Sport. Now we have draft amendment 46, which is required to allow the proposed section of the Gungahlin Drive extension to continue from Belconnen Way but through Black Mountain Nature Reserve to the Glenloch Interchange. The purpose of this draft amendment is to modify the boundary between the `urban areas' land use policy and the `national capital open space system'. 
The amendment, which I am opposing, would move the boundary between Black Mountain Nature Reserve and the Gungahlin Drive extension road reserve further east into Black Mountain Nature Reserve. Both the O'Connor and Bruce ridges and Black Mountain Nature Reserve are areas of native bushland that have been specifically set aside for protection in the Canberra plan of Walter Burley Griffin. I did note Senator Humphries's comment that Canberra's planning has been built around the use of the car. But was this part of that plan? I do not think so. Was the preservation of Black Mountain part of the plan? I do think so. Even if it were true that the planning was for cars—I think it was for people as a national capital—I have never believed that was a dominant component of the planning for this great capital of ours. I think there has to be a very urgent reassessment indeed of the idea coming from the government that the car dominates and that planning requirements should be set aside, like we are seeing right here and now, to allow that domination to continue, even if it does mean rolling back the environmental amenity and death by a thousand cuts to particularly the native and natural environmental amenity of this great city.  
Black Mountain is the host of a rich diversity of native flora and fauna, some of which are restricted to the ACT and found only on Black Mountain. Intrusion of a road into the reserve not only sets a precedent for the destruction of valuable inner city bush elsewhere in order to build freeways—and that is contrary, as I said, to the Burley Griffin concept and plan; the required environmental studies to determine whether building a road will result in an irreplaceable loss of Australia's dwindling fauna and flora have not been carried out satisfactorily. That means completely. Canberra Nature Park is the nature reserve that protects the ACT's hills, ridges and buffers from development, including the mountain. It gives Canberra its bush capital character and that is one of its unique features. There are few national capitals, if any, in the world that have such ecological riches so close to the city centre. In these days of increasing environmental awareness and ecotourism, we should be protecting these assets on ecological, economic and social grounds rather than diminishing them. The extension road would destroy much native habitat of conservation value, including of high-conservation value, and put endangered, vulnerable and near-threatened species at risk. I will come to those matters in a moment.
In particular, Black Mountain reserve is regarded by the community as the jewel of the ACT's ecological crown, at least in the city, being the highest quality vegetation and fauna habitat within Canberra National Park. The extension would encroach up to 65 metres into Black Mountain Nature Reserve, up to 85 metres when roadside vegetation outside the reserve is included and 10 to 15 metres into Aranda bushland along Caswell Drive when proposed construction areas are included. The road would also fragment the grassland and other habitat at Glenloch Interchange. In reality, construction impacts go far beyond the actual areas used. Furthermore, there would be more habitat loss arising from the need to reroute cycle paths, fire trails and walking tracks within the national park and from fuel reduction burning where the forest is adjacent to the Gungahlin Drive extension.
Black Mountain reserve encompasses an area of 450 hectares, and it has over 500 plant species on record. It is considered to be, floristically, the richest area of the ACT, according to the Department of Capital Territory Nature Guide 1976. There are at least 54 orchid species recorded in that reserve. Many orchid species from this site are not found elsewhere in the ACT, and their loss from Black Mountain would mean their extinction from the ACT. The following is a list of orchid species that are found exclusively in this survey area and nowhere else in the ACT—and Senator Humphries and others might like to comment on this: Acianthus collinus,Calochilus paludosus,Chiloglottis trapeziformis,Corunastylus sagittifera,Diplodium truncatum,Lyperanthus suaveolens,Orthoceras strictum,Paracaleana minor and Petalochilus mentiens. Not only are some very rare ACT orchid species found exclusively at sites on Black Mountain but also there are other rare species on Black Mountain. Their loss is likely to have a significant effect on their chance of survival in the ACT. They include Arachnorchis sp. Aff; Tentaculata, rare in the ACT but well represented at one site on Black Mountain; Calochilus sp. aff. Campestris, possibly endemic to the ACT; Cyrtostylis reniformis,which is rare in the ACT although there are good populations on Black Mountain; Diuris semilunulata, confined to the Southern Tablelands with a large population on Black Mountain; and Stegostyla congesta, which is very rare in the ACT and southern tablelands although there are good populations on Black Mountain. 
To put the high biodiversity of the terrestrial orchid population in the Black Mountain area into perspective, the following is a very good summary of the situation. Over half of all species of orchids located in the ACT are found in this area. Black Mountain has about twice the number of native orchid species recorded for the state of California—30 species—and more than the number of species recorded for both Great Britain and Ireland—50 species. Mount Richmond National Park in western Victoria, a park noted for its very rich floral diversity of 450 species, has 50 recorded species of orchids in an area of 1,733 hectares—that is fewer than on Black Mountain—and all plants and animals in that park are protected.
The draft amendment, which the Greens oppose, bases its assertions on a preliminary assessment for the western alignment of November 2002 which assessed a number of environmental issues related to the western alignment of the Gungahlin Drive extension. Given the information presented above, we find unacceptable the preliminary assessment report conclusion that no further environmental studies would be required when a number of the consultants' reports included as attachments to that assessment do recommend such studies—for example, Fitch in relation to air quality studies on elite athletes and Hogg in relation to environmental impacts. It is therefore unacceptable that, although the ACT Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991 provides for more thorough assessments such as a public environment report or an environment impact statement, neither has been prepared in this case.
In addition, there are concerns about the validity of the preliminary assessment's environmental assessment itself—that is in attachment 10. The task of an environmental assessment consultant is to provide impartial, independent information to allow the government and the community to make an informed decision on whether or not the environmental damage—or benefits—which would result from a proposed development going ahead is justified. However, it is clear from attachment 10 that the consultant has accepted a priori that the extension will go ahead and his judgment has been swayed as a consequence. How often have we seen that failure in the starting position if not the concluding position of consultants? For example, the consultant writes that, while a selective tree survey might be useful in identifying trees to be protected along the margins of the roadwork's corridor, there is no point in surveying trees within the road alignment which will need to be removed irrespective of their quality. This attitude is unacceptable, I am sure you will agree, Mr Acting Deputy President.
The draft amendment asserts that most of the more important orchid sites on Black Mountain Nature Reserve would not be affected and specific measures can be implemented to minimise impacts, without fully elaborating on the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures. I invite Senator Humphries to comment on this and to come back with whether or not he accepts this report. As for one foreshadowed measure, the statement in the draft amendment that orchids can be `translocated to another suitable site within Black Mountain Reserve' is very similar to the speculation by a former minister of this place in the Fraser government that the Huon pine trees in the Franklin Dam flood area could be preserved by lifting them out of the valley and planting them on top of the ridges. It shows a crass inability to understand ecological systems, not least orchids. Past experience shows that very few terrestrial orchids survive introduction to new areas owing to their specific nutrient requirements and their obligate associations with soil microbes and insect pollinators. That assertion is well known to people who are interested in orchids and you can find reference to that in Jones et al, 1999. Consistent with these concerns, the draft amendment should be disallowed. 
I sum up by saying this. Black Mountain Nature Reserve is the nature feature of the national capital. Not only is it known for its natural profile in the middle of a growing city of 300,000 people—the largest inland city in Australia—but it is packed full of very important rare and endangered orchids. I have not mentioned the inevitable elimination of other flora and fauna and the animals of the day and the night which will be excluded by this proposed road in this reserve. The question is: how can it be that we cannot defend the integrity of a national park in the heart of the national capital? What sort of a signal is that to the rest of the country? Is it not us in this parliament who should say national parks are inviolate? You do not chop bits out of them because somebody comes along with another new proposal, be it for a road, a woodchip mill, a mining operation or urban expansion. You just do not do it. 
We are in difficult enough straits in Australia because of our confederate system, which is different from the US, where land use is a federal priority; here it is the states priority. If you have the federal parliament saying that in the centre of our own national capital you can chomp a big piece out of the most prominent national park—with rare species in that park—how is the national parliament going to keep pressure on the whole national estate of national parks in Australia? It is not only the wrong thing to do by the ACT; it is the wrong signal to send to the rest of the country.
In coming weeks I will be raising the matter and pursuing in this parliament moves by Australian mining companies to remove eight million hectares of rainforest in Indonesia from protection status. There is pressure by the Australian government—and it has happened on at least 15 occasions in recent times—on the Indonesian government to degrade Indonesian national parks, including rainforests, and to allow commercial exploitation. A little of that rot is here in the ACT.
I am sure people will argue that the area in question is 65 metres along part of Black Mountain, or it is 10 metres here or it is 85 metres there; who cares? That is the argument: if you take a little strip along the side or even across the Mona Lisa, most of it is still left there; why worry? Why worry about the scratch across your Beethoven record? It is not taking up much space. You get this serial degradation based on the argument that it is only a minimal impact that is occurring at a time when, as far as native ecosystems are concerned, Australia is suffering the greatest loss in history. 
I am sure that the Democrats will continue to support the protection of native bushland in the ACT as they have done so well in the past. But I say to the opposition and the government, if it is in your mind to vote against the Greens motion: where do you put an end to this? You tell us which national park in Australia you would not take a little piece of for a compelling reason like an expressway because there has been urban expansion. It is not and should not be allowed. That is why I have made such a strong submission this afternoon on what might seem a minor matter to some, but it is a major matter to local residents—to people who have been fighting to protect this woodland and this piece of national park. They are right; once you allow the scissors to carve a bit out of the map, the bulldozers to carve a bit out of the national park, you are into the death by a thousand cuts—a bit more will not hurt either. We should be mature enough as a nation to say, `No; national parks are inviolate.' Every survey done in Australia shows that that is what people think. It is backed up by 80 to 90 per cent of people. They do not want roads in national parks. This parliament will not be representing that sentiment if it does not support the Greens motion. ",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN (GUNGAHLIN DRIVE EXTENSION)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-10-13,"—I rise to oppose the motion of disallowance which Senator Brown has moved. To explain why, I think that the motion on his part is an overreaction to the proposal that has been put forward, essentially by the ACT government but which facilitates an earlier decision made by the ACT government and, indeed, by this parliament, to support the building of the Gungahlin Drive extension down a corridor between North Canberra and Belconnen.
Only a few weeks ago the Senate voted on a disallowance motion moved by Senator Brown to draft variation 41. At that time the Senate endorsed the capacity of the territory to proceed to build the road which has been proposed on this occasion to the east of the Australian Institute of Sport. I have some doubt as to whether, having made the decision to allow that variation to proceed, it is now possible to go forward and say the road should proceed as indicated by the Senate to the east of the Australian Institute of Sport but should end abruptly on Belconnen Way and not be able to proceed as would be necessary, given the alignment of the road, to the other side of Belconnen Way, to more closely follow the route of Caswell Drive beside Aranda, down to the Glenloch Interchange. It may be possible to have one and not the other but, from the maps that I have seen, I have grave doubts about whether in fact that is the case. I would say to the Senate that a case needs to be made for us to have the capacity to accept draft variation 41 and then not accept draft variation 46 to the National Capital Plan.
I said that the arguments that Senator Brown has put forward today have an element of exaggeration in them, and I think that is the case. He has put forward, essentially, an argument based on the integrity of the Black Mountain reserve and has said that it is an area of high conservation value and should be retained in its present form and that this variation unacceptably impinges on the conservation value of that area.
Let me say first of all that I completely agree with Senator Brown in describing Black Mountain reserve as an area rich in flora and fauna; an area of very significant environmental value to the ACT and, indeed, to the whole Australian community. It is the home of a large number of significant species of plant and animal, and it deserves to be protected appropriately to ensure that those species survive. Senator Brown made reference to the orchids which grow on the reserve, and I have heard about the value of those orchids in the past as well. During the time that I was minister for the environment in the ACT I was told about a large number of rare species of frog that live on the reserve. In fact, it was put to me that there are more species of frog to be found on Black Mountain reserve than are to be found in the entire British Isles. That is what I was told. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of that statement, but it certainly sounded credible to me at the time. So there is no dispute about the fact that this is an area of very significant environmental value. 
The question on which I think Senator Brown and others in this place would differ is whether or not the proposed variation amounts to a significant impingement on that environmental value. Senator Brown made reference to the size of the encroachment into Black Mountain reserve. In fact, on my advice, the encroachment averages about 35 metres—35 metres beside an existing road; an area already somewhat degraded.
—That is an average.
—That is an average. It does extend, as Senator Brown suggested, beyond 35 metres at some points, up to approximately 90 metres. But it averages 35 metres. You would think, from what has been said by Senator Brown, that the proposal is to put a road through the middle of the reserve—
—No, I didn't say that.
—You did not say that, but what you said—trimming the Mona Lisa or putting a scratch across one's favourite Beethoven record—implied significant damage to the integrity of the area. I have a different analogy to use: I would equate it to a man who gets up in the morning and shaves his beard. I see you react with some alarm to that suggestion, Mr Acting Deputy President, as would I—until recently, at least.
 (Senator Bolkus)—I see that you have done it in part, Senator.
—I have in part, and I am sure I have improved as a result. But the extent of the encroachment on the integrity of the head in that case is about as extensive as the proposal which has been put forward by the National Capital Authority. It is extremely minor. If you were to look at a map of the entirety of the Black Mountain reserve on an A4 page, you would see that the size of the encroachment is so minor as almost to be invisible on a map of that description. It is a very small encroachment. I do not have a percentage in front of me, but if it went anywhere near one per cent of the total area of the reserve I would be extremely surprised. It would be a very small infringement on that area.
What is more, the area that is being infringed upon with this variation is, according to the preliminary assessment conducted by the ACT government, one that does effect the removal of some trees, shrubs and groundcover, but none of the species that will be affected are listed as nationally rare or threatened species. Yes, some trees have to be removed and yes, some shrubs, a small amount of vegetation and perhaps some habitats for some animals have to be removed, but none of those species identified as being threatened or rare at the national level—not one of them—will be affected. This was a survey conducted by the present ACT government, not the former ACT government.
I can say from my own experience of the area that it is already, in parts at least, significantly degraded. There are car parking spaces already infringing on this area where people have parked their cars, presumably for the purpose of going into the reserve. Those are the sorts of areas which are going to be taken out by this extension of the road reservation. I am sorry, Senator Brown, but it is a gross exaggeration to describe the area to be excised from the nature reserve as being of any environmental significance whatsoever. It is a gross exaggeration. Let me use other illustrations of that fact. The ACT community is extremely finely attuned to the question of encroachment on its environment. This community, more than any other, is prepared to go to the wall to defend the value of its environment. I and other people who have served in the ACT parliament know full well how strongly and passionately the ACT community feels about such questions. My assessment of the public reaction to this proposal is that there is much greater support for it than there is opposition to it. 
It is significant that Senator Brown has quoted in support of his arguments here today the Save the Ridge group. It is, essentially, a group that is based in the communities of O'Connor and Lyneham. It has been arguing for the retention of the bushland to the north of Belconnen Way—that is, the area about which the Senate voted earlier this year. There is a much older environmental support group: Friends of the Aranda Bushland—it is much older than the Save the Ridge group—which has been working for years to protect the environment around Aranda. To the best of my knowledge, that group has not taken the same view about this proposed road reservation as the Save the Ridge group.
I believe that the reason for that is that they understand the compromise to environmental values is fairly minimal and that the benefits to the residents of Aranda by virtue of this road reservation being made are significant—and, indeed, they are. I think that if the Friends of the Aranda Bushland had taken the same position on this that the Save the Ridge group has taken, I would pay a little more attention to what Senator Brown has had to say but, to the best of my knowledge, they have not. In those circumstances, I take the suggestion of a threat to the environmental values of the area with a very large grain of salt.
After the events of earlier this year, I am surprised that any member of this place needs to be reminded of the other important consideration in widening that road reserve. There was, as I am sure every senator is well aware, a very serious fire emergency in this territory in January. That saw large parts of the Bush Capital burn, particularly places where there was inadequate protection of the urban interface against the bush. One area that, thankfully, did not burn during that emergency was the Black Mountain reserve. If it had burnt, the effect on the rest of the ACT community would have been extremely significant.
—It came very close to burning.
—Fire burnt right up to the Glenloch Interchange, and it was only through the valiant efforts of volunteer and employed firefighters that it was prevented from crossing the interchange and getting into the Black Mountain reserve itself. The impact on the city would have been enormous had that been the case. We cannot exclude the possibility of fire in that reserve in the future, as there has been fire in the not very distant past. The widening of the road reserve, where Caswell Drive presently lies, will help better protect the people of Aranda from any fire which may occur in that area.
—So you bulldoze it to save it from burning!
—That is an argument that has been had outside this place before, Senator Brown. It is a very real argument, and it is an argument you cannot get away from. But it is sometimes necessary to take the step of clearing bushland in order to protect properly both the environmental values of other parts of that bushland and the urban interface that it abuts. From a firefighting view, I think there would be very few people who would argue that that road reserve being enlarged would not assist in the protection of Aranda from fire. That is a significant argument, and I think it cannot be ignored in this debate. 
The broader argument is really about the necessity of proceeding with the road, which has been designated by this ACT government—and previous ACT governments—as an important priority for the infrastructure of the territory. The road itself is necessary. It is an important part of the infrastructure of the ACT. It cannot be substituted by enhanced public transport, for example. Only today I spoke to an ACT resident who happens to work in this building, and he said he intends to move from Gungahlin because he is sick of the daily crawl along existing clogged roads to get to this building in order to do his job. He reflects the view, in making those comments, of a large number of other people who live in Gungahlin and who are sick of being unable to access other parts of the city in the way that residents elsewhere in Canberra can. We have no right to block the building of that road, and I suspect that the passing of this disallowance motion would affect that because it is incompatible with the route already designated to the north of Belconnen Way. It is therefore important that we proceed to back the decision the Senate made earlier this year in reserving the road, as part of draft variation 41.
Senator Brown suggested that, because Australians are of the view that national parks are inviolate, we should not proceed to make this variation and encroach on this reserve. I am sure you would appreciate, Senator Brown, that the Black Mountain Nature Reserve is not a national park. I am also sure that if most members of the community, after having put forward the view that national parks are inviolate, were asked whether they thought a variation to a national park that would affect perhaps one-tenth of one per cent of the park would be acceptable, they would not be so zealous as to deny that kind of variation—particularly when it enhanced the safety of residents who abutted that piece of reserved area. I think the argument for this disallowance motion has not been made. It is a very small encroachment on the integrity of the reserve. I would be the first person in this place to rise and argue for the maintenance of the integrity of the reserve, but I do not believe that—no matter which way you look at it—such an argument can be put forward in respect of this variation.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN (GUNGAHLIN DRIVE EXTENSION)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-10-13,"—Labor will be opposing this disallowance motion, although not for the exact same reasons as Senator Humphries has articulated. The point I would like to make that best represents Labor's view is in relation to the fact that this has been a hotly contested and debated issue within the ACT for such a long time. We have had debates here previously on the issue of the Gungahlin Drive extension. There have been many reports, some of better quality than others, on the merits and otherwise of the various proposed routes of the Gungahlin Drive extension. The bottom line is that the elected government of the ACT have determined that a road to alleviate the difficulties facing Gungahlin residents is one of their highest priorities. To the extent that they were forced to accept a route effectively imposed on them by the National Capital Authority, they have determined to take the road through the eastern route. That compromise position was very difficult to take. The decision we are now discussing—on the encroachment on the Black Mountain reserve—falls into exactly the same category: it was an extremely hard decision to make in the face of competing priorities.
I have no doubt there are some environmental values and that the preferred approach would be to be able to preserve those. I accept that. What I do not accept, given the debate that has occurred at the local level under the auspices of the ACT Legislative Assembly, is that it is appropriate for the federal parliament to effectively veto that. I do not think that would make the action of the federal parliament any better than what I saw as the unreasonable veto by the National Capital Authority on the proposed western alignment for the Gungahlin Drive extension. I felt that was an inappropriate intervention and I put this debate into the same category. I know the same people who are expressing these concerns have had the opportunity to make their concerns known to the elected members of the ACT assembly. I am full of confidence—indeed, I rely upon—their ability to make a judgment about those competing priorities, given that they form the elected body. I do not believe there are grounds for a disallowance in terms of the role that we have in safeguarding Canberra's role as the national capital. I do not believe there is a crossover with this issue. 
I will not take up any more of the Senate's time, other than to say that I do respect the concerns and issues raised by advocates of environmental protection in the area. It is a sensitive area. Those issues have been taken into account in the decision by the ACT government to proceed with the extension in the way it has. I think it is appropriate for the Senate to respect that decision and move forward. I therefore oppose this disallowance motion.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN (GUNGAHLIN DRIVE EXTENSION)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-10-13,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to express our support for the disallowance motion that has been moved in the chamber today relating to a proposed amendment to the National Capital Plan. This is in addition, as others have pointed out, to previous comments and debate in this place on this issue. I am very mindful of the issue of jurisdiction to which Senator Lundy just referred. She and others know that this is clearly going to be an ongoing debate, particularly when you have a very powerful, unelected federal agency in the form of the NCA, which seems to have quite extraordinary powers when it comes to planning and other issues in relation to the Australian Capital Territory. Nonetheless, the Australian Democrats do have a representative in the ACT assembly, Ms Roslyn Dundas, who has put on record on a number of occasions her opposition to the Gungahlin Drive extension—and, more specifically now, in relation to the Black Mountain nature reserve aspect of that extension.
There has been some debate in the chamber—although it was a little underground—between senators about whether or not the draft amendment should have been dealt with in this form or at the time the other part of this debate was before the Senate. I certainly have some sympathy for that argument; we should have been dealing with both aspects of the amendments. However, as we have the opportunity to debate this today, I again put on record the views of the Australian Democrats. I will refer to a bit of the history of this debate—though not in great detail—and to the issues that are specific to the Black Mountain nature reserve. The purpose of draft amendment 46 is to modify the boundary between the urban areas land use policy and the national capital open space system. The boundary is represented in the location of Aranda as the boundary between the Black Mountain nature reserve and the Gungahlin Drive extension reserve.
A few years ago now, in 2000, the ACT government initiated some action to confirm the alignment of the Gungahlin Drive extension between the Barton Highway and the Glenloch Interchange, as part of its investigation into the design of the GDE as it passes the suburb of Aranda, to which the ACT government has sought to refine the boundary of the road reserve to achieve a balance between the impacts on Black Mountain nature reserve and the residential suburb of Aranda. While there have been a number of assessments, the preliminary assessment indicated that the design of the GDE, as a parkway, will be to the east of the existing Caswell Drive alignment. The design retained Caswell Drive as an off-ramp from the GDE and included a south bound on-ramp from Caswell Drive that would cross over the GDE. That design sought to reduce the impact on Aranda residents by maintaining local access to the suburb while minimising the noise impacts that may come from future traffic loads on the new road. However, this means that the new design, or that design developed for the GDE past Aranda, requires significant intrusion into the existing Black Mountain nature reserve. It cuts a 65-metre swathe into the reserve, further exacerbating the concerns that have previously been raised in the Senate about the potential environmental degradation that the eastern alignment could potentially inflict on valuable bushland. 
The Senate has been over the electoral history of this debate: the fact that the Labor Party went to the last election promising to protect the Bruce and O'Connor ridges. We understand that, in the face of opposition from the National Capital Authority, that promise was overturned. Just before Christmas last year the NCA announced that it would not support a road to the west of the Australian Institute of Sport. The basis for this decision was the alleged concern for the health of athletes, claims about which were brought into doubt by the Fitch report, which I have referred to in previous debates on this issue. The NCA instead forced a road to the east of the AIS through valuable urban bushland where many athletes train. This was an unfortunate decision, as we have been over; but also unfortunate was the decision by the Stanhope government not to challenge that decision by the National Capital Authority. Again, that relates to some of the jurisdictional issues that have been raised in this place.
The Democrats went to the last election with a very clear policy on this: we oppose the eastern alignment of the GDE. Roslyn Dundas has made it clear that she will stick to that commitment. She has been involved in many of the debates on these issues in the assembly and has articulated in the media and in the community on many occasions her opposition to the eastern route. I have certainly placed on record our concern both in the Senate and, obviously, through the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories.
I think Senator Humphries's comments about the Canberran and ACT community being finely tuned when it comes to environmental issues is an astute observation. I suspect he has been perhaps more in the thick of it than many of us here and perhaps is in a position to assess that public reaction. Certainly the reaction that the Democrats have been aware of is one that seems very heated and very strong. The Save the Ridge campaign has been mentioned in the Senate a number of times today, and I think it is a catchcry of which we are all increasingly aware. Certainly the community viewpoint has been very strong and very angry for a range of reasons, not least of which is the environmental impact.
One of the main concerns in this debate has been the environmental devastation that many believe would be caused by the eastern alignment of the GDE. We do accept that perhaps there are environmental considerations with the western and the eastern routes, but we believe that the eastern alignment is the less preferable option. We are concerned about the ACT government's dogged determination to push the Gungahlin Drive extension through the east, despite this overwhelming public concern and also evidence that suggests there are environmental and other impacts. The government has maintained its stance regardless of community concern. Besides major public opposition to the eastern option, there is also some evidence to suggest that the western route could be better—it could be more economical, it may have less environmental impact and it may arguably be more efficient than the eastern route. The eastern route could require the running of an inferior highway up and down slopes through the most ecologically significant parts of valuable bushland. 
I will not go on about the electoral impact of this issue, but I think it is important for people to note that this does involve a broken promise. Whether or not the Labor Party in the ACT put up a sufficient fight is clearly a debate that continues to rage within the community—that is, the territory government made clear its concerns to the NCA, but how far it could pursue those concerns and what kind of a fight it could put up for a whole range of reasons is something that we will debate far beyond this disallowance today. The Democrats remain concerned about the powers of the NCA. We are concerned that, as a consequence not only of this draft amendment but of the decision more generally, valuable bushland could be destroyed. This bushland provides a rare and valuable inner urban recreational amenity as well as a habitat for wildlife. It is enjoyed and has been enjoyed by generations of Canberrans.
I am not going to attempt today to read out the names of the various orchid species that are claimed to be threatened as a consequence of this decision. Suffice to say that many orchid species from this site are alleged to not be found anywhere else in the ACT. Indeed, it is claimed that their loss from the Black Mountain area would actually result in their complete extinction. I think that is what Senator Brown was trying to interject when that conversation about beards was taking place. Senator Brown was taking that one step further, suggesting it was not so much that you are shaving off something that can be replaced but that you are actually nicking the skin. I think the idea was to illustrate deleterious impact, but I am not quite sure how effective the beard analogy is in this case. Suffice to say there is a real concern that we will see the extinction of those very rare orchid species to which all speakers have referred. I think that is something that is certainly driving a key part of this campaign and an issue that should be taken into account.
My colleague Roslyn Dundas, on behalf of the Democrats in the ACT, and I, on behalf of the Democrats on a federal level, believe that transport planning for the people of Canberra and the Capital Territory is a big issue—that relates to a debate earlier in this place—and that there has been an ineffective allocation of funds to that particular area. We want to see a scheme developed that focuses on the needs of the ACT for the next few decades—not just the next few years—and that takes into account everything from road structures through to issues of paid parking, broader issues of environmental sustainability and, of course, the specific issue of money and resources for public transport. We will be supporting the disallowance of amendment 46 of the National Capital Plan (Gungahlin Drive Extension—Black Mountain Nature Reserve) as part of our long-running campaign and our opposition to that route. We will watch with interest not only the outcome of this vote but, if this fails today, with interest and concern to see what happens as a consequence of the construction of that route.
Question negatived.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL CAPITAL PLAN (GUNGAHLIN DRIVE EXTENSION)</title>,<title>Motion for Disallowance</title>,Miscellaneous,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-10-13,"—Over the weekend the Greens have held a national conference, and I can report to the Senate that we will be mounting a nationwide campaign—particularly now that the Western Australian Greens are part of the Australian Greens, which is a great event—against the proposals by the Prime Minister for disempowering the Senate. Previous speakers have outlined those proposals. I think the Prime Minister, in announcing the document Resolving deadlocks: a discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution, pronounced that second word `dead luck', which may have been Freudian, because I do not think he is going to have the luck to get this past the Australian people. In the document, on page 32, the Prime Minister gives an indication of why he does not think the current situation—which allows a double dissolution if there are obstructed bills in the Senate, as the means of the government testing with the people whether it wants to take on the Senate and then go to a joint sitting and have the matter resolved—is good enough. The document says:
Facing the possible loss of seats in a full-Senate election ... and the potential loss of government altogether, it is a major risk for any government to call a double dissolution election.
So the Rt Hon. John Howard sees a double dissolution as risky. He is asking: why should a government have to face a risk—that is, being turned down by the people—in order to get its way? A curious contra argument is involved there—an argument against himself. If the Prime Minister is confident that there is legislation in this place which is being held up or blocked but for which he has a mandate then he should go to the people with confidence. It is hardly a rousing matter of confidence that he sees any government calling a double dissolution as taking `a major risk'. That points to the Prime Minister's diffidence about a double dissolution next year and the difficulty he sees in taking that course of action, much as he might want to try it out. I think it is a risky course of action for Prime Minister Howard, particularly when the matters he will put up as warranting that double dissolution, including the sale of Telstra, are so profoundly unpopular out there in the electorate.
I was amazed, at the weekend, at the collapse within the National Party, against the wishes of its own constituents, of the move to protect Telstra from privatisation. I do not think that majority out there in the bush—and it is over 80 per cent—is going to support the government if it calls a double dissolution, amongst other things, on the matter of selling Telstra. No doubt the Prime Minister does know it is a risk, and he is right.
On page 30 of the document, the Prime Minister says this:
While the democratic compact encourages a diversity of views, to be effective it requires respect from those who hold the balance of power over the express platform upon which the government of the day was elected.
He ought to take off his blinkers about that. It takes every bit the same size vote to put somebody into the Senate as it does to put somebody into the House of Representatives. The parties and the Independents represented in the Senate go to the people with a platform, no less than does Prime Minister Howard. We stand here because people have endorsed that platform. In the case of the Greens, we are here because we oppose the industrial relations demolition job—100 years of worker protection that the Howard government wants to undermine. We do oppose people having to face steep rises in pharmaceutical benefits. We do oppose the sale of Telstra, and many of the other issues for which the Prime Minister claims he has a mandate. As Senator Nettle said this morning, 43 per cent is hardly a mandate. 
Prime Minister Howard says, `I have a majority government.' Well, Prime Minister Howard, you have a minority vote. You only have a majority government because of one thing—that is, the House of Representatives is unrepresentative. It does not reflect the vote of the people, and that is highlighted by the fact that more people voted against the Howard government than voted for it. One million more voted against the Howard government than voted for it, but it is in government, and Prime Minister Howard is claiming a majority. He does not have majority support, nor does the Labor Party. There are a number of extremely effective Independents in the House of Representatives, but there would be a whole tranche more of them were there to be proportional representation in the House of Representatives.
That is why the Greens have released, prior to this paper from the Prime Minister, a discussion paper advocating our long-held policy of proportional representation in the House of Representatives. Mr Acting Deputy President Bolkus, you will remember me raising that a number of times in here, because it is the Labor Party which has protested most vociferously when I have done so. Whoever is opposing it is doing so, I think, for political rather than democratic reasons, because the democratic sense says you go for proportional representation.
Mr Acting Deputy President Bolkus, what will be of particular interest to you because you are from South Australia is the role of South Australia in the whole debate on proportional representation in Australia. As a Tasmanian I am pretty proud of the fact that Andrew Inglis Clark, an Attorney-General of the 1890s, instituted proportional representation voting in Hobart and Launceston in 1897. It is little known that, because of that, the first House of Representatives members from Tasmania—the five of them—were elected on a proportional representation basis. They were the most fairly elected back in 1901. Each state elected their representatives according to the state's form of voting at the time.
Tasmania moved ahead of the rest of the country in democratic reform, thanks to Andrew Inglis Clark. However, he had a forerunner by a long shot. Her name was Catherine Helen Spence, and she is on the $5 note. But that is not why she is so important to this place. She was a world-renowned advocate—which is saying something for the 19th century—of proportional representation throughout most of that century, and she survived the first decade of the 20th century. A vote in 1841 in Adelaide involved proportional representation. In 1859, Catherine Helen Spence read the work of Mr Hare of the United Kingdom, who gave rise to the Hare-Clark system that is now used in Tasmania, Ireland, Malta, the Australian Capital Territory and many other places at least at local government level. John Stuart Mill became a proponent of this fair system. 
Catherine Helen Spence brought that system into the public domain in Australia, in particular through her pamphlet of 1861 called `A plea for a pure democracy'. It was a remarkable document. This was 140-plus years ago. Catherine Helen Spence released her document, paid for by her brother—it cost a thousand quid!—and, with great zeal, spread it about in South Australia and the other colonies. It gained great recognition in Britain. The document said: `Let's have proportional representation so that the voting system reflects as far as possible, in the most exacting way, the actual votes of the citizens.' Single member electorates do not do that; proportional representation does. Single member electorate systems allow us to have minority vote governments acting as a majority in the House of Representatives, like the current government, and therefore treating the House of Representatives—without the authority of the people, without the vote of the people that is commensurate with it—as a rubber stamp, and the executive rules. That is what the Prime Minister wants to do with the Senate through his reforms. 
Catherine Helen Spence's system, taken up by Andrew Inglis Clark, is quite different: if you get five per cent of the votes—if the quota is that low—you get five per cent of the representation. If Catherine Helen Spence's not only elegant but most democratic of systems of proportional representation were in play on a statewide basis in the House of Representatives today, not only would we have the current Independents—I believe that, statewide, they would easily get the two per cent to six per cent quota in their various states—but we would have a government with 43 per cent of the seats, an opposition with something like 37 per cent or 39 per cent of the seats, and the other 20 per cent or so of the seats would be taken up by the minor parties. The government might well argue that that cannot be countenanced—and I am sure the Labor Party would—but I tell you this: the only way you can argue that is by saying that a person who does not vote for the coalition or the Labor Party should have their vote devalued and discounted—their vote is not as important as a vote for the government or the Labor Party, and you go back to the old days of corrupt assertion that the person who could spend the most money could buy the most votes. It is not the same thing, but it says that one vote does not have the same value as another.
It is time this system was changed. It is time that Catherine Helen Spence was recognised as the founding mother of our democratic system. She was the first woman to stand for a democratically elected post in the Australian political system, although she stood for office in 1897 and was not elected. However, it was through her influence at those constitutional conventions of 1891 and 1897 that our Constitution allows for proportional representation in both houses of parliament. The Greens proposal—thank you, Catherine Helen Spence and Andrew Inglis Clark—does not require a change to the Constitution as does the Prime Minister's proposal. The Greens proposal for proportional representation brings more democracy into the parliament, as against less democracy under the Prime Minister's proposal. The Greens proposal means that one vote, one value is brought back into the system rather than the Prime Minister's proposal, which leaves in the House of Representatives one vote, one value provided you vote for the big parties but tries to take the much more democratic and proportionally represented members of the Senate and remove their essential powers.
The balance of power between the two houses is a cornerstone of our Constitution and, in particular, the structure of the Senate. The Senate was a states house of review. We all know that it does sometimes have that function, but it has become much more politically dominated, as was forecast 100 years ago. It has grown in stature in the public mind as an essential brake on the government of the day and an essential other equal vote for the citizens of Australia in a set of checks and balances between the two houses, which all the indications of past elections and recent opinion polls show the people of Australia want kept.
I would bet London to a brick on that, if Prime Minister Howard takes this issue to a referendum—if the Labor Party is blinkered enough to support it—he will lose it hands down. He will get a rollicking at the poll from the Australian people, because they like what the Senate does. They respect a house that has responsibly over these recent decades been a hand on the shoulder of government, a directing hand on occasions. It is very finite—98 per cent of legislation gets through but some parts do not. People in the Australian electorates respect that. The Senate has enormous kudos in Australia. We are not the Senate in the United States, we are not the House of Lords and we are not the abolished upper house in New Zealand. We are a democratically elected and responsible chamber keeping a brake on the excesses of rubber stamp democracy by an executive that treats the other half of this parliament as if it is not here. 
The decisions are made in the Prime Minister's office and they go to the cabinet. There is a loss of value in the representation in the House of Representatives because it is made. There is not going to be change there no matter how salient, incisive and important the matters are that may be generated by debate in the House of Representatives. That is where the Senate makes this parliament work. That is where the different nature of the Senate is essential for the excellence of the democracy that is delivered out of this parliament. If you take away the Senate, you will have a Prime Minister elected with total control to do or say what he or she wants. These proposals, particularly the proposal for a Prime Minister to have a joint house sitting, take just that configuration. Get a majority in the House of Representatives which is larger than the minority in the Senate of the governing party and that Prime Minister will in effect treat the whole of the parliament as a rubber stamp and will be unchecked in his or her ability to make decisions. Do you think the Australian people want that? No, they do not.
—And keep his promises.
—Senator Kemp interjects about, presumably, Labor and Liberal prime ministers keeping their promises. That interjection is important because you know how serially they cannot and do not. When it gets to the matters of parliament they deal with all manner of issues that are not involved in previous elections—that is the nature of it.
This Senate is much closer to the people. The committee system and the time lag since the introduction of legislation give the Senate the responsibility to reflect what people are thinking and to be a fail-safe mechanism, a backstop. The Greens stand very strongly against what the Prime Minister is proposing and for proportional representation in the House of Representatives, and we will take that to the ballot box next year if necessary.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,17,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-10-13,"—I was led to believe there would be a division on the previous matter before the Senate in respect of a motion moved by Senator Brown, but that was not the case.
 (Senator Sandy Macdonald)—Senator Murphy, you will need to seek leave to continue your speech.
—I seek leave to continue with my remarks.
Leave granted.
—I will just go back to the issue of resolving deadlocks and the document that has been circulated by the government and the Prime Minister. As I think I said earlier, on page 6 the document says:
First, the introduction of proportional representation in 1948—
this refers to the legislative changes that have been made since 1948—
taking effect in 1949, has fostered the development of minor parties.
This has been a valuable evolution in the representative character of the Australian Parliament.
Yet here we are debating a document that proposes to get rid of all that, that says we do not want to have a representative character in the parliament and that we want to have a rule by the government of the day approach. Our forefathers wrote the Constitution in the way they did for exactly that reason: they wanted to make sure that the parliament, and section 57 in particular, did not allow for governments of the day to run riot and roughshod over the public in general. They wanted to ensure that there were better outcomes. If you look back through the history of the parliaments in this country since 1901, at the number of times that the government of the day has had a majority in the Senate up until 1983—because 1983 also plays an important role as a date in the document entitled Resolving deadlocks—the governments of the day held control of the Senate on 19 occasions, and on 17 other occasions they did not. So that in itself is reflective of what the people want. Even under the proportional representation system, the system of election of the Senate, at a normal three-year half-Senate election the government of the day can still obtain a majority in the Senate—it can. 
One of the reasons that the people of Australia will ultimately reject what is proposed in this document is the fact that in more recent times governments hold to a practice in which they must win at all costs: `Let's get elected. It doesn't matter what we tell the public. We'll do other things after.' That has led to the diminution of the value that the general public place in politics and in politicians generally. Governments say one thing before the election and do something else after.
I find it difficult to understand how the Prime Minister and the government can argue for changes to section 57 for a popularly elected mandate that they cannot implement, when there have been governments that have said: `We'll never, ever introduce the GST,' and, `We won't sell more than one-third of Telstra.' We have heard others promise the l-a-w law tax cuts. There have been `core promises' and `non-core promises'. There have been attacks on Medicare and on education and changes to industrial relations, many of which have been proposed after the government has been elected. We have heard the `children overboard' and the `no children overboard' claims. There have been various claims about security and weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Often these issues lead people to decide how they will vote. Subsequently they turn out to be incorrect, and the public have been grossly misled. That is why the public choose to have a Senate structured in the way that it is structured. The real way to resolve deadlocks in this place is for the government to bring forward good legislation. When you consider how much legislative work is done through this chamber, deadlocks are not all that significant. The government achieves the great bulk of its legislative program.
Another aspect this document somehow tries to promote is that the minority has effective control over the majority. It does not matter whether you are an Independent or a member of a minority party, at the end of the day to oppose and defeat something coming through this place you have to have a majority of the votes. And I think the majority of the votes represents the majority view of the public.
Prime ministers have strived for all the power. They have thought that they were undefeatable. They have taken the approach of believing that everything that they say is exactly what the public wants. Yet I know of many issues on which, if you asked the public whether they support the government or the opposition position for instance, you might get a different outcome. There have been many polls, albeit conducted through the media, that have demonstrated that the public favour one party—because we have what is commonly a two-party preferred system—over another with respect to certain matters. If you ask the question on health, the Labor Party gets the tick. If you ask the question on industrial relations, the Labor Party gets the tick. If it is a question that relates to economic management, the polls suggest that the coalition gets the tick. People make decisions based on various things. But if you look at the last election, the government lied its way into office. I do not know where the popular mandate lies when a government is elected purely on a lie about the `children overboard' incident.  
It is so terribly wrong for a government to imply that this chamber is somehow destroying its legislative program. If you go back in history, as I said, the government of the day has not had control of the Senate 17 times, and 19 times it has. Through all of those years until 1983—and this document refers to 1950 and 1959 and the proposals to look at amendments to section 57—those governments have been either in control or not in control of the Senate, yet they managed to govern. The government program went on. As Senator Murray pointed out earlier with regard to industrial relations in this country, we seem to be rolling along reasonably well.
The discussion paper talks about the importance of reform to small business. On page 32, it states:
This is a reform that, if implemented, would help create thousands of new jobs and reduce costs to small business.
If ever there was a cost burden that was lumped on small business it was the GST. That is not to say that I am opposed to the GST, but one thing is for certain—it could have been much simpler for small business. It still could be made much simpler for small business. But are we focused on that? No; there is not the slightest bit of interest. The cost of implementing the GST for small business runs into tens of billions of dollars per year in this country. Compare that to the imposition of what the government considers to be an industrial relations difficulty with the unfair dismissal laws, or whatever they are called now—fair dismissals. We have a new name for them each time they come forward. If you compare the imposition of requiring an employer in small business to take care when considering employment and ensuring that they comply with their responsibilities as an employer versus the cost imposition of the GST, there is no comparison—not one. It also says on page 32:
The government of the day is often acting to fulfil the mandate it won at the last election ...
I am pleased with that choice of words `often acting'. And often not. Let me deal with the sale of Telstra in the context of `often acting to fulfil'. The government said at the outset, `We will never sell more than one-third of Telstra.' They then proceeded to sell 49.9 per cent of it. They are now proceeding, by way of legislation introduced into and passed through the House of Representatives, to try to sell the lot, but they are proceeding on that basis if services in the bush and in the regions are up to scratch. We have had two or three inquiries and reports, the last of which suggested that there were still some improvements to be made, and the government committed a further $180 million to bring about those improvements. Now, of course, the National Party—
—The Nationals.
—Sorry, Senator McGauran, the Nationals. That's right, you have changed your name. I tell you what: you have not changed your spots. You have changed the name but not your spots. You are still the same party: you still cannot make up your minds whether you are in the `sell Telstra' basket or not. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr John Anderson, participated in a joint statement with the former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, in making a big hoo-ha about announcing the $180 million expenditure and saying that Telstra was ready for full sale. It was not that long ago—in fact, only a few weeks ago—I recall seeing Mr Anderson saying that the sale of Telstra was a long way off. He was in the position where there was a question over the leadership of the Nationals, so his position seemed to be somewhat, shall I say, coloured by the circumstances he was confronting at the time. 
Telstra is clearly not ready for sale. If you are a subscriber, if that is the right word, to Telstra's BigPond dial-up network you certainly would not say that things are up to scratch—in fact, far from it. As one of those subscribers, I find Telstra's BigPond service leaves a great deal to be desired. On page 32 of the statement it says:
It is thus contrary both to the principles of democracy and good government that the will of the people as exercised through the ballot box can be repeatedly and completely frustrated by the opposition joining with minor parties pursuing sectional interests.
`Pursuing sectional interests'. Goodness me. What does the coalition government do in respect of big business? What does it do in respect of at least some of the farming interests in this country? Some of the proposals brought in by this government are now about to be changed. They brought in self-regulation for the great bulk of business in this country, and what happened? Was it good policy? Was that the type of social and economic reform that this country really needed? According to the Treasurer now, no. We have to re-regulate. So what was opposed at the time, despite the fact that most of the changes got through, has turned out to not be a good process for this country, and it is clear from the evidence of all the business failures at the big end of town that self-regulation has simply not worked.
So it is a responsible role—a very significantly responsible role—that the Senate has. I am sure that the Australian people, at the end of the day, will assess this paper for what it is and that they will make the decision that they do not want to support the Prime Minister's approach to resolving deadlocks. In fact, I think they will ask the Prime Minister to be more responsible, to be more honest and to bring forward legislative programs that actually reflect not only the will of the people but also what they would like to see done in this country. It is only by having a chamber that is representative of a great cross-section of the views of the Australian community that will bring that about. I oppose the proposal in the document, including that which is proposed by Michael Lavarch.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,17,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2003-10-13,"—I wish to add my comments to those of my colleagues who have spoken in this debate on section 57 of the Australian Constitution, particularly prompted by the discussion paper entitled `Resolving deadlocks', released last week by the Prime Minister. It seems to be part of an ongoing and well-established pattern by this Prime Minister and his government. In the almost eight years that I have been in this place, I have watched with increasing alarm, particularly over the period of this government, the increasing attacks on institutions which express or symbolise our democratic aspirations. These bodies represent the people of Australia, be they the High Court, a public broadcaster, the judiciary or advocacy and representative groups and organisations. Now it is the Senate that is under concerted attack. 
There have been a number of interesting and impressive contributions to this debate, all arguing for the retention of various Senate powers or arguing against the political or practical debates or proposals that have been put forward. But, of the writings or contributions I have seen in this debate in recent times, I think the Clerk of the Senate says it best. I refer honourable senators and others to Harry Evans's work on this subject. He has effectively called the bluff of our Prime Minister, essentially claiming—and I am paraphrasing—that the Prime Minister finds power attractive and those in the executive will always want more power. In Australia, the executive has a check on it. The Senate is effectively the check on executive power in this country. The Prime Minister has claimed that the Senate is now a house of obstruction instead of fulfilling its so-called constitutional vision of being a states house or a house of review. I always find it interesting to compare that statement with a quote from 1987 when Mr John Howard claimed:  
The Senate is one of the most democratically elected chambers in the world—a body which at present more faithfully represents the popular will of the total Australian people at the last election than does the House of Representatives. 
How quickly things change. We have heard in this debate so far the fact that the Senate is indeed not a house of obstruction and that, in fact, the figures put a lie to this. We have heard a number of contributions that refer to the figures. We know that from 1990 the Senates of the previous four parliaments passed between 97.6 per cent and 99 per cent of all bills which came before them. The current Senate has passed more than 95 per cent of all bills—in fact, some figures show 98 per cent, depending on which date you refer to. Indeed, as we all know, you rarely hear about those bills which are passed often with amendment and you rarely hear about those many bills passed without any amendment. What we do hear about is the legislation, particularly controversial bills, that are not passed by the Senate. I think the Senate passed 103 bills in the first 40 days of sitting in 2003. So it is not the Senate being obstructionist; it is the Senate doing its job, and in a climate where doing that job is becoming increasingly difficult. 
As we all know, the Senate is scheduled to sit for only 60 days this year. I believe that is the equal shortest number of sitting days in a non-election year for the Senate. The expectation that the Senate can perform its valuable and necessary examination and review of legislation in ever-shortening time frames is unrealistic and even dangerous. The public response, I note, to the Senate, and in particular the recent debate about reform of the Senate, has been overwhelming, particularly for an issue dealing with potential constitutional change. I remain convinced that Australians want a check on executive power. You would think that our seemingly navel-gazing discussion of the Senate may not appeal to all members of the community or even a broad section because, understandably, they are dealing daily with real life, difficult hip-pocket issues, yet there have been an overwhelming number of letters to editors and even comments on talkback radio. I am sure my colleagues have received letters, emails, phone calls, faxes et cetera. I know that Australians have other things that they need to and prefer to focus on. 
I note that Media Watch pointed out that, according to the ratings, the show Big Brother Up Late commanded twice as many viewers as the broadcast of Senate question time, which was on at the same time. Twice as many Australians preferred to watch people sleeping in the roundhouse than watch the government being held to account in the upper house. But that is not to say that Australians do not understand the role of the Senate or that they do not care about the role of the Senate. The letters to the papers in the past week since this model was released have been interesting and overwhelming, as indeed have the opinion polls. Suggestions, though, by the Prime Minister that this model or this proposal may be jettisoned after a number of months if there is insufficient support among the public, the community or political parties I think is an interesting notion. There is a part of me that wants him to brazen out this debate, not shelve it once it has been road-tested, albeit road-tested for the sole motivation of perpetuating this false notion of Senate obstructionism.  
I am happy to go to an election where the Senate is the centrepiece. I think it would be interesting to test the views of Australians on the role of the Senate and ask Australians, `Do you want to water down the powers of the Australian Senate?' and see how they respond. Bring it on. I suspect, however, that this is simply yet another ruse by a canny government and, indeed, a canny Prime Minister to cajole, to intimidate and maybe to persuade other parties into succumbing to legislation which is flawed. It is all about building up that public, political and electoral pressure, perpetuating this notion of a Senate which is obstructionist, in order to put pressure on people in this place either through this place or through the community generally, expecting us perhaps to lower our standards in order to protect our precious seats. I am one senator happy to take that chance. Certainly the Democrats, and I as a senator, will amend and negotiate on legislation, whether it is the student income support bill right through to the Backing Australia's Ability bill—which I negotiated with the government on—but I will not compromise on principles and policies that see flawed or unfair legislation pass this place. That tactic will not work on some of us. 
In relation to the core issue of constitutional reform and debate, I am one of the first to say: let us bring on constitutional debates, broader debates; let us not shy away from them. I have never believed that our Constitution is perfect. Of course it is an evolving document. I find it ironic that some politicians who argued in 1999 `If it ain't broke, don't fix it' are the first now to claim the Senate is broken and therefore in need of a fix. 
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—I continue my remarks in relation to proposed changes to the Senate and, in particular, what the Democrats perceive as an attack on the Senate in an attempt to water down the Senate's powers. Before the dinner break, I was saying how ironic it is that the proponents of the view `If it ain't broke, don't fix it' in relation to constitutional change, specifically the 1999 referendum on a republic, are the same people who are now arguing for Senate reform. That is okay, because I have always believed that the Constitution is an evolving document and that we have the right to discuss any perceived constitutional imperfections and, indeed, put the case for change if we think that that is appropriate. I am very proud of the fact that our nation has been innovative in relation to constitutional reform. We have quite an impressive range of feats in constitutional innovation—universal suffrage, women's suffrage, the secret ballot and postal voting. All of these changes were pioneered in Australia many years before democracies such as the UK and many other democracies around the world. 
Our system of government is recognised as one of the most successful and enduring. Indeed, that is something to which the Prime Minister refers in his document Resolvingdeadlocks: A discussion paper on section 57 of the Australian Constitution. The authors of our Constitution were concerned with states rights, not citizens rights. There are a number of things missing, arguably, from our Constitution. There is no declaration of the objectives of nationhood or the rights of citizens. There is certainly no mention of equality between the sexes or equality for Indigenous Australians or, indeed, the pursuit of happiness. Our history books and our laws have long ignored Indigenous cultures and the fact that Indigenous people have been dispossessed for a long time, and our Constitution continues to ignore that.  
More importantly and germane to this debate, the Constitution does not even mention the office of the Prime Minister, even though it is the most powerful position in the land. Neither the Senate nor the House of Representatives has acted as envisaged by its constitutional authors. I am the first to acknowledge that. I believe that the House of Representatives is captive of the executive and that the Senate has upheld the role of scrutinising legislation rather than functioning as a states house. I note that the Constitution does mention, however, `peace, order and good government'. I am very happy to see us debate constitutional reform and constitutional change but, if we are to do so, let us not do it through the narrow parameter of what is set down in section 57, particularly an attack on the Senate. Let us debate some broader questions. Let us debate everything from ratification of troop deployments to the powers of the Governor-General. Let us talk about the Senate's power to block supply, something which I and probably the majority in this place would argue should be abolished. Let us talk about whether or not we should have fixed terms. What about a bill of rights? How about whether or not we should have a British monarch as our head of state? We are all entitled to make contributions towards the debate involving constitutional reform. Those issues are dear to my heart. There are certainly many others on which I might not be as strong—issues to do with citizen initiated referenda, for example—and ones on which I am strong, such as the Constitution. 
Should the Constitution mention local government? Should the Constitution enshrine protection of the environment, as we have seen in the constitutions of not necessarily more modern democracies but democracies that have penned their constitutions more recently. For example, in the constitution of Namibia there is a strong acknowledgement of the role of the environment. 
On the broader issue of the role of the Senate, we do some unique things and have some of the best ways to ensure accountability and transparency of government, a check on executive power. We have private senators' bills and the committee system and its cross-party nature that is so important to ensure accountability. I am sorry to see that often this debate gets bogged down in the `My mandate is bigger than your mandate' argument. It is an argument very hard for this government to sustain when it was elected on 43 per cent of the primary vote. In fact, it is ironic, if not ridiculous, to see chapter headings in the document `Resolving deadlocks' that talk about a minority-led Senate when all of us understand that legislation in this place is either passed, amended or stopped as a consequence of a majority of voters, a majority which I believe reflects and represents the will of the Australian people.
The accountability aspect of the Senate has been more than elaborated on by colleagues before me. Senator Murphy, who spoke before me, in response to an interjection from Senator Kemp, talked about the notion of promises. Senator Kemp was saying to us, `You should keep government accountable. You're stopping us from introducing or implementing our promises.' For the record, there are many broken promises in this place and all political parties are guilty of that. What matters most is that the diversity and difference of our population is reflected and represented in our parliaments and I think that the Senate does that better than any parliament, largely as a consequence of the proportional voting system that we have in this place. On that note, I acknowledge the contribution earlier by Senator Bob Brown in relation to Catherine Helen Spence. I am all for naming her the foremother of the modern Australian democracy. I would like to see more women given their appropriate place in history. I find it interesting when I thumb through this document to see that there is a reference to the dominant intention of the founding fathers.  
In my contribution I have mentioned that, because the Constitution is an evolving document, we should on the one hand pay due respect to those founding fathers but also recognise that they allowed for our Constitution to change. I hope we will allow our Constitution to change for the better and not for the blatant purpose of perpetuating the notion that the Senate is obstructionist, so that we can pass through legislation that is unfair. I think this is part of a political push that has more to do with bludgeoning the Senate into submission either through theoretical and constitutional change or, indeed, in practice by wanting to debilitate us, to weaken the Senate and other parties in this place in the same way that repeated attacks on everything from the judiciary to the High Court and the ABC are designed to maximise the power of the executive—moves that I think will ultimately debilitate the power of the people.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,17,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2003-10-13,"—It is some 19 years since the Senate was last seized with a thorough debate about the nature and limits of Senate powers. The last occasion was when the Hawke government brought forward referendum proposals, including a proposal for simultaneous elections of the two chambers—the third time such a proposal had been introduced in a decade and the third time it went on to be defeated by the people at a referendum.
There are only seven senators—including, I note, yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President Cook—who participated in that debate in 1984 who are still members of the Senate today. So in publishing the discussion paper `Resolving deadlocks', the Prime Minister last week gave this generation of senators its first opportunity to address itself to the question of the proper limits and the proper uses of Senate power.
I would like, if I may, to approach the discussion paper in an historical context. I would like to go back to the aspirations held for this chamber by the founding fathers. If one reads the convention debates leading to Federation, it is perfectly clear that in creating the Senate the founding fathers were seeking to do two things in particular: first, to protect the rights of the states and, secondly, to entrench in our Constitution the principle of bicameralism by instituting a powerful house of review. It is commonplace that the Senate ceased to be a states house, as Deakin always predicted it would, with the rise of the political parties. But its role as a house of review has not atrophied; it has only been strengthened with the passage of the years, as the discussion paper suggests.
The founding fathers created the most powerful house of review in the world, even more powerful than the United States Senate because, under our Constitution—unlike the American Constitution—the Senate has the capacity, only once exercised, of dismissing an executive government. The question of deadlocks between the chambers is not merely a question about deadlocks in relation to legislation; it also raises squarely the question of the Senate's powers in relation to supply bills. I have always felt—and I said this in a debate I had with Senator Brown on Lateline on Friday night—that it was never realistic to think that one could have a debate about deadlocks between the houses about legislation and confine discussion to section 57 of the Constitution when the most acute form of deadlock, the blocking of supply bills, is raised not by section 57 but by section 53. To introduce the debate, inevitably, is to enlarge its scope. 
Sir Samuel Griffith said at the 1891 convention:
But it must be remembered that it is not proposed to deny the Senate the power of veto. Surely if the Senate wanted to stop the machinery of government, the way to do that would be to throw out the Appropriation Bill. I, for my part, am much inclined to think that the power of rejection is a much more dangerous power than the power of amendment; yet it is a power that must be conceded.
Six years later, Deakin, at the 1897 convention said:
Under this Constitution, that right—
that is, the right to deny supply—
is given without qualification; the special circumstances and certain special occasions are left for the senators themselves to determine. This power of veto may be exercised absolutely. Suppose the two houses came into conflict—and the main thing they are likely to come into conflict about is finance—what is the only remedy? Dissolution—an appeal to the whole people. 
In enshrining the Senate as a house of review, the founding fathers acknowledged their debt to the American Senate. They were more influenced by that model than by any of the other historical or comparative models which they considered.
The role of the Senate as a house of review has, I suspect, never been more eloquently captured than by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper No. 63, which he published in 1788. Using the elegant language of those times, Alexander Hamilton said this:
History informs us of no long-lived republic which had not a senate.
And then he went on to discuss the senates not only of Rome, but of Sparta and Carthage. He said:
Many of the defects ... which can only be supplied by a senatorial institution, are common to a numerous assembly frequently elected by the people ... The people can never wilfully betray their own interests; but they may possibly be betrayed by the representatives of the people; and the danger will be evidently greater where the whole legislative trust is lodged in the hands of one body of men, than where the concurrence of separate and dissimilar bodies is required in every public act.
Those were the high hopes of the founding fathers, and they were bound—at least in the early days of the Federation—to be disappointed. Lord Bryce, writing in 1921 in his famous work Modern Democracies, assessed the performance of the Australian Senate in its first two decades in a most negative and discouraging fashion. He wrote:
All the expectations and aims wherewith the Senate was created have been falsified by the event. It has not protected State interests, for those interests have come very little into question. ... Neither has it become the home of sages, for the best political talent of the nation flows to the House of Representatives, where office is to be won in strenuous conflict.
—You might dispute that!
—I will come back to that, Senator Ellison. Lord Bryce goes on:
The Senate has done little to improve measures, though this is largely due to a cause unforeseen by its founders. Not having any special functions, such as that of control of appointments and of foreign policy which gives authority to the American Senate, its Australian copy has proved a mere replica, and an inferior replica, of the House. Able and ambitious men prefer the latter, because office and power are in its gift, and its work is more important and exciting, for most of the Ministers, and the strongest among them, are needed there, while the Senate is usually put off with two or so of the less vigorous. Thus from the first it counted for little. 
That is what Lord Bryce said in 1921. But, when we look at ministers like Senator Ellison, whom I see sitting at the table today, one can confidently assert that the early negative appraisal of the Senate by the first commentators on the Australian Constitution has been well and truly falsified in the result, so that, today, far from not being the house of sages—when we see men like you, Mr Acting Deputy President Cook, and gentlemen like Senator Ellison and Senator Sherry and others among us—we can be satisfied that, were the shade of Lord Bryce to visit the galleries today, he would recant his words.
In the years since, but in particular in the last quarter century or so, the Senate has asserted itself in a way unforeseen in the first half of the 20th century. In particular, it has asserted its role in relation to legislation. What is the criterion by which the propriety of the Senate's conduct in relation to the amendment of legislation is to be judged? It is whether or not in exercising its powers as a house of review the Senate properly accepts that a government elected in the House of Representatives does have a mandate for its key bills, so that the power of review can only be exercised properly and beneficially if it is exercised with restraint.
Yet, in the last few days, in debating this most important issue in this chamber, we have heard language—in particular, language coming from opposition senators—which would, were he there, have made Gough Whitlam turn in his grave, but, since Mr Whitlam, happily, is still among us, must cause a rich appeal to his very abundant sense of irony. Senator Faulkner, the unsmiling face of hypocrisy, has said that the Labor Party will oppose the measures suggested by the Prime Minister unless they go further. So the opportunity for incremental change to make the exercise by the Senate of its powers of review more democratic—not less democratic—is being denied from the lips of the very people who seek to keep alive the torch of Whitlamism. How can it be the case that incremental reform to the Senate is to be opposed in the name of a demand for more sweeping change? The Labor Party's position is hypocritical and it is illogical—but perhaps not quite so illogical as the position taken by the crossbench parties and the Australian Democrats.
I have listened carefully and respectfully to the contributions made by Australian Democrat senators and by Senator Brown on behalf of the Greens in this debate. All of them, in the unlikely guise of constitutional conservatives, have asserted that were the Prime Minister's proposals to be adopted the power of the Senate would be eviscerated. Not so—at least not in relation to the second of the options put forward in the discussion paper; that is, the Lavarch proposal. Let me remind you that, according to the Lavarch proposal, if a bill is rejected by the Senate, there is an interval of three months. It is rejected a second time by the Senate; the Prime Minister chooses then to go to a general election—not a double dissolution, but a general election—on the grounds of the rejected bill, fights and wins an election campaign. The bill is then once again rejected; there can be a joint sitting to pass the bill in question.
How can that be undemocratic? How can it be an abuse of a government's mandate if it goes to the people, and places the very legislation in question before them, and is re-elected? The Lavarch proposal—I think very cleverly—by making a general election the centrepiece of the process, the key procedural stage in the process, means that the public are always the arbiters of the bill. The speeches we heard from Australian Democrat senators and the speech we heard from Senator Brown proceeded as if the Lavarch proposal were not one of the two options set forth in the discussion paper. Yet it is, and it is for my money the option most likely to succeed. It is impossible to assert that the Lavarch proposal for reform of the Senate is anything other than the perfect democratic compromise. Even the Clerk of the Senate, whom I see at the table, has come out in favour of the Lavarch proposal. Mr Evans was quoted in the Age on 12 August 2003, referring to the Lavarch model, as saying: 
It would be a vast improvement over his—
that is, the Prime Minister's—
original proposal ... But it would also be an improvement over the current arrangement.
What Mr Evans wisely saw was that putting a general election right in the middle of the process makes all the difference. It provides the democratic validation which makes irrelevant all the arguments we have heard from the crossbench parties about the limitations of mandates. The election confers the mandate. The legislation at issue could not possibly be more emphatically endorsed than by the people voting to return the government which has gone to them in an appeal based on that very legislation.
I said a moment ago that, although this has been so far largely a debate about section 57 of the Constitution, it was always unrealistic to think that a discussion about deadlocks could proceed in the absence of some consideration of the power to block supply. There is no doubt that the power exists. It has been exercised once. I remember in 1975 being of the view that the occasion was not an appropriate one for the exercise of the power. I remember being of the view at the time that the grounds put forward by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Fraser, were unconvincing and disingenuous. Twenty-eight years later, I have no reason to change the view I then held. The blocking of supply in 1975 was not something that ought properly to have been done.
Let me put something on the record for the sake of history: there was one other key player in those events who shared my view. As I told the Senate once a couple of years ago, in the last few years of his life I became very close to Sir John Kerr and I had the great pleasure of hearing him in his anecdotage. Sir John Kerr confided to me many things about the events of 1975 and about other aspects of his long and interesting life. One thing he told me was that he also was and always had been of the view that what Fraser did in 1975 was wrong, that it would have been better for Australian democracy had Fraser and the then opposition not blocked supply. Sir John Kerr wore the cost of Fraser's act for the rest of his life. Kerr did the right thing, even though he believed that Fraser's act was wrong.
Nevertheless, there remains an anomaly in our Constitution in relation to the power of the Senate to block supply and it arises from this: neither under section 53 nor anywhere else in the Constitution is there a requirement that if the Senate blocks supply bills and sends the House of Representatives to the people, the Senate itself must face the people and face the consequences of so grave a decision. The only time it ever happened, in 1975, there was a double dissolution but only because of the coincidental circumstance that there were 21 trigger bills allowing for a double dissolution to occur. But there could easily be a situation in which the Senate blocked appropriation bills but there were not trigger bills for a double dissolution. In 1976 at the constitutional convention in Hobart, Sir Charles Court, then the Premier of Western Australia—and no constitutional radical he—suggested an amendment to the Constitution to address that anomaly by requiring that, were the Senate to block supply bills and send the House of Representatives to the people, it itself after 30 days would have to be automatically dissolved so that it too would face the judgment of the people for its act. I believe that would be a beneficial change. May I, in closing this debate, offer that as an additional consideration which the government might introduce into the discussion. 
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Constitutional Reform: Senate Powers</title>,Ministerial Statements,17,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-10-13,"—From my understanding of where we were last time, this is amendment (1). I am not sure whether the minister is moving (1), (2) and (3) together or simply (1) at this time.
—We are moving government amendment (1) at this time.
—I indicate that, for the reasons I outlined in my speech on the second reading on this matter, we will be supporting this particular amendment. I think it is appropriate to record at least our understanding that these amendments are not intended to provide for the abolition of the APS by stealth. That issue was raised during the two hearings of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee inquiry into the provisions of the relevant bill. At the last hearing of that inquiry, the advice from both the Australian Federal Police and the relevant Attorney-General's advisers was that the matter was going to be well and truly consulted on, before the `one act, one agency' issue was enlivened and to ensure the industry issues were addressed cooperatively and in good faith. The Attorney-General, and I am sure the Minister for Justice and Customs, would know and understand that different industrial arrangements apply to the APS and the Australian Federal Police.

2 After subsection 21(4)
Insert:
	(4A)	The powers conferred, and duties imposed, by this Part on members and special members of the Australian Federal Police are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other powers conferred, or duties imposed, by any other law of the Commonwealth or the law of a State or Territory, and this Part is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of any other law of the Commonwealth or the law of a State or Territory in so far as it is capable of operating concurrently with this Part.
These two amendments deal with AFP powers and insert a new section, 18F, in item 1 of the bill, as introduced, to confer the powers contained in new sections 18A, 18B and 18C on AFP officers. The bill, as amended, would allow officers of both the Australian Protective Service and Australian Federal Police to request a person's name, address and reason for being in a place, or in the vicinity of a place, person or thing in respect of which the Protective Service has functions, where the officer reasonably suspects the person might have just committed, might be committing or might be about to commit a prescribed offence.
The bill, as amended, will also allow a power to stop and search a person the officer reasonably suspects has in their possession a thing that could be used to cause substantial damage to a place, or death or serious harm to a person in respect of which the Protective Service has functions. It will further allow the power to seize a thing the officer is searching for, or any other thing the officer reasonably suspects is likely to be used to cause death or serious harm to a person, or to a person who is in a place, or in the vicinity of a place, person or thing in respect of which the Protective Service has functions. Basically, the powers are there of requesting a person's name and address, stopping a person, searching bags they may have and seizing anything that may be linked to a security threat. What this amendment does is extend these powers to the Australian Federal Police. 
It is worth while to note in this debate that existing arrest powers can only be used by the APS and AFP officers where a person has committed, or is committing, an offence. Officers require greater flexibility. They need to be able to act effectively in suspicious circumstances where the exercise of existing arrest powers is not immediately necessary. This is all about proactive measures that go to prevention. We are not talking about arrest powers here; we are talking about the ability to intervene if necessary, ask a person their name and address and their reason for being there, search their bags and seize any item that could be a security threat.
The Australian Protective Service has primary responsibility for providing protective security for the Commonwealth, including security at airports. It carries out its work at the front line of our changing security environment. It has become necessary to re-evaluate the role of the APS in view of the current security environment we find ourselves in. While APS officers have primary responsibility for providing protective security services, the provision of such services comes with a greater law enforcement jurisdiction of AFP officers. We have looked at a situation where the APS, which does not have sworn officers, could act in a situation but, when it gets to a level where arrest or further action is required, the Australian Federal Police are called in.
These new powers are flexible and allow an appropriate response to each particular set of circumstances. Of course, where you have the Australian Protective Service, such as at an airport, there are invariably Australian Federal Police present as well. We discovered during the assessment of the need for these new powers that the APS would have powers that the Australian Federal Police did not. That could result in a situation where the APS would have these proactive powers—at an airport, say—and the AFP would not.
An AFP officer is a sworn police officer who has the power of arrest. The government formed the view that it would be appropriate to extend those powers to the AFP as well. We had originally planned to present this to the parliament in a separate bill. In the circumstances it was thought best to put those powers in this bill, together with the APS powers, so that this inconsistency did not exist in the meantime. With respect, I suggest that it does make sense for the AFP to have the same powers as the APS. There are restrictions on the exercise of this power contained in section 18 of the bill, which have been touched on in debate on previous amendments during the committee stage. I commend these two amendments to the committee.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PROTECTIVE SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-10-13,"—I think the minister, when he said `discovered', might have gone a little bit further than I would have thought. It was on the drawing board for some time. The minister did allude to that further on in his speech, in that I think there was a view taken on the powers here to draw forward the legislative program in respect of the parts of the power of `one act, one agency' to ensure that at least there was not an overlap—or in this instance, I suspect, an underlap—where the Australian Protective Service would be operating in areas without the ability to call on the Australian Federal Police. But we can leave that debate for another day, when the bill in respect of `one act, one agency' does come forward.
I understand that the problem, if I could call it that, brought forward by moving the Australian Federal Police provisions into the proposed Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2003 is that, because of the lack of consultation, there was concern by various organisations that in effect it was amalgamation by stealth, as I said earlier. But we were assured that in fact that was not the case. The Senate inquiry revealed that it was more to ensure that there was sufficient protection for the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Protective Service in respect of the powers that have been given to the APS and to ensure that the ability to provide secure arrangements was present. 
The opposition take the amendments proposed by the government in good faith and are prepared to accept and support them. We do, however, reiterate our concern that proper consultation is progressing smoothly with `one act, one agency' and that all the relevant parties have been informed, are being informed or will be informed, particularly in relation to those industrial issues. Estimates and various committees, including the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, have raised the issue of the Australian Protective Service's industrial arrangements to ensure that. Now is clearly an appropriate time—in my view, at least—for it to be addressed, if and when `one act, one agency' is contemplated. But the debate on this bill does give me an opportunity to at least make the point that those industrial matters should be addressed, and I would expect them to be addressed.
Paramount to that is that the consultative process is undertaken by the Attorney-General with the relevant persons so at least they can feel as though they have considered the issue fully. Without seeking to prolong these proceedings, we have indicated that we will agree to the amendments that have been proposed by the government.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2003-10-13,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak this evening on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 with the new Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, at—or to shortly be at—the helm. Today the incoming minister has a chance to begin to redeem the failure and mismanagement of the previous minister in the crucial area of family assistance. I only hope that the new minister can learn from her predecessor's mistakes. Rather than simply defending this ramshackle system of family assistance, the new minister has a chance to acknowledge the problems and start the task of fixing them. That can start with the bill this evening.
The bill we are debating this evening is deficient in a number of ways. Most fundamentally, it fails to address the core problems with the flawed family tax and child-care benefit payment system. There is no attempt in this bill to address the problems which Labor and, more recently, the Commonwealth Ombudsman have outlined. Central to the problems is the flawed prospective annual income test that families are subjected to if they wish to receive benefits fortnightly. The problems with the system are well documented: 700,000 families are hit with FTB or CCB debts—one in three families who receive benefits—and total accumulated debt now stands at over $1.2 billion. The limited scope of this bill is yet another attempt by this government to stick a bandaid on a system that is haemorrhaging. Nevertheless, the content of this bill has some limited benefit by removing the ridiculous 12-month time limit for families to be paid past period claims where they are eligible for them. 
Labor will not be opposing this bill, but we will be insisting on a range of simple amendments that will improve this bill markedly. Labor will be moving amendments to further lengthen the time frame for past period claims to three years so that families who missed out on entitlements for the 2000-01 year may obtain them. Labor will also move amendments to ensure families have a say in whether their tax returns may be used to recover overpayments rather than the clandestine tax stripping that occurs currently. Before discussing these amendments and the content of the bill, I believe it would be beneficial for the new minister if I were to outline the core problems with the system.
The previous minister had a great deal of difficulty understanding the essential problem with the prospective annual income test for family tax benefit and child-care benefit. When the very first bills were introduced to implement this new payment system as part of the new tax system, Labor warned it would be a nightmare for families. The minister of the day, Senator Newman, derided Labor, saying our concerns were nothing but scaremongering. As I mentioned earlier, we now know that around 700,000 families each year are caught in this debt trap, accruing some $1.2 billion in debts after two years.
The core problem is that benefits for families are not paid on the basis of current income; they are paid on the basis of future income. Each year, families who wish to obtain their benefits fortnightly must guess their annual income one year in advance. The problem for most is that they simply do not know whether they are going to get extra overtime or a pay rise or even whether one parent may have to go back to work. With this system, future events actually impact on the benefits they are eligible for now. Even if families tell Centrelink as soon as they know their income is going to change, it is, in many cases, too late. At the end-of-year reconciliation, their income is effectively averaged over the year and the government retrospectively claws back benefits that families were told they were entitled to receive. Apart from the one-off $1,000 election year waiver for 2000-01, the government has ruthlessly recouped those benefits.
One of the government's favourite methods has been the stripping of tax returns, which occurs without warning to hapless families who are counting on the money for payment of bills or school fees. Most do not even know they have a debt, let alone that it may run into the thousands. The government relies on fine print in the Tax Pack that says refunds may be used to offset family assistance debts. The truth is there is not so much as a phone call or a letter before the money is stripped. The ombudsman has called for an end to this practice, but this has fallen on deaf ears. Labor will, this evening, move substantive amendments to the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 to ensure that the government cannot strip tax returns without the consent of families. Labor's amendments, which I will outline in detail during the committee stage, will ensure families can have confidence that their finances will not be thrown into disarray by a family tax debt, which they never knew they owed, being ripped from their tax return. 
Before I move on to other aspects of this bill, I would urge the new minister to address some of the loopholes Labor has discovered in the family tax benefit rules. The minister should by now have received a briefing on evidence which emerged from Senate estimates, which indicated that hundreds, if not thousands, of high-wealth families have accessed family tax benefit payments. These families, including some who are millionaires, have pocketed payments which are worth up to $4,300 per child.
The outgoing minister has failed to adequately address the loopholes that Labor has raised—namely, that when a claim for family tax benefit is lodged no verification is made of current family income; payments are made on the basis of customer estimates alone. Margin lending losses from playing the share market may be used by families to artificially reduce assessable income, and the government relies on the self-reporting of foreign income with no verification mechanisms in place. The government's response to these loopholes has been inadequate, to say the least. The double standard will infuriate many hardworking families, who are utterly frustrated with the way this system treats them while the top end of town takes it for a ride.
Turning now to the bill itself, as I mentioned earlier it seeks to extend the time limit that applies to families to obtain a catch-up payment of FTB or CCB or to make a lump-sum claim. Of the 2.1 million families who receive payments each financial year, approximately 95 per cent receive their payments fortnightly. The remainder obtain a lump sum amount through Centrelink or the ATO once their income is known. The system allows families who overestimate their annual income to receive a so-called top-up payment when they lodge their tax return. However it is more a catch-up payment, since these families have received less than their full fortnightly entitlement throughout the year and the government is only paying them an amount that should have been paid to them earlier. In both of these cases—where there is a lump sum owed or a catch-up payment—there is a 12-month time limit from the end of the financial year when these claims must be lodged. Should a family miss the deadline, they can kiss goodbye to the money the government owes them. Unsurprisingly, many families have missed the deadline. This legislative fix is in response to Labor's discovery in February this year that 25,072 family tax benefit customers who lodged 2001 tax returns after 30 June 2002 and/or whose partners lodged 2001 tax returns after 30 June 2002 were denied $37 million—an average of $1,477—in top-ups of their 2000-01 FTB entitlements. These figures do not include information on those who were owed lump sum amounts.
Through this bill, the government has decided to extend by a further 12 months, to 24 months, the deadline for catch-up payments and lump sum claims. This little patch-up hits the budget bottom line to the tune of $180 million over the forward estimates. While it is welcome, it does nothing to address the core problems with family tax benefit and child-care benefit. The simple fact is this: few families can afford to defer payments until the end of the year to claim as a lump sum or a catch-up payment, so the announcement is of no benefit to most. In light of the other bandaid changes the government has made to this system, it is obvious that it has a great deal of difficulty grasping this concept. Families cannot afford to forgo fortnightly benefits. Raising kids is expensive and the costs incurred do not arrive conveniently at the end of the financial year, but this government has designed a system that leaves families with two unpalatable choices. Either they forgo fortnightly payments and really struggle financially or they seek to obtain their entitlements and run the risk that they get a nasty end-of-year debt. Either way, they lose. 
As it is, we have seen all of the government's strategies to reduce families' accruing debts come to nought. One of the disturbing things about the debt figures is that, whilst there has been no decline in families acquiring debts, there has been an increase in the number receiving catch-up payments. Why is this disturbing? While the government changes have done nothing to reduce the number of families being hit with debts, they have resulted in a greater number of families receiving less than their full fortnightly entitlement. If this is not an indictment of their failure to fix the problems with this system, I do not know what is. What families desperately need is a family payment system that can properly adjust for changes in family income throughout the year and pay the correct entitlement without the risk of a nasty end-of-year debt.
The truth is that the extension of time limits that this bill provides for does not scratch the surface of the problems with this system. As it is, the further 12-month extension to 24 months is inadequate. Families who missed out on family payment top-ups in the first year of the scheme's operation—2000-01—are not assisted by this legislation. Why should these families be treated differently? They have been short-changed by the government, and it ought to pay them their entitlements. It is also at odds with the government's repeated claim that FTB and CCB are `tax benefits'. The government would be aware that tax deductions and offsets may be claimed up to four years after the financial year to which they related. Accordingly, Labor will be moving amendments to bring the time limit for FTB and CCB claims closer into line with other tax benefits by allowing for a three-year time frame for claims. This three-year time frame will allow families who missed out on a lump sum or catch-up payment for 2000-01 to obtain their entitlement by 30 June 2004.
There is a cost to this amendment—in the vicinity of an additional $45 million in expenditure during the 2003-04 year. However, given the recent budget surplus, the government can hardly argue that this cannot be afforded. It will certainly make a big difference to the families affected. As I outlined earlier, it will provide on average $1,477 for 25,000 families who were paid less than their fortnightly entitlement and somewhat more for families who missed out on their entire benefit. I would urge the government to accept Labor's amendments. The government should remember that it is the one encouraging families to claim part or all of their benefits at the end of the year, and it ought to provide a fair time frame for those entitlements to be made. I would also urge the government to contemplate the fundamental reforms that are needed in this failing system.
Labor has consistently said that a new approach needs to be adopted in order to pay family assistance. A new method of assessment needs to be introduced so that benefits are responsive to changes in earnings. This means doing away with prospective annual income estimates and moving closer to actual current income. Such a system would not punish families for something that will happen in the future and should also help to restore incentives to earn extra. Currently 75 per cent of taxpayers who lose more than 60 per cent of their extra earnings in tax and the withdrawal of benefits are families with dependent children. Excellent work by NATSEM has established the numbers losing this much are approaching double those of 1997. So much for tax reform!
To sum up, I will return to where I commenced. In this bill this evening we have yet another attempt by this government to stick a bandaid on a system that is haemorrhaging. Hundreds of thousands of families across the nation have been hit with debts two years running and, as they lodge their 2002-03 tax returns, many will get their third debt. The system is drowning families in debt. It is both socially and financially irresponsible. The failure to fix the flawed system contrasts sharply with the loopholes left open for the wealthy. The system is a bonus for wealthy families who play the share market but a burden for average families who can barely afford a trip to the supermarket.  
This bill does not scratch the surface of fixing the problems with this system; nevertheless Labor will support it. We will be insisting on both our amendments this evening—the extension of top-ups and the moves to give families a capacity to have debts recovered other than by tax stripping. Labor would ask that the government take some time to consider the merits of these changes and adopt them both. I want to be very clear that, when this bill comes back, we will not insist on the further extension of top-ups if we meet further opposition from the government. We do not want to see this bill delayed because the government claims there are not the funds to pay for this amendment, but we will not back away from our amendment to give families the capacity to avoid having their tax returns stripped. This amendment will not cost money. It is a sensible change that will help families caught by the government's family payment rules, so there is no reason to oppose it.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2003-10-13,"—I rise also to speak this evening on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003. In doing so I note that, three years after the government pushed through its new family tax system, it has to be time to admit that the ideology behind that has not matched the reality. It is clear that this government has not been able to reconcile its tax system with the family payments system. It is ironic that a government that has quite zealously pushed through industrial relations reform that has created a more uncertain, often unpredictable environment for ordinary workers—a government that has presided over a massive expansion in casual and temporary work with fewer guaranteed conditions and stripped of the protection of industrial awards—expects low-income families to rely on the tax system for their day-to-day income needs.
The government had an excellent opportunity with the A New Tax System reforms to do some serious work to achieve better harmonisation of the tax and transfer systems. But it blew it. Without taking into account the actual needs of families—the so-called battlers Prime Minister Howard would like us to believe that he identifies with—the government decided that families who have little extra cash at the end of the week should really be topped up on an annual basis rather than a fortnightly basis. So the government hit upon the 1950s version of families—a stable, pay-as-you-go wage with little fluctuation, where dad gets the extra cash at the end of the year. To accomplish the transition of welfare fortnightly payments to annual tax top-ups, the income support system enabled families to estimate their annual income. The first year saw massive debts where over 700,000 families had to repay. The government then introduced a new initiative that it bravely badged as `more choices for families', which in fact encouraged people to underestimate their income so that their fortnightly payments were less than their actual entitlement. While this means that these people are less likely to get a rude shock at the end of the year, it also means they do without the income when they most need it—that is, during the year when they need new shoes, school uniforms, school excursions and 101 other things that under this government people now need to pay, such as the average $13 copayment for seeing a doctor. 
In February, newspapers reported the extent of this repayment fiasco. Nearly half a million families had to pay back $801 in family tax benefit that produced more than $400 million worth of debt last financial year, in 2001-02. Another 128,900 families have had to pay back some $34 million in overpayments in child-care cash benefit. More than one in four of the two million families receiving the benefit were caught out by the new family tax benefit system that requires them to estimate their annual income a year in advance. According to more recent reports, the number of families affected was 640,000 when the remaining 20 per cent of family tax benefit recipients finalised their tax returns.
In February estimates hearings it was revealed that a further 380,684 families had received a family tax benefit top-up averaging $746 after they had overestimated their earnings. These families were underpaid the family tax benefit each fortnight and had opted to take the money at the end of the financial year. So the number of families receiving top-ups was significantly higher than last year. The increase in top-ups follows a push by the government for families to overestimate their incomes to avoid a debt. A senior departmental official said:
The proportion of those reconciled who had top-ups was 15 per cent last year, and this year it is 27 per cent ...
Changes to the system in November last year were made after families were shocked to discover their tax refunds were plundered to repay the debts. From November last year, families who notify Centrelink of a pay rise can reduce their future fortnightly family tax benefit payments to avoid a debt. This is obviously an untenable situation. It strays significantly from the fundamental principle that income support is there when you need it and that it will give you extra security.
I would also question the extent to which Centrelink is adhering to the spirit of the law. According to section 77 of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999, Centrelink is obliged to inform people about the options available to them in terms of repayment. Yet information I have received from constituents is that this has been ignored by Centrelink in that people are being told the date by which they must repay the lump sum, with no other options being provided to them.
The extent to which the administration of income support entitlements has become dysfunctional is obviously partly due to the philosophy of this government, which still treats income support recipients so differently from other members of our community. A government that can provide handouts of $6,500 per doctor or practice without any strings attached, which occurred in May this year, merely because the annual allocation money has been unspent for a program is clearly providing a system of income support that is unknown to many people who enter Centrelink's doors. So too with tax treatment. Most of us are trusted sufficiently to provide a minimal amount of documentation and a self-assessment process, with an administrative system that allows for a margin of error. It recognises that, within certain bounds, people will get it right 99 per cent of the time. This is not so with the income support system for the poorer members of our community. The stress created by an inflexible policy and a poor administration system is immense. When we have Senator Vanstone defending Centrelink staff suggesting that people take out loans on credit cards to pay back debts, we have a government without a heart. 
I will be moving amendments that will mean less stress for working families due to less harsh repayment options and provide for the waiving of debt should the error be that of Centrelink. We Democrats believe that the government needs to take responsibility for its policies and its administration. Where there are other opportunities in bills from this portfolio, we Democrats will also be pushing for less harsh treatment of people's debts where they are primarily the result of poorly considered policy.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2003-10-13,"—I also wish to speak very briefly on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003. I welcome the fact that this legislation is before us, because we can see that the government has seen that this legislation can be changed and that it is prepared to make some changes to a payment that has caused enormous stress to the community and that has caused amazing numbers of questions to be asked from the time it was introduced three years ago. Those questions have been raised not just by people on this side of the house. Since this payment was introduced in July 2000, it has been the subject of major questioning at a series of Senate estimates hearings, of representations to members of parliament from all parties in both houses and also of a report by the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
Basically it has been said that this payment has faults. No-one actually questions whether there is a need for the payment. In fact, we all agree, everybody in this place agrees, that there is a need for an effective family payment. We celebrate the fact that governments of all flavours have acknowledged that there need to be payments for families in Australia who are raising children. Those payments have been around in one form or another for many years. But, since its introduction, the family tax payment has caused stress, more so sometimes than the benefit gained from receipt. Why has it caused stress? It is because of the basic flaw in how the assessment of eligibility is determined.
Basically any payment that totally relies on people making a forward estimate of their income, being held to that estimate for 12 months and then being punished by the incursion of a debt if their income has changed cannot be promoted as a positive way of applauding the work of families, which was one of the positive aspects of this payment's introduction. This payment was going to respond to the needs of Australian families and people would be rewarded for the efforts of raising children; indeed, that was the intent.
We should be working together to ensure that that intent is actually implemented. But rather than people being able to work effectively in an honest, positive way with their government and with the department that implements the policy of their government, rather than developing that relationship, there is a relationship of fear. As I have said before in this place, that damages the whole process. We need to re-establish the trust and the respect on which, I believe, this payment was based.
The estimate process actively gives people the opportunity to put down honestly what they expect their income to be during the next 12 months. We have heard that over 95 per cent of the families who make the claim for this payment—and millions of Australian families have made claims for this payment since it was introduced—choose to receive fortnightly payments. There is a range of options, and the options have increased over the years because the government and the department have proved that they can be flexible. The range of options has changed to allow people to make a concrete choice of how they will take their payments. As we know, because the stress and strain on Australian families have been increasing, people need the money immediately. 
Senator Greig referred to the kinds of expenses that Australian families have and the kinds of immediate expenses that they have in raising children. The intent of the payment was to help families in our Australian society. Over 95 per cent of families have chosen to take a fortnightly payment, and that means that they can budget around that. The other small number of families, although the figure has been growing over the last 12 months, has decided to take a lump sum payment at the end of the year. That is a wise option, and one that the government has been actively encouraging because that enables the reconciliation—a wonderful term which we use in other ways in this place—of the payment and your estimated income at the beginning of the 12 months to be more effective.
Reconciling people's estimates with their actual income creates a huge workload for the people in the department. It takes a lot of time. One of the regular Senate estimates questions we ask is: how is the reconciliation of the payments going? When people reconcile their actual income with their estimate—the core aspect of this payment—they discover that mistakes have been made in the estimate. People's lifestyles and circumstances change in 12 months—for instance, being retrenched and having retrenchment payments coming into the family income. While it is a tragedy to have to receive a retrenchment payment, it is made worse because not only is your immediate and future lifestyle affected but your family payment situation is affected as well. No family can predetermine whether they are going to have a payment of that kind or not.
We have heard the former minister say in this place on a number of occasions that `a debt is a debt is a debt'. That was the response to questions about how payments under the social security system can be arranged. When a family receives notification from Centrelink—the department they rely on so intrinsically for their regular payment—that they have a debt, they feel that they have done something wrong. As I said previously, the relationship between the claimant and the department is not always as positive and as trusting as we would hope. I have had the experience of dealing with families who have felt as though they were criminals and that they had done something intrinsically wrong because they received notification from the department that they have a debt. 
The figures we have heard show that hundreds of thousands of people have incurred this debt. Over 600,000 people have incurred debts under this one particular payment in the Centrelink system. When these people receive notification that they are in debt, they feel that they have done something wrong and, in terms of the ongoing relationship, they are more reluctant to further engage in the system and to be as open and honest as the system demands. People feel guilty and feel as though they have been at fault in things over which they have no control.
In fact, we have heard that the department and the minister acknowledge that the vast majority of people who are caught up in the cycle of debt with this particular payment are not people who are defrauding or trying to manipulate the system to improve their circumstances; they are purely victims of a process and a payment system, the onus of which relies so totally on estimation. As we heard from Senator Bishop, any system that relies so totally on estimation allows itself to be vulnerable to mistakes. But these mistakes actually translate into trauma for families, into fear and sometimes into people being reluctant to further engage with the process.  
They also translate into what I think is one of the meanest aspects of the interaction between Centrelink and clients that I have seen over the last years: the absolute right of the department to strip the tax returns of claimants who have had an overpayment in this process. The methodology to collect `the debt is the debt is the debt' is the stripping of the annual tax return. Many members of the community budget so closely in the previous 12 months that they are reliant on receiving their tax return to be able to make payments on bills and expenses that build up over a period of time. We have all had the experience of waiting for the tax return. What we have now is people waiting for the tax return to find that, without any notice in a number of cases—and I cannot understand any system in which people's money is taken away before they are told that that is going to happen—that money is taken.
Whilst we acknowledge that a debt is a debt is a debt, basically the people caught up in this system would more than likely be very capable of negotiating a repayment process with the department. If the relationship between the department and the claimant is established as one of mutual respect and if there is an understanding of the process, we have enormous experience in negotiating repayment schedules. However, under this particular payment, the money is immediately withdrawn from the tax refund. So what you have is the double whammy. People are then caught up in another cycle of debt. If you have not got your tax refund to make payments on the various causes that you have, then you are working from behind. The sheer horror that these people find themselves caught in with this process damages them, damages the people who are working in the department and damages the integrity and effectiveness of the payment. Remember that this payment was not introduced as a revenue raiser but introduced as a way to help families in their economic circumstances.
I cannot understand how anyone could think the way the payment is operating could be defined as helpful for those people who have been caught up in the debt cycle. What we have in the proposal before us is an acknowledgement that the government is prepared to change, and we welcome that. However, the sadness about this process is that it does not go far enough. We are strongly in agreement that the family payment process must be maintained and must be strengthened. What we need to do is work out a way of making it effective. This legislation is a step towards achieving that. But why is the step so small? I have concentrated so far on people who have a debt out of the process but, as we are told, there are people who receive a top-up as well, and we welcome that. We welcome the fact that people do receive top-up payments, and the introduction of this legislation takes one small step towards making that easier for families by allowing them to have a longer period to claim their top-up payment. I emphasise it is their top-up payment. They would not be receiving a top-up payment from a government so focused on the debt aspect if they were not entitled to it and if they had not been receiving, on a fortnightly basis or at the end of the year, a smaller amount of money than that to which they were entitled.
Up until now, they have only had 12 months to put in their tax return to claim their top-up payment. Everybody knows that, under other aspects of the taxation system, you have a longer period to put in your tax return. This once again focuses on the complexity of the system. Why have one set of rules for the social security aspects of payments and a different set for the taxation aspects of payment? If we are looking at taxable income, surely under a simpler system—and we have heard discussion about simpler systems for many years in this place—the rules would be, if not the same, at least similar. We have identified this issue of the variation of the amount of time you have to put your claims in. The government has acknowledged that and extended the time now to two years—for a system that has been in place for three years. So anyone in the first year is not affected by this catch-up. I cannot understand the rationale behind that decision. 
When the member for Throsby in the other place was speaking on this legislation, she referred to a family in her constituency that actually fought the good fight on this payment. Being small business owners who were working themselves through the GST process, they found themselves in the situation of being late with their tax return. When they were late with their tax return, they were late with the family tax payment catch-up arrangement and missed out on $4,189.69 to which they were entitled. But this family—and I think with the great assistance of the member for Throsby—worked through the existing system of appeal. I am a great believer in appeals and I think we have a fairly reasonable appeals system the way we operate now. This family did the right thing: they went through the appeals system. They first went through the internal review with the department and then went through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Through their activity, they have highlighted the very change this legislation is addressing. They highlighted, through their situation, the need for a greater period, particularly for families putting in their tax returns and going through the reconciliation process.
This should have been a major victory. The family, through the SSAT process, had identified the issue. However, their case related to the first year of the payment. So the change we are welcoming in this legislation, whilst acknowledging the very point about the timing of tax returns, will not help them. They will not be rewarded by receiving the money to which they should be entitled. I am at a loss to know how we can be moving legislation and not acknowledge the flaws in the system. Senator Bishop and Senator Greig have acknowledged the flaws in the system. Instead of fixing up just one element of it, why not go the whole way? Why stop at two years? So far, I have seen no explanation that covers that point.
So we move now to the next round of Senate estimates. In the next round of Senate estimates, exactly the same questions will be asked that have been asked over the last three years: how many payments, how many families have been caught up in debt in this process, what is the amount of the debt and how is the reconciliation process going? It will be the same series of questions about the same payment. Surely by now we should have been able to identify the basic flaw in the system. We should have been able to acknowledge that there are ways to make it work. We should have been able to identify that there is a willingness to make it work, and we should have been able to work effectively to ensure that the family tax payment, which was designed to help families, can with just a little bit more effort be made to do that for which it was intended—help families.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-10-13,"—I rise to contribute to the second reading debate on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 and to place on the record that One Nation will support the government's legislation. I will also make some comments about the amendments proposed by the Democrats and the Labor Party. The bill amends the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 to allow a longer period for families to make a claim for a lump sum payment, as Senator Moore has just very clearly described in her contribution. The bill also allows the time frame for payment of top-ups to be extended for 12 months.  
The problem with the present system, I believe, is in a situation where the person involved has provided the Department of Family and Community Services with the correct information and it is the department which has made the error. I give an example of one parent, who just happens to be a custodial parent, who spent two years without receiving child support from the non-custodial parent. At the end of that two-year period there was some form of resolution of those non-payments of child support. An amount of money was paid into the custodial parent's account. Then, out of the blue, comes a notice from the department that an overpayment had been made, based on the correct information given to the department, and this person was required within one month to repay $6,000. They contacted the department and explained that they had had extreme difficulties over the previous two years and that they needed some time to be able to make the repayment. 
The next step in the process was for this person to receive a letter of demand from a debt collection agency. There was no further contact from the department—just a commercial debt collector stepping up at the door saying, `You owe $6,000.' The single custodial parent contacted the department again. Did they get a hearing from the department? No, they did not. The department had swept the person's accounts and had determined that the $6,000 was there and they wanted it back there and then. That single parent, who had lived in abject poverty for two years as a result of not receiving child support payments for their child, then found themselves back in exactly the same boat because the department took that $6,000 straight out of their account. This is the attitude that we are finding with this department—not one of compassion but one of absolute power.
This brings me to the two lots of proposed amendments. I will speak first of all to the amendments proposed by Senator Bishop on behalf of the Labor Party. They, to a large degree, address the issue where the department is seizing a tax refund. Labor's amendment seeks to insert after the word `may' the words `with the prior written consent of the person'. Although I understand the Labor Party to be saying that if this amendment were passed the department would not be able to seize that tax return without the consent of the person, I put to the chamber: what if that person is in exactly the same position as the person I described, the single parent, that had put in the correct information and the overpayment was an error by the department? The Labor Party's amendment does not resolve the issue, because that person could say to the department, `You can't have my tax refund,' but the department would merely say, `Then we'll get it another way.' 
I believe that the amendment which will be put forward by Senator Greig on behalf of the Democrats is a much better amendment, and One Nation will support that amendment. That amendment clearly sets out that, if there is a debt due to the Commonwealth which is an overpayment that has been made as the result of an error by the Commonwealth and the person receiving the overpayment did not contribute to the error, the overpayment is not a debt due to the Commonwealth. That is absolutely and succinctly clear. If the department gets it wrong, then that is not a debt to the Commonwealth. I believe, for that reason, the Democrat amendment is a much better amendment which will resolve all of the issues. It does not resolve the issue of having their tax refund swept and removed but actually removes the debt for the person who has not contributed in any way to the situation.  
The second amendment I like that Senator Greig will move on behalf of the Democrats is that if there has been an error and a person has given the department what they believe to be their projected income for the year and has received a benefit based on that projected income but subsequently their actual income is higher than they estimated—so, yes, the person has contributed to the error by underestimating their income—the person be given double the time to pay back that overpayment. Rather than have their tax refund stripped from them, the Democrat proposal is that, if they received an overpayment over a 12-month period, they would have the next two years in which to repay that overpayment. One Nation believes that that is a much fairer and far more acceptable social process.
In conclusion, I place on record that One Nation supports the government's bill because it will allow people an extra 12 months if they do not get their tax return in on time. Let us face it: for various reasons all of us have found ourselves in that situation, including me. That will help families to still be able to get that lump sum payment when they have underestimated their income. The government is on the right track, but I believe that the amendments of the Australian Democrats resolve two of the other major issues: firstly, if the debt occurs as a result of the department's error it is not claimable as a debt; and, secondly, if a person has inadvertently underestimated their income that person should be given a longer period to make restitution.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-10-13,"—I rise to comment on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003. This legislation will go only partly towards fixing the shocking debacle that was left by the former Minister for Family and Community Services. The family tax benefit requires most families to provide forward estimates of their income—in other words, to look into a crystal ball—to receive their fortnightly family benefits payment. Ninety-five per cent of people choose this option rather than claiming the benefit at the end of the financial year, but 95 per cent of people do not have a crystal ball—this government would expect them to have one. This is due to the fact that most Australian families rely and depend on that little bit extra each fortnight to keep the household running. They simply cannot afford to wait until tax time, which is why most of them choose to provide forward estimates of their income. While the tax legislation provides families with the opportunity to claim additional deductions and offsets up to four years after the relevant financial year, the family tax benefit rules currently only allow for top-ups and lump sums to be paid within 12 months of the relevant financial year. This limitation meant that 25,072 family tax benefit recipients who lodged 2000-01 tax returns after 30 June 2002 were denied more than a staggering $37 million—an average of $1,477 per family tax benefit recipient—in top-up payments of their 2000-01 family tax benefit entitlements.
Let me focus on what is happening to Northern Territory families. There were 6,938 families in the Northern Territory with debts from the 2001-02 financial year. The total of these debts is an enormous $12,483,940—that is, an average of $1,799 per family. I can give you many examples of people in my electorate who have been hard hit by this government's policy. I have had people in my office in tears, particularly women, some of them Defence Force family members, who are facing debts of a minimum $2,000 and some of them up to $7,000 and $8,000. Let me provide you with one example of a message from a Northern Territory constituent which I received on Monday, 6 October. It says: 
Having moved to the Territory 12 months ago and enrolling as a voter here, I wish to advise you of a situation we are experiencing. 
They may take some comfort in knowing that they are not the only ones in this country who are experiencing this sort of situation. This family has a four-year-old child and for the first three years one partner stayed at home. After they moved to the Territory, the higher cost of living forced one of the partners to re-enter the work force in January beginning to work part time and in May working full time. They outline in this message to me a whole history of what has happened to them under the family tax debt arrangements. They say:
To ensure we correctly filled out our Tax returns for the last financial year we sought the service of a fully qualified accountant. The returns were signed and we eagerly awaited for the returns to come back.
When they did to our surprise my partner received a cheque for $0.00. We contacted the Taxation Office who advised that due to the FAO over paying us $1580.71 the anticipated return of $1222.00 was forward to them. We also still owed them a balance of $358.71
This is the thing that is staggering—they say:
Can you please explain to me how you tell a 4 year old that he can't go back to Adelaide to see his grandparents. We were to use this Tax return to visit them, who he hasn't seen since October 2002.
They ask these very valid questions of me, which I think it is this government's responsibility to answer. They say:
How could we be in this position when we were totally honest with the FAO advising them regularly when our estimated income changed. ... For them to say “Sorry, we made a mistake in the calculations” is totally unacceptable.
Why were we not advised of their error, until we contacted them after receiving a cheque for $0.00. I'm sure it would have cost money to raise this cheque.
Why weren't we given an option of paying back the owed 1,580.71—
That is a very good question; why were they not given the option of paying that money back, rather than simply having $1,580 garnished immediately and instantly from their tax return? They continue—
instead of taking the Tax return. They never over paid us in a lump sum so why take it back in this manner.
Then they say:
What incentive do we have for my partner to continue full time work, or do we need to consider moving back to South Australia where we can live on one wage.
These are ordinary people and this system is affecting them in their normal day-to-day family life in the Territory. They are trying to make ends meet, bringing up children and, of course, anticipating eagerly that they will be able to get back to Adelaide at Christmas time. These are genuine, honest, hardworking, normal Territory people, who ask the very valid question as to why such a large amount—$1,580—was simply taken out of their tax return and they were not even given a chance to repay that over a period of weeks and months. Many of these families have been hit with debts two years running. If they lodge their tax returns this year, many will get a third debt. 
This government have failed to fix the flawed system for the last two years and so far they have refused to close the loopholes that allow wealthy families to claim family tax benefit part A and the ever-confusing maternity allowance. One in three families fell foul in the first years of operation of this failed system. To hide the scale of the problem, at the last election the Prime Minister was forced to allow a tolerance of up to $2,000 per family for overpayments. Instead of fixing the system back then, the government advised families to lie about their income and deliberately forgo fortnightly assistance. Labor wants to solve the problem rather than ignore it, as the government is doing. Under Labor, changes will be made to reduce the chance of overpayments and the support and work and caring patterns of individual families will be recognised. I can assure the minister that many families in my electorate will not forget this shambles come election time. 
I might add that this system has particularly affected families in the electorate who belong to the Defence Force. These are people who expected that allowances they received as members of the Defence Force—particularly their remote leave locality travel allowance and airconditioning allowance, which the government only reinstated to them this year—would be given to them over and above everything else, because that is what they expected as part of their responsibilities in being a member of the Defence Force when they accepted a posting and went to the Territory. Under the fringe benefits reportable system, it is now part of their claimable and declarable total income for the year.
In anticipating their family tax debt, these people never realised they would have to add in those allowances. They never dreamed that the very incentives they were getting for working with the defence forces in the Northern Territory would be the very incentives that would be used against them and that they would incur a family tax debt. Many families, particularly Defence Force families in the Territory, have been hit hard by this policy. They have tried to anticipate their yearly income and, of course, they have not included any allowances they would get automatically for being part of the Defence Force. 
This just shows that the government is out of touch with many things. It is out of touch with what happens to ordinary families. It is out of touch with what happens to Defence Force families and, most importantly, it is out of touch generally with Australian families across the board. Ask any Centrelink customer or any member of this government what they think the weather will be on 7 May next year in Canberra. They will not know; no-one could possibly know that. That is the same as asking what anyone's income will be for the next 12 months, particularly if they are a casual or part-time worker or, in the case of the Territory, a member of the Defence Force. Mothers who may be considering returning to work as casual workers—for instance, relief teachers, casual nurses or subcontractors—cannot possibly calculate their projected income, yet they simply cannot afford to wait until the end of the year. It is simply not as easy as predicting that Carlton will be the wooden spooners or close to it at the end of the AFL season next year. That would be much easier to predict than something under this government's family tax system.
Stripping families of their expected returns at tax time is a very harsh measure. Families are paying for it. It is indicative of this government's hardline approach to the average Australian family. Families should be given the opportunity to discuss repayment options, as in the case of this family whose message I received just two weeks ago. Tax returns should not be automatically used to pay back Centrelink debts. Most families would be happy and would recognise—and do recognise—that they have a debt and would come to some arrangement to repay that debt. But not to be given an option is unconscionable. It reminds me of bailiff-type tactics—but even then bailiffs sometimes have scruples. It also reminds me of an interview on aged pension debts that the previous minister, Senator Vanstone, had in August this year when she appeared on A Current Affair. The interviewer asked: 
What if they don't have the cash?
Minister Vanstone said:
Well, we would look at their assets.
The interviewer asked:
So would you be prepared to sell up their family homes?
And the minister replied:
Well I would be.
So this government will stop at nothing. Tax returns provide many families with a little cash—or a windfall, if you like—in the lead-up to Christmas. To seize this money without the consent or knowledge of the customer is simply outrageous. Earlier this year the Commonwealth Ombudsman recommended wholesale reform of the scheme because minor policy changes would still not prevent a large number of families from accruing unavoidable debts. We are yet to see any changes that significantly benefit families.
This government has failed Australia's working families, and these pressures have placed too many families under stress. Parents have had to sacrifice more and more time with their kids just to keep the family budget together. Working hours have become unpredictable. Under the Howard government we have seen household debt go up to a record $550 billion; credit card debt now stands at $20.5 billion; and, on average, households owe more than they can earn. This is hardly something to be pleased about, but the government is doing very little to address these issues. Services are harder to access and are less affordable. The costs of education and health care are rising. Of course, under the government's packages for Medicare and higher education, that will be even more the case.
A Crean Labor government, though, will ensure support to working families through a fairer payment system. A Crean Labor government will focus on helping families, especially in the first five years of their children's lives, through paid maternity leave, more accessible and affordable child-care services, and a modern approach to workplace relations. Under a Crean Labor government, parents could be certain that payments would be adjusted correctly when they advise of a change in income. Parents would be better supported during transitions in and out of work, without the risk of big debts. Labor will make family payments fairer by removing the guesswork and providing greater certainty. Amendments that enable families choice about how they pay their debts are welcomed as an initial step. However, they still go nowhere near fixing the mess that the former minister has now handballed to Senator Patterson. I sincerely hope that the new minister will recognise this mess and do something to fix the system.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2003-10-13,"—I cannot go through in absolute detail everything that has been said this evening, although I have been listening in my room, but I will start by saying that around two million Australian families—with 3½ million children—benefited from the introduction of the family tax benefit. That is the vast majority of Australian families with dependent children. Government expenditure on family assistance increased by around $2 billion a year. The income testing arrangements under the FTB are more generous, with more families receiving maximum levels of assistance and families able to keep more of each dollar they earn.
In addition, when Labor was in government and people had to make an assessment of their income, if they overestimated their income there was no top-up. Tonight I do not think we have heard one person mention the fact that, if people overestimate their income and get a lower family tax benefit, they can get a top-up at the end of the year. That never happened under Labor. The family allowance was not topped up. Nobody tonight has mentioned that. Nobody has actually said that there is a positive on this side if people overestimate their income either to hedge against an increase in their income or to hedge against the possibility that they may have an overpayment at the end of the year. Some people choose to do that. Some people underestimate their income to get a higher family tax benefit and see that they can pay it back at the end. 
People are told that they will have their overpayment taken out of their tax refund. That information is in a number of places. I am looking to see whether I think it is in a sufficient number of places and whether recipients are told sufficiently often. Being very new to the portfolio, I am not totally on top of how often they are told, but I tell you that I will guarantee that they will be told very often to make sure that they are very clear that if they get an overpayment it will come out of their income tax refund, because it is a debt to the Commonwealth. I think it is important that they understand that they need to try to estimate their income as accurately as possible and that it is better to overestimate their income and have a windfall at the end of the year than to underestimate it.
The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Extension of Time Limits) Bill 2003 makes a number of important changes to the family assistance law. In broad terms, amendments are made to the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 to give families more time to claim family tax benefit or child-care benefit as a lump sum for a previous income year and to provide greater capacity in the family assistance law to pay top-ups of FTB—top-ups that were never available under Labor. These changes address issues raised by the Ombudsman in his own recent investigation into family assistance administration and impacts on Family Assistance Office customers, and are consistent with suggestions made by tax agents for enhancements to the existing administrative arrangements for FTB.
The bill extends the time limits for making past period claims for FTB and child-care benefit by 12 months. The effect is that families will have two years after the end of the relevant income year in which to make a past period claim. These changes will apply to the 2001-02 income year and to subsequent income years. For the 2001-02 income year, this means that families will have until 30 June 2004, instead of the current 30 June 2003, to make a past period claim. The bill also extends the time frame for payments of top-ups—again, top-ups that were not available under the previous family allowance payments of the Labor government. The time frame has been extended for top-ups to the FTB by 12 months.
Under the current rules, families can be paid a top-up of FTB only if the relevant tax returns are lodged within 12 months of the end of the income year to which the payment relates. This rule facilitates the process of income reconciliation and enables top-ups to be paid when the customer has been paid family tax benefit on the basis of an overestimate of income. If tax returns are not lodged on time then actual and estimated income cannot be reconciled, and the amounts of the FTB paid in the relevant income year become a debt until such time as income reconciliation can occur. This bill does not change the legal requirement for families to lodge tax returns within 12 months of the end of the income year to which the payment relates. However, it does enable families to receive a top-up of FTB if they do not lodge within those 12 months, provided that they lodge in the subsequent 12 months. 
This measure will enable top-ups to be paid in respect of the 2001-02 income year if the relevant tax returns are lodged by 30 June 2004 instead of by 30 June 2003. The new time frames will also apply to later income years. The deadline for lodging tax returns for taxation purposes is not affected by this measure. Centrelink has already paid out $870 million in top-ups since the introduction of the FTB. Extending the deadline by an additional 12 months will be a further boost to approximately 35,000 families at an estimated cost of $45 million per annum. The time frames related to the exchange, use and destruction of tax file number data for income reconciliation purposes is extended from two to three years. This change is consistent with the extended time frames for the past period claims of FTB and child-care benefit and for the payment of top-ups of FTB. Consequential amendments are made to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to enable families who use the services of a recognised tax adviser to make past period claims from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004, and they continue to be able to claim the adviser's fee as a tax deduction.
A number of measures were introduced by the former minister to assist clients of Centrelink to assess their income and to take up various options of their FTB payments in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of overpayments. We are trying to make sure that clients are as aware as possible of those various options. I think it is important that we do everything to ensure that we reduce the risk of overpayments. There will always be situations in which clients are unable or have not been able to assess their income and will require top-ups or will incur a debt. We have to make sure that they are as informed as they possibly can be about the need to be as accurate as possible and about the need to take up the options offered to Centrelink clients who are eligible for an FTB in More Choice for Families, and we have to make sure that they are more aware that their tax rebate will be affected if they have an overpayment. The information is there and, as I said, I am trying to make sure that they get that information as often as possible so that they are very aware that the debt they have incurred will need to be repaid and that one way in which it will be repaid is through their tax rebate.

Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EXTENSION OF TIME LIMITS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2003-10-13,"—During August and September this year I have had the good fortune to be able to venture into the heartland of Western Australia's wheat belt to attend the famous Dowerin and Newdegate field days and to see first-hand the remarkable transformation that this current season has brought to this part of Western Australia. This time last year saw barren paddocks with, at best, a stubble pretending to be a crop, with dust storms and water carting the order of the day.
Hopefully—and barring any natural or other catastrophes—Western Australia's grain producers are in for a very good harvest. Despite current appearances, there are still the ravages of fungus and frost, hail and other weather extremes to be negotiated. So, while there is an air of optimism, it is still tempered by the reality of Australian farmers being at the mercy of so many variables. Commentators are currently talking of a gross tonnage harvest somewhere between 10 and 16 million tonnes in Western Australia alone. A harvest delivering at the upper end of this range has the potential to create something of a logistical receival and storage problem for my state's single grain handler, Co-operative Bulk Handling. CBH is quite a remarkable organisation, with over 170 receival points throughout Western Australia and a massive port and storage infrastructure capable of moving and storing in excess of 12 million tonnes of grain—namely wheat, barley and oats. 
Whilst I have used the word `problem' in anticipation of a good harvest, it is a welcome problem for Western Australian grain growers after the heartbreak of the last couple of years. Western Australian farmers are very optimistic about the future. Nowhere has this been more apparent than at the two field days which I mentioned that I have attended over the past few months where, in discussions with farmers and grain industry people, the upward swing in people's attitude towards a return to more prosperous times is very evident.
I attended the Dowerin Field Day on Wednesday, 27th August along with 30,000 other people. This field day is a serious `big time' event and, according to the Dowerin people, the total attendance of approximately 60,000 over the three days ranked second only to the nation's largest field day, the Orange Field Day in New South Wales. This year some 750 exhibitors fielded about $70 million worth of products and equipment. The event has grown from its humble beginnings in 1968 to such an extent that a waiting list of prospective exhibitors has had to be established. This year 70 new exhibitors put up their displays for the first time, ranging from enterprising small business operators that have developed innovative products particularly suited to primary industries to the newest equipment from the biggest names in world agriculture. What makes this field day so attractive for the farming community is the opportunity to see the latest agricultural machinery being put through their paces in actual field trials and demonstrations. With the prospect of a good season, the interest in the latest and greatest agricultural machinery was very high. The only dampener for farmers was that many suppliers have already closed off their order books for many lines of harvesting equipment.
One group I want to make a special mention of is the Kondinin Group, which have been operating all over Australia for the past 40 or so years, having had their genesis in Western Australia. They took their name from the famous town in Western Australia. All those years ago a group of enterprising farmers took a long-term view of their industry and identified the need for agricultural research in areas not normally undertaken by the CSIRO. This included practical advice on field tests on machinery and on what works best in particular areas of Australia's agricultural regions.
With the frenetic change in technology, this advice has proven invaluable to farmers when they make their machinery purchases, especially considering that to purchase the latest seeding rig a farmer is looking at a price tag approaching half a million dollars. The Kondinin Group faced a big challenge last year because of the Australia-wide drought that affected many farmers. Unfortunately, annual subscriptions to fund this research enterprise were crossed off many farmers' `to pay' lists. However, once it became clear that the group might fold, the farmers of Australia rallied and the business is once again on the road to recovery. Indeed, I am happy to report to the Senate that it is a thriving enterprise.
The second field day I attended was at Newdegate, 400 kilometres south-east of Perth, on Wednesday, 3 September. This is a two-day event and caters primarily for the farmers in the south-east region of Western Australia. Once again there was a spirit of optimism. Within the machinery section alone there were over 160 displays. Although the focus was on machinery, there was also a wide representation in the display of sheep, particularly rams for sale and cattle. But machinery was where the attention was mostly focused at Newdegate. 
I was particularly pleased to see the continuing growth of regional Western Australian businesses that specialise in the production of agricultural equipment. One such piece of machinery that caught my eye was a boom spray that was built by a company based in the small wheat-belt town of Narembeen. This company produces one of the largest sprayers in the world. It is a single axle boom spray and has been designed as a tractor drawn unit, with a 7,000-litre tank, a 1,200-litre flush tank and a boom width of 46.3 metres. It is hydraulically driven with a multistaged second line that gives greater flexibility in water rates, pressures, speeds and jet combinations and, best of all, can be easily operated by a single operator.
Another small regional company based in Beverley had a similar machine that was highly rated by the Kondinin Group. What both of these companies showed is the ability of small regional manufacturers to be competitive in the wider market. To these two companies and to the many other small regional manufacturers I give them my hearty congratulations. It is very good to see that entrepreneurship is still alive and thriving in the Western Australian country towns, notwithstanding the very severe drought that we went through last season.
I want to extend my hearty congratulations to the two organising committees at Dowerin and Newdegate for a job very well done. Both committees are outstanding examples of community `can do' attitudes that focus attention on their respective towns and, above all, recognise the invaluable contribution that Western Australian agriculture makes to the state's and to the nation's economy.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Agriculture: Dowerin and Newdegate Field Days</title>,Adjournment,20,1
