"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,2000-06-22,"—I present the following paper: Australia's Health 2000, the seventh biennial health report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND WELFARE</title>,<title>Report</title>,Miscellaneous,6,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—The Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 is another piece of legislation which shows that Australia has a Commonwealth government which promises something before an election and delivers it immediately after. This legislation is a fulfilment of the obligation to assist particularly those in rural and regional Australia with regard to proceeds from the sale of the second tranche of Telstra for the provision of untimed local calls to consumers in extended zones who currently do not enjoy such a service. In fact, in the 1998 election campaign $150 million was promised, and of course it is being delivered for just that purpose.
This particular bill amends part 2 of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999, and that is all to do with the universal service obligation regime. What we are trying to do here is, firstly, to enhance some industry certainty about just how the costs associated with this universal service obligation will in fact be returned upon over the next financial year. We want to ensure that the minister is able to determine exactly what the USO costs are in advance of each of the years. Also, we are supporting through this legislation the proposed tender of $150 million for the provision of untimed local calls, and we are therefore meeting our election obligation.
There certainly is a lot of paranoia associated with this USO and suggesting that perhaps it is linked directly to ownership. But with so many telcos now operating in Australia there is absolutely no reason whatsoever why it needs to be Telstra and Telstra alone that delivers upon this universal service obligation. So this government is all about ensuring that consumers are feeling very much at ease with the idea that others may in fact be able to deliver more for the same amount, or perhaps even less over time than Telstra has been able to do. There are some on the government side and certainly those on the other side who constantly bay that if it is not Telstra it is not telecommunications, that the Telstra badge has to be seen on anything to do with the delivery of telephone services, particularly in rural and regional Australia. I say to those people very clearly that by constantly trying to prop up the need to have a Telstra badge on anything to do with telecommunications they are in fact doing themselves out of the wide range of possibilities that legitimately could be delivered as a result of the level of competition, backed up by the certainty contained within this Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill. There is no reason whatsoever for people to fear that not having Telstra in their town, or Telstra not being the provider of the universal service obligation, should deliver a poorer standard. If one has a look at some of the things being proposed by a couple of different companies currently on the agenda, we can see, even for people in the most remote parts of Australia, the prospect of full Internet services such as those provided in the inner-city parts of our major cities, and the very best of telephone services, at untimed local call rates, within extended zones as a result of this legislation. We can see vastly improved television services, even down to pay television services, although I suspect that those of us who subscribe would think they have now got 36 channels where they cannot find anything worth while to watch instead of just four or five. As well, importantly, there is streaming audio, that is, radio services that they are not currently enjoying. I think that is of particular consequence to a lot of people, particularly in the very remote parts of Australia, those very isolated 40,000 subscribers out in the far extended zones. 
This government, through this legislation, is fulfilling an election obligation. This government, through this legislation, is also providing some certainty for today and into the future as far as telecommunication service standards are concerned. The government is also responding to those who would like to try to create mischief, day in day out, about whether or not some of the proceeds from the sale of the second tranche of Telstra are in fact being delivered in the bush. I am very confident that, as a result of this legislation, amongst other measures which this government has put in place, people in the remotest part of rural and regional Australia are going to enjoy a greater sense of understanding and certainty as far as their telecommunication services are concerned.
Therefore, this bill is a very important piece of legislation. It is undoing what was a failure of those opposite for 13 years—it is addressing the plight of customers in extended zones of Australia. The Labor Party did nothing during those 13 years to provide any of the certainty that we are providing in this legislation. The Labor Party turned its back on rural and regional Australia who, in turn, rightly responded in elections in 1996 and 1998 by turning their backs on the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party is the organisation which opposed the T2 sale. Therefore, at the heart of the legislation, it opposes the measures that are contained within it. So anybody listening to the parliament today or reading the Hansard, for whatever reason, and those in the galleries need to understand very clearly that the Australian Labor Party is not in favour of extending the sort of customer protection and certainty, improved services and so forth, that are being offered as a result of this legislation. That is a statement of absolute fact.
When you look at what is happening in the cities of Australia, you see the need for some action there as well. Standards need to be upheld. The government's measures in regard to telecommunications and the provision of mobile phone telephony and the roll-out procedures that are following need to be enhanced by action, particularly from the Australian Labor Party in the city of Brisbane. It is astonishing to me to find that, 3½ years after legislation to do with mobile telephony and the roll-out of infrastructure was introduced into this place and passed, we are still finding planning provisions not being fully followed through by the Brisbane City Council. As an agent of the state government of Queensland, the Brisbane City Council was given powers under the Telecommunications Act 1997 to look at the planning criterion attached to the roll-out of infrastructure. We did not hear any complaints from Lord Mayor Soorley in Brisbane prior to the formation of the Howard government in 1996 about how this infrastructure was impacting upon the amenity of people in the city of Brisbane—no comment at all about impact—but, of course, we do these days. 
When the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts conducted a review of the operations of the 1997 telecommunications determination governing low-impact facilities—the review was intended to report on any difficulties that may have been encountered in its practical application and identify ways in which these problems might be addressed—it is astonishing to note that the Brisbane City Council did not even present a written submission, while a number of other local authorities around Australia did. The reason I raise this is that the Brisbane City Council is now adopting a `We didn't have an opinion then but now we do' approach to this whole argument. The Brisbane City Council is basically saying to the people of Brisbane, `We actually don't want the responsibility to plan for telecommunications infrastructure. We don't want to protect the citizens of Brisbane by providing them with the proper processes and insisting that telecommunications companies themselves keep in mind the consumer and general citizenry feeling about infrastructure.' I suspect the time may come when, if the Brisbane City Council cannot live up to what has been their obligation for 3½ years under legislation passed by this place, we would always be prepared to review that legislation to give greater instruction to the Brisbane City Council.
Just as various telcos gain the possibility of tendering for universal service obligation under this act, various telcos are currently rolling out infrastructure through my electorate of Moreton, through the southern suburbs of Brisbane. I have to say in this place that organisations such as One.Tel need to hang their heads in shame because the great irony is that in rural and regional Australia they are screaming out for infrastructure, while in the cities of Australia organisations like One.Tel are approaching this thing like a bunch of cowboys. They are rolling out infrastructure with very little regard for the feelings of those who actually have to accommodate it—the neighbours of that infrastructure. Organisations like One.Tel should take very much to heart my warning to them; that is, if they do not pick up their act; if they do not start to consider the neighbours of their infrastructure and the placement of their infrastructure; if they do not adopt an approach of proper consultation and of dealing through channels; and if they keep trying to hide behind the Telecommunications Act—saying that a telecommunications mobile phone tower is low impact and therefore a council should not intervene, and the councils themselves accepting that sort of explanation without any challenge—then organisations like One.Tel without any great commonsense are going to find themselves being come down upon very heavily, I believe, by laws in this place. 
I make the point that, if you want to talk about consumer protection and service standards, matters contained in a positive way within this bill, I will be quite willing to revisit legislation previously passed in this place to ensure that consumers and residents who are next door to particular infrastructure, or who may be threatened in their own minds by the fact that they are going to be placed next door to infrastructure, are themselves also protected from the telecommunications roll-out regime. So One.Tel and others, Optus included, can consider themselves on notice. Their conduct has been very obvious to many of us who have city based electorates. They need to pick up their act in a big way. 
What is at the heart of the particular aspect I have raised is the credibility of the entire telecommunications industry. There are those who wish to see—understandably so—greater access to telecommunications possibilities, particular those in rural and regional Australia who are screaming out for it. This bill provides for that. There are those of us who live in cities who also want to see greater possibilities and ready access to the various advances that come our way through telecommunications. For those who live next door to infrastructure or for those who are not being well served by their councils properly zoning the infrastructure placement, such as is the case in the city of Brisbane, we cannot allow them to become victims or not-thought-about commodities in the urgent roll-out which is occurring, particularly in organisations such as One.Tel. Corporate citizens should be good in this country. If they are not, legislators have a role to play. I do not for a moment hesitate in representing vigorously the views of my constituents in this or any other forum about these sorts of matters.
The bill before us is, I believe, of great benefit to a great number of Australians who have been crying out for such benefits. The bill before us provides the sort of certainty, promised before an election and delivered upon after an election, that a lot of people in rural and remote Australia demand. I still say that people in city Australia also demand a certain amount of certainty, consumer protection, service standards and corporate standards which do not seem to be coming from too many of the telcos in their current roll-out hysteria. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate and to perhaps get the previous speaker to understand that his view about what regional and remote Australia might need in relation to telecommunications and what are the standards they currently enjoy is nowhere near the fact. He really has no appreciation of what is happening in terms of telecommunications in isolated areas of Australia. There are probably only two or three other people in this place who have any first-hand experience of the current failure of the telecommunications infrastructure that Telstra supplies in regional and remote areas. As the member for the Northern Territory, I am particularly concerned about the lack of service that is currently provided in remote areas of northern Australia. 
The Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 has two principal objectives: to enable the minister to determine a universal service provider's net universal service costs for up to three yeas in advance and to give carriers tendering for the $150 million allocation to extend access to untimed local calls in remote Australia some certainty about the universal service regime that will apply if they win the tender. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that there has been a Senate inquiry into this issue and that the Labor members of the Senate committee have dissented in the report. In their dissension they have acknowledged the fundamental importance of the universal service obligation in ensuring the delivery of minimum telecommunications services to rural and regional Australia. They have condemned the government for its continuing push for the full privatision of Telstra, a policy which would inevitably lead to a decline in services to rural and regional Australia.
I will come back to the remainder of the issues they raised shortly, but I want to pick up on this issue of the decline in services. I have in front of me a letter from a constituent to the member for Arnhem in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, John Ah Kit. This letter relates to a lady who lives in an Aboriginal community on the northern coast of the Northern Territory and Arnhem Land called Milingimbi. The previous speaker, the member for Moreton, knows a bit about Brisbane, but he knows bugger all about the bush. He certainly knows nothing about Milingimbi and he certainly knows nothing about the standard of services that prevails there. I wonder if the minister at the table, Mr McGauran, knows where Milingimbi is or if he is aware of the concerns that have been expressed by Milingimbi residents about the failure of Telstra to provide telecommunications infrastructure. 
In this correspondence to John Ah Kit, this person outlines in some detail the sorry story that she has experienced in relation to the provision of a telephone. This goes back to November 1999, when a cable had been laid by Telstra in a trench from the fence to her house. But there was no trench extending from the property to the Telstra box. Telstra advised that they did not dig such trenches, that it was up to someone else to do that and that she should go to see the local CDEP team. She did and, unfortunately, they were not able to do it at that time. She then spoke to Telstra and advised them that the CDEP team would be unable to dig the trench over the Christmas break. Telstra said they would not do it.
In February 2000, she phoned Telstra about supplying a minisat phone, as she was unable to communicate with her family via telecommunications, apart from when she was at work at the local clinic. When she wrote this letter, she expressed her exasperation at the failure of Telstra to deliver a service. Telstra were initially contacted on 7 October 1999. It is now 22 June 2000 and she still has no telephone. This sorry story is repeated time and time again across remote Australia. It is not the fault of the Telstra personnel, who do their utmost out of Darwin and other areas of the Northern Territory to provide services. The fact is that it is an absolute failure at the management level of Telstra to provide appropriate resources so that these people can do their jobs properly. When she wrote this letter to John Ah Kit in March—and I am advised this morning that there is still no telephone—she said:
I have worked at Milingimbi for almost three years now, but my family live in Tasmania. Without a telephone I am feeling isolated. ... My mother is a frail elderly lady, who has poor health. I have had to give other people's telephone numbers to family members in case they need to contact me urgently after hours. These friends have said they will relay messages to me at night if needed. If I want to talk with family and friends I have to go to the Health Centre of a night to ring. It is extremely frustrating being unable to access the phone when and how I wish.
She makes the point:
There are two nurses at Gapuwiyak Health Centre—
Gapuwiyak is away from Milingimbi, also in north-east Arnhem Land—
who are also waiting for phones.
She makes the point that they have been given satellite phones. What is interesting about this statement is her observation about the paucity of government policy. She makes this comment: 
Final comment! John Howard says that services in the bush will not be diminished. My answer is that these services cannot be diminished where there are no services.
I think that is a fairly succinct appreciation of what is happening in many parts of remote Australia. Telstra is failing to do the job that it is supposed to do, currently failing to carry out its obligations under the USO. Here we have a proposal from this government that, if we go down the road of tendering out the USO on privatised Telstra, somehow or another these people will get services. I remind the House where these people live. They live in small pockets of 200, 500 or 800 people scattered right across Northern Australia in very isolated communities. They are not the cream. It is a high cost exercise to provide these services. Unfortunately, as a result of government policy and as a result of the inadequacy in Telstra senior management and their unwillingness to provide the appropriate resources, these services are not being provided.
You would be aware, I hope, Minister, of where Groote Eylandt is. Groote Eylandt is not by any means a poor community. There is a large mine on Groote Eylandt. The Angurugu community government council, which is away from the mining settlement, was promised a fibre-optic cable at August of last year. In the early 1980s Telstra did something which was unprecedented and outlayed tens of millions of dollars to put in microwave transmissions systems across Northern Australia. But, whilst it was very important and very useful at the time it was introduced, because hitherto people had no access to a telephone at all, unfortunately that technology is so outdated that it cannot carry the load. It certainly cannot carry the data passing across telephone lines to get basic services like the Internet or even faxes. At the Angurugu council, the service to the community has been extremely poor for some time and, despite the fact that they were promised by Telstra that they would have a fibre-optic link by August of last year, there is no fibre-optic link. The council were advised yesterday that  the cable would not be provided until next financial year because there was a budget overrun. Do you think that would happen if it were in the honourable member for Bennelong's electorate or the minister at the table's electorate? The fact is that the government, through Telstra, is failing in its responsibilities to these Australian citizens who are not being given appropriate recognition in terms of the services they require and should expect to get from Telstra. Who is responsible for this? The government.
No-one I have spoken to in my electorate believes that they will get any benefits out of the full privatisation of Telstra. They say, as my constituent has said, that really what we need is services. They will only be provided by dint of direction, not some vague undertaking that somehow or another a privatised Telstra with all its commercial imperatives will provide these loss making services to communities. We know they will not, yet we have ministers prepared to stand up at this table here and in other places in this building and outside and baldly try and explain to the Australian population the benefits that will be achieved by the full privatisation of Telstra. We know that is far from the truth.
It does not stop there. I have had cause recently in this place to talk about the way in which Telstra sold off a portion of its business by stealth. Telstra used to provide Commander phones. Telstra sold off that business to a joint venture company, of which Telstra owns 30 to 35 per cent, with another company called Plessey Communications. They formed a new organisation called PlesTel. They did not tell their clients—certainly they did not tell their clients in Northern Australia—that the responsibility for providing Commander phone systems had been commercialised and deprivatised and sold off to another organisation. People who had been the clients of Telstra had the expectation that Telstra would carry out its responsibilities, fix, repair and replace their Commander phone systems. 
In a number of communities in Northern Australia this is not taking place. I have recounted here before an instance where a community organisation rang Telstra and asked them if they could come and put in—this happened only recently—a new Commander phone system. This community is about an hour's flying time out of Nhulunbuy in north-east Arnhem Land and about 1½ hours flying time by light plane out of Darwin. It is a place which is inaccessible for much of the year because of rain. The only way you can get there is by barge or by aeroplane. Telstra has technicians who work in these remote communities. Indeed, they have a helicopter which is based out of Nhulunbuy to provide services to these remote areas. Where they provide the services they are provided well by the technicians fixing problems and putting in phones. But the point is that they do not have sufficient resources to do the job that is required, as has been demonstrated by this situation at Millingimbi.  
I go back to this Commander phone system. The organisation rings Telstra in Darwin. Telstra says, `We will get back to you the next day.' They do not get a call from Telstra; they get a call from another company, the company that is a PlesTel agent in the Northern Territory. The company provides them with a quote for the provision of a new Commander phone system. The Commander phone system will cost them $2,500 to purchase—agreed, not a problem. That is what it would cost any person in Australia to purchase this system. They are told it will cost $300 for labour to put the system in place. They are then told that it will cost them $2,500 for transport for the technician to come from the company in Darwin to Nhulunbuy and then on-fly to the community to provide the service. 
Again, if you are the member for Bennelong, you do not have to worry about that, of course, because the PlesTel agent in Bennelong will not charge you travel time and certainly will not charge you the fuel costs. But, if you live in remote Australia and you want a new Commander phone system, as a result of the experiences identified in this community you can expect to pay the full tote odds for the travel of this technician from a company contracted by PlesTel—35 per cent owned by Telstra—to provide you with a service that Telstra used to provide. Up until February of this year Telstra technicians were able to do the work. Then they were told they were no longer to do the work. 
So, if you live in remote Australia and you want a new Commander phone system, instead of ringing Telstra and getting them to supply and fit it, you have to go to some other organisation and Telstra will not absorb the labour costs or the travel time in the pricing of the work. Is that fair? Is that reasonable? Yet this is what is happening under this government's telecommunications policy and under the current policies of Telstra management. It is both unfair and unreasonable for people who live in remote Australia to be expected to pay these costs. Yet this government is parading around the country saying `Somehow or another you will get nirvana out of the fact that we will privatise Telstra; you will get these huge benefits out of the way in which we are going to deal with the universal service obligation.' The fact is that they are not currently carrying out their obligations as they ought to be doing. 
Who was responsible for this? The government. I say to the government, and I say particularly to National Party members, such as the ministers across the table, that if they believe in their wildest dreams that people in the Northern Territory who live in remote communities or people who live in the remote north-west of Western Australia or northern Queensland or northern South Australia or far western New South Wales are fooled for one minute by the rhetoric about the sale of Telstra and what is in this bill then they are sadly mistaken and they will wear the cost when people come to cast their ballot at the next federal election.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—There is another side to the argument that the member for the Northern Territory has been putting today. The member seems to think that there should be a fibre-optic cable up to every gum tree and every signpost in remote and regional Australia. 
—You are a dope. 
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory will withdraw that remark. 
—I beg your pardon. I withdraw. You are not a dope.  
—The honourable member for the Northern Territory will be very careful in future in the way he behaves. 
—Just as it is unreasonable to expect that there should be a service station or a supermarket at the doorstep of every outback property, perhaps it is unreasonable to expect that there should be a fibre-optic cable at the doorstep of every outback property, but I guess that is for another time. 
I would like to concentrate on the good things that Telstra does. Certainly in their science and technology labs, which I have had the privilege of being able to see, they are doing leading science in the world—and this is Telstra. Their call centres—and I particularly acquaint the House with their call centres in River Keys in Townsville—are being internationally accredited as world's best practice in customer service. I can tell you that the `force from the north', as they call themselves in River Keys Call Centre, certainly have had their hands untied. They are doing extraordinarily well in providing first-class customer service, and good on them.
The coalition believes that the most effective way to encourage price reductions, improvements in service and innovative products is to unleash the forces of competition in the telecommunications sector. I well remember that before March 1996 telecommunications in Australia were dominated by the existence of a government owned, overstaffed, non-customer-focused telecommunications giant with enormous market power—that is Telstra. Look at what has happened since the opening up of the telecommunications market to competition: a number of carriers have been established, prices have been driven down and there have been improvements in service. When you talk to the majority of consumers out there, they are very happy indeed—and prices are continuing to fall because the market has been opened up to true competition.
As history has unfolded, the government have given the Australian community the opportunity to invest in this telecommunications giant. However, regional Australia will be best served as a result of the initiatives in this bill before the parliament. The Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 is an initiative to implement untimed local calls within Australia, particularly regional Australia. I can assure you that the people in North Queensland where I come from will very much welcome this particular move. In Townsville and Thuringowa, which I represent, this is not an issue. But it is certainly an issue not too many kilometres from the boundary of my electorate, and of course it is an issue for the entire top end of Queensland.
The recent sale of the 16.6 per cent of Telstra in T2 has provided the government with the opportunity to use up to $150 million over three years to provide untimed local calls in extended zones in remote Australia. That will mean that telephone calls within an extended zone will be untimed local calls, which is something that just a short time ago could not have been believed. Also, $36 million has been available to provide untimed local call access through the Internet for all Australians. More than 99 per cent of Australian telephone users already have access to untimed local calls guaranteed by legislation. However, untimed local calls are unavailable or have been severely restricted for subscribers living in Telstra's so-called extended zones in remote Australia. There are 111 extended zones covering approximately 80 per cent of the Australian landmass and containing about 39,000 subscribers in total. Despite what the member for the Northern Territory has told this parliament, things are moving on for the better because Telstra, or whoever, is going to be able to provide a better service to those people living in the remotest parts of Australia.
The restriction on untimed local calls reflects the limited capacity of Telstra's remote infrastructure, particularly the digital radio concentrator systems—the DRCSs—which have been installed for perhaps 10 years. They are currently used by around 12,000 subscribers. There is a limited capacity on this system because it is a radio system. It forces subscriber usage to be constrained to prevent severe congestion, and pricing is used as a rationing mechanism. To extend the benefits of untimed local calls to all Australians, the government have allocated $150 million from the second tranche sale of Telstra. This will upgrade remote telecommunications infrastructure to support the provision of untimed local calls within the extended zone. At the same time, calls from an extended zone to its community service town will be charged at a new `preferential rate' of 25c per 12 minutes. Subscribers in extended zones will be guaranteed untimed call access to the Internet, but that will not include ISP charges. What a terrific move forward for people in remote areas of Australia to have discounted access to their local community service town and to have untimed local calls. 
The decision to allocate the $150 million untimed local call access account by means of a competitive tender will optimise the benefits to remote Australia. It is going to be fascinating because it will provide a means of testing the claims of different carriers regarding their capability to serve these areas and their costs in doing so. Tenderers will be encouraged to optimise their tenders by nominating the terms on which they are willing to supply untimed local calls, preferential rate calls and untimed call access to the Internet. They will also be asked to nominate additional services and features that they are willing to offer. That is just a sentence, but there is an awful lot in that sentence because they are going to be asked to nominate additional services and features that they are willing to offer—perhaps things that not in the wildest dreams of people in remote Australia would they have ever thought they might now be able to have access to. It will be a fascinating process to see what the carriers actually tender to the government. This, I guess you could say, is competition at its best.
In competing for the $150 million, it is proposed that tenderers be required to indicate the following: the ability to fulfil the government's basic service requirements in relation to untimed local calls, preferential rate calls and Internet access; a timetable for rollout, with tenderers being encouraged to show that they can provide early delivery of improved services to remote Australia—certainly early delivery is a point that the member for the Northern Territory commented on, and the government will be looking at that very closely—the ability to at least maintain other existing services and levels of service and their willingness to offer higher data rates—something that is very important these days—enhanced call handling facilities, revised call charging arrangements and any other additional services and features that a particular carrier may consider it appropriate to offer; the ability to meet specified pricing requirements, safeguards and guarantees against non-performance and so on; benefits for regional economic development and employment; and a long-term commitment to servicing remote Australia, including as a universal service provider. The servicing aspect is also critical. We have heard many stories. We heard some in the chamber this morning, though I think they are probably not particularly typical, and I hear them too, that it can take time. The government will be looking at this in the tender process. The request for tender containing full details of the scheme is currently being prepared.
There has been much criticism directed at the coalition's efforts to privatise Telstra. That criticism is coming from the other side of this House and it has been strident. I understand that many of my colleagues on the other side, whom I talk to privately, perhaps share a different view from what they say publicly. It is very interesting that some of those who think logically and clearly, and who understand the arguments for and against in relation to the proposed full sale of Telstra, understand the benefits that the government has been enunciating. Of course, in the proposal for the full sale of Telstra the government has not done what the Labor Party did when it sold other Commonwealth enterprises. I think many of us were disappointed when Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank were sold and we saw the proceeds of those sales applied to recurrent expenditure rather than being invested for the long-term benefit of the Australian community. Certainly the government's intention in relation to the full sale of Telstra, if it proceeds, is to invest those proceeds and to make sure that all Australians have the benefit of the sale. 
I hear a lot of nonsense being talked about what might happen. I hear the emotional arguments about selling the family silver, but they do not stack up in the cold, hard light of day. They do not stack up on how Australians might benefit by the government divesting itself of a telecommunications carrier. My personal view—and I stress that it is a personal view—is that if Telstra is not sold quickly, its value will actually fall, because the other competition will come on, the other competition will do well and Telstra will lose its current market advantage. If the government were ever going to dispose of a telecommunications carrier, the optimum time is now. If the many shareholders—in fact, millions of Australians who are shareholders—in Telstra see the value of their shares fall because, for cynically political reasons, the opposition opposes the sale, that would be sad for them.
Another point I would like to make is that Labor allowed Telstra and Optus to string cables across the suburbs of Australia without requiring planning permission. It presided over a cosy Telstra-Optus duopoly, which failed to deliver substantial price reductions and which left most of the cost savings from technological improvements in the pockets of the carriers, not the Australian consumers. Labor forced the abolition of the AMPS mobile phone system and took no steps whatsoever to secure a replacement for this vital communications service in the bush. Hundreds of thousands of rural and regional mobile phone users would have lost their mobile phone service in the year 2000 except for the very effective action taken by the coalition government.
Labor failed to ensure that carriers provided a timely and efficient service to their customers and ignored the special needs of phone users in regional and rural areas of Australia. Of course, Labor bitterly opposed the coalition's plans to spend $250 million on improving telecommunications in regional Australia, and it promised in the 1998 election to take this money away from regional Australia if elected. I wonder how the member for the Northern Territory would respond to that. Labor has no policies in place in relation to telecommunications in rural and regional Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I put to you and to the parliament that this amendment bill will greatly benefit the communications system in remote Australia. It is an initiative to genuinely commit the government to servicing the people in rural and remote Australia.

"Vaile, Mark, MP",NP,2000-06-22,"—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sure that you, along with many other Australians, are very appreciative of the outcome for your workers at Thomastown. In summing up the debate on the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, I thank all members for their contribution to the debate. It has been a constructive debate. The bill makes amendments to the universal service obligation regime to support important reforms in the delivery of the USO. The detail of these amendments has been spelt out in the second reading speech.
One of the most significant aspects of this legislation is the amendments aimed at supporting the $150 million tender for the provision of untimed local calls in extended zones. Approximately 40,000 Australians currently do not have access to untimed local calls, something taken for granted by the majority of Australians. The coalition committed to address this inequity at the last election. This legislation supports this commitment. During its time in government the ALP did nothing to address this inequity. The $150 million tender is funded by the sale of the second tranche of Telstra. It forms part of the Telstra social bonus, which is nearly $1 billion, aimed at expanding employment, business, research and development, educational and social opportunities for all Australians. Along with the proceeds of the first sale of Telstra, more than $1 billion has been made available for important environmental works.
The social bonus will expand access to regional, rural and remote Australia to improved telecommunications infrastructure. The amount of $150 million for untimed local calls is just one element of the social bonus. Other elements include $158 million for building IT strengths; $70 million for the Building Additional Rural Networks program; $45 million for the local government fund; $3 million to expand mobile phone coverage in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania; $3 million to fund Net Alert; $10 million for the Trials in Innovative Government Electronic Regional Services project; $15 million for connecting Tasmanian schools; and, $120 million to establish the Television Fund. There will also be $70 million for rural transaction centres, $36 million to provide local call Internet access to all Australians and $25 million for continuous mobile phone coverage along 11 major highways. There will also be $20 million for telecommunications improvements on remote and isolated islands and $15 million for the Launceston broadband project. These programs build on the highly successful Networking the Nation program, a $250 million program funded from the sale of the first tranche of Telstra. 
It should be noted that the ALP voted against the social bonus at the last election. They also threatened to do away with Networking the Nation. Labor opposed our programs at the time. We have brought them before the parliament, but when they see these programs in action delivering real benefits, what do they do?
—We are going to do away with the National Party at the next election.
—No, you will not be, not with programs like this that are seeing services rolled out in rural and regional Australia that the ALP could never dream of delivering and have never offered to the Australian public living outside the metropolitan areas. This bill, as I said at the outset, makes amendments to the universal service obligation regime to support important reforms. The provision of untimed local calls in extended zones in rural and regional Australia is one of those very important changes that we have fought for and is the subject of this legislation. We are not prepared to accept the opposition's proposed amendment, which adds nothing to the value of this bill. I commend the bill to the House.
Question put:
That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Stephen Smith's amendment) stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1,speech
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:
(1) this fresh demonstration of the Government's administrative style of drift followed by mad panic; and
(2)F its failure to tackle tobacco excise compliance, and now contemptuously giving the House of Representatives and the public a mere 24 hours to consider this Bill before debating it”.
For the opposition and the general public to be put in this situation is a travesty of parliamentary process. This represents a grossly inadequate time for consultation and is yet another example of the government treating this parliament and this community with utter contempt. Unfortunately, it is far from an isolated example. Yesterday we saw question time being cut short—just half the expected number of questions—in another example of lowering of parliamentary standards. Like a lot of other members I was disappointed with what occurred yesterday. I am disappointed that the government cut short question time and I am disappointed that they see fit to bring on a bill for debate today which was only released to the parliament and to the community yesterday. It is simply not possible for the opposition to come to a considered position. We will not have opportunities for meetings of the relevant caucus committee; we will not have opportunities for the shadow ministry to meet and determine a position; we will not have opportunities for the caucus to meet and determine a position on this bill, so we are simply put in the position of flying blind. The government might not care about the opposition's circumstances concerning this, but it is also a contempt on their own members. They introduce a bill but there is no opportunity for their own backbench committees and members of parliament to consider the implications of such a piece of legislation. There is no opportunity in the broader community for those who are affected by this piece of legislation to think about and consider its consequences. 
The Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000 enacts a number of measures designed to address tobacco excise avoidance and evasion. That principle is something which I strongly support and I am sure most of us would strongly support. Indeed, I will come to the fact that I have raised this issue in the parliament previously as a matter of concern. It is one thing to say that we all want to address tobacco excise avoidance and another thing altogether to say that we can or will approve of anything that the government dishes up. I have no doubt that there are people, particularly tobacco growers, who will be interested in this legislation and may well be affected in some fashion by it and that they would like the opportunity to consider this legislation and be consulted on it. 
I am aware, for example, that there are tobacco growers in the electorate of Indi, some of them particularly being in the Victorian state electorate of Benalla. Given Labor's recent excellent outcome in the state electorate of Benalla, the electorate of Indi is an electorate we might have our eyes on in the future. The present member, Mr Lieberman, has announced his intention to retire. The member is a gentleman and a scholar, but I think his departure from the parliament might give Labor added interest in the electorate of Indi. I think he would like the opportunity to go and consult with his tobacco growers about the impact of these measures on them. We would certainly like the opportunity to consult with people in the Myrtleford area and other areas about the impact of this legislation on them. Similarly, in the electorate of Leichhardt, up behind Cairns, there are issues in this legislation which will be of concern to people. There are suggestions, in the 24 hours that I have had to have a look at this legislation, that people can go to jail for possessing tobacco seeds. I suspect that there will be things that people will want to comment on in terms of the detail of this legislation. Instead, we have the government treating the electorates of Indi and Leichhardt and the people in those electorates with absolute contempt—introducing this bill yesterday, bringing it on for debate and rushing it through the House of Representatives today.
You have to compare this with proper parliamentary practice elsewhere. In the Victorian parliament, to which I used to belong, while there was a period during the Kennett government when it was open slather and bills were simply rushed through without opportunity for debate or scrutiny, the general practice in that parliament, which it has since resumed, is that no bills are brought on for debate for a period less than two weeks. So, once you have introduced a bill, there are opportunities for people out in the community to comment; there are opportunities for political parties, even Independent members of parliament, to form a judgment about the content of the legislation and to come into that parliament to make their contribution concerning it. That is the situation which applies in Victoria. It is the situation which applies in the Senate and, no doubt, in many other chambers. To bring on a bill 24 hours after it has been introduced simply is not good enough.
It is part of this government's characteristic of introducing legislation on the run. The government knows perfectly well that this is not an appropriate way to do business. Only yesterday I moved some amendments to legislation concerning financial sector reform which the government accepted and the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation said, in accepting the amendments, that the reason he was able to accept those amendments was that we had given him notice. He said:
... one of the reasons why we have not traditionally accepted the Labor Party's amendments is that we find out about them when we get in here. On this occasion ... the Labor Party actually sent us the amendments before we came into the House. That gave us an opportunity to consider the impact of the amendments, to put them through the appropriate processes within the government, to consider them in detail and then, where possible, to accept them.
So, through those comments, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation understands only too well the significance of providing notice, yet his government is prepared to come in here and introduce a bill yesterday and expect us to debate it today. This is part of a government which is in legislative panic mode. We have wave after wave of taxation legislation coming through the parliament. I find it astonishing that those opposite, who profess to believe in small government and talk about deregulation, are giving us legislation by the kilogram, measured in kilograms rather than in pages or numbers of amendments. 
Indeed, there is so much legislation going through the parliament that the parliament cannot be given adequate time to consider it. Apparently, according to the government, there just is not time. It reminds me of the White Rabbit in Alice in Wonderland—`Goodness me, goodness me! Look at the time, look at the time!' We have legislation coming through this place by the truckload. It is legislation which has to be amended on the run because the government has not considered it adequately before it has introduced it into the parliament. So, during this week in bills that I have had carriage of, we have been hit with, in one case, 77 amendments on the run to legislation which dealt with potential capital gains tax liabilities for self-managed superannuation funds and, in another piece of legislation changing the government's new tax system—GST based legislation—34 amendments. Last night they introduced amendments of their own to the financial sector reform legislation. If the government introduces its legislation in haste, it will find that the legislation will have drafting defects and it will simply have to come back to the chamber to amend that legislation. In this case, we are not even being given or afforded the opportunity to determine those legislative defects, because this bill will be rushed through the parliament without proper opportunity for scrutiny. I cannot register too strongly my concern at the way this government is doing business and is treating this parliament with contempt.
The legislation endeavours to crack down on the issue of tobacco excise avoidance. This is an issue which people have been drawing to the attention of the government for some time. I would like to ask the government how long they have known about this problem, what representations they have received and what action they have taken concerning it. For example, Philip Morris wrote to me at the end of May, providing a copy of a report which they had provided to the government. It was titled `Chop Chop: A report on the manufacture and sale of illegal tobacco in Australia'. They made these representations because they described government tobacco policy as being in crisis, with existing government policy driving the creation of a booming black market in tobacco that operates outside of revenue raising and health policy initiatives. They estimated the value of the illegal tobacco market, the chop chop market, as being in excess of $380 million per annum, and they said that it was costing governments more than $300 million per annum in lost revenue, of which some $280 million was lost excise. Philip Morris said:
Illegal tobacco is available in many tobacconists and independently owned retail outlets. ... Those involved in the illegal tobacco trade do not consider themselves subject to the same regulatory controls as legitimate operators. As a result, the unchecked growth of the illegal tobacco market and the unchecked distribution channels it creates threaten Federal, State and Territory policies and initiatives enshrined in the National Tobacco Strategy, such as juvenile smoking prevention campaigns, government mandated controls on “tar”, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels, and the application of health warnings and other mandatory packaging requirements.
They describe this issue as one of `significant concern to the Australian tobacco manufacturers'. The report said that despite the large sums involved—the estimated $280 million in excise evasion:
... no new or dedicated resources have been applied to address this growing problem and, if left unchecked, Chop Chop has the potential to dramatically escalate and become an entrenched problem for government revenue, retailers and the tobacco industry.
They also suggested that as the illegal tobacco market becomes increasingly organised, it would include the involvement of crime syndicates and other criminal organisations. Their submission centred primarily on the illegal tobacco, or chop chop, trade, but they said:
... the focus on the crime impacting on the tobacco industry should in no way be lessened. Today, manufacturers, retailers and suppliers of legitimate tobacco products are facing substantial costs associated with security and protection for their product and their staff. 
They traced this problem back to late 1997. They said:
The sudden growth of the illegal tobacco market can be traced back to the abolition of State Licence Fees (SLF) ... Under the SLF, illegal traders took advantage of the loop-holes in the laws for the exporting and subsequent re-importing of tobacco products to exploit the different tax levels. A successful High Court challenge to the SLF in August 1997 effectively ended this trade.
The report goes on to say that at the same time: 
... the Australian tobacco manufacturers were reducing their demand for domestic leaf, resulting in an over-supply of tobacco leaf, translating to readily available tobacco leaf to non-legitimate buyers. 
The wholesale price for Chop Chop ranges from between $45 to $80 per kilogram, with certain retailers selling the product in resealable plastic bags containing 50 grams for approximately $8. This compares to the retail price for legitimate roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco of $16. Continuous product improvements of Chop Chop have led to a much improved final product, increased variety and a marked increase in average retail prices making the business more lucrative to new and existing players ... 
...		...		...
... the steady demand for illegal leaf has allowed Chop Chop dealers to purchase quality leaf at a premium price above the market rate paid by the legitimate tobacco manufacturers.
The report went on to say:
Market intelligence suggests that Chop Chop is now available in a majority of tobacconists and independently owned retail outlets. The manufacturing and distribution operations have become quite sophisticated through the acquisition of state of the art cutting and processing equipment. In addition, cigarette-manufacturing equipment is being imported to make tailor-made cigarettes to complement the burgeoning trade in loose leaf tobacco.
Their industry calculations were that chop chop accounted for a volume of anywhere between 1,000 to 1,200 tonnes per annum. To give that some perspective, the legitimate roll-your-own tobacco market was 1,400 tonnes per annum. So the illegal market was nearly 70 to 80 per cent of the legitimate roll-your-own market. Those retailers who do not stock chop chop have suggested that the product is impacting on their turnover of branded tobacco products by as much as 25 per cent. That tends to encourage legitimate retailers to participate in the distribution of chop chop to try to protect their livelihood. Clearly, from the point of view of the Commonwealth, the key issue here is that about $280 million in tobacco excise is being avoided annually through the illicit sale of tobacco. This report went on to say:
The manufacturers, with the support of tobacco grower organisations, have made repeated representations to Government at all levels, including meetings with Federal and State Ministers, Ministerial Advisers and representatives from the Australian Taxation Office and Australian Customs Service.
They made all those representations to government, and they said in their report:
Regrettably, at this stage there has been a general reluctance to adopt any serious measures to address illegal tobacco despite the large level of forgone excise. 
They noted that the Customs Service had been involved in a couple of raids on illegal tobacco operations, but they said that those raids `have not made any significant in-roads into curbing the illegal tobacco trade'. They made a number of recommendations for government action, and concluded that:
Despite these recommendations and some recent raids and seizures, the resources being applied to this serious problem do not in any way reflect the level of forgone revenue to the Government, retailers and the tobacco industry.
That to me was all too familiar, because I had been advised earlier in the year that the Australian Taxation Office had dropped the ball concerning fuel excise avoidance, petrol excise avoidance and the rackets concerning fuel substitution. When I drew those concerns to public attention, the first reaction of the Taxation Office and the Assistant Treasurer was that everything was under control. But, when the New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs, Liberty Oil and other organisations produced incontrovertible evidence that fuel substitution was a major scandal, the government was forced to act, and we have debated previously a couple of bills that the government has introduced to try to address the problem of fuel substitution. 
In reading that report, I have become concerned that we have been witnessing another fuel excise avoidance scandal, that is to say, a government which has not been cracking down on tobacco excise avoidance and not making sure that that revenue is obtained. Indeed, people in a position to know some of those things have described to me a tobacco excise scam which goes along the following lines. A person who purchases Australian produced cigarettes for export is not required to pay the tobacco excise providing certain conditions are met. They have to complete export documentation, so they represent to the Taxation Office and to the Customs office that these cigarettes are for export. They complete the export documentation, which is called an ECN, an export control number. That is done on computer. That lists the details of the item being exported, its destination and the vessel that it is being exported on. They can, however, get a release of the cigarettes into their controlled storage, whereupon it has to be exported on the vessel listed within 30 days. If they miss the vessel, they are obliged to supply an amended entry with the new vessel details. The cigarettes are supposed to be stored at premises declared to the Australian Customs Service. This does not have to be a bond warehouse, as they are released on the condition that they will be exported. Verification is the responsibility of the Customs Service where it is a duty matter, but for Australian manufactured cigarettes it is a tax office matter, as excise may be applicable. 
What has been suggested to me is that there has been very little checking of the cigarettes. The tax office has had insufficient staff and resources to do this. I have described to the House on many occasions my concern that the tax office has been so focused on the GST that many other areas of its responsibility have been left to go to rack and ruin. It has been alleged that this issue of checking of cigarettes is another of them. The usual scam is to substitute the cigarettes with some other material, usually some grocery item for the export destination. The cigarettes are then sold into home consumption while the container goes onto the ship. You have to ask yourself, thinking about this, why the cigarettes are allowed to be released at all. They should go to a certain area and be packed into a container under supervision. That container should be sealed and the seal verified on loading into the vessel. Even more seriously than that, the tax office took over excise responsibilities from Customs two years ago. It seems to me that, particularly in relation to fuel but probably also here, they have not been up to the task given them. You have to wonder whether they are the right people to be handling this task, given that they are simply too overloaded and too focused on the GST to do this issue justice. 
I express the concern that what we have been witnessing with tobacco excise avoidance is exactly the same thing we saw in relation to the fuel substitution scandal. The government comes in here with legislation and no doubt it will say, `But we are acting to address these problems, we are acting to crack down on tobacco excise avoidance. Here is our legislation.' But this simply takes us back to 1997 and 1998, when the government announced, with considerable fanfare, that it was going to act to crack down on fuel substitution. I remind the House, seeing that my colleague the member for Cunningham is here, that when the government announced a crackdown on fuel substitution the member for Cunningham, a very generous person, said in debate, `Minister, I was just singing your praises for the budget initiative last night with respect to the crackdown on dangerous fuel substitution. Now that you are here, let me congratulate you face to face.' What then happened was that, having said they were going to crack down on fuel substitution, responsibility was passed across from Customs to the tax office, and the tax office dropped the ball. Customs had found with their own checking that about one in every 10 samples of fuel was the subject of fuel substitution, that it disclosed the marker that indicated fuel substitution was going on. 
You would think that if you were catching people out on one in every 10 occasions you would ramp up that activity. Instead of ramping it up, the tax office abandoned it. They said, `This isn't really working.' In fact, they stopped the testing involving a fleet of trucks, sold off a couple of the trucks and put the rest into mothballs, even though the testing had been very successful. As I said before, they carried out 551 tests and in 52 cases they found that the marker was present in the fuel. When I complained about their inaction concerning this matter, Tax Commissioner Carmody described the idea of testing for fuel substitution as Boys' Own Annual stuff and ridiculed this idea. The point here is that the government is giving itself the power to test to ascertain whether the chop chop racket is going on, but it depends on the tax office actually going out and doing it. So, if Tax Commissioner Carmody regards this as Boys' Own Annual stuff, we have to be concerned about whether we will not have another fuel substitution racket on our hands. We will certainly be scrutinising the government to see that it does carry out the activities that it says it will carry out in moving this legislation. 
This is quite complex legislation and significant changes are being made. I will indicate a few of them briefly. Under the current law there is registration of producers of tobacco leaf without qualification, but under the new law we will have licensing of producers of tobacco seed, plant and leaf only if qualifying criteria are satisfied. Under the current law we have registration of dealers in tobacco leaf without qualification; under the new law we have that licensing only if qualifying criteria are satisfied. Under the current law the licensing of manufacturers is subject to any limitation being specified; under the new law there will be licensing of manufacturers of excisable goods only if qualifying criteria are satisfied and subject to any limitation specified. Indeed, under the current law we have revocation of licence only in limited circumstances; under the new law we have an ability to suspend or cancel licences if certain conditions are not satisfied. These changes are clearly substantial. We think it is scandalous that this legislation is going through without the opportunity for those who are affected by these issues to comment on them.
I mentioned earlier that the government had received representations from Philip Morris and others expressing concern about this issue. In a speech to the parliament about a month ago, I pointed out the concerns of Philip Morris and others regarding the chop chop issue and we now find the government moving to introduce legislation. To the extent that my raising it in the parliament has contributed to the government taking action, that is welcome, but we and everybody else are entitled to proper scrutiny of the detail of this legislation.
I also indicate to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration that I think the government should provide to the House indications of how much revenue the illegal tobacco market, the chop chop market, has been costing the government each year. We also need information about when the government's attention was first drawn to this issue and what action the government took on being advised of this problem. In relation to each of those questions, we think there ought to be a response from the government. We think this matter should be the subject of more detailed consideration and clearly in the Senate that is what we will be moving to. We will not be opposing the legislation now before the House. We think that action to attack tobacco excise avoidance is appropriate and we have called for it, but we think that we need to be able to consider this legislation in more detail than we are able to as a result of the government introducing it yesterday and bringing it on for debate today. That is a contempt of the parliament and we have condemned it with the second reading amendment that we moved.
—You don't believe that.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I regard it as a matter of profound regret that the government displays so little respect for parliament as an institution and so little respect for the electorate at large that it thinks it is all right to bring in legislation yesterday and demand that we debate it today. It shows contempt for the opposition; it shows contempt for the government's own party room, which has had no opportunity to consider it; and it shows contempt for the broader community, including those in the electorates of Indi and Leichhardt, and tobacco growing areas where there will be quite a lot of interest in the detail of this legislation and just how it will impact on their operations which by and large are legitimate. I urge the House to support my second reading amendment. I hope that the parliamentary secretary may be able to provide us with some information on the revenue involved when this matter was first brought to the government's attention and what its response was. (Time expired)
 (Mr Mossfield)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second the amendment.",REPS,<title>EXCISE AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE IMPROVEMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—The Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000 is essentially about excise evasion, but I cannot let this opportunity pass without reminding the House that tobacco consumption in Australia today reflects a personal, social and economic tragedy, affecting us all as individuals, families and taxpayers. The debate about smoking brings the right to personal freedom into collision with the cost of public health. Wherever you stand in this debate, there is no denying that the use and abuse of licit let alone illicit substances comes at a very high personal and public cost. There are some successes in the attempts by government to prevent the tragic consequences of tobacco use from occurring. The Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer has estimated that the first six months of the national tobacco campaign resulted in a $24 million saving for the health budget; in other words, Australians avoided $24 million worth of illness and disease by modifying their behaviour in accordance with that campaign. 
Only last week, the Minister for Health and Aged Care unveiled a new advertising campaign intended to make smokers aware of the health hazards of tobacco smoke to eyes, a topic not previously well known to smokers, or perhaps not understood. As an illustration of the damage done by tobacco in this regard alone, an estimated 20,000 Australians have macular degeneration attributed to smoking and 8,000 of them are likely to be blinded in both eyes, most likely, according to the evidence, because of their smoking habits. This is a pretty devastating statistic. Yet, despite the best intentions on the part of our minister and our health authorities, a significant proportion of the Australian population, especially young women, continue to jeopardise their health by smoking.
The costs of smoking are well known and, because they have a direct impact on the state through additional cost to public health budgets, it has long been a principle of government that tobacco ought to be subject to taxation by excise in the same manner as alcohol or petrol. Excise applied to tobacco increases the cost of its use, thereby driving down demand, particularly amongst the young, simultaneously compensating the community for the external cost associated with tobacco consumption—that is the theory.
In recent years the Commonwealth has made many improvements to its excise regime for tobacco. Perhaps the most significant development in this regard has been the shift to a per stick duty from 1 November last year. Previously, excise and duties calculated according to weight and value had led to the production of large quantities of large pack, light cigarette products. This development in marketing and sales had drawn more and more young people into tobacco consumption, and there were detrimental effects on health across the spectrum of users. The introduction of per stick duty rates for products containing 0.8 grams of tobacco or less—cigarettes or very small cigars and bidis, I think they are called—has since stymied what I see as a very unfortunate development.
Nonetheless, the heavy excise applied to tobacco products in recognition of their real cost has given impetus to the growth in the illicit trading of tobacco products—that is, the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products without the appropriate rate of excise. Contributing to the expansion of this illegal activity has been the decline in demand by licensed manufacturers for domestically grown tobacco leaf and the increased excise duty applied by the Commonwealth as a replacement for state licensing and related fees struck down by the High Court in August 1997. That was when the states' business franchise fees on tobacco products were held to be unconstitutional. 
I was fascinated to hear the member for Wills quote so extensively from a report commissioned by a massive tobacco manufacturer in this country in support of his criticism that this government is not doing enough to protect the tobacco manufacturers from the impact of the illicit tobacco business. I am sure he has received quite a number of lobbying documents from tobacco companies, and it is interesting that he relies so heavily on this one.
—It is the big end of town.
—They have quite a record in that regard. Why don't we put that report and the stirring but oh so hypocritical defence of the tobacco manufacturers by the member for Wills in a proper perspective? While the Excise Act does currently provide for sanctions against activities that foster this illicit trade or that exploit permissions which have the effect of either deferring duty or increasing the risk of duty evasions, those sanctions are seen to be inadequate to deal with the problem at hand. For this reason, the bill before the House makes a number of amendments to the Excise Act so as to strengthen the hand of the Commonwealth in ensuring the integrity of Commonwealth revenue and, on the other hand, safeguarding public health.
Whereas existing controls are limited to the regulation of tobacco leaf after it has been stripped from the plant, the new measures regulate the growing of tobacco as an activity in its entirety. As an example, only a licensed producer will now be permitted to produce tobacco seed, plants and leaf. As part of this reform, a comprehensive licensing scheme will be introduced that allows for the granting, suspension and cancellation of licences in certain circumstances. The new system will also require that the movement of tobacco leaf, which is currently unregulated, be authorised only by permit, with identification labels attached to tobacco bails prior to transfer from a producer's premises unless express permission is otherwise granted. Penalties will be introduced for unauthorised transfers and for the counterfeiting of labels. Commonwealth officers will, under the amended law, be able to stop and search for excisable goods or tobacco leaf at any place where there is reasonable suspicion of an offence being committed.
The law as it presently stands applies penalties to those found guilty of evading excise that absolutely pale in comparison to the potential gains from the trade. In response, this bill creates a two-tier structure with some offence provisions that allow for increased maximum penalties, including two-year maximum prison terms where the requisite mental element is established. A fixed infringement notice for 20 penalty units will also be introduced for selling or possessing tobacco on which appropriate duty has not been paid. The maximum penalty for the movement of excisable goods without authority or permission will be raised from the present $500 to 500 penalty points.
Smoking represents an extraordinary cost, not simply to the coffers of the Treasury but to every family without a father or a mother and every person without a lung or a limb. It is incumbent upon governments to discourage its use and to ensure that the full and total costs of tobacco use are recognised and accounted for by producers and users. It is incumbent upon governments in discouraging the use of tobacco to ensure that others involved in the education and promotion of a healthy lifestyle for Australians are encouraged. Only this morning the Treasurer announced that the government will legislate that organisations whose main activity is promoting the prevention or control of disease or illness in people can continue to access important tax benefits. These are organisations that are integral to promoting good health and that make a significant contribution to educating Australians on matters such as diet, disease and lifestyle. We as a government will ensure that these organisations retain their FBT exemption, continue to be able to accept tax deductible donations and retain their status as charitable institutions. 
With such legislation in hand and with this package of measures before the House today to strengthen the statutory framework within which the ATO can combat the erosion of the excise revenue base from illicit tobacco, we have in place a responsible and balanced approach to tobacco use in this country. We have a long way to go in terms of the abuse and the use of tobacco, but these measures will help achieve that end. I commend this bill to the House. ",REPS,<title>EXCISE AMENDMENT (COMPLIANCE IMPROVEMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—I would like to thank the honourable members for Wills and Curtin for their contributions to this debate. The measures contained in this bill will strengthen the ability of the Australian Taxation Office to combat the evasion of excise on tobacco and protect the revenue base against the illegal product chop chop.
The honourable member for Wills moved a second reading amendment which claimed that the government should be condemned for what was referred to as a `demonstration of the government's administrative style of drift followed by mad panic' and also our `failure to tackle tobacco excise compliance'. The government does not accept the veracity of that second reading amendment. Quite frankly, the honourable member for Wills has been here long enough to know that he cannot have it both ways. The government is tackling excise compliance. The Australian Taxation Office has had a number of successful prosecutions already, and now the government is bringing in this Excise Amendment (Compliance Improvement) Bill 2000. The member for Wills claims the bill is being brought in too quickly. Well, that is because the government is tackling excise compliance quickly. This is an illegal activity and the government is not going to apologise for not delaying measures which will help combat it.
It ought to be appreciated that the Australian Taxation Office has an established compliance program which includes registration of growers and dealers, audits of growers and manufacturers, and working with the industry to develop new approaches such as those in this bill. The Australian Taxation Office also coordinates its approaches with Customs to prevent importation of tobacco leaf except by registered dealers. Obviously, the Australian Taxation Office has ongoing investigations and prosecutions and this bill strengthens the capacity to control the illegal trade.
The member for Wills suggested that the government had not followed its policy processes and that our backbench had not been considered, and I think he even claimed that we had treated the government backbench with contempt. Well, this bill has passed through all stages of the government policy processes including consideration by the backbench committee and by the party room. We have certainly been consulting in that area.
This is an important matter. The member for Wills ought to congratulate the government rather than condemn us for bringing a law that is important as far as making sure that this illegal activity does not continue. The member for Wills claimed that the government was warned in 1997. Well, this problem has been increasing since the High Court decision in 1997 which struck out the state business franchise fees. As a result of that decision the Commonwealth undertook to collect those fees as an excise. The Australian Taxation Office and Customs have been acting against evasions and there have been a number of successful prosecutions. The measures in this bill will improve the ability of the Australian Taxation Office to combat these illegal activities.
The government is sending very clear messages to criminals that every action is being taken to protect excise revenue. It is pretty clear that the illicit tobacco trade is threatening to undermine the revenue base for tobacco excise. We certainly would not deny that the amount of revenue at risk is significant. Various figures have been suggested. We appreciate that it is a substantial amount of money and that is why the government has moved so quickly to bring this bill in to make sure that in future the law of Australia is observed. The member for Wills claimed that there was inadequate time for consultation. He claimed that the opposition has not had time to come to a considered position. He even suggested that the government was flying blind. It is interesting that, despite the fact that the honourable member for Wills has claimed that the opposition has not had time to come to a considered position, he was able to rush into the media with a media release. Is he telling us that his media release was in fact worded from a `not considered' position? Is he saying that his own media release is a half-baked document based on a lack of understanding of the issues in hand? 
—That is what everyone else is saying.
—The member for Moreton is undoubtedly correct. This is the problem with the honourable member for Wills. He seems to rush into the media all the time without first considering what is in fact the situation.
The member for Wills also attacked the Australian Taxation Office. I think this is pretty sad because the Australian Taxation Office is a department of hard-working individuals who are focused on improving taxation compliance in the best way. The Australian Taxation Office does not deserve to be attacked by the member for Wills as he has done on this occasion. The member for Wills also claimed that there was a lack of opportunity to consult with tobacco growers. Nothing could be further from the truth. There has been widespread consultation with the tobacco industry on the improved compliance strategy. The basic elements of this bill derive from a joint government-industry illicit tobacco strategy, and all three tobacco growers cooperatives support the approach in this bill as do the cigarette manufacturers. It is pretty clear that a lot of what the honourable member for Wills has said is in no way, shape or form even remotely accurate. The member for Wills would do well to listen to the contribution by the honourable member for Curtin, which by comparison was a very erudite, well-worded and well-thought-out contribution to the parliament.
The measures contained in this bill include improving the regulation of tobacco product and increasing penalties on those involved in illicit activities. Under the measures contained in this bill, tobacco producers will be required to be licensed. The movement of tobacco leaf will be regulated. This will involve a system of labelling bales of tobacco leaf. The power of excise officers to stop and search conveyances will be extended and the maximum pecuniary penalties will be set at 500 penalty points, currently $55,000, or five times the duty payable had the tobacco leaf been manufactured into tobacco and entered into home consumption. Offenders can also face jail terms of up to two years for the more serious offences. Despite the rhetoric of the honourable member for Wills, this bill demonstrates the absolute commitment of the government to countering the illicit trade in chop chop. I commend the bill to the House.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—I move: 
That the requested amendment be not made. 
The government is not supporting the amendment put forward by the Australian Democrats to the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000 in the Senate. The amendment seeks to exempt from the Social Security Act the means test for all benefits paid to veterans and war widows under part 2 and part 4 of the Veterans Entitlements Acts as well as compensation payments paid to Commonwealth and allied veterans living in Australia by their former governments. 
The government opposes this amendment as presented by the Australian Democrats because it introduces more anomalies than it claims to address. This is a crude and simplistic approach to deal with a complex issue. This amendment does not address the technical differences between the veterans and social security systems. For instance, veterans with service pensions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and who rent would be disadvantaged because, although their disability pension is not counted in the calculation of their service pension, it is counted for calculating the amount of rent assistance. 
By exempting disability pension entirely from the Social Security Act means test, veterans at Centrelink without qualifying service who rent will get a distinct advantage over veterans with qualifying service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Furthermore, this amendment provides for Commonwealth or allied veterans who receive a disability pension from their governments and Commonwealth or allied war widows to be advantaged over those who receive an income support payment from Veterans' Affairs. As well as producing these anomalies, the amendment also confuses the treatment of benefits such as disability pension for veterans and war widows pensions. These are quite different benefits with different policy origins and purposes. 
This amendment is a poor attempt to address an anomaly which the government has always acknowledged. The amendment entails significant costs, in excess of $50 million per year, while the government has already assigned a high priority to other initiatives in the veterans portfolio such as extending the eligibility of repatriation benefits to include service in South East Asia between 1955 and 1975 and simplifying access to health care.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—Labor supports the Democrats' amendment regarding the portability of veterans pensions. We understand from the government that there may be some technical problems with the amendment as drafted by the Democrats. We foreshadow that we may be in a position to make further changes in the Senate. However, as to the principle of the Democrats' position, we are supporting the objective they are trying to achieve. Once again, with the government's intransigent position we are seeing the placing of an unfair burden on those people in our community who can least afford to bear it and who are least likely to be able to make a big noise about it. 
There are a number of amendments. Perhaps I will make all my comments now to the bill and the amendments that the House will be considering, for the sake of brevity. I want to look first at the amendments that standardise the overseas portability of social security and related payments. The government's changes will reduce the capacity of the system to support Australian residents with special needs. We will have the most unfair situation where, if a disability support pensioner were to go overseas for treatment, they would lose their pension after six months. This would mean in a lot of cases that the treatment could never be sought because the person would have no way of supporting himself or herself if the treatment took longer than six months. Once again, the meanness of this government comes to the fore. This government makes Scrooge look like a philanthropist. It is always looking for opportunities to keep hold of its revenue, no matter who is disadvantaged in the process—all in the name of a standardised and simplified system. This is always code for the government cutting costs.  
Changes to international portability will lead to savings of up to $10.7 million per year. That is what this bill is really all about. This bill flies in the face of the report of the Welfare Reform Reference Committee, which has stressed the importance of developing a more responsive, flexible welfare system that can tailor programs and payments to individual circumstances and need. Instead, the government wants to push through changes that will do the opposite. This so-called streamlining achieves two things: savings for the government and an extra burden for some of the most vulnerable in our community. Labor's amendments, which we moved in the Senate, dealt with the issue of basic portability arrangements. 
The second set of amendments we moved dealt with the issue of short residence. In my electorate of Grayndler, I have many constituents who have lived and worked hard in Australia for 30 or 40 years. Upon retirement, they have chosen to return to the country of their birth for extended periods of time. This is particularly common amongst the older Greek Australians in my electorate. Why should they be required to remain in Australia for two years at a time if they want to retain their pension? They have worked hard for decades and do not deserve this treatment. Furthermore, when you are elderly, two years is a very long time. Labor's next set of amendments seeks to preserve the proportionality provisions for many pensioners. The government maintains that most will not be affected by this change in portability from one year to 26 weeks. The fact remains, however, that some will. The pensioners whom I referred to earlier will be adversely affected by this to the extent that they may not be able to afford to go home to their countries of birth and revisit family, friends and places. Once again, Uncle Scrooge is knocking at the door. 
The second area of change to the legislation is in data matching, using tax file numbers. While we are supportive of measures that address welfare fraud, we are concerned about the possibility that the savings in this area will be used to brand all welfare recipients, particularly those on unemployment benefits, as cheats—and, given the reactionary minister in charge of employment and his ability to denigrate the unemployed rather than help them, that would not be surprising. But then again, after his performance in this House yesterday, nothing would surprise. This is an area where the government has had some experience. It is very quick to lay blame and to use negative language when describing long-term unemployed. This government is creating an environment where the genuinely needy, the honest and those who make honest mistakes are all under suspicion. So I believe we have good cause to be wary of such improved data matching. Misuse of people's personal details is something we have seen recently with the Prime Minister's `pulp fiction' letter. I wish to conclude my remarks there, but I know that the member for Cowan intends to very adequately outline what this government should be doing in relation to this matter.

"Edwards, Graham, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—The member for Grayndler has set out the opposition's position quite clearly on this matter. The opposition does have some sympathy for the government in this situation—not much, however. They could have fixed the problem last night had they agreed to defer the debate in the Senate and sorted out these technical difficulties, but for some reason or other they chose not to. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration handling the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000 said that this is a crude and simplistic approach in an endeavour to fix an anomaly. He said it is a poor attempt. That may well be the case, but it is an honest attempt to fix an anomaly about which the government have been on notice for some time. Wayne Swan raised this issue in this House last year. Senator Chris Schacht, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, who is always out there consulting and listening to veterans and responding to their needs, also put the government on notice about this issue last year.
The anomaly is simply that many veterans, in an endeavour to serve their country, joined the armed forces during the Second World War. Many of them tried everything they could to get overseas and serve on the front line. Of course, that was not possible, and a lot of those veterans were not able to get overseas. Those people who have a pension for some problems that they incurred in their time of service had that pension counted as income against social security benefits. That is opposed to those veterans who did go overseas and who have similar sorts of pensions but who do not have that pension treated as income against social security benefits. 
That anomaly has been around for a long time. It is an anomaly which the veteran community have put before the government and, unfortunately, it is something that the government has chosen to ignore. The ALP very strongly supports those veterans who are caught up in this situation, and we certainly took the opportunity to give them that support last night. As I said, the opposition has some sympathy. There are some technical difficulties, and those difficulties should be sorted out. 
But the government also talk about money—they relate everything to money. I think they are being a little niggardly, and I agree with the member for Grayndler when he says that the government are Scrooge-like. This government have just spent some $431 million advertising a new tax system which is going to have dire consequences for many veterans on fixed and low incomes. It is also a government in which one of their leading ministers the other day indicated that they were about to get a benefit of some $7 billion through what they claim are going to be benefits from the GST. If they are getting that money on the one hand and spending $431 million on the other hand trying to advertise their GST, surely they should not and could not begrudge a section of the veteran community getting some benefit. I think the cost of this particular benefit and the anomaly that we are trying to fix is in the vicinity of $21 million. The government should not have been surprised by this amendment. They have known for a long time that it was coming. The government are fully aware of the fact that many veterans have raised concerns about this anomaly going back over a period of time, and they simply should be prepared to fix this matter up themselves. The fact that they have not has led to some technical difficulties, and I believe that those technical difficulties can now be resolved.

"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—I am pleased to rise to speak on the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 for a number of reasons. It gives me an opportunity to reflect upon the fine work of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which, of course, is one of the processes that was undertaken before this particular piece of legislation came to this place. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has, rightly, reviewed the aspects of the double taxation agreements that are contained within the legislation, the double taxation agreements with Finland and Romania—two countries that we do trade with. For the record, it is important to know that, in the case of Romania, exports totalling $75 million and imports of $8.5 million are the current trade scenario. In the case of Finland, our exports totalled $600 million and our imports total $300 million. So there is a bit over a billion dollars worth of trade between the two countries and Australia that is also covered as a result of this legislation. 
Double taxation agreements are one of those things that, on first brush and perhaps on about the second or third brush as well, are rather remarkably less exciting than watching paint dry for those who are not into getting into the technical matters behind them. What is important to note is that, by negotiating various tax treaties on a bilateral basis, Australia and the nations with which we have negotiated these treaties come to agreement about sharing the taxing rights over various kinds of income. What is very important, and the fundamental principle, is that we are not taxing twice the economic activity that occurs in both our country and the nation with which we have signed these particular agreements. So the question of the way in which the taxation systems operate in each of the countries comes into the negotiating principles behind the double taxation agreements. It is important that there is an appropriate balance between the source and resident countries involved and the taxing rights exercised by that, so that each nation does actually get its fair share of tax as well as the benefits that come from the economic activities of the companies involved.
Of course, the various taxation treaties that we have embarked upon set out certain types of taxing rights applying to each of the countries and they assist international business operations to increase the certainty for those companies involved that taxation issues that affect cross-border transactions are not going to unnecessarily penalise both inbound and outbound investment. These measures are job creating measures because they assist Australian exporters, particularly the exporters of services, not just goods, and also assist in the movement of personnel from country to country as our expertise is made a more viable commodity as international boundaries become less defined when it comes to international economic activity. We have now developed a network of taxation treaties that facilitate information exchanges and promote cooperation between taxation authorities and, of course, this, naturally enough, ensures that international fiscal evasion and tax avoidance are minimised, and one would hope all but wiped out.
Given that the increasing internationalisation of business activity is a statement of fact, it is of course important to reflect upon Australia's own taxation system and the way in which it marries into and matches up to the expectations of nations we are trading with. So it is extraordinary to reflect upon the comments of the Treasurer yesterday when he made the point that the OECD, the organisation of the richest countries in the world, is meeting next week in Paris—the Treasurer, of course, will be chairing that meeting as the world's longest serving finance minister—and to note that there is going to be only one nation appearing at that meeting next week that has a wholesale sales tax in place.
—Tell them which one.
—That particular country, for the benefit of both the parliamentary secretary at the table, my friend the member for Fisher, and for the parliament, is, of course, Australia. With only a handful of days to go, the Treasurer of this nation will have to go and face his contemporaries when he chairs the OECD meeting next week and say, `We do still have a wholesale sales tax.' But, of course, with days to go, that is going to disappear. That meeting will involve economies such as Japan, America, the United Kingdom, France and Germany—nations that long ago discarded this wholesale sales tax system that, happily enough, in a little over a week's time Australia will also be dumping. It is worth knowing that it was only a couple of years ago that we first discovered how many nations were left with a wholesale sales tax system, and that trend of its dissolution has continued. A few years ago, at the height of the introduction of this new tax system for consideration by the people of Australia, they talked about Botswana, Ghana, Swaziland and the Solomon Islands being the only nations, other than Australia, with a wholesale sales tax. That list has now decreased to the point where it is only the nation state of Swaziland, contained within southern Africa, that maintains a wholesale sales tax. One suspects that even Swaziland itself will adopt the principle of destroying the wholesale sales tax regime. It is a tax on goods, it is a tax on the export potential of goods produced by a nation and it is therefore a tax on the jobs of those who work in the export producing commodity sector of Australia, as it would also be in Swaziland. 
So that leaves only one land that is promoting the wholesale sales tax system as a worthwhile system, and that is Fantasyland—Fantasyland, the happiest little kingdom of them all, inhabited by the members of the Australian Labor Party in this place. It is worth knowing that members of the Australian Labor Party in every other parliament in Australia have signed off on the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and signed off on the notion of the new goods and services tax that covers the various goods and services produced in this country and also, importantly, that brings us into line with every other nation around the world, with the exception, momentarily, of Swaziland. What is before us is an ongoing sign of not only the good management by this government of our nation's economy but also, importantly, the job prospects of all Australians.
Romania and Finland, as a result of this legislation, will join the Australian Tax Treaty Network, which includes Austria, Belgium, Canada, the People's Republic of China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kiribati, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, the Republic of China on Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States of America, Vietnam and Fiji. They are the nations with which Australia is trading on a constant basis. They are the nations which Australia's new taxation system will be able to marry into and match up to. They are the nations with which we have a consistent set of understandings about the treatment of taxation of economic activity in both the import and export sectors. The job creating sectors of Australia can have some certainty as a result of the extension of those agreements to Finland and to Romania.
It is important to emphasise again that the avoidance of double tax and the understanding of the entire fiscal responsibilities of each of those nations are made more certain as a result of this legislation. It is also important to know that the new tax system, which starts on 1 July, will be more readily and easily understood and identified by our trading partners. Our trading partners, those nations I just listed, will not have to scratch their heads and wonder why it took so long for the Australian nation—the Commonwealth of Australia—to realise that it too should have a tax system that is understood by all of these other countries; one that does not simply tax through the wholesale sales tax regime the goods we produce but, rather, shares the burden of taxation across the range of activities in our economy—the goods and the services that we produce.
I always find it amusing to reflect upon the media's pumped up hysteria about these matters. When the Prime Minister was visiting France a few months ago, after his successful journey to Turkey and to the Anzac Day service there on 25 April, somebody on Channel 9 remarked that French business officials were in crisis talks with the Prime Minister to discuss their concerns about the impact of the GST on trade with Australia. That would have been extraordinary, given that France is probably running a VAT of some description of about 20 per cent. They would understand very clearly how a 10 per cent goods and services tax operates, and they would understand the consistency that Australia will be offering to its international linkages because of the new taxation system that we are bringing in on 1 July. No longer will Australia be on the list of those nations virtually alone in the world, operating with a wholesale sales tax system. No longer will Australia's exported goods and services have to bear the burden of wholesale sales taxes that have cascaded through the production and distribution chains and added a whole pile of additional cost burdens. No longer will Australia's export industries have to face the prospect of more than $4 billion worth of wholesale sales taxes tacked onto their competitive possibilities, and no longer will Australia be so alone in the world.
This bill before us, at first brush, is perhaps a bill that deals with quite tedious technical matters, but it is yet another bit of good news because two more countries are joining our Tax Treaty Network—Romania and Finland. There is more than $1 billion worth of trade with Australia between those two countries, and that, to my mind, extends one billion good reasons for us to pass this legislation today. I commend the bill to the House. ",REPS,<title>INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—In relation to the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000 I would like to thank the participants in this debate for their contributions. I also thank the honourable member for Wills for his support for this bill and for the initiatives that the government has taken in relation to international tax agreements.
This bill amends the International Tax Agreements Act 1953 to give the force of law to the agreement between Australia and Romania for the avoidance of double tax and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. The bill will also give the force of law to a second protocol to the agreement between Australia and Finland for the avoidance of double tax and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. The Romanian agreement will assist in the development of Australia's trade and investment links with Romania, which is already a substantial export market for Australia in the central European region. The new agreement prevents double taxation by allocating taxing rights between Australia and Romania in respect of all forms of income flows between the two countries. The basis of allocating these rights is essentially the same as that adopted in Australia's other modern taxation agreements.
The Finnish protocol will exempt from dividend withholding tax dividends that are paid out of fully taxed profits flowing between Australia and Finland. The protocol updates and clarifies certain aspects of the existing agreement with Finland. The Romanian agreement will enter into force after diplomatic notes are exchanged advising that the processes in each country to give the agreement the force of law have been completed. The Finnish protocol will enter into force 30 days after both countries have exchanged notifications.
Before I resume my seat, I would like to refer in passing to a repetitious remark made by the honourable member for Wills in his speech in relation to the government's advertising campaign for Australia's new tax system, which will come into force on 1 July with tremendous benefits to all parts of the Australian community. He said that the money being spent by the government was a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money and that Labor opposes it. As I said in debate yesterday, the government does not apologise for making sure that the people of Australia are fully aware of all of the benefits, all of the facts and all of the circumstances of Australia's new tax system. It would be highly irresponsible of us as a government to bring about real substantial tax reform—the most substantial tax reform every brought about in this country, with the support of the Australian people—unless we told the community about the benefits of our new tax system.
The opposition constantly harps on a huge figure which it claims is being spent with respect to advertising. But I just want to reiterate what I said yesterday: a substantial proportion of expenditure—a full $200 million—is attributable to the start-up office. This money is being used, largely, by the start-up office in public education, including business skills education, adviser training and funding peak bodies to deliver sector-specific education and information. So the government is being responsible. We are a reputable government. We went to the Australian people seeking their support prior to the 1998 election. We gained the support of the Australian people. We brought the legislation into the parliament. We have attracted the support of Australia's elected representatives, despite the recalcitrance of the Australian Labor Party. On 1 July we will deliver a new tax system that will see Labor's wholesale sales tax scrapped, a new tax system that will see $12 billion of tax cuts, a new tax system that will see 80 per cent of Australians paying no more than 30 cents in the dollar taxation, a new tax system that will see a four per cent boost in pensions and benefits and compensation for retirees and, as we have entered this new century, a new tax system supported by the Australian people and for which the government has a mandate.  
One looks at the ALP with absolute contempt, because the Australian Labor Party refuse to accept the democratic verdict of the last election. They have sought to frustrate. They have sought to destroy. They have sought to undermine. They have sought to prevent this government from delivering on its mandate. We do not apologise, because on 1 July Australia will have a new tax system and there will be benefits for all parts of the Australian community.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the committee's fifth report for 2000, relating to the Defence Science and Technology Organisation rationalisation project.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The report I have just tabled concerns the proposed provision of facilities for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation rationalisation, Melbourne. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation is the second largest government funded research organisation in Australia after the CSIRO and has a work force of approximately 2,000 employees. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation provides advice on the application of science and technology that is best suited to Australia's defence and security needs. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation has two laboratories: the Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory in Melbourne and the Electronics and Surveillance Research Laboratory in Salisbury, South Australia. The principal sites from which the AMRL operates are located at Maribyrnong and Fishermens Bend, Melbourne. Defence has occupied the Maribyrnong and Fishermens Bend sites since the 1920s. The Fishermens Bend site is the birthplace of aeronautical research activity in Australia. The development of the Fishermens Bend site has spanned more than half a century and involved a number of large scale projects. The Public Works Committee has been involved in this development. The AMRL currently conducts activities in four key areas: operational analysis, acquisition advice, war fighter support and through life support of Australian Defence Force assets.
The project encompasses relocating AMRL Maribyrnong activities to refurbished and new facilities at Fishermens Bend and enhancing AMRL capabilities. The project includes new and refurbished facilities to relocate and consolidate the following existing research activities: maritime platforms, combatant protection and nutrition, and science corporate management. The project also includes initiatives which will result in integrated common technologies across the areas of mechanical testing and advance composites manufacture. I think I can say on behalf of the committee that we were all enormously impressed by the work that is being carried out by this organisation which is certainly very important to Australia. The following enhanced capabilities are also proposed: a new airframes and engines division, a large scale maritime and aircraft structures testing facility, a thermal testing facility and a structural component bank. The project will overcome a number of identified constraints in relation to the existing facilities at Maribyrnong and Fishermens Bend, including that no opportunity exists to develop fully integrated research facilities or to develop multifunctional shared facilities, that research activities which are currently split over two sites impose operational and cost inefficiencies on AMRL and that there is little or no ability to increase research outputs or achieve productivity gains as a result of the inefficient siting of facilities. 
When referred to the committee, the estimated out-turn cost of the proposed works was $56.71 million. The committee has recommended that the project should proceed. The relocation, refurbishment and consolidation of existing capabilities will provide operational efficiencies, result in recurrent cost savings and allow for a multidisciplinary team approach to be implemented. Proposed new facilities meet an identified need and will allow for improved operational efficiencies and will significantly enhance AMRL's capabilities. The committee was apprised of concerns relating to the rationalisation and the future sale of the Maribyrnong facilities and the heritage values of both the Maribyrnong and Fishermens Bend sites. In respect of the future sale of the Maribyrnong site, Defence advised and provided the committee with an undertaking that studies that will be conducted by Defence to look at all issues relating to the sale of the Maribyrnong site will be done through extensive consultation with affected parties.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—by leave—I will try to be brief in speaking in support of the report that has just been tabled by the chair of the Public Works Committee before the House today. I want to do so because not very often do we as parliamentarians get an opportunity to commend and congratulate some of our people who work within our organisations around this country. As the Public Works Committee we could only look at the assessment and costing to make sure taxpayers' dollars are being spent wisely and well. In the 30 pages of this report we could not explain or cover the marvellous job that our scientists are doing. I was very impressed. As you probably realise, I have been involved in political life for many years, but having seen who I believe are our unsung heroes, our science personnel, working away, and some of the projects that they take on, I can stand up in this parliament and say they are second to none. As the chair of the Public Works Committee stated, the staff number some 2,000 people around Australia. We certainly did not have the opportunity of meeting every one of them but, through the course of this investigation and through looking at sites both at Maribyrnong and at Fishermens Bend, I can speak of what I saw and what we all experienced. I commend and congratulate and put on the public record the wonderful work that is being undertaken by our scientists. I particularly feel for the people in Maribyrnong because that site has been occupied since 1922. There has been a work force over the years of 600-plus but, over the last 10 years, that has been reduced to 200-odd. But the decision has been made within our science areas that you must move on and that, if you are going to get value for money—more importantly, if you are going to have scientists commune and talk with one another—then this is the best and wisest decision. I believe we found that during our investigation.
Also when there we had the opportunity of going through Fishermens Bend to see what our scientists are doing to keep some of our aircraft in the air and to keep equipment going under very difficult circumstances. I said I would be brief, but I really want to say to each and every one of them that they are unsung heroes. Too often we hear criticism of some of the work of our public servants. More importantly, often we do not have the opportunity to commend and congratulate them. So, in speaking to this report, I want to put that on the record, and I know I speak on behalf of all the committee when I say that we were more than impressed and certainly very proud not only of their expertise but also of their capabilities and of how well they are looking after the taxpayers' dollars in this particular area. I wish them well in their future advancement. I know that Fishermens Bend was the birthplace of those research activities—in fact they have been operating there since 1938. Over the last 50 years they have built some excellent facilities.

I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works, but I am the local member whose area will be affected by the recommendations made by the committee. Obviously I respect the unanimous and considered view of the committee that this is best in the broader public interest. However, I was very pleased to hear the chair of the committee comment that the considerations that I raised with the committee with respect to the ongoing treatment of the Maribyrnong site have been taken into account. We obviously will be very concerned about the loss of jobs in our area. As importantly, we are concerned about the future sale of the site.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the committee's fifth report for 2000, relating to the Defence Science and Technology Organisation rationalisation project.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The report I have just tabled concerns the proposed provision of facilities for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation rationalisation, Melbourne. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation is the second largest government funded research organisation in Australia after the CSIRO and has a work force of approximately 2,000 employees. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation provides advice on the application of science and technology that is best suited to Australia's defence and security needs. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation has two laboratories: the Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory in Melbourne and the Electronics and Surveillance Research Laboratory in Salisbury, South Australia. The principal sites from which the AMRL operates are located at Maribyrnong and Fishermens Bend, Melbourne. Defence has occupied the Maribyrnong and Fishermens Bend sites since the 1920s. The Fishermens Bend site is the birthplace of aeronautical research activity in Australia. The development of the Fishermens Bend site has spanned more than half a century and involved a number of large scale projects. The Public Works Committee has been involved in this development. The AMRL currently conducts activities in four key areas: operational analysis, acquisition advice, war fighter support and through life support of Australian Defence Force assets.
The project encompasses relocating AMRL Maribyrnong activities to refurbished and new facilities at Fishermens Bend and enhancing AMRL capabilities. The project includes new and refurbished facilities to relocate and consolidate the following existing research activities: maritime platforms, combatant protection and nutrition, and science corporate management. The project also includes initiatives which will result in integrated common technologies across the areas of mechanical testing and advance composites manufacture. I think I can say on behalf of the committee that we were all enormously impressed by the work that is being carried out by this organisation which is certainly very important to Australia. The following enhanced capabilities are also proposed: a new airframes and engines division, a large scale maritime and aircraft structures testing facility, a thermal testing facility and a structural component bank. The project will overcome a number of identified constraints in relation to the existing facilities at Maribyrnong and Fishermens Bend, including that no opportunity exists to develop fully integrated research facilities or to develop multifunctional shared facilities, that research activities which are currently split over two sites impose operational and cost inefficiencies on AMRL and that there is little or no ability to increase research outputs or achieve productivity gains as a result of the inefficient siting of facilities. 
When referred to the committee, the estimated out-turn cost of the proposed works was $56.71 million. The committee has recommended that the project should proceed. The relocation, refurbishment and consolidation of existing capabilities will provide operational efficiencies, result in recurrent cost savings and allow for a multidisciplinary team approach to be implemented. Proposed new facilities meet an identified need and will allow for improved operational efficiencies and will significantly enhance AMRL's capabilities. The committee was apprised of concerns relating to the rationalisation and the future sale of the Maribyrnong facilities and the heritage values of both the Maribyrnong and Fishermens Bend sites. In respect of the future sale of the Maribyrnong site, Defence advised and provided the committee with an undertaking that studies that will be conducted by Defence to look at all issues relating to the sale of the Maribyrnong site will be done through extensive consultation with affected parties.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—by leave—I will try to be brief in speaking in support of the report that has just been tabled by the chair of the Public Works Committee before the House today. I want to do so because not very often do we as parliamentarians get an opportunity to commend and congratulate some of our people who work within our organisations around this country. As the Public Works Committee we could only look at the assessment and costing to make sure taxpayers' dollars are being spent wisely and well. In the 30 pages of this report we could not explain or cover the marvellous job that our scientists are doing. I was very impressed. As you probably realise, I have been involved in political life for many years, but having seen who I believe are our unsung heroes, our science personnel, working away, and some of the projects that they take on, I can stand up in this parliament and say they are second to none. As the chair of the Public Works Committee stated, the staff number some 2,000 people around Australia. We certainly did not have the opportunity of meeting every one of them but, through the course of this investigation and through looking at sites both at Maribyrnong and at Fishermens Bend, I can speak of what I saw and what we all experienced. I commend and congratulate and put on the public record the wonderful work that is being undertaken by our scientists. I particularly feel for the people in Maribyrnong because that site has been occupied since 1922. There has been a work force over the years of 600-plus but, over the last 10 years, that has been reduced to 200-odd. But the decision has been made within our science areas that you must move on and that, if you are going to get value for money—more importantly, if you are going to have scientists commune and talk with one another—then this is the best and wisest decision. I believe we found that during our investigation.
Also when there we had the opportunity of going through Fishermens Bend to see what our scientists are doing to keep some of our aircraft in the air and to keep equipment going under very difficult circumstances. I said I would be brief, but I really want to say to each and every one of them that they are unsung heroes. Too often we hear criticism of some of the work of our public servants. More importantly, often we do not have the opportunity to commend and congratulate them. So, in speaking to this report, I want to put that on the record, and I know I speak on behalf of all the committee when I say that we were more than impressed and certainly very proud not only of their expertise but also of their capabilities and of how well they are looking after the taxpayers' dollars in this particular area. I wish them well in their future advancement. I know that Fishermens Bend was the birthplace of those research activities—in fact they have been operating there since 1938. Over the last 50 years they have built some excellent facilities. We hope they continue to build those facilities, but, more importantly, we hope they continue to do the work for which they are renowned.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,12,2,speech

"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I rise today to speak against these very unfair pieces of legislation, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000 and, as part of the cognate debate, the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2000 which is an administrative extension of the main bill. I remain somewhat puzzled as to the reason why the government and the minister are introducing these measures into the House of Representatives by way of legislation. Just over a year ago, the Senate quite clearly ruled that a similar policy measure introduced at the time as a regulation was discriminatory, elitist and just plain unfair, and knocked it back. I also remain puzzled as to the reason why the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has decided to introduce this measure in the form of a bill this time around when, as I understand it, he could have attempted to introduce it again as a regulation, which would be the normal procedure in this case. I hope that the rationale for this course of action is to allow for substantial debate on these important bills in both chambers, a move that I welcome regardless of the government's motivation. 
I welcome the opportunity to address the House on these bills because so much needs to be said about the culture which has led to the introduction of such unfair and un-Australian pieces of legislation where the government is essentially legislating in favour of queue jumping. I mention queue jumping because it is a topic very close to the government's heart and it is a topic that in many respects has polarised the Australian people over the last couple of years. In the last couple of years we have seen an influx of illegal immigrants reach Australia from countries such as Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Palestine, China, the African continent and other places plagued by civil unrest and endless conflict.
Our problem with illegal immigration and its despicable offshoot, namely people-smuggling, while nowhere near the level of some of our peer nations such as the UK, Canada and the United States—and indeed most developed European countries such as Italy, France and Germany, just to name a few—has nevertheless reached proportions previously unknown in this country. As illegal immigration has soared in comparison with previous years, so has the meritorious nature of many of these asylum seekers' claims, and the term `queue jumper' has emerged, bringing with it a sinister meaning instantly recognisable as an un-Australian act, an action that goes against the very nature of our sense of fair play. To his credit, the minister for immigration has devoted much energy to addressing this problem with the full cooperation of the opposition.
Mr Deputy Speaker, just to give you an example of the government's and opposition's cooperation in this area, Labor has supported many reasonable measures to date such as information exchange and data matching between agencies to improve tracking of visa overstayers and illegal workers; taking away the right of illegal immigrants to have lawyers automatically present prior to and during their interviews with the immigration department; changes to refugee regulations to address unfounded claims for refugee status, designed to hit those seeking to abuse the system and jump the queue, while protecting genuine claimants; heavily increasing fines for people-smugglers and those associated with these operations; and supporting the now somewhat infamous temporary protection visa system, which gave the government the benefit of the doubt in attempting to stem the flow of illegal arrivals, albeit with genuine refugee claims, to our shores. These are some of the measures—some quite drastic—that the government has employed, in the main with Labor's blessing, to stop queue jumping by desperate people arriving in Australia by sea or air. That is why Labor cannot support a bill that flies in the face of such efforts, creates a double standard and legalises queue jumping for those people who are wealthy enough to be able afford some $65,000 per couple in fees, levies and bonds. 
While I am critical of the government for their overzealous application of user-pay principles, I want to make it very clear that the opposition is in favour of ensuring that aged parents who enter Australia make worthwhile financial contributions to the community that may have to cater for their needs in later years. Labor acknowledges that it would be unfair and very costly if Australian taxpayers had to fund medical expenses for thousands of newly arrived aged parents whose contributions did not adequately cover their treatment. Let us not forget that at present the cost for a couple of aged parents or aged dependent relatives migrating to this country is already in the vicinity of some $8,000—a cost structure introduced by Labor. The minister for immigration, in his second reading speech on 7 June, made the comment that allowing the 20,000 aged parents currently in the queue under the current financial arrangements could result in `billions' of dollars of taxpayers' money being spent on supporting them. 
For a start, no-one is suggesting that all the 20,000 aged parents that are in the queue should be allowed in all at once. No-one is suggesting that at all. Secondly, I take the minister's estimate of `billions' of dollars with the same grain of salt that I took with his earlier estimates of how many illegal immigrants were preparing to `invade' Australia. Back in November and December 1999, the minister was canvassing a figure of some 10,000 boat people about to descend on Australia, with whole Middle Eastern villages packing up for the trip. Of course, that figure never eventuated, because that number of people preparing to come to Australia I do not believe ever existed. Since the minister publicly made that alarmist comment some six months ago, I understand that some 1,000 illegal immigrants have reached our shores. At last count, over a period of some 18 months we received approximately 3,500 illegal immigrants—far, far short of the minister's dire estimates. Similarly, I believe that the figure of `billions' is spurious, as is the accounting that reached it. The claim itself is little more than a scare tactic by the minister to justify and shore up a weak argument.
Another statement that highlights the mindset of this government is the minister's comment that research shows that people who migrate to Australia late in life make a minimal contribution to revenue but incur a very substantial cost in terms of social security and health. This very sad statement only confirms why the Australian public, especially our aged, have completely lost faith in the Howard government and its philosophy of how much a person can be milked throughout their working life, and how quickly they can be discarded when they are no longer deemed useful. I am sure the minister realises that in most cultures grandparents provide not only great stability and focus within their families but, based on the government's own thinking, also a free child-caring service so that younger members of the family can become more productive and ultimately pay more taxes. Perhaps the government's figures, in addition to analysing the billions of taxpayer dollars that aged migrants cost society, should also factor in the billions that are saved in child-care subsidies, increased productivity and additional taxes excised from the parents' higher earnings.
These aged migrants that the government is so keen to punish for costing us so much are, in most cases, related to many thousands of Australian families who, following their migration to Australia, have worked very hard for many years to provide a better life for their children and close family members. Let us remember there are presently some 20,000 in the queue of people who have paid their $1,065 or whatever it is to come to this country. Taking that 20,000, there are residents of this country—in most cases probably Australian citizens; there would be probably anything from 50,000 to 100,000 people who are here, who are Australians—who are waiting for these people to go through the queue. As I will say later on in this speech, at the moment the minister has capped the number that can come in from that queue at 500. Calculate that at about 40 years before they will all be able to come in and, of course, most of them will be deceased by that time. I believe it is very unfair for the government to ask Australian families wishing to sponsor their aged parents to part with what would often amount to their whole life savings in order to pay fees and levies. This bill in its current format is very discriminatory towards wealthy migrants and against migrants from developing countries who cannot ever hope to afford the amounts of money required to fulfil the criteria. I do not believe that Australians would like to see their government favour wealthy people to the detriment of so many other worthy immigrants from countries not so well off. 
We must never forget the contribution made by migrants who helped build Australia and prospered over the past century having arrived with little more than a dream and the will to succeed. The headline of a major article by Jon Marsh in the Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday, 11 March 1999 reads `Immigrants' parents “will die waiting”, government warned'. On the same page, also under Jon Marsh's by-line, is another article with the headline `One list for the rich and one for the poor?' The first article is quite a large article, and it explains in detail that the list of parents who wanted to migrate to Australia to join their Australian children was so long that many would die waiting at the then current rate of 2,500 per year that the government was allowing to come into this country.
Since that article—which, incidentally, showed a picture of a newly arrived aged parent caring for her grandson while the mother prepares to go to work—the quota has again been slashed, to 500 parents per year, in a fit of pique over the Senate's audacity to disallow the original `Rolls Royce' visa class. I am sorry that the minister is not here. He usually is; there must be a reason why he is not here. I would like to say all this to his face. Usually he is fairly calm, but sometimes he gets a little bit dirty. When the Senate knocked him back, in a fit of pique he said, `I was letting in 2,500; now it is only 500. So there! Cop that! Go and blame Labor.' This is the attitude that he has been taking of late. The Herald's article is very telling, as it confirms my previous remarks about the enormous contribution that aged parents make both socially and economically. These are the words of the daughter, a university lecturer in mathematical statistics and computer sciences, who arrived from Greece in 1994, explaining to the journalist how valuable her aged mother is to her family:
`My mother came over to help me. It was my first baby so I was glad she was here,' she said. `She liked it here, so decided it would be a good idea if both my parents came over to join me.' Mrs Hussein said she had supported herself in Australia and having her parents here would help her to continue her job and remain a taxpayer rather than someone who claimed benefits.
`I found a job three weeks after arriving in Australia so I have not cost the taxpayer anything. My husband and I are both Australian citizens. This country was built on the immigrants. Let's make it fair for everyone.'
I wonder how many thousands of families there are in Australia with exactly the same story to tell. How much have their aged parents contributed to the bottom line of the government's budget? A major feature of these new visa classes—which the opposition took into consideration when it decided to oppose this bill—is the application of a nebulous health service charge of $25,000 per person, raised from the current health service charge of $940. I say `nebulous' because neither my colleague Jenny Macklin, the shadow minister for health, nor I have yet managed to figure out exactly how this figure was reached. What formula was used? What actuarial criteria applied? During the last round of Senate estimates that focused on consideration of the immigration department's budget measures, Senators McKiernan and Cooney questioned at length officers from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs on this very issue. In addition, they also questioned the officers present on whether the alternative to the $25,000 fee, a mythical `private health insurance cover for migrant aged parents', was viable or indeed existed. On this particular issue, I will read some extracts of the conversation between my colleague Senator McKiernan and Mr Abdul Rizvi, along with a very perceptive and worthwhile comment made by my friend Senator Barney Cooney based on his interpretation of the department's justification of this fee. I quote: 
Senator McKIERNAN— ... The PBS states:
... either take out a satisfactory level of private health insurance to cover the first ten years after arrival (if such a product is made available by the health insurance industry), or pay a health services charge of $25,000 per person.
Is such a product available?
Mr Rizvi—In our consultations with the department of health, and they have also on our behalf had some consultations with the industry, at this stage it would appear that such a product is not available. Whether the industry is in a position to develop such a product is another matter and that is something we will just have to wait and see. But at this stage, no, such a product is not available. 
... Certainly the advice from the department of health is that no, such a product is not yet available.
Senator McKIERNAN—How then was the figure of $25,000 arrived at?
Mr Smith—The $25,000 health charge you are referring to? 
... It is based on a mixture of average life expectancies, the average call on all health services by people in certain age groups and then a judgment about what would be a reasonable share of that to contribute. If we assume that someone who is, say, aged 65, comes in as an aged parent and if they were to live for 20 years then, based on the department of health surveys and advice, $6,000 a year is the total call for someone in that age group. So six times $20,000 is $120,000. We took about 20 per cent as being a reasonable contribution to make.
Later on during the proceedings, Senator Cooney said:
Senator COONEY—An actuary, in working out the sum that you should pay, would apply a percentage, like four per cent or five per cent, depending on what judgment he or she made about the future events. That is the way you go about it, as I understand it. 
... what Senator McKiernan has been asking and what I am now asking is: how did you get to the $25,000? It seems that what you have done, to some extent, is to pluck it out of the air and say that $25,000 seems a reasonable sort of figure. An actuary would have gone about it by a particular process. That might be the question to ask, actually: did you ever seek the advice of an actuary in working out the figure?
Mr Farmer—In answering your question and Senator McKiernan's question, would it be helpful if we undertook to provide on notice details about the way in which that figure was arrived at?
In other words—and with all due respect to the head of the department, Mr Farmer, for whom I have a great deal of respect—Mr Farmer admitted that the department did not really have an answer and that they needed time to find one. Figures plucked out of the air—this seems to be a constant theme when this government talks about figures, be they budget surpluses, Australia bound boat people or revenue expectations for visa classes.
The Howard government seems to be obsessed with lining the pockets of, subsidising and propping up already wealthy private health insurance funds to the detriment and neglect of the Medicare system. Let us not forget that Medicare is the health fund for all Australians, paid for by all Australians. I understand that the amount of money the government has spent to provide incentives for people to take out private health insurance would have been enough to build 17 teaching hospitals. If these figures are correct or even close to being correct, where are the priorities in this country when at the same time as Australia suffers an acute shortage of public hospital beds we are giving away money hand over fist to subsidise the health care of, in some cases, millionaires and people who are already well off?
I put it to the government that this measure is ill-conceived, poorly planned and calculated, and its true motivation is not to reduce the financial burden on the Australian community; rather, this bill is an attempt to justify a very ordinary budget underpinned by a phantom surplus. Depending on whether or not one believes the budget papers or the bill's explanatory memorandum, this measure is supposed to bring in revenue to the tune of either $155 million or thereabouts or $127 million over a four-year period. To my mind a discrepancy of almost $30 million shows that, at best, this has been a cavalier attitude to taxpayers' money; at worst, negligence in policy planning. 
Above all, the measures in this bill lack support, I submit, from those very people who are supposed to subscribe to it. In his second reading speech on 7 June the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs stated that during his recent community consultations he received substantial support for this proposal.
Mr Hardgrave interjecting—
—Well, you would not have been there. So what are you talking about? You would not know what you are talking about when it comes to these issues.
 (Mr Hollis)—Order! The member should make his remarks through the chair.
—Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker: my colleague the member for Moreton would not know what he is talking about. I want to be nice to you today anyway.
Government members interjecting—
—We did not show too much yesterday, so we had better show some today.
I really have to question such a statement that the minister has all this support, given that the minister's annual national talkfest is little more than an expensive public relations exercise full of special effects and pretty graphs, but precious little substance. These so-called consultations are just an opportunity for the minister to visit marginal Liberal seats, given the fact that, out of the 12 meetings held during the last 12 months, eight were held in coalition held electorates across the country. I have a list here. I thought at some stage I might be able to use it. These are the public consultations that the minister for immigration trumpets about how he gets around the country and talks to the real people out there in the community and how they tell him how many we should bring in next year and whether the immigration policies of the government are going well. Looking at the list, the only places where there was a Labor member was in places where he could not get away from them: for instance, Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory—obviously there is a Labor member up there and there was not much he could do about that one; Hobart—thankfully all of Tasmania voted Labor and not one seat is held by the Liberal Party, so I suppose one can excuse that one. In Canberra, he has held them at Parliament House; I guess that is represented by a Labor member as well. In Newcastle, no person would want to vote anything but Labor, and they are Labor up there. But nearly all the minister's visits have been to Liberal held seats. In Melbourne the minister has visited the Knox Community Centre, which is represented by Mr Charles and Mr Nugent somewhere there; Jackie Kelly's seat; Chris Gallus's seat in Adelaide; Barry Wakelin's seat of Whyalla; and on and on it goes—even Wilson Tuckey's seat at Geraldton. I would like to know how many immigrants are up there and would be prepared to talk to him. He also went to the electorates of Margaret May and Teresa Gambaro. 
The reality is that these are nothing but simply political tricks to look after some of the marginal members. But I must put it to him—not that it matters—that because these areas that he is visiting are not exactly areas that migrants go to in their droves; why is he not going to the inner city suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne where the migrants are? No, he goes into these fringe areas where he knows there are not too many. I have to say this: every time he goes somewhere where there are a lot of migrants or people who help migrants they do not particularly like him. That is why. In any event I do not think Mr Ruddock is the sort of person who can win you too many votes at the moment in any event, so good luck to those marginal Liberal members who want him in their seat.
If on our evidence we question these estimations as to the amount of revenue that this measure would raise, I can just hear the answer. The minister will say, `Labor's not going to allow us to bring this in; therefore it is a hole in our budget.'  The fact is that his reasoning was always going to be ambitious. I say that because, between 1 November 1998 when the  previous visa class was introduced by regulation and 31 March 1999 when it was finally disallowed in the Senate, some 2,531 people had applied to join that class at a cost of something like $17,000 per couple. This is the regulation which was disallowed in the Senate. So over a full five-month period, only some 2,500 people, something like 10 per cent of those that were in that queue—although not all of them came from the queue, but most of them did, I understand—applied for the visa class where they had to spend $17,000. The figure of 2,531 represented approximately 10 per cent of the then aged parent and aged dependent relative queue. If 10 per cent of the queue is all the minister was able to convince over a five-month period of the discounted price of $17,000, how does he expect to convince 4,000 people over the next two program years to part with $65,000 per couple? I believe the government is being very ambitious and optimistic in this regard. 
Further, another substantial piece of evidence that I can rely on is the recent survey that the Australian Democrats conducted to gauge support or otherwise for these new measures. I understand that Senator Bartlett sent out some 6,000 letters explaining the new measures and seeking feedback from ethnic community organisations, church and religious groups, migration agents and other stakeholders. The result of this comprehensive survey, I understand, as I read in an article in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, is that 75 per cent of those that replied were against the new measure.
I reiterate that the Labor opposition are not opposed to the principles of mutual obligation, nor are we opposed to ensuring that newly arrived aged parents and aged dependent relatives provide substantial contributions to their own health care, in particular. These contributions, however, must be fair and they must be achievable, especially by those people whose means are limited. If the government intends to raise millions of dollars by the sale of visas, let it say so, openly and transparently. Let the government place whatever criteria it wants on these visas. But the point is that, if it is just creating a new visa class to make some money, it should at least have the guts to say that that is what it wants to do. In his second reading speech the minister said he now wants to allow more parents to live in Australia in a way that ensures a fair deal for the Australian taxpayer. The Labor opposition agrees wholeheartedly with this statement. What the opposition does not want, however, is deception and unfairness in policy making. This bill has plenty of both.
On this note, the speaker who will follow me from the opposition side will be the shadow health minister, who will make many telling observations as to how this particular bill has been ill-conceived. In fact, if it were passed, the drain on the public health system would be extraordinarily great, because all this minister is saying is that he wants this $25,000 per person health fee to be paid to a private health insurer. Never mind at the moment that they do not have a product. But, presuming they can have a product, they will pay that money into the private health insurer and the Medicare system will still pick up the health care of these people. It is just so stupid that it is beyond words. As I say to you, the member for Jagajaga will talk about that in more detail.
I might say also, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Labor is not averse to coming up with a fair system whereby over a period of time and, say, on a yearly basis perhaps some contribution can be made, because a lot of people in this country who are now aged have contributed to the Medicare system by way of their levies and as a result they should not be disadvantaged and there should not be any undue pressures put on the Australian taxpaying public if these people come over here at a late stage. So we agree with that. My mind is always open. As I always say to the minister for immigration, if he wants to put something up that is fair, we will, as we do in 85 to 90 per cent of cases, agree to the bill.
I want to finish by reiterating that the opposition will not support this bill at present. I therefore wish to move an amendment which has been circulated in my name. I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“the bill be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for an increase in the quota for parent visas based on:
(1) a fair contribution by parents or their sponsors towards the costs to be met by Medicare for parents' general health care; 
 (2) any health contributions to be used to offset the increased costs for Medicare and public hospital services; and
(3) the size of any contribution not being such as to exclude access to visas by parents of Australian families with limited means”.
Time is running out for me—
—It always was.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I have to reply to that interjection.
—You only have two minutes.
—I have 30 seconds or something. The member for Moreton is here on tenterhooks. The chances are that the Australian public will give him the biggest boot he has ever had in his life at the next election and he is saying things like that about us. It is just so funny, it makes me laugh. He is not a bad fellow; it is a pity his electors will reject him shortly. They did it to me, mate, so don't feel bad.
I simply say that the rationale behind my motion will be further referred to by the shadow health minister my colleague and friend Jenny Macklin. We support the amendment but certainly we do not support the bill.

"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—At the heart of the argument is Graham Richardson's observation—this pathological, passionate distaste that the Australian Labor Party have for anything to do with private health. When we cut everything the honourable member for Bowman had to say in his 30-minute contribution to this particular debate, that is really what it was all about. We have heard a lot about the question of rights but we never hear much about the sense of responsibility. I really must begin on that point.
In a lot of ways this amendment could almost be named after the honourable member for Bowman, the Sciacca amendment, because so much of what we are doing in this legislation addresses the chain of events that came about as a direct result of his advice to his Senate colleagues to block legislation which would create two new parent subclasses. It was first announced in November 1998. It is a statement of historical fact that the Senate disallowed those particular regulations which underpinned the subclasses on 31 March 1999. The effect of that was that everything to do with the whole area of parent visas basically went back to what it was prior to November 1998.
The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is somebody who shows the lead on consultation and keeps in touch with the community in the specific area that he addresses.
—In Liberal seats.
—The honourable member for Bowman interjects that it is a Liberal seat. If it were not for the fact that the government held so many seats across Australia, it would be more difficult for the minister to actually get to the fine cross-section of Australians that he manages to speak to at those particular consultation sessions.
I know there are a lot of people from various ethnic community groups within my electorate of Moreton who travelled to Redcliffe, to the electorate of Petrie, the venue for those consultations in the area of Brisbane. I think a lot of them would be very offended. I will be making sure they have a copy of the words of the honourable member for Bowman. They would be very offended by the underlying logic in his argument to this place that they did not represent a valid view, that they were somehow or other cooked up or conspired by the minister to present something that suited his cause.
Those people from my electorate have come from diverse backgrounds—from various parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, war-torn parts of our world—to live in this country. They go to consultation sessions with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, express their view and give him a tick or a cross on matters he has raised with them. It is offensive in the extreme for the honourable member for Bowman to come in here and suggest that somehow or other they were cooked up and conspired by the minister to suit his cause. 
I find it especially offensive that the honourable member for Bowman has caused the circumstance where the regulations the minister originally attempted to amend were disallowed by the Senate. But 2,500 parents were going to come to Australia under this particular rights and responsibilities style of approach. It was 2,500 and now it is down to 500, all thanks to the Australian Labor Party in the other place on the advice of the honourable member for Bowman. The honourable member for Bowman is pretty rich in coming into this place.
This particular piece of legislation is all about getting people out of a couple of queues. One is the migration queue that they are in. In the circumstances caused by the honourable member for Bowman, it will take 40 years for the 20,000 people currently waiting for visas under this particular category to get here. Naturally enough, a whole bunch of them will never arrive. It will take 40 years under this particular set of circumstances regarding existing parents.
This government is trying to say, `If there are people in the queue who have the capacity to meet the responsibility of looking after their circumstances like all other Australians who have lived here their entire lives, if they have the capacity to meet their health care costs, then talk. Let's give them the chance to come here, be repatriated with family members who are sponsoring them and provide all of the social linkages that we know that ageing parents are able to provide to families and their particular needs.' This is all about getting them out of that queue. It is also about not creating yet another series of long queues in public hospitals around Australia. I understand the honourable member for Jagajaga follows me in this particular debate. I know that her passionate distaste for anything to do with private health will be displayed by her contribution.
What members of the Australian Labor do every time they come into these debates is talk about whether or not people should be able to subscribe to private health insurance mechanisms. The companies cannot keep up with those who are doing so before 1 July; everyone wants to get cover. Members of the Labor Party complain that there is something fundamentally wrong, public hospitals should be propped up and we should create longer queues. That is at the heart of everything the Australian Labor Party ever says on these matters. They want longer queues in public health institutions around this country. They do not want encouraged in any way those people who have the capacity to relieve those queues from the burden of so many in them by meeting their own particular sense of responsibilities by contributing to private health insurance. They do not want people to take out private health insurance, which means they do not want people to leave the long public hospital queues around this country.
This mechanism is consistent with a well established principle of this government to say to those who have the capacity to do something for those who do not have the capacity to go ahead and do so. We will allow some of those who do not have the means to put together bonds or pay charges to meet the costs of their health or social security benefits as newly arrived migrants in this country. We are giving those people the opportunity to come up the queue faster than would have been the case as a direct result of measures that were caused by the Australian Labor Party. This actually helps get people out of the queue. It is also part of the ongoing important measures that have been introduced by this government to ensure integrity in the immigration system in this country. It is not just those who migrate here who have a stake in the integrity of the immigration system. It is a matter of concern right across the breadth of public policy debate in this country, right across the different cohorts and constituencies that exist in this nation. We saw not too many years ago in this country someone prepared to try to split politics and divisions within our national social fabric by attempting to create in people's minds some resentment towards those who migrate to this country. So integrity of the immigration system is one of the most important things that Minister Ruddock has achieved during his stewardship.
It is important we send a message to all Australians that people are not coming here on a free ride and that anyone who migrates to this country migrates for the right reasons. The `what's in it for Australia' criterion has been met in a positive way. Likewise, even those who migrate to this country as parents of longer established migrants have themselves an opportunity to be part of that integrity approach that we are adopting and have adopted since coming to government. We do not want people who migrate to this country to feel a sense of resentment from those who have lived here a long time—who were born here and whose family has been here for generations or those who perhaps arrived in the postwar migration boom. We do not want people to come to this country and find anything other than a complete welcome. The fact someone may come late in their working life to this nation is in itself a very big decision. It is not a decision that is taken lightly. It is not a decision that is taken against a background of having no assets in so many of the cases. It is not an unreasonable thing at all to ask those people who come here with some capacity to invest—having come here late in their working life—`What contribution can you make?  What can you do to assist this country in looking after you in your later years?'  
It is important for anybody who wants to participate in this debate to understand that there are health care costs associated with people over the age of 65 of, on average, $6,000 a year. We have a statement from members opposite that that should be borne in part by the average Australian taxpayer, which means of course that the integrity of the system starts to come into disrepute. I am stunned to think that the Australian Labor Party would want to create a set of circumstances where it would be easy for those who want to practise splitter's politics to divide our nation into migrants and non-migrants, black and white and so forth, as we saw not too many years ago, all over again. I would hate to think that the Australian Labor Party are, by implication, suggesting that that would suit them fine, because that is actually the sort of thing that could occur as a result of not taking the kinds of measures contained in this bill. 
We are saying, `If you want to come to this country, we want you here if you have something positive to offer. Here are the terms; here are the conditions.' We are still saying to 500 people a year—it could have been 2,500 if the member for Bowman had not intervened—that they will still be able to come here under other circumstances. To those who have the capacity to contribute towards the cost of their health, wellbeing and maintenance, we are saying it is not fair just for the Australian taxpayer to meet that cost. We are saying that unless the private health insurance industry provides cover—and that product will come as a result of the obvious incentive that will be there for the private health industry to do so—then there will be a health service charge of $25,000 per person. Those are the rules; those are the conditions and that is the basis on which you come to Australia. I do not see that that in itself is a problem. I do not think it is a problem to any fair-minded Australian who looks not just at the specifics of this but rather at the broad issues—the importance of maintaining our social fabric and, of course, the integrity of this system.
The charge that the member Bowman is upset about, this $25,000, may never be charged if the private health insurance industry comes forward with the sort of package of cover we are encouraging through this piece of legislation. What would happen is that there would be a statement of agreement struck by somebody who believes they can meet the cost of whatever the charge of the premium would be each year to cover their entire health care costs. Most Australians would applaud the fact that we are saying, `You have the right to live here in Australia. We will confer upon you citizenship. We value the fact that you have decided to move here for whatever reason, but like every other Australian there is a set of responsibilities you have to undertake and guarantee you will undertake.' I do not see that in itself as being a problem in the real world—the sort of world that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has never been afraid to enter into. 
I have visited these consultation processes that the minister has undertaken. He had one in my electorate a few years ago. There is no doubt in my mind that the minister has taken brickbats and bouquets along the way. That has ensured that the minister keeps on the right path to come up with the right balance of measures and, moreover, the people of Australia are coming with him. He is responding to people's views, concerns and needs, but at the same time he is explaining to those people—there are some in the community who do not even understand why we have any immigrants—the value of our migration program, the measures the government has undertaken to ensure its integrity is in place and that those who migrate here clearly understand before they come here their rights and responsibilities.  
This is one of a range of measures that is contained within our migration acts. This is just one means by which people are able to put forward their case to meet the `what's in it for Australia' criterion that is generally applied to anybody who aspires to migrate to this country. No-one would doubt for a moment that we should allow people to come here on their terms and conditions. Moreover, once they get here, no-one should ever doubt that this government would allow anybody to create a circumstance where anybody who has migrated to this country is looked down upon as being less Australian than someone who was born here or whose families have been here. It is one of a package of measures that is bringing families together.
I know the minister's own hand was across the unification of a family in my electorate. His intervention and efforts made it possible, after eight years of living apart, for Kebreab Teweldemedhin, who came from Eritrea and fought his way to this country, last week to be reunited with his wife and children. He has seen his 10-year-old daughter become 18, his 11-year-old daughter become 19, his 14-year-old daughter become 22 and his son whom he had not seen for nine years, and they are now back together living here in Australia. That is what this migration program, at its heart, is all is about; that is, bringing people to Australia who will make a contribution to this nation with a clear understanding of their rights and responsibilities once they get here and bringing people here who will be, due to their having come here, encouraged to do good things for this nation. And I know that Kebreab's family will contribute greatly to this nation.
I come back to where I began my contribution to this debate. I am offended in the extreme by the notion of the member for Bowman in questioning the bona fides of the minister and in questioning the minister's motivation to hold public consultations. I am offended in the extreme by the member for Bowman who himself has caused fewer parents to come through on the clear path that could have been in place for 2,500 a year and is now only 500 a year. I am offended by the member for Bowman's smoke and mirrors contribution to this debate to try to bring about some confusion in the ranks that all migrants will face some sort of impost on them. I am offended in the extreme by this ongoing pathological and philosophical hatred that the Australian Labor Party has for anything to do with private health. What it basically says to people is, `It's all one-sided and we will give you everything; don't bother doing anything for yourself.'  I think great dignity comes from those who can subscribe to private health. Great dignity will also come from the measures contained within the bills for those who take up the option to get themselves out of the queue—a queue made longer by the member for Bowman and the Australian Labor Party—and come to Australia and contribute something to themselves, their family and our nation. I commend the bill to the House.
Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000 proposes a new system for approval of visas for parents of Australian citizens to migrate to Australia. In future these people will be required to buy private health insurance for 10 years in advance or pay a $25,000 charge in order to qualify for consideration. This will result in a considerable cost for Australians who want to bring their retired parents to this country to spend their last years with their families. Including the social security bonds, it will be necessary for a family to raise $64,000 to bring both parents or $35,000 to bring out a sole remaining parent. The government argues that these arrangements will offset the cost to the Commonwealth from allowing a larger number of parents to enter, because they will be paying for their own health care. This scheme does nothing of the sort, because it does not attract a single extra dollar to pay for the additional Medicare services that will be provided. The important thing to note, of course, is that once these family members arrive in Australia they will be entitled to Medicare, whether they have private health insurance or not.
The government seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding of how Medicare works and what is provided by private health insurance. It is quite false to suggest that private health insurance is a replacement product, because it does not pay for the cost of basic health care met by Medicare and it really only pays for the additional costs of using a private hospital. For example, $6 billion a year is spent on  medical services for GPs and specialists by the Commonwealth. None of this is covered by private health insurance. Medicare even funds 75 per cent of the medical bills of private patients for in-hospital private treatment. Private health insurance covers only the other 25 per cent or, in the case of no-gap coverage, the gap between the 75 per cent Medicare rebate and the total cost.
Another $4 billion is funded through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which is a fundamental part of Medicare and available to all people entitled to a Medicare card. Again, private health insurance does not cover any of these costs. The only return a privately insured patient can get is against the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payment for pharmaceuticals received as a private in-patient—a relatively small proportion of cases.
The third major category is for the costs of hospital accommodation and treatment. Here the Commonwealth spends $6 billion on public hospitals, and the states spend a similar amount. Under this proposed scheme, the government will provide a Medicare card to each new parent migrant and that parent will then be entitled to free medical, pharmaceutical and hospital services under Medicare without getting a single dollar back. There is no contribution paid for the Medicare services under the government's proposal and no reduction in the costs met by the government for medical or pharmaceutical services. 
The government's argument hangs around whether a person with private health insurance saves the government anything if they go to a private hospital rather than a public one. So far, the government has completely failed to demonstrate that the recent increase in private health insurance membership has had the slightest impact on the demand for public hospitals. In fact, the evidence suggests that private hospitals are substantially underutilised while public hospitals continue to treat record numbers of patients. There is no sign that there has been a shift in the direction that the government has counted on. The cost to the government of medical services paid for by Medicare has not dropped by a dollar. Medicare continues to pay 75 per cent of the medical costs of private hospital patients and pays 85 per cent of the cost of all normal medical consultations.
The government continues to pay the full cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and is now subsidising health insurance for those members who get a rebate from their fund for the co-payments that others pay out of pocket. The government's cost of contributing to public hospitals has not dropped. In fact, the cost of running our public hospitals continues to increase as the states try to keep up with demand. It is very unfortunate that this government has failed to properly index its payments to the states, and as a result the states have been short-changed as far as their public hospitals are concerned.
This government should be condemned for reneging on the Australian health care agreements signed with the states in late 1998. Barely one year later the Minister for Health and Aged Care in the federal parliament has refused to accept the finding of an independent inquiry appointed in accordance with the dispute provisions in the agreement. The minister has effectively ripped up the agreement and short-changed the states. And, of course, as a result of the measure before the House, this situation will get worse as more pressure will come on the public hospitals with no extra contribution.
The opposition does not object to the proposition that it would be reasonable for migrant parents to make a contribution to offset the likely health expenses to be incurred by the public purse. I am sure that, provided that that contribution was within their means, most parents and their children would be happy to pay such a contribution. The issue is whether the contribution is reasonable and structured to make it affordable. It is contrary to the equity principles on which Australia's migration program is based that requirements such as this should create a situation where wealthy people can get easy access to Australia while those less well off are kept out. Unfortunately, the government has refused to look at the issue in a reasonable way. The requirement to purchase private health insurance is unreasonable and will be shown to be unworkable and the alternative of a $25,000 up-front payment is beyond the means of most people.
I have already explained why requiring migrant parents to take out private health insurance will not reduce the cost to the public purse. I have to say that the silliness of this policy gets even worse. As we know, the government pays 30 per cent of the cost of all private health insurance and it will actually incur extra costs as a result of this proposal—which I might say to the minister are not disclosed in the financial statement in the explanatory memorandum.
If 4,000 parents took out private health insurance policies at the foreshadowed cost of $25,000 for 10 years coverage, it would produce income for the funds of around $100 million but the government would have to fund $30 million of that through the 30 per cent rebate. There would be absolutely no saving to the government as far as Medicare is concerned. The government proposes to give access to Medicare to these migrants without any payment. As most are retired or without any other income, they are probably all exempt from paying the Medicare levy.
Likewise, the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would not reduce by $1 by virtue of the migrant parents having private health insurance. Public hospital costs would not drop either. For a start, migrant parents would be perfectly entitled to use public hospitals as any other Medicare card holder is entitled to do. Quite a few privately insured people use public hospitals because that is where they can access reliable emergency services and complex treatment. In a private hospital, people are often charged large gap fees. This is also an incentive for people to go public. 
Before I go on to talk about Labor's proposition, I want to mention another unresolved flaw in the government's scheme. At present there are no policies available to provide the coverage that this bill dictates. No health fund currently offers a 10-year policy and there is considerable doubt that the rules applying to health funds will permit a policy to be paid up front given the uncertainty that exists about future premium increases. There are many things about such policies which would have to be explained, not least the rules about whether or not they are partially refundable should the person die.
The government must also explain how its commitment to maintain community rating for private health insurance is kept. These 10-year policies will be targeted at a specific age group who are known to have much higher costs than other people who are members of any fund. The government will be effectively forcing other fund members to contribute to the cross-subsidisation of migrant parents unless it abandons community rating for these older migrants, which will push up the cost of these premiums significantly. So we need to know which way the government intends to go. Is it intending to charge these migrant parents the full cost of covering these parents at an older age, which is of course outside the principles of community rating, or does it intend to stick with community rating and cross-subsidise through the health insurance funds? I would like either the minister for immigration or the health minister to explain why they think this private health insurance arrangement will do one scrap of good when dealing with this problem.
As I indicated, the opposition does not object to the proposition that migrant parents should make a reasonable contribution to the provision of health services that they will be able to access in Australia. The basic principle of Medicare is that people contribute towards the cost of health services in proportion to their ability to pay. Most people contribute through their working life, paying the Medicare levy and other taxes to meet their share of the total health system, which is widely acknowledged as one of the world's best and funded by one of the world's fairest funding mechanisms. This means that everybody contributes. Those who retire with incomes below the Medicare levy threshold are not required to contribute further but those with incomes above that level do continue to contribute their share. The problem with migrant parents will be that most be will be retired and on very low incomes. Because older people have higher than average health needs, they would also be much more likely to draw more than average on the Medicare pool while not having contributed during their working lives in their home countries.
The most sensible way to overcome this problem and for the government to minimise the additional budget expense is to introduce a system for direct contributions to Medicare by this particular group. The funds contributed by migrant parents or by their children on their behalf could be used to directly fund the additional health services in Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and public hospitals that would be required to provide for their needs. The opposition is therefore proposing that a new Medicare contribution be considered as an alternative to the Medicare levy for people who obtain visas to come to Australia as migrant parents. This should be set at a reasonable level that would be affordable for all groups in the community. The benefit must go to the health system instead of just into general revenue. We want to see a way in which our public system and Medicare can get the money that is needed to care for these people. This would be a vastly better scheme than what the government is proposing. The money paid by migrant parents for their health would go directly into the public health system.
As with other Medicare services, there would still be a cross-subsidy from general taxation but this would be at a more acceptable level than has previously been proposed by the government. Under the government's proposal, the cost of the rebate blows away any savings from getting migrants treated in private hospitals instead of public hospitals. The government's scheme does not raise a single dollar towards the cost of providing Medicare and pharmaceuticals if all it is aiming to do is drive people into a private health insurance product that does not even exist. As I said, under the opposition's approach, there would be more money in the public system, which would make it possible to provide the necessary services to these migrant parents who do want to be with their  families here in Australia. 
We think it is reasonable for people to make a contribution but we want to make sure that that is a contribution that most people are able to make. The sorts of charges that the government is proposing will mean that those with money can afford to bring their parents to Australia and those who do not have that sort of money will not be able to reunite their families. That is not an Australian way of doing things and it is certainly not the way in which Australia would like to see our migration policy being pursued. ",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—I rise today to support the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000 and congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and also thank him for being here in the chamber to listen to the debate today. I think it is important that we see ministers here understanding some of the issues that are raised, and I thank him for it. I think he is a minister who has done an outstanding job of listening to people and their concerns. I have listened to the speech of the honourable member for Jagajaga. I think it is very interesting. She says on the one hand that we need to have some kind of scheme to assist the parents of Australian residents to come to Australia. On the other hand, she says that the amount we want to charge is too much. But, rather interestingly and very politically, she does not say how much she thinks we should charge. She said, `Well, I'm afraid we're opposed to that because it's just far too hard.'  I say to the honourable member for Jagajaga that, if she thinks it is too hard, she should tell us the amount that she thinks is appropriate. It is very easy to come in here and say that she agrees with the principle but the amount is just too high.
I personally think this is an excellent initiative by the minister. In my own electorate office I have seen a number of people who are Australian residents and who have lived here for some time. In my own electorate I have a number of people who have settled from the UK, from Scotland and Ireland, and many other places. They wish to be reunited with their elderly parents or elderly parent. But, because the queue is so long, they feel this great frustration. For most of us, the relationship with our families is absolutely paramount. I can imagine the experience that they would have of being separated from their elderly parents without, in many cases, the prospect of having them come to live with them. Often they may be frail or incapacitated in some way. The trade-off which the minister has proposed is not easy. He has to balance the cost to the Australian taxpayer of having the elderly parent in Australia with the compassion.
I personally think we need to recognise the considerable number of people who want to come to Australia in this category and the way in which they can be assisted. The theme I hear in my electorate office from people is, `We are prepared to guarantee the costs our parents would incur in Australia—their medical costs, et cetera. What we want more than anything is for them to come here. We recognise the costs that are there.' It is not as though under the proposals in this bill a profit will be made, because the figures have been worked out on the reality of what has been charged overall. It is particularly interesting that the charges proposed are a considerable amount less—the figures I have show that on average the total health cost for persons over 65 years is about $6,000 a year. For a person with a remaining life span of 20 years the total cost may be about $120,000. The total welfare cost—special benefit and age pension payments—could be as large as $160,000 per person over the same period. To charge a $25,000 bond is not excessive. It is still in terms of the actual cost. This is not a set-up; this is not providing a spin; this is the reality of what it is costing. We want the parents of Australian residents to have health care, but they should make some contribution towards it, because the average Australian taxpayer who is battling day in and day out would say, `It is fair enough to bring your parents out, but do not expect us to pick up all the costs. Let's look at what is a reasonable amount.' If we look at the reality, in terms of the government's program we have 500 people a year who are able to come to this country under the parents of Australian residents visa program. 
The minister is saying he will provide an additional 4,000 places. Currently we have 20,000 people on the list. It is a substantial boost in terms of the numbers that will be allowed in. The people who have seen me at my electorate office asking for assistance will be delighted if this goes through. Often the Labor Party claims it is a party of compassion. Let us see some of this compassion, because this is about family reunions. The Democrats make the same claim. Let us look at the reality of what we are trying to achieve and that is the balance that is required.
The ALP attempted to make the changes in the past by recognising the significant costs of bringing parents to Australia. In 1988 they introduced the Assurance of Support Regime and Migration Act in recognition of the high cost on taxpayers. They want an assurance signed by the people bringing their parents to this country that those will not be a burden to the Australian taxpayers. Because there was no monetary cost involved, there was a lot of default. Some seven per cent of migrants subject to an assurance received special benefits costing about $9 million and about $7.2 million in unemployment benefits. In 1991 the Labor government decided to tighten it up. They restricted government liability to social security payments, applied stricter means tests on assurers, improved debt recovery liaison between the finance and social security departments and introduced a refundable bond to cover eligible social security payments. Then in addition to the enhanced AOS regime a migrant health services charge was introduced. 
In 1988 as part of wider reform the Commonwealth government proposed to tighten eligibility to Medicare entitlements to exclude a range of people, including visa overstayers, illegal immigrants and the like. In 1992 there was also a change in the definition of who is a resident, to deal with this particular problem. A joint standing committee looked at the issue in terms of how to address the problem of the abuse of the health system. It was a bipartisan committee that recognised that there were right across the board abuses of this system. People were taking from the Australian taxpayers all the subsidies and support. They came up with a number of recommendations and, in particular, recommended the definition of Australian residents be amended to prevent persons with temporary entry permits from gaining access to Medicare, subject to exceptions in specified cases such as temporary visas for asylum seekers. That is the background to this issue. What did the minister propose to introduce? 
This bill includes a requirement that the children of migrants who enter Australia under these new visas will, firstly, pay a $10,000 bond which would be refunded. It is not as though they will put it up and lose it. It will be refunded if the parents of the sponsors do not access the welfare system within the first 10 years of residency in this country. This bond replaces the $3,500 bond currently in place. They will accrue interest on that bond. If they do not access the system, they will get it back. Secondly, a $25,000 health services charge will be paid or private health insurance taken out to cover the parent for that 10-year period. The bill also removes the incentive for non-genuine applicants to lodge applications merely to gain access to the Medicare system for the period during which their applications are being processed. Basically, it makes parents responsible for the activities, welfare and health of their parents. Very often the Australian resident will say, `Yes, we are prepared to pay all the costs; we just want our parents here.' That is fine. But, when they actually arrive, they want their neighbours, people across the street and people in other suburbs to pay the costs. In other words we are saying, `That's fine. We will assist you by granting 4,000 visas but it is up to you to guarantee that you will provide the private medical health insurance and that you will also undertake this bond that will be refunded if it is not accessed.' I think it is eminently fair.  
The criticism that this is creating a visa system for the rich simply is not true because of the costs in reality that occur. The average health cost per year for persons over the age of 65 is $6,000. Over a span of 20 years that would multiply out to $120,000, which means that the parent who comes to Australia is still being subsidised by the Australian taxpayer; assisted by the government overall. So on the criterion of what is fair and equitable, this piece of legislation introduced by the minister for immigration establishes the balance between compassion and recognising that currently there are 20,000 parents of Australian residents on the list to come to Australia. On the other hand, it recognises the cost of $120,000 over the lifetime of the parents, a cost to the Australian taxpayer. This proposal provides the ability to establish a balance between the overall cost to the Australian community and the need to be able to reunite families. 
Of course members on this side of the House and I am sure all members of this parliament support the need for family reunions and the need for Australian residents to be able to bring out their elderly parents from wherever it may be in the world and to have the ability to care for them in the later years of their life. These changes are an attempt to recognise the long waiting lists that exist, the need to cover the costs for the Australian taxpayer and, overall, provide a balance which is a responsible way to go. These changes are in line with what the community would expect. It has been extensively discussed with various community groups, drawn from a range of countries, and the reaction is very positive. It is claimed by the Democrats that many people are opposed to it. That is not borne out by the research carried out by the department of immigration. This is what the community want; they want the ability to bring out their aged parents. They have asked for it in many ways. The department and the minister recognise that the length of the queues of those who are waiting to come to Australia is extensive, currently some 20,000 people. In making these changes it shows not only a government of compassion but also a government that is responsible in the economic management of this country.

Are all Australian governments contributing to a reduction in these costs, and if not, why?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Alcohol Abuse</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,question
"Wooldridge, Dr Michael, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in this matter. In a very recent article in the prestigious journal The Annals of Internal Medicine the cost of just hangovers in Australia was put at over $6.3 billion a year from lost productivity and illness. That is a very significant amount. In the 1998 household expenditure survey, 18 per cent of people admitted to having driven a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. The survey also showed that 30 per cent of people 14 years of age or older had been subject to verbal abuse by people who had been drunk; five per cent of people 14 years of age or older admitted to being subject to physical abuse from people who had been drunk. Beyond these immediate harms, there are much longer-term health costs of disease, premature death and substantial risk-taking behaviour.
The Commonwealth has a number of strategies where we are trying to address the issue of alcohol related harm in the community. There is a national alcohol action plan under way. We hope to complete it later this year. It is providing direction on a number of issues, particularly health and hospitality work force education and training, workplace alcohol policies and education, the needs of high-risk communities and populations, and the need for interventions to reduce alcohol related harm. Further, earlier this year, we launched two very successful commercials aimed at binge drinking amongst younger people to raise the awareness of choices in safe drinking. The National Health and Medical Research Council is releasing safe drinking guidelines. They are being prepared, and in fact this weekend will be sent out for further public consultation. 
The second part of the honourable member's question was: are all governments acting to promote these initiatives? I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the Western Australian, South Australian, Victorian and Tasmanian governments have been particularly responsible in this area. One of the most significant things that has happened in recent years—and I am actually prepared to give the opposition credit for something when they were in government—is the introduction of a differential rate on the taxation of beer. This was introduced in the 1988 budget. I remember it well because it was in the first days in this new Parliament House. In the budget night speech in 1988, the Treasurer, Mr Keating, said very clearly that the reform was designed to favour the consumption of lower alcohol beverages. The health minister, Neal Blewett, the following day in answer to questions expanded on this. He said:
... I regard it as a major advance in the taxation system of this country to establish for all time a taxation regime which distinguishes between low and high alcohol beer. I believe that now it is established and built into the system it will be maintained, and I believe that that has very positive health benefits.
In answer to another question on this matter, he went on to say:
... they will lead to a swing away from both the consumption and production of higher strength alcohol beers ....
The research has in fact borne this out. The drug and alcohol review in 1995, looking at Australia's harm minimisation policies, stated:
A reasonable assumption is that the observed downturn in the per capita consumption of alcohol in Australia has been contributed to by the introduction of differential strength beers and that to some degree the reduction in alcohol related morbidity and mortality in Australia can be similarly attributed.
So it has been very successful. For that reason it is immensely disappointing that the New South Wales government have announced that from 1 July they are in fact no longer going to subsidise low alcohol beer. This initiative, in place for over 12 years, has had very positive health effects for Australia on what is the second biggest preventable cause of illness in Australia. So while the Commonwealth government are working hard in this area, we cannot do things alone. We need to work cooperatively with state and territory governments. Most states are meeting their needs and their obligations in this public health area. New South Wales are not.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Alcohol Abuse</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,answer

—The honourable member for Blaxland asked me a question. I thought it was about petrol but it was about sunscreens and folate supplements.

I am very pleased to inform the honourable member that I have been able to find out. I can inform the House that the announcement of details of the GST status of sunscreens and folate supplements has been delayed due to a requirement of the Treasurer that the approval of all state and territory Treasurers be obtained. They were written to on 28 April, and we got the last response from the Queensland Treasurer on 19 June.

This week, Mr Speaker, you have disciplined some honourable members for disorderly behaviour. I respectfully ask you to consider that disruptive behaviour takes many forms.

",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER</title>,<title>Parliament: Behaviour in the House</title>,Questions to the Speaker,25,1,answer
"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I suppose I can anticipate, from the first dorothy dixer that the government obtained today for the Prime Minister, that there will be no prime ministerial participation in this debate, because the denial which he has been in and, I might say also, the denial of the Treasurer of their obligations—to ensure that people who are responsible for implementing their tax and paying it have absolute clarity before that tax is put in place—are to be answered by a simple reference to the number of queries they have received. As though a statement about the fact that millions have applied for an ABN, that 90,000 have attended meetings for explanations and that there have been 500 tax meetings around the country which have been attended by X, Y and Z numbers actually constitutes an answer to the fact that every single major business organisation, huge numbers of individual businesses and large numbers of consumers have been making sensible detailed requests of this government so they may know how they can operate risk free in the daunting new environment that confronts them, we get from the Prime Minister simply a set of slogans.
Patriotism is supposed to be the last refuge of the scoundrel, as can be seen in the bogus patriotism of the Prime Minister over the course of the last few weeks. His total explanation for where he now stands in relation to the GST does not answer questions from the Housing Industry Association, the Taxpayers Association or small business; he simply states, `No matter how bad you feel about all of this, no matter how bad you feel about the impact of it on your family, as far as I am concerned it is good for the country.' No evidence is presented for that point of view. None. Take a look at the macro figures that the Treasury put forward and what they anticipate for the economy. When this government came into office, it inherited four years of four-plus per cent annual growth from the previous Labor government. It missed out on a year of that, but we have had four per cent annual growth since. That was under a tax system described as `decrepit' and `in need of massive change'. The only macro figure we now have from the Treasury is that if we are lucky we will keep getting four per cent annual growth for the next three or four years but that it might be a bit less than that. So we will not find a `good for the country' answer in any of the macro figures that the Treasury has pointed out. 
So how else might we find a `good for the country' explanation? We might find the system `good for the country' if the business community were standing up and saying, `We have absolute clarity on this matter. We have total confidence about the way in which we will implement this. We know exactly what we are supposed to do, and we think that it is going to be very good for us to be able to do it.' The government has made a thing of what it regards as its small business constituency, and I would be the first to admit that the Liberal Party has enjoyed a massive preponderance of the votes of people who are in small business. In fact, in the last set of figures I saw, at the last election the Labor Party could count on the support of some 20 per cent of the people who are in small businesses around this country. However, what have we seen from small business in making their judgment on the administrative chaos that we referred to in the proposition which is being discussed as a matter of public importance today? What have we heard from them? These are small business people who have been able to secure Australian business numbers, who have been able to contribute to those thousands of telephone calls and who have been able to turn up to all of the business seminars which are supposed to have been conducted over the last six months. After they have applied for their numbers, after they have made their queries to the Taxation Office, after they have attended all the seminars that have been made available to them, after a period of four years of unprecedented growth under the Labor Party and three more years of similar growth under this government—what have they done? Remember, we are not in the middle of a recession. We are not in the middle of a major economic downturn. We are not confronting an economic collapse in Asia. We are not confronting a situation where the American economy or the European economy has gone to the bad. We find that the small business community records their lowest confidence position on record.
And what do they identify as the cause of this situation? The administration of the goods and services tax and the impact of it upon them. Let me go through this small business survey, which has become the authoritative paper on small business attitudes in this country, and its indicators. The goods and services tax continues to be the prime concern of small businesses across Australia. Almost one-third of small business proprietors nominated the GST as a problem for their business. On balance, small business proprietors continue to believe that the federal government's policies work against them. More than four out of 10 now believe that the policies work against them, compared with only 15 per cent who believe that government policies are supportive. The net negative 26 per cent is the worst assessment of federal policies since the government was elected. 
The survey also says that less than one quarter of small business proprietors believe the government is doing a good job in implementing the GST. More than one half believe it is doing a bad job, with most of those believing it is doing a very bad job in implementing the goods and services tax. This is from the people who employ 70 per cent of Australians. This is from the people who have become the government's new tax collectors. This is from the people who expected that their lives would be spent doing things that interested them, that made them money and that enabled them to employ people. Contrary to a promise that they would have 50 per cent of their red tape removed, they find themselves government tax collectors. But worse than being government tax collectors, they are government tax collectors in ignorance. Call after call is being made by small business. Plea after plea is being put forward by people in business, who are saying, `Will you give us answers to the specifics? When we ring the various hotlines, we get people telling us the general theory of the GST.' 
When you ask for private rulings, eventually you get some, but the rulings raise more questions. When you ask those questions, you get a different ruling. And when you ask your neighbouring business what ruling they have, it is a different ruling again. Over all of this is the understanding in small business that, if they get the answer wrong on all of this, hovering out there is somebody who might fine them $10 million and there is a Taxation Office that will prosecute them. In talking to small business, the Commissioner of Taxation is reduced to saying, `I know the law is potentially highly punitive, I know you can be in serious trouble on all of this, we know all these things, but don't worry—we'll go easy in the first few months.' That is the certainty with which they are expected to live: that they may find themselves in breach of the law, and all they have to rely on, after years and years of reports and struggles with the Taxation Office, is a promise to go easy for a few months as the system goes into place. 
The two people missing in action, in being out there giving an explanation of detail, have been the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and they are now in a tag team of avoidance of their own. The Treasurer is out of the country in the last week before it comes into place, when you would expect some final answers on a fair few things related to this, and then the Prime Minister is out of the country in the week it comes into operation. It is a tag team of avoidance of responsibility. The Treasurer in particular has been missing in action over the course of the last few weeks. Since he is in Paris, let us find the correct analogies. I think there are two. One is that of the Scarlet Pimpernel: `They seek him here, they seek him there, they seek the scoundrel everywhere. Be he in Heaven or be he in hell, that damned elusive Pimpernel.' What the Pimpernel was doing, of course, was saving a few aristocrats from the guillotine. 
And there is a direct relevance to our experience here. The only people in this community who are guaranteed that they are better off under the new taxation arrangements are high income earners. We have demonstrated in question time after question time that the Prime Minister's promise that Australia would be better off has simply misled them, and they understand it. There has been a massive shift in the obligation related to taxation on middle Australian families, and more and more Australian families are asking the question, `If this tax is supposed to be so good for us, if the economy is supposed to be so good, why don't I and my family feel that the pressures have been taken from us?' They will get no answers to that, in the same way as the new tax collectors get no answers from the Scarlet Pimpernel in Paris.
I suppose the second analogy is, since we are going to engage in matters French, Pepe Le Pew. In this case Pepe Le Pew could be seen as the GST itself—the skunk in the middle of the road that no-one wants to know. But there is always being pursued by Pepe Le Pew a Cheshire cat, and all that is left of the Treasurer in the final few days before the implementation of the GST is the Cheshire cat's smile. `Wish me luck as you wave me goodbye,' said the Treasurer as he went off to Paris. Remember that he evaded question time today when we wanted to know from him what he is doing on petrol; what he is doing for people who are going to get a huge, unexpected housing bill; and what is going to happen in a whole key set of areas of adult education. He is up and off—out, escaped. He had his myrmidons up there in the gallery yesterday saying, `Thank God the Prime Minister shut question time down yesterday. They can't get me before it all comes into place.' Straight out the door went the Treasurer, to leave the hapless Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, who is at the table, no doubt to flounder unmanfully, as he floundered unmanfully at the beginning of this year, with the questions that will have no answers until the court cases start to roll.
What we have got here is a Treasurer avoiding his responsibilities. Let us get this absolutely clear: that OECD meeting, at which Mr Fahey could well and truly have substituted for him if they chose to do it, begins on Monday, and there is another meeting on the Sunday prior to that. Inexperienced as I am in overseas travel, I do know that it does not take three days to get to Paris from here. But he got out of this question time and he got himself out of a couple of days worth of unhelpful questions from the Housing Industry Association, from the small business community, from the National Taxpayers Association, from those of our educators and trainers who still do not know which of their courses are going to be attracting the GST, from those with concerns in the health area about what precisely is being covered there and, of course, from those who want to know what exactly the position on fuel is going to be.  
Let me just say this: when something is to be announced after question time on Thursday afternoon, it is not good news. Good news travels with a large bevy of supporters at least an hour before question time; bad news arrives with the perpetrator out of the country an hour or two after question time. You can rely on that, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl. Mr Deputy Speaker has stood up, I might say, as the last ditch of integrity in the National Party on another issue on which we want a few answers too and have got no answers as far as this government is concerned. 
There is a symbol there on the Treasurer's departure, and that is the decision which has been taken—a decision by the National Party, a decision by the Democrats, a decision by the government—to finally abandon the most battling elements of the Australian community: those who live in boarding houses and those who live in mobile homes. These are in many cases the last bastion, if you like, of underprivilege in this country. They have been abandoned by all who said they would support them, but particularly abandoned by a government which will not face questions, abandoned by a government which will not answer questions. You see, we are no longer in policy debate, we are in administration, and it is a botched administration. No matter what claims may be made by the Prime Minister, it is a botched administration by everyone who has to deal with it.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—That speech says more about the Leader of the Opposition than it does about the government. 
Opposition members interjecting—
—I cannot identify any sense of humour there. If we want to deal with complexity, let us talk about complexity. I urge the members of the Labor Party to hang around and listen to this, because they should be aware of the sort of complex system they are seeking to defend. They are defending 11 payment systems that are currently in place under the wholesale sales tax system that the Labor Party wants to protect. That is a payment system covering provisional tax, company instalments, farm management deposits, pay as you earn, prescribed payments system, reportable payments system, TFN withholding, non-resident interest, dividend and royalties, mining withholding, natural resources withholding and withdrawals from Australian film industry trust fund accounts. Eleven payment systems under the Labor Party; one payment system under the new tax system from 1 July, known as pay as you go. Eleven payment systems for the Labor Party; one payment system under the coalition.
Under the Labor Party's system, there are 32 different payment periods for small and medium sized businesses. What does that mean for a small business? It means that a small manufacturing business needs to make at least 12 payments of tax instalments on behalf of employees, four income tax payments, 12 sales tax payments and perhaps four fringe benefits payments. Under the Labor Party there are 32 different payment periods and there are four under pay as you go with the coalition.
Let us talk about the multiple business numbers that a small or a medium sized business needs to have under the Labor Party's system. Under the Labor Party, you may need a PAYE registration number, an ACM which is an Australian company number, an ASFN which is an Australian super fund number, an ARBN which is an Australian registered bodies number, a wholesale sales tax number, a PPS which is a prescribed payments system number, an RPS which is a registered payments system number, and a company tax number. You need all those different numbers under the Labor Party. Under the coalition you need one—an ABN. That is not even taking into account payroll tax numbers, customs numbers and excise numbers.
The Labor Party talk about complexity but they are the mothers and fathers of a complex taxation system. They are the people who have built one of the most complicated taxation systems in the world. Despite what the Labor Party are saying at this moment to the people of Australia, the system that starts on 1 July will give the most significant respite from red tape that small business has ever had under a taxation system. The reason for that is that the coalition on this side of the House understands small business. If you cast around the ranks of the coalition, you will find vast experience of people being involved in business—business men and women who have rolled up their shirt sleeves and gone the hard yards trying to make a buck, without a guaranteed income, in order to feed their families. 
The Labor Party—which are seriously missing business experience, not just on the front bench but all across the back bench—come here and lecture us about the complexity of a taxation system. We have talked about complexity—32 different types of payment periods which are being rolled into four, 11 different payment systems being rolled into one and multiple business numbers being rolled into one. The coalition stands for a simpler taxation system. The Labor Party know all about complexity. If they come into this House, as they do, and seek to defend the current system, they should explain to small business how a single rate of GST is more complicated than seven different rates of wholesale sales tax. Tell me how that is more complicated for small businesses, particularly for importers and exporters? The Labor Party have zero per cent, 12 per cent, 22 per cent, 32 per cent, 37 per cent, 41 per cent and 45 per cent wholesale sales tax. That is the system which the Labor Party say is simple! The coalition is replacing it with a 10 per cent GST. Even if you are at a zero rate under the Labor Party, institutions wishing to apply to be wholesale sales tax exempt must fill in forms for assessment of eligibility. Even if you want a zero rate you have to fill in forms. Yet the Labor Party come into this House and claim that the new taxation system is more complex than the current taxation system.
The Leader of the Opposition did not use many facts in his speech. He simply gave us the traditional rhetoric about the coalition and what it was like under the Labor Party, claiming credit for all that great growth that Australia has had over the last few years. It is amazing how the Leader of the Opposition, who managed to oppose every significant measure of this government to try to put in place a stronger Australian economy, can come into this place and claim credit for 12 consecutive quarters of annualised four per cent growth or better—it defies logic. Did we hear him claim credit for the low unemployment rate in Australia at the moment? No. Did we hear him claim credit for the creation of  711,000 jobs over the last four years? No. He will try, but he did not. Did we hear him claim in this House that lower interest rates are a creation of the Labor Party? No. We did not hear him do that, just as we did not hear him claim that the Labor Party—and he would have been truthful about this, but he did not say it—were responsible for nine per cent inflation during the 1980s, and that the Labor Party were responsible for interest rates of 23 per cent in the 1980s and early 1990s. What does that do for small business—23 per cent? I see the member for Fremantle scoffing. The member for Fremantle would be familiar with small business. 
The Labor Party, who have no experience running businesses, come into this House in an unctuous manner and lecture the coalition about what is good for small business. They lecture us about the complexity of our taxation system and forget what legacy they left Australian small business—a legacy of high interest rates, high unemployment and a complex taxation system, and a legacy which left workers worse off in their wages and salaries. The Labor Party boasted about it as if it were some grand achievement that they managed to push down real salaries for the average Australian worker. 
During all of those years that the Labor Party were there, they lectured the coalition and they lectured the Australian people about how well they were doing for small business. The Labor Party were the greatest disadvantage to small business in Australia and the greatest burden that small businesses had to carry for more than a decade. If you look at the level of liquidations of small businesses in the late 1980s and early 1990s, any person who understands the challenge of thrift, the challenge of trying to make money and the challenge of starting up a business would cry with sympathy for small business and all the pain it had to endure under a Labor government. There is no remorse and there is no regret. The Labor Party come into this place question time after question time, MPI after MPI and bill after bill, pleading the case of small business, yet when they had the opportunity to sit on the treasury bench they ignored the plight of small business—in fact, they did small business in the eye. 
Do you know what scares us and scares Australian small business? There is one word: roll-back. Roll-back is the most intimidating term for small business. Let me tell you why. The words of the shadow Treasurer, the member for Hotham, Mr Crean, ring around this place in relation to roll-back. The member for Hotham on 2GB on 20 January 2000—and he has forgotten these words, but let me tell you that I have not forgotten his words—said to Stan Zamanek:
. . . and there will be anomalies in any system where you allow exemptions.
He goes on:
The wholesale sales tax was a graded scale. There were four, well there were seven, rates, but essentially there as a zero rate, there was 10 and there was 22 . . .
He forgot about the extra two per cent he jacked on back in 1993. He forgot about the 32 per cent rate, the 37 per cent rate, the 41 per cent rate and the 45 per cent rate. He goes on to say:
So basically—
Opposition member interjecting—
—It is very interesting that the honourable member raises food. Listen to the words of the member for Hotham:
So basically the wholesale sales tax applied to the necessities of life. I am sorry, the wholesale sales tax was off the necessities of life. It did not apply to food.
Zamanek: I am sorry, it did. It applied to biscuits, it applied to fruit juice, it applied to confectionery and those things. You would classify that as food, wouldn't you?
Crean: Yes, yes, you do, and there are anomalies in the system. Okay, I agree with that.
That was from the mouth of the member for Hotham—an acceptance that roll-back is going to crucify a simple system. Those words from the member for Hotham are obviously stating that the more roll-back you have, the more complex a taxation system becomes. Now we have the Leader of the Opposition, who is the chief proponent of roll-back, coming into this place and lecturing us about a complex taxation system when in fact the only policy that the Labor Party have at the moment is to make our current taxation system even more complicated.
Who bears the price of a complicated taxation system? It will start at small business and it will end up at consumers. Consumers, hardworking Australians, families, pensioners and disadvantaged Australians are ultimately those who will bear the cost of a complex taxation system. Yet the Labor Party come into this place and lecture us about complexity. They lecture us about the difficulties facing small business with a complex taxation system. I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the members of the Labor Party: if you are serious when you talk about the complexity of a taxation system, why don't you start telling us what roll-back really means?
We had the absurd situation where the member for Melbourne Ports stood in his place and asked a question of the Prime Minister about a rental property that had gone up, as I understand it, from $500 a week to $520. Unless I am missing something, it does not strike me that that property would be a caravan park residence, would it, for $520 a week? It would not be a boarding house, would it, at $520 a week? Therefore it would be input taxed. Rent is input taxed. If rent is input taxed, why have the Labor Party been arguing for the last three days for input taxation on caravan parks and boarding houses? The member for Melbourne Ports stood in his place and argued for input taxation on rents—
—No, he did not.
—This was a few days ago. He argued for input taxation on rents and today he asked about prices going up because of input taxation on rent. Is that not hypocrisy? The Labor Party are being hypocritical when it comes to these matters. The Labor Party are hypocritical when it comes to the complexity of taxation. The Labor Party are hypocritical when it comes to small business. On this side of the House we are doing the right thing.

"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—The Prime Minister in question time today described the GST changes as `the greatest tax reforms Australia has ever seen'. He went on to describe them as `a marvellous change' but he forgot to mention that we are actually going to have a $24 billion new tax imposed on this country and $12 billion worth of tax cuts. By any reckoning, that is certainly a momentous change. If it is so good, why has the Treasurer already flown the coop? He has gone off to Paris, and the Prime Minister is soon to follow. It strikes me that they do not want to be here to see the results of their handiwork. The Prime Minister also said today that this taxation system was designed to help the Australian community. Frankly, that is help we could do without. It has already had the opposite effect, as the Leader of the Opposition clearly illustrated. What we should do as a result of this tax system that was designed to help the Australian community is to sack the designer—one John Winston Howard.
I think a lot of people are now wondering if the Treasurer's name should actually be `Peripatetic Pete'. He has run away at a critical time in the implementation of this tax. I am afraid that my mind works a bit like that of the Leader of the Opposition because we both thought of the Cheshire cat when preparing for today's MPI. All that is left of the Treasurer, too, is that smirk. He is escaping the country now, leaving Australians to navigate the blind maze that he and the Prime Minister have designed and inflicted on us. Despite having spent over $431 million to try and sell us a dodgy map of that maze, they have only succeeded in confusing everyone, themselves included, judging from the performances in question time over recent months. The GST jumble has rendered this Treasurer incoherent. You only had to listen to him on AM yesterday. The detail is really chaining him up. But it is not his heart that needs to be unchained; it is his brain. We have seen impossibly complex legislation before this House. We have seen a raft of rulings and amendments. There are a lot that are still incomplete. While everyone is waiting for these details—some of which will be emerging this afternoon, we are told—the Treasurer is winging his way to Paris.
I acknowledge the member for Rankin—I am pleased to see he is sitting nearby—for some of the following statistics. We were supposed to get a fairer and simpler system. It was designed to sweep away the old-fashioned complex wholesale sales tax. We heard from the minister at the table a while ago of the sins of the old tax system. Of course the reverse is true. We on this side have always known that the GST is unfair. That is why we have opposed it. But it has been compounded by the income tax and benefit changes which further attack the least well off. It is now obvious even to the most blind adherents to the government's line that it is also devilishly complex. Far from being fairer and simpler, it is more unfair and more complex. We had an admission of that kind from the minister just a little while ago. We are told the tax bill and the amendments weigh nearly seven kilograms. That is pretty simple. There are 1,466 amendments so far—and still counting; there are more to come. The Business activity statement for business owners is a 148-page manual and I am sure most tax agents now have bookshelves full of instructions which change from week to week. I know we have a lot in our electorate offices, too. There is a similar complexity in the not-for-profit sector.
Already there are around 20,000 requests for private binding rulings and there are dozens of public rulings outstanding. We had questions about those today and we got some limited commitments; I will return to that in a minute. Around this we have had misleading information and confusion, questions left unanswered and critical decisions delayed. Just this week we finally got information on which foods were in and which foods were out of the GST. They are inconsistent and irrational, and mystifying distinctions are made. There are six types of yoghurt to start with, some in and some out. A lot of information has been deliberately withheld and has had to be squeezed out of the Treasurer drop by drop. On issues like inflation, even the government's own estimates have doubled. We were told by the minister who took part in this debate earlier that no price would rise by more than 10 per cent. We now know that the ACCC was not even instructed and certainly has no power to keep price rises below 10 per cent. We were also told that many prices would be cheaper. We have now found that even in areas like motor vehicles that is not likely to be so. The real price rises are starting to emerge. Even the comparison between the ACCC's and the government's price lists is instructive. They are all higher, and the closer we get to 1 July the higher the prices get. We were told there would not be any taxes on taxes. Just have a look. There is GST plus stamp duty across the board. Promises on beer have been broken. Draft beer prices will rise dramatically. This has been described by one of my constituents in an email to me today as a `lowdown sneaky act'. I must say I agree with him. And we all know that permanent residents in caravan parks and boarding houses are going to be well off! 
We have had a little package introduced today. The pressure was obviously building, courtesy of the National Party. But it is not going to help self-funded retirees and it is not very much for the rest. We have had revelations about the real increases in rents—at least double what the Treasurer said, and maybe higher. It is no wonder that he has skipped the country. He probably thought that he could keep the results of that modelling under wraps until 1 July and then sic the ACCC onto the landlords, blaming them. Of course on petrol prices we were told it would be cheaper—and lower transport costs have indeed been assumed in the government's modelling of the GST impact. We still do not have a decision—although we might have one after question time today—on what the cuts to the fuel excise will be. The price is already over 100c a litre in some parts of the country. And we have no maps of where the rebates will apply. We might get them this afternoon. Pity the poor service station owners who have to work this all out with only a few working days to go between now and the introduction.
I want to deal briefly with the treatment of health and education. Until today we have not had the critical determination on public health goods including folates, sunscreens and the like. Now we have actually got it. It has been weaseled out of the government today—again just a few working days from 1 July. But if you look at the determination that came out in question time today it is clear that they have to name every single brand and type of paracetamol that is on the market, one by one. That means that every time there is a new brand or a new type, that will require a separate determination. That is complexity for you. Things such as condoms, folates, sunscreens and personal lubricants all have to have an ARTG number—a therapeutic goods listing number—as at 1 July. In other words, if a new product comes onto the market on 2 July it is outside the determination. Apparently the government have conceded to the industry that this determination is flawed. But they still brought it into this House today. They know it is flawed, and they bring it into the parliament today.
—And only when we raise it.
—Yes. And you can expect a new determination in the break. I think that is a fair bet.
—If you want any more, get it to us next week.
—We will do our very best to work some of these things out between now and then. In addition to this failure to make a health determination until just now, a lot of health costs that are clearly legitimate are going to be hit by the GST. We were told there would be no GST on health. Tampons and sanitary pads, breast pumps and baby products, creams for serious skin diseases like psoriasis and eczema, which is suffered by over a million Australians, and of course complementary medicines in total were supposed to be GST free and are not. They were formerly sales tax exempt. Services of many therapists and counsellors will attract the GST and membership subscriptions to bodies like Diabetes Australia will be socked for the GST, while high rollers—gamblers—will be GST exempt. Many of the rulings that have been made to date have already created an administrative nightmare for doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. To give an example which is one of many, the February ruling means that hospitals will have to pay 10 per cent extra for visiting medical officers. They are contracted to the hospital. Then the hospitals will have to make monthly claims to be reimbursed for the GST paid and not recovered from public patients, so they will have to divide it up into public and private sector. The doctors will have to collect the GST and pay it to the tax office. And health was meant to be GST free! That is very amusing. 
In education there are some very similar problems. With nine days to go—again, this was confirmed at question time—and six working days to go there are still no rulings on adult, community and further education. Clearly, some providers are charging for them. They do not have a lot of choice. It is a nightmare for second semester TAFE enrolments, for example. What are they supposed to do? We asked questions about whether there was a 10 per cent tax on English language courses, Asian and European courses. The minister did not seem to know exactly. He thought they should be doing something but he was not sure what it was. 
There are whole lot of education costs that are being imposed by the GST, particularly in the area of compliance. There are going to be impacts across the board that no-one has even anticipated. So while the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are disporting themselves around Europe, taking in the sights of Paris and London—in the Treasurer's case he probably will not bother with the escargots because he can get them GST free when he comes back to Australia—the rest of Australia will not only have to pick up the tab for their travel but also have to try and negotiate their way through the mire that is the GST. And all for what, exactly? (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Administration Chaos</title>,Matters of Public Importance,27,1,speech
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2000-06-22,"—In nine days time the largest cuts in income tax ever will come into force in Australia. On 1 July every taxpayer will receive an income tax cut. Eighty per cent of Australians, some now on top rates of 43 per cent, will pay a top rate of income tax no higher than 30 per cent. The government is introducing $12 billion in tax cuts by providing assistance worth more than $2.4 billion per year to around two million families and by providing a wealth of assistance to people on social security, to self-funded retirees and to pensioners. 
As an integral part of the new system every taxpayer will receive personal income tax cuts from 1 July 2000, unlike the Keating l-a-w law promised tax cuts in 1993. Did they deliver those promised tax cuts? No, instead they put wholesale tax up and put it on products that had never had a wholesale sales tax. Fuel went up 7c a litre. In the 13 years of Labor, excise on fuel increased from 7c to 34c a litre. They also linked the excise to indexation. A very `simple' system indeed! I guess that did not create administrative chaos because no-one knew about it. It just created chaos. You could not ask questions because the opposition, who was in government at the time, dishonestly hid all of these obscene tax burdens on all of the people of Australia—no questions, no answers. We just had to pay. 
We are about lifting this hidden obscene burden of payments off all Australians. In doing so we are giving the assistance that is required, the assistance that was never given to businesses or consumers when Labor introduced their paper warfare when they were in government. This outdated, unfair and largely hidden paperwork war has been replaced by this: one page with two sides. Yes, one page. For the information of the opposition, this is called a `business activity statement'. You see this one page? And you speak of administrative chaos. What a joke! This one page replaces up to 32 different returns. This one page is submitted around four times per year instead of up to 32 times per year. But, then, I suppose we should excuse the members of the opposition for being confused and for not understanding how to administer something so simple as this double-sided piece of paper because they have never had administrative experience. So I guess we should not expect that they would have administrative experience now. 
The members of the Labor Party may show their ignorance. However, the one thing I do resent as a business woman for the last 24 years is that they have so terribly defamed and underestimated the capacity of the intelligent businessmen and women and consumers out there in the real world. Most members on the opposition benches do not run a business. Because they have not had that experience of filing the returns and fulfilling the requirements of business that they placed on us and consumers when they were in government, they sincerely do not understand the simplicity of this one business activity statement. Get a load of it, fellows—just one double-sided piece of paper.  
The benefits of the new tax system cannot be ignored, even by the partisan Labor Party. This MPI refers to the responsibility of the government for the `administrative chaos surrounding the GST'. What a joke. This shows the opposition's ignorance, the Labor Party's ignorance, of business and conducting business. There is no chaos within this government. Let us take one department just off the top of our heads. The Department of Family and Community Services are right on schedule for implementation. This means that the pensioners and the allowees will receive the four per cent increase to their payments from July, more older Australians will be entitled to a pension for the first time, families will receive the increased rates of families assistance from July and older Australians will benefit from the timely implementation of the savings bonuses. A number of older Australians have already returned their claim forms for the savings bonuses and they will start receiving their bonuses from early July. The 550 family assistance offices across Australia will be open from 3 July, giving Australian families improved services, higher rates of assistance and greater access to health. The conversion of Australian families from the existing Family Assistance Scheme to the new family tax benefit is on schedule and will deliver improved services and benefits to Australian families. By not supporting the new tax system, the Labor Party is against increases in family allowance, increased assistance for single income families, increased assistance for families with children, a changing Commonwealth-state tax treatment, a great tax for states, increases for pensions and income tax cuts. The list goes on.
Families will have their benefits increased as part of the largest overhaul of family assistance ever—and the opposition stand for families! These changes will give families more disposable income to outweigh any price rises from the goods and services tax. The new tax system introduces one of the largest structural changes to the Australian economy—probably the largest since the Second World War. And guess what? This government, the businesses and the consumers out there in the real world have been able to handle it. However the opposition, because of their lack of real term experience, cannot. So they just assume that everyone else is in the same position. Well, sorry, guys. Sorry about that, but the business world and the consumer are ahead of you in paces. Well done business world and consumer! 
As at 15 June, 150,000 advisory visits have been requested of which over 120,000—that is over 85 per cent—have been finalised. What a great job these field officers do when they come to your business! I know, because my family business is one of those 120,000 businesses that have taken advantage of this great service offered by this great government. On the government's web site the average hits per day number 683,204. Our kit titled `Moving from PPS'—that is, prescribed payment system—`to PAYG' will be sent out to the 670,000 prescribed payment system payers and payees. The tax office is in town conducting tax reform business education and information sessions across the nation. These are extremely successful. I have conducted many of those across my electorate of Riverina in conjunction with the tax office, and I would highly recommend them to the opposition. Work in conjunction with the Taxation Office, fellas, and maybe that will finally help you to understand administration and what it is all about—something you have never been able to quite click with.
Every dollar raised by the goods and services tax is paid to the state and territory governments. All of those additional taxes will put money into schools, hospitals, police and the roads of the future. As far as our state of readiness goes, we are ready with 2.7 million applications for ABNs, a large proportion for GST and over 2.3 million calls to the tax reform info lines; and businesses sought and received from the ATO nearly 12 million publication booklets and fact sheets. Man, they are ready! I wonder just how many of the opposition have sought all of this information to have themselves ready. They are not interested. With over 90 million hits to the ATO's tax reform web site and with millions of publications being downloaded, we have had an enormous response to our implementation of a new tax system. The result of recent surveys on business readiness have highlighted how the business community has been preparing for the GST. Last month a Morgan and Banks survey found that 94 per cent of businesses were ready for GST—they are ahead of the opposition—and Morgan and Banks also found that 75 per cent of businesses felt that the GST presented no major disruption to their business. A similar survey last month by Dun and Bradstreet also found that over 90 per cent of businesses were either moderately or very well prepared for the GST. (Time expired)

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I rise to speak on the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2000 and the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000. I want to start by saying that both of these bills are a great disappointment to me and that they will be a great disappointment to many migrant families living in Australia—people who are Australian citizens and people who are Australian residents. It will be a great disappointment because, at the heart of it, these bills are not about trying to resolve an issue or fix a problem or somehow trying to do something good or better for the community. At the heart of these bills are very mean, very nasty, very un-Australian and very punitive measures. I do not believe the intent of the bills is based on equity or on good policy; in fact, quite the opposite.
The bill is highly discriminatory and based on discriminatory ideals. It makes immigration matters more complicated. It prevents and works against family reunion. It also prevents better access to medical services and Medicare. Worst of all, it is based on a very deep and personal failure by this government and this minister to fully understand what they should be doing for migrant families. There is a whole range of related matters. What disappoints me most is the government's failure to understand that parents are an essential part of a family. This is a totally draconian bill. I searched through the bill very closely for a positive outcome—for something that families could look forward to and say, `Here's something we could use. Here's something that will be better for us, for our family and for our parents—something that will do something for the country.' But it is quite the opposite. This bill makes it more difficult—it is about prevention. I am very disappointed in the bill.
At the heart of the bill are the charges for visa applications. Currently there are charges for visa applications. We on this side of the House do not shirk our responsibilities. We say there is a mutual obligation—that people applying should pay a fee and contribute to our health system and to a whole range of systems—but I think most reasonable people would believe that that charge should be something that is affordable, equitable and in the ballpark of what families can afford. There is no use sticking a fee on to draw a line that says, `Nobody will get over that one; let's just see how high we can make that bar.' This bill takes the visa application fee and associated levies and bonds—wait for this; this is how much you will have to fork out or put on your credit card or see your loans manager about, if you have one—to $64,000. When people walk in, they will be told, `We'd like a fee with that application.' The response would be, `Sure, not a problem. How much is that—$25, $30, $100, $1000?' They will be told, `No, sorry. For your parents, it will be around $64,000,' to which the response may be, `Okay, well I might have to go and see my manager about a second mortgage on the home or I might have to sell the home,' if they are lucky enough to have one. Or, `We will just have to take out a loan for that sort of money.' I do not know how many people have a lazy $64,000 sitting under the bed. Obviously that fee is for a couple—it is not that expensive for a single person. If one of your parents has, unfortunately, passed away and you want to bring over the surviving parent to give them some quality of life and to spend some time with them before they also pass away, the fee that you would have to put forward would be $35,000. I am sure people listening to this are saying, `No, the member must be mistaken. This fee of $35,000 cannot be right.' But it is right. I am not mistaken. This is what this government and this minister want to charge people applying for visa applications to get their parents here. 
We are not talking about some exclusive class of people. I know that the minister, in a previous bill that was rejected by the Senate, had a `Rolls Royce' class of visa application which was substantially less, but that one was rejected by the Senate. It did not make it through. I think that one was about $17,000, but in quite a nasty fashion now, they are saying, `We'll just make it $35,000 or $64,000.' It is totally untenable. The government and the minister try to explain this by saying that it is to recover costs, that it is about making people pay for services they will use in the future if we let them into the country. They say that the deal is quite simple: if you want to pay this sort of money to get the visa, you can either put up-front $35,000 for a single to the government for medical services into the future, or you can take out a private health insurance scheme for a period of 10 years, for which you must pay up front. So all of this is about up-front fees.
Everywhere we look, everywhere we turn, every time we see a policy of this government, it is about up-front fees. It is about making it more difficult. It is not about equity, it is not about trying to make the world a better place, which I thought was the job we were supposed to be doing here; it is about making it harder, it is about making it inequitable, it is about making it only available to those few in the world and in Australia who can afford those sorts of fees. How many people migrating to Australia will come from those sorts of wealthy backgrounds where it could be expected they would have that sort of money spare? I am sure there will be some people—I do not say there will not be any—who will take every avenue given to them because of what it means to have their parents with them. They will take absolutely every single avenue to raise that sort of money, at their cost. They will suffer, they will miss out. Their children will suffer; their children will miss out. Their families will go without so they can get their parents over here. I think that is a very admirable thing to do, but is it reasonable that we expect them to do that? I do not think it is. Maybe the minister should come in and explain how he sees that a family missing out on a whole range of things is somehow a fair thing, because that is what would happen to them with this sort of debt burden on their heads. Who can afford this?
There was, a little time ago, a provision to `queue jump'. I know people get offended by that because there are a lot of bad connotations around queue jumping, but I will come back to that in a moment. If there are 20,000 parents sitting on a waiting list, and at the current intake rate is 500 a year, which is very generous on behalf of the government, it will take, at a guess, about 40 years for people to have their parents come to Australia under this government's legislation. Does it seem reasonable? It certainly does not seem reasonable to me. Imagine asking those families it affects, `Whereabouts on the list are you?' and their response is ` I'm 18,548.' So what is it going to take? Say, 30 years? How many people expect in 30 years their parents still to be with them?
Where does this government and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs get off trying to purport to actually improve things in this bill by actually putting forward those sorts of policies and regulations? As I said earlier, it is about making things more difficult. It is about inequity. It is about discrimination. Everything that is contained in this bill is highly offensive. Worst of all, it is completely antifamily. It is antifamily at its very core. As I have said many times in this House, all of the government's policies are, at their core, antifamily. You can dress them up as tax and call it a GST. Have a close look at that system and ask: what is at its core? Who does it hurt the most? Who benefits and who does not benefit? At its core, it hurts families. In my view, that is an antifamily policy, an antifamily bill or antifamily legislation. And there is a whole range of others in education and in health. I will touch briefly on health because it is directly related to this bill in terms of the up-front fees that are charged. 
People will have to make that final decision before 1 July as to whether they opt into the private health insurance scheme. Of course, if they do not opt in, they effectively become locked out. They become locked out because of the punitive measures applied by the government to exclude them. It is not a bill that includes; it excludes. If you do not join a private health fund before 1 July, for every year you do not join you pay a two per cent penalty and you pay for whatever your age is—not at the 30-year rate that is currently available. Let us say that you are 30 and out of what is a sustenance budget—you are living week to week; you do not have a lot of spare cash—you simply cannot afford that extra $120, $140, $180 or $200 a month to get private health cover and you say, `We just can't afford it as a family; so we are just going to have to miss out.' That is what this government's scare campaign is telling everyone: `Run for cover because if you don't you're going to miss out on cover; you won't be covered.' That is what the ads tell people. But, of course, that is not the truth. In 10 years time you might be a little better off and you might think, `Now the timing is right; I might go out there and contribute to the private health system,' and join. But why would you? You are going to be slugged for your age and you are going to be slugged two per cent for every year you were not there: 10 times two—20 per cent. You will be slugged 20 per cent on top, not because you do not want to belong but because the government have prevented you from belonging—they have excluded you from the system. So the intent of that legislation is not to include people. There has been a rush of people—huge figures, as we are told by the minister. Unbelievable. Last week alone, 20,000 people joined MBF. That is fantastic, and I applaud them. But, at the end of the day, we still have 68 per cent—two-thirds of all Australians—who are not covered and, because of the government's legislation, will probably never be covered because they are prevented and excluded under the current system.
The same principle applies to this bill. It is about excluding people; it is not about including people whatsoever. We would argue that offsetting costs to the government is a good thing; it is something that the government should look to. We are not saying that we oppose all of the principles. We recognise mutual obligation, and I think there should be a contribution, but people do contribute and they do pay. Currently, the figure for a couple is around $8,000. Personally I think that is a lot of money, but I think it is a reasonable figure. I think it is a figure that we can work with. While it will cost families dearly—if you are just going to chuck $8,000 on the Bankcard, then it is going to hurt—they will do it because they want their parents to come here. Of course, the opportunity to do it does not really exist anyway because we have 20,000 people sitting in a queue with a most generous—and I say that as sarcastically as I can—500 a year. That will take 40 years. And people are expected to have confidence and hope and sit at home and think, `We should be thankful that there is a program at all.' I do not think that is what they think. They are probably saying—and they have said it to me—that it is cruel and nasty and they cannot see the intent. But, as I explained earlier, I think we know the intent and the purpose, and it is nasty and it is very un-Australian. 
Australia was built on the backs of many immigrants. Many people came to this country to find a better place, and they did: they found a much better place, a fairer and more equitable society, a society that actually cares. But we are now seeing this slow pernicious creeping in of bills such as this that cut at the very core of our values and our culture without taking into  consideration the culture of others. Some people might say, `Why does that matter? Why should we worry about the culture of others?' What about your own culture? How important are your parents to you? How important is it to have your parents with you? They can make life a bit easier for you. They can help you with child care. That would actually reduce the burden on the government—less in child-care subsidies; I am sure the government would be happy about that. They could perhaps give a family a bit more time, a better quality of life—a whole range of things. I think it would actually work in the national interest to encourage family reunions. I think it is a good thing to try to keep families together. I cannot see how preventative measures would be a better thing.  
But I know what the minister is going to say. He will say, `This is not about prevention; this is actually about getting people off that queue'—20,000 people at 500 a year, 40 years—`let's get them off that queue.' I said earlier on that I would talk about that word that I do not particularly like to use, and I use it very sparingly—that is, queuejumpers. The government has made a very big issue of attacking anybody who comes to this country, be they refugees, asylum seekers or others—some illegally—and saying, `Queuejumpers are not welcome; queue jumping is wrong.' I agree with the minister: people should not jump queues. You are right, Minister: people should not jump queues. You have said it many times, and it seems to be at the core of some of the policies that you are putting forward—and for that you should be applauded. But suddenly we see a backflip on queue jumping. Suddenly it is okay. The rules of the game are still the same except they have been changed in one bit—that is, it is okay to queue jump as long as you have $64,000. You cannot queue jump if you are poor; you can queue jump only if you are wealthy. That makes sense, doesn't it? Is that the intent here? `Queue jumping is a terrible, nasty evil thing, and Australia should do everything it can to prevent people queue jumping. Australia should do everything it can to protect its borders and shores. But we'll make it okay to queue jump—not a problem—as long as you've got plenty of money.' What else are we going to see come out of this? Are we going to see queue jumping of other varieties based on the fact that if you are wealthy you can forget about everything else that the government has said, you can queue jump?
I want to touch on the so-called contribution that this money will make towards the health system. Minister, I am sure you understand the private health system and Medicare very well, so you understand that whether you are in the private health system or not in the private health system, Medicare—which is for all Australians, which is paid for by all Australians—still picks up the tab. So it is not as if by joining a private health scheme—whether it be under this legislation or otherwise—suddenly it is a replacement, something different, something exclusive. No, it is not. It is the same thing because the government—that is, the taxpayer—still picks up the tab. Plenty of people who have private health cover do not necessarily always use private hospitals. Sometimes they use the public system because, if it is an emergency, no-one will drive you down the road to the private hospital if you are lucky enough to have one near where you live, but they will take you to the public hospital because that is where emergencies are handled. Although I could, I will not dwell too long on these issues. At the heart of this, those issues are not addressed. I think it is false economy and I think it is based on the wrong principles.
Also I want to touch briefly on the matter of where the fee may have come from. Why is it $25,000 straight up, up-front? In the Senate estimates this was pursued, but the best we could get was Mr Farmer admitting that the department did not have an answer and that they needed time to find one. That was the best we could get after a fair bit of questioning about how they got this figure. They just plucked it out of the air—you know, times this by that, divide by half, multiply by four, take 20 per cent. Why $25,000? Why didn't you just make it $55,000 or $65,000? Where do you draw the line? Obviously not at an affordable mark in the sand; just at a mark where you set the bar just so high that it excludes, because that is what this does. You will not have a huge rush or a huge take-up, but again I do not believe the government wants that. That is not what it is about. They are trying to pander to someone by saying, `Look, we are trying to do something but in the end we are not really trying at all.' 
Although I do not normally do this, while the minister is here I want to raise a particular case with him regarding a particular constituent of mine and about how efficient the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs is. I have a case involving a Miss Aida Laurio Del Fabbro from the Philippines who is married to an Australian. She made an application to come and join her husband here. It is now 12 months since the application was made but to this day they are still frustrated in getting the department to actually make a decision. It is not as simple as the department just not having done their job; there is a health issue involved. A government sponsored doctor in the Philippines made an error and did not diagnose properly and so has caused a bungle. I think the minister should pay pretty close attention to this issue and actually fix it because it has been 12 months.

"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—These bills before us today, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000 and the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2000, are an important part of the government's program to have an orderly and efficient migration program that does not put an undue burden on the Australian community. They follow a trend commenced under the Labor government to reign in the costs some migrants place on the Australian community. From 1982, migrants to Australia have had to provide assurance of support for periods varying between three, five and 10 years. By 1988, seven per cent of migrants subject to this assurance of support defaulted on their assurances and received special benefits of approximately $9 million and $7 million in unemployed benefits. Because of the mounting cost and financial burden of new arrivals, in 1991 the AOS period was reduced from five to two years. Government liability for social security payments was restricted with a stricter means tests on assurers and improved debt recovery liaison. As part of these measures, the then Labor government introduced a bond of $3,500 for the principal applicant and $1,500 for each adult dependant to cover possible social security payments. At the same time the Social Security Act was amended to impose a non-refundable charge of $822 to offset part of the costs associated with medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits. It was to be paid in addition to the Medicare levy. These actions by the then Labor government were supported by the coalition, both government and opposition acknowledging that some of the non-refugee arrivals were placing an unfair burden on the Australian community. 
However, the cost of new arrivals to Australia has continued to rise and negatively impact on the budget. Of particular cost to the Australian community are parents and grandparents who migrate to Australia from overseas. Older immigrants place high costs on the economy. Parents and other aged relatives are the only category of migrants for whom costs to the budget increase over time rather than decrease. They draw on social security and other health and welfare services without themselves having contributed to the tax system. This extra burden on Australia's welfare system is occurring at the same time as Australia's population is ageing and the pressure on the health and welfare budgets is increasing. The cost of immigration of aged parents is not just a problem in Australia, although Australia does have a much more generous welfare system than many other countries. A study based on comparable US data estimated that for every 1,000 parent entrants the cost to Australia's welfare system would exceed $1.5 billion. Similarly, a study by DIMA estimated that the cost of health care, residential care and social security payments for parent entrants was approximately $48,000 for males and $78,000 for females. 
In government, Labor recognised the economic problem posed by sponsored parents and, as a result of Labor policies, the number of sponsored parents declined from 11,600 in 1988-89, to 5,300 in 1992-93 and to 5,100 in 1994-95. It was the clear intention of the then government to reduce the number of sponsored aged parents. However, there was a blow-out in 1995 of 8,900 and this remained high in 1996-97 at 7,600. The costs to the Australian public were substantial. By January 1998 there were 52,970 migrants aged 55 years and over with less than 10 years residence receiving social security support at a cost of $400 million per annum. In response to burgeoning costs, in 1997-98 this government introduced a cap for parent visas, with the number of aged parents being able to enter Australia as migrants being capped at 1,000. As a result of the cap, a queue formed for aged persons wanting to come as permanent residents to Australia on a parent visa.
The minister has indicated that there are currently over 20,000 in the application pipeline and I understand that this pipeline is growing at a rate of 400 persons per month. To reduce this queue, in October 1998, by regulation, the minister provided 4,000 more spaces for aged parents by increasing the one-off fee of $940 to $5,000 per adult applicant to cover health costs. Assurance of support bonds were increased from $3,500 to $4,000 for the main applicant and from $1,500 to $2,000 for each additional applicant. Assurers were required to demonstrate that they had the financial capacity to meet their obligations, the money to be refundable after two years, with interest, if social security benefits had not been accessed. By March 1999, 2,200 people had applied to enter Australia under the scheme. These regulations were disallowed in the Senate on 31 March 1999. On behalf of the Democrats, Senator Andrew Bartlett then said: 
Those people who can afford the increased amounts ... get into the fast lane.
The Democrats feel the changes open Australia's immigration law up to the charge of being more directed toward the rich and discrimination against the poor and underprivileged.
Senator Bartlett provided the other place with an analogy based on movie or sports queues where people with money were able to go to the front of the queue. `It does not happen in Australia,' the senator said. It was not, the senator concluded, desirable policy in Australia. I can only wonder where the Democrats—and by implication the Labor opposition—have been for the last few years. Not only can people with money get into the front of a queue for a cultural and sports events in Australia; they are the only ones in the queue today in Australia. The egalitarian Labor government in New South Wales has deemed $1,382 a fair price for ticket to the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, laughingly entitled `the people's games'.
I am not advocating that migration policy should be undertaken on the same basis as sports policy. I seek only to point out that Senator Bartlett's analogy was false and that indeed, contrary to his assertion, the poor are discriminated against in Australia in both sport and culture. And, I might say, in every other way. There has never been a society like this where people in the lower socioeconomic sections have equal access to the same benefits as those with a greater income. Indeed, our business migration policy reflects that—a policy supported by the Labor opposition. On behalf of the Labor opposition, in the disallowance debate, Senator Schacht said that Labor was disallowing the regulations because they discriminated against poorer applicants. The argument has been reiterated today with this bill, and I will address that argument later.
The rejection of the October 1998 regulations made it impossible for the government to conduct migration policy that was both compassionate and financially responsible. Faced with increasing migration of elderly parents, and the financial reality that a person over 65 could be expected to cost the Commonwealth $120,000 in health costs over an estimated lifespan of 20 years and $160,000 for special benefits and pensions, the minister reduced the aged parent cap to 500. The minister has now provided an opportunity for debating the whole issue of migration of aged persons by introducing the present bill into the House. This bill proposes a contingency reserve of 4,000 non-working parents to enter under a new visa class that has an extended period of assurance of 10 years instead of the normal two and an AOS bond of $10,000 for the initial applicant and $4,000 for each additional applicant. The bond is refundable after 10 years, plus interest and minus any welfare benefits. Applicants also have the choice of taking out private health insurance or paying an up-front service charge of $25,000 per person. In his second reading speech, the minister pointed out that this represents one-fifth of the potential health cost of an individual. There are other initiatives in the bill, including removing access to Medicare from parent visa applicants who are in Australia temporarily while their permanent visas are being assessed. However, I do not intend to canvass these initiatives at this time. Instead, I will address the principle of the legislation and the actions of the Labor Party in opposing the bill.
Firstly, the opposition claim they have no disagreement with the principle of the bill. They could hardly claim otherwise as it was the Labor Party who introduced the principle of AOS and the health guarantee into the migration program. It is indeed their principle. I am reminded of the old joke of the gentleman—I think this was a joke of Bernard Shaw's actually—who asks a woman if she will come to dinner with him if he gives her a million dollars. She replies, `Yes, of course,' and he says, `But will you come if I give you one dollar?' She says, `No, what do you take me for?' He says, `Madam, we know what you are. We are only haggling over the price.' I thank my colleague from Western Australia, the member for Moore, for acknowledging the joke with a laugh. 
My colleague the member for Cook asked the shadow minister what would be an appropriate charge for migrants who had never contributed to this country and who would never contribute but who would take from it welfare and health benefits paid for by others. Perhaps the Labor member who follows me would like to answer that question, for it is incumbent on the opposition to let us know. If they are genuine in supporting the principle of the bill, we need to know how they would change it to make it acceptable. The AOS and health charge is currently one-fifth of the potential cost of an elderly migrant. Would the ALP accept a sixth, an eighth or a tenth? Why is the AOS that the government has tried to introduce in 2000 so much more onerous than the AOS and health charge introduced by Labor in the 1980s, and what is the ALP's alternative? The bottom line is that someone has to pay. The question for the opposition today is: is it the Australian taxpayer, is it the migrant and the people who benefit from that migrant's presence, their children, or is it a combination of the two? If it is the Australian taxpayer, then the opposition is asking for an increase in taxes, a reduction in welfare benefits for other Australians or a budget deficit. Perhaps the member for Prospect would like to let us know. If it is the beneficiaries, then the cost to them would be much greater than the cost the government has proposed, and those taking up the visas would be an extremely wealthy and limited cohort indeed. If it is the third alternative, we are back with the government policy—shared responsibility—and back to the question of how to apportion the share. Four-fifths to the Australian taxpayer and one-fifth to the migrant and their beneficiaries seems more than fair in my view.
The truth is that this is not really a matter of ALP policy versus coalition policy. In government, the ALP would pursue exactly the same policy. It is amazing that the ALP in government and the ALP in opposition can be such different creatures. In government, the ALP sold the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. It sold the Moomba pipeline and it sold the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. In opposition, it opposes the sale of Telstra. In government, the ALP reduced car tariffs from 57 per cent to 15 per cent. In opposition, it opposes a continuation of its own policy of a 2½ per cent reduction each year. In contrast, the coalition sought to contribute to good government when it was in opposition. When we opposed something, it was on a matter of principle. I sat in those party rooms and I heard principle discussed. There was never a time when we opposed something simply to thwart the government and to stop the elected government from governing. The same cannot be said for the Labor Party. It is hypocritical and populist. It is base and dishonest. In opposition, it has no policies; in government, it adopts the policies of the coalition.",REPS,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PARENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1,speech
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I rise today to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000 and the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Amendment Bill 2000. I would like to begin by making the point that Australia's immigration policy must be one which will enhance the future of our country, one which will encourage a healthy mix of migrants. Migration policy should not and must not be—as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs himself says—about just economic costs and benefits. However, at the heart of these bills is nothing more than an economic objective. The bills provide for the creation of a new visa class for aged parents with a dramatic increase in the cost of support, bonds and health charges. As speaker after speaker has told the House, there are now over 20,000 parents around the world who are waiting to be reunited with their families in Australia. Now that this government has cut the yearly intake of parents to 500 per year, their wait has been made so much longer.  
The minister—and I am glad he is in the parliament tonight—in his second reading speech referred to research that shows that people who migrate to Australia later in life make a minimal contribution to the revenue of the country but incur a reasonable cost to the taxpayer in terms of security and health. It is true that when Labor were in government we introduced a scheme whereby entrants would have to pay a bond and a health charge if they wished to enter the country, but it was a fair cost. The cost of keeping aged parents was offset by introducing an application charge, which is currently around $5,000 per couple. However, the increase in charges that these bills propose is far from fair. In fact, the consequences of introducing such a high cost for people to be reunited with their families in Australia could be severely damaging to the financial situations of those families. The increase in costs—from $3,500 for the main applicant and $1,500 for any adult to $10,000 and $4,000 respectively—is enormous, and then of course the applicants must also either obtain private health insurance for the first 10 years in Australia or pay an excess charge of $25,000 per person. If we take the $25,000 per person for the health bond—which, for a mother and father, will add up to $50,00—and we add $10,00 for the initial person's application and $4,000 for the additional person, we come up with a sum of $64,000 just for one aged couple, one mother and father, to be reunited with their family in Australia.
In the minister's second reading speech, he said that during his community consultations on the 2000-01 immigration intake many participants who wished to bring their parents to Australia indicated that they would meet all the costs associated with the migration of their parents. I wonder if they knew that the cost would be $64,000 when they agreed to meet all of the costs associated with the migration. I also question whether the minister had any community consultation with the people in my electorate of Prospect. Fifty-two per cent of people in the local government area of Fairfield, which makes up the majority of my electorate and comprises nearly 200,000 people, were born overseas. In many cases they are separated from family members who are spread throughout the world.
Many of my constituents have been waiting for years to be reunited with their families but are being held back by this government's dollar driven immigration policies. I would be extremely surprised to learn that an average migrant family in my electorate of Prospect could afford the $64,000 this government expects migrants to cough up before they can be reunited with their parents. Most of the immigrants in my electorate work extremely hard and they make a wonderful contribution to the local community, not only because of what they contribute with hard work but through their businesses and their cultural activities. They are not, as the government might want us to believe, people who offer nothing to the community but only cost the government money through medical and welfare expenses. 
I would like to relate a story of one of my constituents, a Mr Robert Foulis from Prospect, who has been trying since 1998 to get his parents from Belfast in Northern Ireland to join him and his children here in Australia. Mr Foulis is a truck driver on a salary of $40,000 a year. His original application was rejected by the department on the ground that in 1990 his father had a minor heart condition. Mr Foulis has supplied medical records to the department which now state there have been no further symptoms since the operation. The medical report furnished eight years after the heart condition says that Mr Foulis Sr, Robert's father, remains remarkably well. `He is symptom free and is in no way curtailed in any of his physical activities.' The report also stated that Robert's father has visited Australia on at least five occasions since 1990 without any problems at all. Robert is Mr and Mrs Foulis' only child of 50 years of age. That man has spent 21 years in Australia. Robert now has three children and two grandchildren. He has maintained that his parents would continue to receive a British pension and would be housed at Robert's new residence, which he recently bought, I might add, to accommodate his large family. His parents would be entirely financially independent through their British pension, and Robert has maintained that they would also seek, if they can find it, private medical insurance when they arrive.  
This government is now trying to make my constituent pay $64,000 to bring his parents out from Belfast if he wants early consideration, even though they will be financially independent from the Australian taxpayer, as they receive their British pension and they will have taken out that private health insurance. $64,000 is more than Mr Foulis would earn in a year and it would take years of saving, requiring him to take out a loan, probably with a finance company, where he will over the years have to pay back an exorbitant amount of interest. The financial counsellor of the Wesley Mission in Fairfield was concerned that people would be now encouraged to take out second mortgages on their homes, which they cannot afford, just to find the $64,000 required so they could have their families join them. Currently, as we know, bank interest rates range anywhere from 7.99 per cent and beyond. However, finance companies, which are more inclined to lend money in areas like this, can charge rates of interest up to 27 per cent, and sometimes even more. $64,000 is a very unreasonable and inflated cost, which in this case would cause a massive burden on Mr Foulis's finances. Mr Foulis has written to the Migration Review Tribunal and is still waiting for their decision. 
I believe this bill highlights this government's hypocritical nature in regard to migration policy. Just to give you an idea of this, there are the minister's own comments in his address in the National Press Club. Again I quote the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, who is at the table. He said:
It is my job to ensure that the immigration program has integrity, that it delivers all manner of benefits, both human and economic, to Australia. 
He went on to say:
Migration policy is not just about the economic cost and benefits and it is about the way we see ourselves as a nation.
I fail to see how we can see ourselves as a nation which is free of discrimination, tolerant and humanitarian in its immigration policy when the government requires a straight-up payment of up to $64,000 for those who can afford it. For those who cannot afford it—constituents in my electorate—they must wait on the government's capped intake of 500 per year. Given the current waiting list of 20,000, at 500 per year the wait is up to 40 years. Or, as we say to the aged parents waiting, `Never, ever.'
The minister goes on to talk about how his migration policy does not discriminate on the grounds of race, religion, ethnic origin or nationality. However, there is one significant exclusion there, and that is wealth. If a couple such as the Foulises have medical reports to say they have no signs of ill health, they have an only child here in Australia who has already bought a new house to accommodate them, they will not receive Australian pensions, they will be supported by their British pension, and they are prepared to take out private health insurance, what justification can this government have to require that their son Robert, who earns on average $40,000, pays $64,000 in fees and bonds to the government so that he and his children can experience the joy of being reunited with his parents? For those families where money is no object, $64,000 may be only a small sum to pay for the joy they will experience upon being reunited with their families. But I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that for those people in my electorate of Prospect $64,000 is a great deal of money.
I know from the experience in my electorate how important family is to our migrant communities, and what worries me is that they will do whatever they have to do to try and get the money to bring out their remaining family members. If this means taking out a loan from a finance company at some exorbitant interest rate or trying to get a second mortgage on their business or their house, on top of their credit card, their living expenses, their car repayments or other liabilities they have, then they will try—but at what cost to the family and at what cost to the community?
Another case from my electorate is that of Mrs Amira Jirjice, who has had her parents on the government's waiting list since 1998 and they have been stuck in the queue while the intake is now capped at 500 per year. I have made several representations on her behalf to the minister for immigration. However, this government's migration policy has only hampered her family's attempts at reunification. In May 1999 she wrote: 
I also want to express my sad feelings and disappointment of what 1 have heard about the Government's changes in next year's immigration intake, slashing the parent reunion category from 2,800 to 500 only. It is a payback by Mr Ruddock for the Senate's rejection of a Government regulation that will affect us more than anyone else ...
Mrs Jirjice also wrote to the minister earlier in 1998 stating that her parents `had three children already living in Australia and her parents' application to migrate to Australia had been accepted in 1996'. She said that all the medical tests were finished and everything was provided in August 1998. She continued:
I hope that you will consider a decision to end their suffering as a relief and a Christmas gift to all of us (their children) who as Australians have contributed and will continue to contribute to this country.
Since then her family have been waiting to bring her elderly parents to Australia and they have faced set-back after set-back. Their wait will undoubtedly be made far more difficult if the family in Australia now has to come up with the $64,000 required to be reunited with their parents. What sort of integrity does this country's migration policy have when it paves the way for families to be become debt ridden? The enjoyment, satisfaction and quality of life that is experienced when these families are united with their parents should not be granted only to those who can afford it. What message does this send to people abroad? Does it say, `If you have enough money, then you can come to Australia'? This is not the white Australia policy; this is the rich Australia policy.
The minister would be well aware of the thousands of people who arrive on our shores after having paid people smugglers thousands of dollars to get here. This is a despicable form of queue jumping which cannot and must not be tolerated by the government or opposition. Many of these queue jumpers have family already settled in Australia. Those arriving are told that they can seek out their families and be reunited within a couple of days and can look forward to a new life in Australia with their families. Of course, we know that this is not the case, but this is how those `snake heads', as I would like to refer to them, try to get people to pay enormous sums of money. 
This bill advocates a government sponsored form of queue jumping—and, when you look at it, that is what they are talking about. They now have the option of taking a risk and paying a smuggler to enter our country illegally or paying the government $64,000 to enter the country. It is hardly fair of this government to condemn one form of queue jumping and allow another. People smuggling is the biggest threat to the sovereignty of our migration policy. People smuggling is a thriving, illegal, worldwide trade. It competes with drug trafficking and arms trading as major international crime syndicates. Recently Australia has been receiving more than its fair share of illegal immigrants. Between 1 December 1999 and 19 March 2000—and I took out figures for only those few months—22 boats were intercepted off the north and north-west of Australia carrying 1,505 people, and a lot more have come since then. That is staggering—more than the combined total of illegal boat arrivals in the previous three years. It cannot be denied that we now have a serious crisis on our hands. This trade needs to be tackled head on. The government has spent millions on its Tough on Drugs stance and there are severe penalties for drug trafficking in and out of this country—and they should be even more severe. But the evidence suggested by those 1,505 people who have arrived up to March this year shows that the people smuggling trade seems to be thriving, despite any government attempts to stop it.
This bill will do absolutely nothing to stamp out the people smuggling trade, which should be one of the main focuses of our immigration policy. If anything, I believe it may now offer people smugglers the incentive to undercut the government's cost of $64,000 per couple for settlement in Australia, because what we have provided in this bill is for those people smugglers to use that price as a benchmark when they set their fees and charges—`Don't worry about us, mate. The government will charge you $64,000 a couple. We'll do it for $50,000 and get you in quicker.' 
Our migration policy should combat people smuggling and should not compete with it. The government's newly announced measures to combat people smuggling include the international information campaign `Pay a people smuggler and you'll pay the price' and the recent announcement overseas of shock television images of crocodiles and sharks warning people not to pay a people smuggler to come to Australia. It is yet to be seen whether these initiatives will do anything to curb the people smuggling epidemic. Some might argue, if you want to scare people away from coming to Australia, that we should forget about images of man-eating crocodiles and sharks and show them images of small business owners trying to get ready for the GST.
The Labor opposition has repeatedly called for the establishment of a national coast guard which would alleviate the responsibility of detecting illegal arrivals from being shared between Coastwatch, the Navy and Australian Customs. This would more effectively help deal with the people smuggling problem because it would be a central and unified agency which could concentrate a large proportion of its resources on catching the individuals who profit out of this scurrilous trade. This way, if we can stamp out and go after the people smuggling racketeers, the cost of detaining and keeping illegal immigrants is significantly reduced as fewer would be arriving. Eventually, a reduction in illegal arrivals would allow those people who have been patiently waiting in line to be reunited with their families a quicker and smoother wait for their applications to proceed. 
Illegal migration has a direct effect on the number of migration visas that are approved. In February this year, the minister ordered a freeze in processing of offshore refugee visas because there were so many onshore applications pending. I am not questioning that, but trying to explain that to the people I represent is very difficult indeed. The minister said in the Australian on 15 February 2000 that this freeze was a natural consequence of the wave of illegal immigrants. I pose the question: if this bill becomes law, will these people who have paid anywhere up to $64,000 to enter the country have their visa applications put on hold as soon as we get another sudden increase in illegal arrivals? $64,000 is a massive and unfair increase in the processing of parent immigration visas. However, what is most concerning is the minister's comments to the effect that $25,000 is really only one-fifth of the potential health costs, which are estimated at around $120,000.
In the cases I have already mentioned, a cost of up to $125,000 will be totally and completely unreasonable and unnecessary as the sponsors have assured us that the parents will be self-sufficient, financially independent and in good health. I ask the minister to think about what sort of migration policy we want here in Australia. As the minister says, migration policy is about the way we want to see ourselves as a nation. But it is also about how we want other nations to see us. I do not know about the minister, but I do know that I want Australia to be seen as a friendly and welcoming nation which has a migration policy that encompasses integrity and humanity and offers all manner of benefits in Australia, not just purely economic benefits.
I repeat that the $64,000 set by the government is excessive and unreasonable. It sends a message out to the people smugglers that Australia's immigration policy can be compromised by the forces of the dollar. I cannot support a bill which says quite clearly that if you have money, with no questions asked about how it was obtained, you are welcome to join the rest of your family in Australia. I cannot support a bill which will have the consequences of families incurring large debts at interest rates at times in excess of 25 per cent or higher. I cannot support a bill proposed by a government which talks so much about cracking down on queue jumping yet in one fell swoop advocates a form of queue jumping for the haves but not for the have nots.
The member for Hindmarsh asked what we would do. I can inform her, the minister and every member of the government, as has been stated time and time again, that we would certainly look at working with the government in this area but not while they propose the exorbitant fees that have now been plucked at random out of a hat. We have to give consideration to the majority of people who wish to be reunited with their families, but it has to be done in a fair and reasonable way. It has to be done in such a way that people who are now coming here illegally will know that they are not welcome in this country; but those who are making the proper contribution to this country as legal migrants should at least reach a point in their lives some time in the future when, if it is permissible, they can go through the proper channels and have their parents or loved ones with them to provide support. This is what we should be doing in an immigration policy. It should not be driven by the almighty dollar. There is more to humanity and more to the human being than what the dollar can buy. I believe that most of the government members would join me if they talked to their constituents and listened to some of the heartfelt agony that people are going through because of this legislation.

"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2000-06-22,"—I am particularly pleased to rise in support of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Parents and Other Measures) Bill 2000. In this House last year I spoke of my extremely strong disappointment with the voting down in the Senate of the Migration Amendment Regulation 1998,which would have allowed the children of elderly parents living overseas to sponsor them to migrate to Australia under a new visa subclass. This disallowance caused considerable distress to many constituents in my electorate of Moore who were willing to pay an additional assurance of support in order to expedite the visa process and, at the same time, ensure their relatives were not an undue burden on the Australian taxpayer. Further distress was caused as many parents were being processed under this new subclass when the decision was made in the Senate to deny these people the opportunity to be reunited with their families in Australia. 
It was not an easy task to explain to the families in my electorate why their parents should have to go back into the queue for the old visa, where there is a cap each year of 500 applicants, especially given the reasons of the non--government parties in the Senate for the disallowance. Despite the high level of interest of families in Australia in taking advantage of the new visa, the Labor Party denied them the opportunity because they said it was a visa for the rich. This was even harder to explain to my constituents, who were by no means wealthy—just prepared, along with their parents, to contribute towards the cost of being reunited with their family. Fortunately, the designated parent visa category was made available in November last year to assist the parents who were victimised by the Senate's decision. This incorporated the previous arrangements of the Migration Amendment Regulation, and nearly all of the applicants from the previous visa class moved over to this new category of visa.
This bill will allow for an intake of up to 4,000 parents over the next two years under the federal government's immigration program, in addition to existing visas that are available to parents. Those in the designated parent visa class will continue to be processed under that visa. The new entry arrangements under this bill ask for an assurance of support for a period of 10 years instead of the current two. This is in line with the current 10-year waiting period before elderly migrants are able to access the age pension. The bond for the assurance of support will rise from $3,500 to $10,000 for the main applicant and from $1,500 to $4,000 for other adult dependants. This will be repaid to the applicants after the 10 years if they have not accessed any welfare benefits during that time. The interest on that bond will also be repaid to the applicants. The applicants will then have a choice of taking out suitable private health insurance for the first 10 years or paying a health bond of $25,000 to contribute to the cost of their health needs in that time.
Another welcome aspect of this bill makes for more flexible arrangements for parents who are currently waiting for approval for a visa but who wish to visit their families in the meantime. In terms of health care during that time, many of these parents will be able to access reciprocal arrangements within Medicare. Otherwise, they will not have access to Medicare whilst on a visitors visa. This visa and the previously disallowed visa were introduced by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs after his extensive consultations when travelling around the country to discuss Australia's immigration program. One of these public meetings was held in my electorate, and I commend the minister on his willingness to listen to my constituents. For an immigration program to be successful, it is important to give members of the public, who often feel alienated by the political decision making process, a chance to put their views to the minister—and I know he is a good listener. 
Parent visas, under which more elderly parents have the opportunity to come to Australia if they are prepared to contribute towards the cost of their care, have been welcomed by both the general public and the major peak bodies involved in immigration issues. It is a commonsense measure that allows new Australians the means of bringing their parents to Australia while not being an unfair burden on the taxpayer. Those who have worked and paid taxes all their lives in another country should not move to this country and receive the benefits that people here pay taxes for. They should not expect to be fully supported. The many families that I have had contact with who wish to see their parents join them in Australia accept this as a fair means of entering the country. As I said earlier, all the peak bodies involved in immigration believe this is a fair measure. It is now up to the Senate to listen to the wishes of their constituents.
Another reason why many of the families have absolutely no problem with supporting their parents, or helping the parents support themselves, is that this is not an unusual request in the immigration laws of other countries. Australia is not asking for something out of the ordinary when it asks newly arrived migrants to be self-supporting. For example, elderly parents wanting to emigrate to the United Kingdom to join their children who migrated from Australia would only be granted a visa if they were wholly or mainly financially dependent on the sponsor. They are unable to access any public funds—that is, state benefits such as income support, housing assistance, thejob seekers allowance and disability payments. 
This new parent visa will help to free up the existing parent visa category which has a cap of 500 applicants per year, so those people unable or unwilling to pay an increased assurance of support will have their visas approved in a shorter time frame as many applicants ahead of them in the queue move over to the new visa. This surely must keep the member for Prospect happy. A recent survey completed by the National Institute of Labour Studies at Flinders University showed that three-quarters of migrants surveyed in Australia had a parent living overseas. After three years of settlement, 15 per cent of the sample surveyed had sponsored or applied to sponsor a close relative to migrate to Australia. A further 18 per cent indicated they were planning to sponsor a relative in the near future. At present there are about 20,000 parents waiting to obtain a visa to migrate to Australia. The sponsoring of elderly parents will always be a major component of any immigration program in this country, so it is important that we get this right. As this House has already heard, the average cost of looking after the health of someone over the age of 65 is estimated at $6,000 a year. As a community, we have to balance the wishes of new Australians to be reunited with their parents and the effect this will have on the public purse. This is not to say we should ignore the many positive benefits of bringing parents out to Australia, particularly in terms of family support. I call on the non-government parties in this House to stop the ideological nonsense about visas for the rich and support this practical, widely popular and fair measure. I commend this Bill to the House. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I am very concerned about the debate that is currently raging about the effect on rent of the GST. On the one hand, we have a commitment that the GST will not apply to normal private household rent and, on the other, we have an acknowledgment that landlords will probably pass on costs associated with the property although GST as a direct charge on rent would not occur. I believe the government's estimate on the potential increase on these rents as I have described was around 2.3 per cent. Now we have a report, seemingly kept under wraps at first by the government, by the government's preferred economic modeller, Econtech, which predicts that increase is now to be around 4.7 per cent. Earlier this week, the Treasurer translated that with some pretty smart figuring into an increase of about $8 to $10 a week, which he then went on to describe as `affordable for the average family'. As we have pointed out, if that average family is on a dual income of $45,000, has two children—what I would consider a pretty average family—and receives $25 a week tax cuts as part of the GST package, this means $8 to $10 a week going immediately into rent really cuts quite a swathe into that tax cut which is the compensation method for the cost of the GST coming on stream. This is long before that average family even begins to cover other increased costs of living associated with the GST. It seems to me that the Treasurer and the government really do not see the reality of these imposts on our families and on our communities. In my electorate of Canberra I understand there are over 11,000 households, or 22.5 per cent of the community, in private rental which stand to be affected by this new projected outcome. Rent makes a very large hole in a family's income. I do not believe that our families can simply just keep absorbing all of these rising costs.
We also have the debate about rent on long-stay caravan park residents and people who live in boarding houses. The government has never denied that GST will be charged directly on their rent. Some of these people have chosen this lifestyle as their only economic means of owning their own dwelling. In bringing this issue to the fore from this side of the parliament we have been vilified as scaremongering or as troublemaking. Despite that, the pressure on the government has been sufficient that another series of Democrat-government meetings has been held to devise a way out of this electoral mess—that is how they see this, not as an unfair treatment of people but as a threat in electoral terms.
What is the solution they have come up with? The Democrats' deal with the government to compensate the GST rent hikes is shameful. For a single social security recipient with no children the deal is worth just 16c extra per day. Only social security recipients receiving the maximum rate of rent assistance will receive the increase. For most social security recipients who do not receive the maximum rate the deal does not deliver any money at all—not one cent. We intend to move amendments to this legislation to ensure the removal of the GST charge from these people completely. That is how this issue should be solved, not by dabbling around the edges in a shameful way, by pretending that some compensation package has been devised overnight purely because of the electoral pressure being now felt by sectors of the government. The only real way of dealing with this issue is to remove the possibility of charging the GST to those people in the first place.  
We keep hearing about 1 July, the day it all begins. That is true—it is the day it is supposed to all begin—but for many of these families it has already, directly or indirectly, well and truly begun, long before any so-called `compensation' packages have even remotely become available. I am saddened by the apparent ignorance and absolute inability of this government to see what is really happening out there. When I stand up in this place and talk about my community, my families, my constituents, who are coming to me of their own free will to tell me how this whole scenario is affecting them—they are telling me, I am not telling them—my job is to come in here and make sure that the government hears that message.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I wish to raise an issue in response to a press release from Senator Nick Minchin calling on the Senate to support state native title. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Senator Minchin has been described as a liar by some of his colleagues as a result of some party room negotiations. In this instance, he is knowingly misleading the public in claiming that native title matters in three states are holding up exploration applications. There can be no doubt that we are experiencing a serious decline in outlays of mineral exploration in this country. For the past couple of generations, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the only correlation with exploration activity was and remains base metal prices. The decline in greenfields exploration in this country predates the Mabo decision, as do early trends in the decline of brownfields exploration.
In the past few years, there has been a well-documented exodus of risk capital from minerals exploration to dot com ventures. This shift has nothing to do with native title and everything to do with the trend to speculation inherent in stock markets. Serious players in the states are threatened not by the native title system, but rather by governments committed to thwarting the proper operation of the Native Title Act for political purposes. For example, despite all registered claims in place at the time of the 1998 amended act having to be reassessed by the standards of John Howard's new act, the Western Australian government has appealed against the registration of every claim that has successfully passed the John Howard test. 
As recently as last Friday, we had notice that Premier Court intends to issue licences over land subject to native title claims in advance of determinations by the High Court on critical legal issues. We know where this has led us in the past. The validation regime in the Native Title Act amendments is all due to the fact that state governments would not heed the implications of the original Mabo decision. The problems of mineral exploration in this country are real and immediate. They deserve serious debate uncluttered by political motives. Spurious identification of the cause of a problem must inevitably delay or thwart lasting solutions.
Mr Deputy Speaker, you should also be aware, to highlight the absurdity of the statements by Senator Minchin, that, in the case of the Northern Territory, exploration was frozen for a number of years by a fiat of the Northern Territory government who refused to deal with the current Native Title Act and the right to negotiate regime. They have since come to their senses, but in effect, exploration was frozen by them, a conservative government.

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2000-06-22,"—This Sunday, 25 June, it will be my privilege and pleasure to attend the 25th anniversary celebrations of the Mount Gravatt Meals on Wheels. Since its inception in July 1975, Mount Gravatt Meals on Wheels has delivered a total of 331,854 meals. In the 1999-2000 financial year it delivered 28,339 meals—that is, 130 per day over six runs. In fact, this contrasts with its first financial year of operations in 1975-76 when it delivered 2,384 meals, around eight per day. In the 1992-2000 financial year there were 288 clients in all relying upon this valuable service. The service also relies upon the active contribution of 196 volunteers.
I would like to honour the volunteers and committee members who have served continuously since 1975. I refer to Dorothy Begbie, Val Little and Buntie Hughes. Also, Ruth Barlow has been involved with Mount Gravatt Meals on Wheels for the past 22 years, and prior to commencing her volunteer duties with Mount Gravatt Meals on Wheels she did meal deliveries with St Andrews Meals on Wheels in the city of Brisbane. I also honour Rose O'Brien, who turns 90 this August, who started with Mount Gravatt Meals on Wheels back in 1982. She has been with the group for 18 years and was president for 11 years until July 1999 and still does active meal deliveries.  
I also honour the original committee: its president, Mrs Gladys Peel, now deceased; vice president, Eva Parer, now deceased; secretary, Buntie Hughes; treasurer, Keith Begbie; roster secretary, Marge Wilson; and committee member, S. Rowland. I also honour the current committee. The president, Mary Low, has a particularly distinguished service with Meals on Wheels, having started her career with Meals on Wheels at Mount Gravatt Meals on Wheels originally, and subsequently rising to become state president of Meals on Wheels in Queensland and serving in that position for 12 years. Following her time as state president, she returned to Mount Gravatt Meals on Wheels in July 1999 and was appointed president. 
From the current committee, I also honour Jack Sexton, who recently turned 90. He has been with Mount Gravatt Meals on Wheels for 17½ years. He started doing deliveries for Meals on Wheels a long time ago. He was appointed treasurer in 1982 and has been active in Meals on Wheels at Mount Gravatt ever since. I also honour Ken Wilson, who has been secretary for 10 years, and the meals coordinator, Ian McDonald. I honour all of those who have volunteered for this valuable service which has been provided to residents of the Mount Gravatt district for the last 25 years.
I would also like to honour today the contribution of the Holland Park Meals on Wheels service which, next Thursday, 29 June, will be celebrating its 30th anniversary. Regrettably, because of my presence in the parliament, I will be unable to attend that celebration. The history is an interesting one. A public meeting was held on 23 June 1970 in the Holland Park RSL hall. It was there that the first management committee was elected. On 13 July 1970, the first meals were cooked and delivered from the kitchen in the church hall. Since that time, the expansion of its operations has continued unabated. There was an expansion of the facilities in July 1985 and the first meals were prepared in that new facility on Monday, 5 August of that year.
Holland Park Meals on Wheels served its one-millionth meal on 28 October 1996. During its 30 years in operation, it has prepared 1,331,481 meals and in the last financial year produced 91,247 meals, with the average number of meals prepared each day being 376. Holland Park Meals on Wheels employs a full-time manager; 11 part-time employees work alongside 270 sterling volunteers. I would also like to honour the committee: its president, Lynne Petie; vice president, Margaret Seto;  secretary, Rita Hickey; treasurer, John Leighton; and committee members, Margaret and Bill Hamilton, Rob MacKnish and Roma and Bill Winders. Also, I honour the current manager, Janice Cochrane, who has held that position for the last 12 years. 
I honour the immediate past committee, including the president, Arthur Till. Elected for his 16th year as president, Arthur has been on the committee for 30 years and served two years as vice president before becoming president. Arthur's wife, June Till, has also been continuously involved in Meals on Wheels since its inception. I honour the vice president, Lynne Petie; secretary, Rita Hickey; treasurer, John Leighton; and committee members Denis Freeman, Margaret and Bill Hamilton, Rob MacKnish, Margaret Seto, June Till and Roma and Bill Winders. I also honour past presidents: Mrs Pat McAllister, Mrs Dorothy Foreman, Margaret Hamilton, May Boyd, and Arthur Till, to whom I have just referred. I honour all these volunteers who have contributed to this extraordinary service provided to the Holland Park district and I commend them on their 30th anniversary celebrations.
