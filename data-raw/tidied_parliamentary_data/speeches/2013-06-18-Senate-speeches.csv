The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Bernardi
) (13:12):  The question is that amendment (1) on sheet 7375, moved by Senator Waters, be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2013-06-18,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (13:12):  Given that we were rather rushed last night in the five minutes we had to discuss this amendment, I will recap: the amendment would allow landholders the right to say no to coal and coal seam gas mining on their land. Many communities across the east coast are now banding together to demand that right. Today a poll has been released showing that 86 per cent of New South Wales residents want the right to say no; they want to be able to lock the gate and to be not breaking the law when they do so.


I take this opportunity to acknowledge in the public gallery some members of the Lock the Gate Alliance. The alliance has been very courageous in the stand it has taken against this industry, which, as we know, threatens groundwater, threatens the climate and of course threatens the reef, and is impacting on rural communities—and increasingly on urban communities as the coal seam gas industry encroaches on the cities as well. We are honoured to be moving this amendment to give those communities the right to lock the gate and to do so lawfully.


As I outlined last night, this amendment does not change the ownership of the resource, it is perfectly constitutional and it does not lessen any of the other environmental requirements. This is purely an amendment to strengthen the bargaining position of communities and allow them to lock the gate against this dangerous and risky industry.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-06-18,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:14):  I rise to say how critical this amendment is, particularly for the future of rural and regional Australia and particularly for areas that will be growing our food in the future. It is disgraceful that permission has been given for coal seam gas exploration when the precautionary principle would have told you they have no idea what the impact on groundwater or the Artesian Basin will be, yet they have allowed this to proceed. Furthermore, they have no idea how much fugitive emissions of methane are going from those coal seam gas sites into the atmosphere.


I started my political career supporting the farmers at Wesley Vale against the North Broken Hill pulp mill. I have been out with Senator Waters. I have been out in New South Wales with Kate Fairman and Jeremy Buckingham—they are members of parliament there. I have been to the Felton Valley, I have been to Moree, I have been through Lismore and I have been out onto the Liverpool Plains. Everywhere I go, farmers say to me that they cannot believe that they have been sold out so badly by both the Liberal and the National parties, who have told them for years that they support them in what they do. Yet, when push comes to shove, those parties are selling out to the coal industry and the coal seam gas industry against the best interests of protecting agricultural land and water into the future.


I have been on some of those properties and it is very, very clear—particularly with those black soils—that you will get massive erosion if you allow the infrastructure for coal seam gas onto those properties. But, apart from anything else, farmers and farming communities ought to have the right to say no. The anger out there is extreme because the political process has said, 'Where the most votes are counts the most.' They have changed the law to protect communities where there are votes, like Western Sydney, but they have left rural communities high and dry. I can tell you that people recognise—as Lester Brown has said many times—that in this century food security is a major challenge: those responsible for producing food particularly need to do it in the face of extreme weather events and in the face of agricultural land being lost to urbanisation and other pressures. We must protect this land and we must give farmers the right to say no to coal seam gas and coal on their properties.


This is the era— (Quorum formed) As I was saying, Lester Brown has recognised that food is the new oil in this century, and land and water are the new gold. It is about time that in Australia we recognise the pressure that the environment is under and we protect our land, water and rural communities. I think this is a critical amendment to give farmers the right to say no. We have heard from the Leader of the Opposition—depending on which station he is being interviewed on at the time—that sometimes he supports farmers rights to say no and at other times he does not. It is about time we actually had this tested in the parliament. This is going to be a very significant vote as to whether people actually do want to support farmers being able to stand up.


When I was out on the Liverpool Plains, I met a gentleman who was 70 years old; his name was Bill. He came down to talk to me and he said he had spent his 70 years building up his property to the state that it is in now. It is a very beautiful property and he said he never expected that he would have to spend the rest of his life defending it. That is a pretty powerful statement for a farmer to make. He has coal seam gas next door. Other communities, like at Moree, have locked the gates—and good on them. Communities around the country are trying to do the same.


They are up against it because of the power of the fossil fuel lobby. When you look at what has happened in New South Wales—with ICAC in particular—and you find out how many of these permits have been granted and what the conditions of those are, you really have to scratch your head and ask, 'Why haven't they been revoked, in light of how they were granted in the first place? How is it possible that farming communities are being wrought asunder and yet the people who have facilitated this are getting away with it?' As far as the government is concerned, it is very late for Tony Burke—now the minister—to be concerned about it after he approved every coal seam gas project that came across his desk until now, including the Gloucester facility. That is why the Greens have argued strongly that these laws should apply retrospectively, particularly to those projects that have not actually been started. And they should be applied retrospectively to those that have started, to the extent of them being forced to report on the water and atmospheric impacts of the fugitive emissions coming from those projects.


There is no excuse. Eighty per cent of the fossil fuel reserves should stay in the ground if we are to be serious about global warming and constraining global warming to less than two degrees. That means no more new fossil fuel industries. It makes no sense to be driving a fossil fuel industry at the end of the fossil fuel age. You cannot stand up in here, day after day, and say, 'I believe the climate science,' and in the next breath give the go-ahead to the biggest coal mines and massive coal seam gas facilities from one end of the country to the other. It makes no sense. It is totally hypocritical. You either believe this climate science and get on with rolling out 100 per cent renewables and protecting agricultural land and water or you accept the fact that you are a climate sceptic, that you do not believe the climate science and that is why you want to drive the fossil fuel industry.


But you cannot have it both ways, and it is about time people started to face up to that. We are seeing the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef as I stand here, as a result of new coal ports. We have the government and the coalition driving the opening up of coal in the Galilee Basin and the Bowen Basin. The Galilee Basin alone, if it were a separate country, would be producing seven per cent of the world's emissions when that coal is burned. It has to stay in the ground. It is not only a bad thing for the atmosphere but a bad thing for economic development. We cannot have people investing in companies when we know that the share value is going to be written off, because the value is based on reserves and these reserves are not accessible if you are serious about the climate science. Let us get back and protect our farmers; let us give them the right to say no.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-06-18,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:23):  The coalition will most definitely be opposing this amendment of the Greens. I inform the Senate that we do so because the words of Senator Waters and Senator Milne, in suggesting that this amendment does not in any way change ownership, ring quite hollow when you look at the actual wording of the amendment. The amendment states:


The Minister must not approve, for the purposes of the controlling provision, the taking of the action, unless the Minister is satisfied that any owner, and any occupier, of land that would be likely to be affected by the taking of the action:


(a)  has obtained independent legal advice; and


(b)  has obtained independent advice in relation to the likely impacts of the taking of the action; and


(c)  has freely given informed consent in relation to the taking of the action.


This amendment would have two consequences that obviously spring to mind. The first is that an owner of the immediate property in question would be able to block access indefinitely, with a blank cheque, for as long as they want, until effectively they have extracted the price that they want for such access. That is what the effect would be. Unlike the historical provisions that I will turn to in a second in relation to how state laws around access have been governed for a long time, this is a blank cheque to block action with no automatic recourse to mediation, no opportunity for any type of fairness of recognition that the states' ownership of the minerals or the resource or the petroleum resource comes into play in the consideration of things. By giving the title owner, the landowner, that blank cheque to block access, you effectively give them a blank cheque to extract whatever price they want for the minerals that are in the ground.


Secondly, I highlight the fact that this amendment talks about any owner and any occupier of land that 'would be likely to be affected' by the taking of action. Those are important words, because we are addressing in the totality of the bill before the Senate amendments that relate to water resources and the protection of those water resources. Fundamental to the recognition that we must protect those water resources is a recognition that those water resources stretch across title boundaries into adjoining properties. The coalition acknowledges there must be appropriate science and research for the protection of those resources, but this amendment would lead to the possibility that not just the owner of the land on which the exploration or development activity is taking place would have to give permission but potentially adjoining landowners would also have to give permission. You could have a situation where the landowner in questioning extracts the price they want and are happy for it to go ahead, but adjoining landowners find themselves with the opportunity to block access until they extract a price that they are happy with.


This flies in the face of the entire understanding of land-use management in the history of the Australian Federation. Throughout that history it has been recognised that land-use management decisions lie with state governments. That is the fundamental understanding that has existed. The words 'lock the gate' that are thrown around emotively at times—and I know they have been used as a campaign slogan in this very emotive debate—are a demonstration that this is about a desire to stop development. Senator Milne talked about the fact that the coal has to stay in the ground for climate change reasons—a demonstration that the Greens' involvement in this space is driven not by genuine concerns for landowners, farmers or those who might be affected by these developments but by broader political objectives of the Greens political party.


As I said, this goes against the longstanding practice of states in their exclusive regulation of this area. Those longstanding practices have evolved over the years in recognising that there should be some firm processes in place for how landowners give consent and how such consent is given fairly. It tries to balance, at the state level around Australia, a recognition that, whilst the resources in the ground may belong to the state, there is an issue around the landowners and that landowners need to be reasonably respected and treated in a fair way for the giving of consent.


In New South Wales, such things date back to before the Mining Act 1906, which dealt not just with gold and other minerals but also with mineral oils or petroleum in outlining the types of provisions for obtaining landholder consent. The Mining Act 1906 was updated in relation to petroleum and gaseous products in 1955 with the passage of the Petroleum Act 1955 in New South Wales. Section 50 of that act contains the following provisions:




50. 
The holder of any licence or lease under this Act shall not carry out any prospecting or mining operations or erect any works on the surface of any land which is under cultivation unless the owner or the owner and occupier, as the case may be, of such land has or have consented thereto:





Provided that—





(a) the Minister may, if he considers that the circumstances so warrant, define an area of the prospecting or mining operations may be carried out or works may be erected, and may specify the nature of the operations to be carried out or the works to be erected, but before any such operations are commenced or works are erected, the warden shall assess the amount to be paid as compensation for any loss of or damage to any crop on such cultivated land;





(b) cultivation for the growth and spread of pasture grasses shall not be deemed to be cultivation within the meaning of this section unless, in the opinion of the Minister, the circumstances so warrant; and





(c) in the case of dispute as to whether land is or is not under cultivation within the meaning of this section the Minister's decision thereon shall be final.





So, a process has long been established and was set out there in the Petroleum Act of 1955 at the New South Wales level. That provided for the fundamental decision that owner or occupier should provide consent but, equally, a mediation process was in place there where the minister provide consent if it could be agreed to and there should be independent assessment of appropriate compensation to be paid.





In 1991 the Petroleum Onshore Act was passed in New South Wales and replaced the 1955 act, but it contained in s. 71 an almost identical provision in relation to land under cultivation and similar activities. In 1994 there were amendments that removed the requirement for landholder consent in relation to exploration licences and assessment leases but not in relation to production leases. These are important distinctions—and distinctions that I will be moving further amendments in relation to—that clearly separate the treatment of exploration or assessment activities from production activities.





The amendments also inserted a new part 4(a), with similar land access provisions to those introduced into the Mining Act of 1989. So, we had a new part 4(a) of the Petroleum Onshore Act 1991 that provided that the holder of a prospecting title may not carry out prospecting operations on any private land otherwise than in accordance with an access agreement (a) agreed between the title holder and the owner and occupier of the land or (b) determined by an arbiter. Since 1994 these provisions have been slightly amended but essentially remain in force in New South Wales, as do similar provisions in other jurisdictions.





When the Greens come to this place and others go to the other place to argue that somehow there is not a process in place that respects the rights of landholders, that is simply a falsehood. There are laws in place—long-established laws, century-old laws at a state level—that very clearly respect the rights of landholders whilst also respecting the right of the state to access the minerals contained within the lands. That recognises that those minerals are an important asset of the people of the state, not just of the individual landowner. Those laws have sat there for 100-plus years in Australian history, and longer if you go to 
the individual jurisdictions and longer still in places overseas. Such laws recognise that appropriate processes which ideally cover an access arrangement between the licensed company, which is developing the mineral resource and extracting the mineral resources, and the landowner. If that cannot be achieved—if the landowner cannot reach reasonable terms with the licence owner—then the state steps in via arbitration and establishes what those fair terms should be.





The Greens' amendment would simply turn this long-established practice at a state level completely on its head and suddenly there would be a situation where not just immediate landowners but other landowners on surrounding properties would have a complete right of veto and the federal environment minister would sit above all of the different ministers and authorities at a state level to have the final yea or nay say, with no process in the Greens amendment for how disputes might be arbitrated.





We on the coalition side recognise that there is a genuine concern that exists in many communities about how provisions such as those I have outlined are applied in the states. There is a real concern to make sure they are applied transparently. There are genuine concerns too about the way governments, like the New South Wales Labor government, may have given out some mining leases. That reeks of corruption and no doubt will be proven to be acts of corruption. But that does not mean that for the entire Commonwealth of Australia we should turn a century-plus of established law-making on its head. That would potentially shut down the appropriate management of mineral resources around Australia and, in doing so, shut down exploration, assessment and production activities that may likely be undertaken in the future. Essentially, that would be the 
outcome of the amendment proposed by the Greens.




I trust that the government will equally be opposing this and will oppose it with a similar concern—not just for its effects on an industry that is important to Australia and not just to trample on the federation and the rights of states that this amendment undertakes but to recognise that there is an appropriate balance to be achieved here. Such a balance should ensure that landholders are rightly compensated where access to their land is granted as part of a mineral or petroleum licence and that communities rightly receive a level of support and recognition for the way mining or petroleum development impacts on those communities. The balance should also make sure the people of a state receive the benefits of the utilisation of the resources of that state.

They are the things that need to be balanced. They are the things that should be balanced in state laws, not through some blunt, crude amendment such as this one proposed by the Greens today, which I trust the chamber will rightly reject.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-06-18,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:37):  The issue here is that of course we acknowledge that landholders have an absolute right to what is present on their land. But, by reason of state governments over such a long period of time stealing hydrocarbonist materials from underneath their ground, they have lost those rights. They have lost those rights by reason of state government actions. In Queensland they lost them with the 1915 Petroleum Act. In South Australia, where Senator Birmingham is from and you too, Temporary Chairman, they lost them in 1971. In the Territory they lost them in 1953. In New South Wales Neville Wran gave a splendid second reading speech on how he was stealing those rights in 1983. That was quite recent. So it is very clear that, when people say that landholders never had the rights to coal, gas and oil underneath their places, that is not correct. They have never had the rights to silver, gold and iron ore, but they have had the rights to hydrocarbonist material. The problem is that to restore those rights you have to restore them at a state level. You cannot restore them at a federal level; you have to restore them at a state level.


I think it is a great idea to give those rights back to landholders at a state level from where they were stolen. That would obviously give landholders a vastly greater say in what is happening. I would presume, much to the dilemma of the Greens, that far from stopping the further development of mineral resources it would actually assist the further development of mineral resources just like it does in Texas and other places. We can see that once people realise there is a substantial return that gives their family a better standard of living they are more than willing to engage with the mining companies. What is happening at the moment is that they are getting ripped off. We have said this quite clearly a number of times. We did in the 2011 Senate inquiry, which I wrote the extension of terms for, to deal in a transparent way with coal seam gas.


It is important to understand the principles that the National Party stands behind. No. 1 is: do not go onto prime agricultural land. No. 2 is: do not destroy aquifers. Even though my political adversary put forward a bill for $150 million for further investigation and you would think prima facie that we would be fighting against it, I fought to make sure it was agreed to. No. 3 is: do not go next to people's quiet enjoyment. That is a term borrowed from rental tenancy agreements. No. 4 is: make sure a return goes back to the community. Royalties for Regions—who came up with that policy? It was the National Party. No. 5 is: there be a baseline agreement that one per cent of the returns from the well head go back to the landholder. They were additional comments signed off by the National Party. This gives a clear understanding. That would mean in some areas, where it is not prime agricultural land and it is not going to destroy aquifers or be next to the quiet enjoyment of someone's house, a person gets a chance for a fair return.


The best well in Queensland, in Roma, returns $1 million a day. A one per cent return per year from that well would be around $3.3 million. That would be a great return for that landholder. That would be a great return for the town of Roma—or for Wallumbilla, Dulacca or Injune. It would give people the capacity to get a real return back into their local community. The person most likely to spend that money would of course be the landholder on whose property the well is. A very average well returns around $30,000 to $40,000 per day, so you are looking at in excess of $100,000 a year per well.


These are the sorts of things that would deal with so many arguments. What are they getting at the moment? We found one person who got a slab of beer. One person got $240 a year. Some people thought they were really getting ahead when they were getting $1,500 a year. It was only the Senate inquiry that brought transparency and gave a clear understanding of just how much was involved and how people should be getting a fairer return.


In the state of Texas in the United States of America they get 25 per cent of the gross at the well head. Then the federal government comes and taxes the landholder and then the state government comes and taxes the landholder. Do they have any problems with access agreements? Surprisingly, no. They have no problems with access agreements whatsoever. In fact, if you find a shoe box you will find an oil well or something sitting on top of it, because people are making quite a substantial return out of it. I think once this logic is taken on board, not by the federal government but by state governments and the mining companies, then a lot of these problems that have been dealt with here will be ironed out.


However, I do not think changing over constitutional law at a federal level is going to work. I do not quite know how that one is going to work today. What we have here, as always with the Greens—because I do not think this has not been supported in the lower house by any in the Labor Party or by the Independents—is a classic case of a form of a wedge. They do it for the purposes of saying, 'We'll work on the presumption that nobody actually knows what this is about.' At first blush they will say, 'This is just what we are looking for.' But the reality is that not only would it be constitutionally unviable; it just completely belies the historical facts that sit behind this thing, which is that you are looking for rights that are held by the states. You are trying to put conditions on them at a federal level and that is just not going to work.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-06-18,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (13:44):  I would like to add some comments to this and ask some questions. Senator Milne said that food is the new oil. I tend to agree with her. Food is vital. But it always amazes me when we see properties like Toorale Station, with 93,000 hectares of good food-producing country, locked up, bought out and made into a national park to burn. That is what will happen to Toorale Station. It will burn, as sure as I am speaking here now, with no management, a lack of hazard reduction, fuel on the ground and no grazing. They say, 'Let's just lock the property up and let it burn.' As sure as I speak the rain will fall, the grass will grow, and then we will get the dry time. Then along comes a thunderstorm and the lightning will set off the fire on 93,000 hectares of country that has not been grazed for years. There will be up to 100 or 150 tonnes to a hectare of fuel, just like it was in the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, where half the country burned—it just happened in national parks. Of course, you cannot allow grazing in national parks; that is not allowed following the Greens' pressure on Minister Tony Burke. The coalition government put cattle into the alpine country to reduce those very fuel levels.


We see it in the Pilliga, between Narrabri and Moree, where the country has been locked up for national parks. It used to be forest. It used to be managed. It used to be grazed. And we see the hot fires go through with so much fuel, getting up into the crowns of the trees and killing them, where the koalas are literally cooked. If there is a huge fire on a hot day the strong wind goes through these huge fuel levels.


We have the irony of the Greens, where food is the new oil, and they say, 'Let's just lock up our food-growing country in the national parks. Let it burn! Let it destroy the environment!' Around 90 million tonnes of carbon dioxide was estimated to come out of the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria. But we have a carbon tax to reduce our carbon emissions. This is crazy! Let's let the country burn! Let the animals be killed and sizzled—koalas, native species, you name it! I find it quite amazing.


It is a fact that this country needs energy. When Senator Milne and the Greens can convince me that you can power a 9400 model John Deere tractor at about 380 or 400 horsepower, towing a 60- or 70-foot wide air seeder with a fertiliser and grain bin—when you can power that tractor with a solar panel on the roof of that tractor, I am going to be simply amazed. We need diesel to power that tractor. Perhaps the Greens want us to go back to the Clydesdale horse days with a single-furrow mouldboard plough, walking alongside. Shut the machines down! We need energy and here we have clean energy in Australia—gas—with fewer emissions, and it is not imported. So let's shut down gas! The current situation in New South Wales is that 95 per cent of the gas is imported into New South Wales. But let's close it all down. Then when people are knocking down the doors in my office asking, 'Why is gas so expensive?' I can say, 'Blame the Greens,' and lock the gate on others for shutting down industries. We have made it quite clear where the Nationals stand on this issue.


I am disappointed that Senator Milne has left the chamber, because I wanted to ask: if this amendment went through the Senate, where the farmer could say no to anyone going onto the property for mining projects, coal seam gas or whatever, how is it going to be enforced at a federal level when the land is controlled by the states? I want an answer to that. How are you going to enforce it as a federal law? I find that simply amazing. This is not about the farmers having a say, this is about a political wedge. That is all this is about.


When I talk to the large gas companies in Australia, they say they do not go onto properties when the farmers say, 'We don't want you here.' That has been the message clearly put to me. What I am saying is that we need energy. We need gas. We also need to look after our environment for future generations. One of the most, if not the most, important parts of our environment is the very topsoil that grows our food, not only for the 23 million Australians but also for millions of others around the world relying on the food production here in Australia. It is all very good to say, 'Let's shut this down, let's shut that down, let's go back and live in a cave and we'll issue three sticks of wood for a week—that's your quota to keep warm and do your cooking.' But that is not the real world. We live in the real world, where we need energy and we need to produce.


My leader in the Senate, Senator Joyce, just made quite clear to the Senate the policy that was released in November 2011: look after the land, look after the water, look after the environment, give a fair go. And here are the Greens looking for a wedge. How are we going to enforce this law? The minerals are owned by the states—the Crown—and the Rann government stole that off the farmers in 1981 or 1983 in New South Wales, with no compensation, just like when they shut down the farming country with the Native Vegetation Conservation Act. I was very pleased last week to hear Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner addressing that crazy issue.


I can give you an example about the food bowl, as Senator Milne said. If you have a farming country in New South Wales and you do not plough it for 10 years, then you are not allowed to plough it again. If you plough a good country you will get a tonne to the acre of wheat—you will yield 1,000 kilograms of wheat. Or you can leave it as grazing country under the native veg act and you might rear 20 or 25 kilograms, perhaps five kilograms of wool. Here we have the food bowl producing food, but under the Greens plan—and Senator Bob Carr, when Premier of New South Wales, said it would be the greenest government the state has ever seen—we have shut down the farmers from growing food and being productive. And what was the compensation? The compensation was zilch. Make the property owners pay for the environmental issues.


So do not ever talk about food being the new oil when the Greens' history is of shutting down the production of food in New South Wales. The history proves it. Thank goodness the New South Wales government is, after its inquiry, about to address that issue and bring some fairness back into the whole environmental debate in New South Wales. The landowners have been caned by the Greens; Senator Bob Carr; the minister—as John Laws used to refer to him, Kimberly Maxwell Yeadon—who we thought had a very capable staff; and Senator Penny Wong. This is the group hanging together, saying, 'Shut down the farmers, don't give them any compensation and don't worry about producing food.' That has been a problem in this country for too long.


We take our supply of food for granted. Around the rest of the world we see subsidies given to the farmers, and we have to compete against them. The point I make—and we made it quite clear—is that we need balance. We need energy, or you will take us back to the Clydesdales, walking behind the horse with the single-furrow plough and a couple of Clydesdales hooked together—a very slow process.


We have become a modern machinery farming enterprise, with huge production. We will not be going back to the horses. We will use energy. We require energy, and diesel will be part of that energy. Let us just shut down our local clean energy in gas and import diesel. Is that the plan? Is that the balance of payments plan? Is that the environmental plan? Is it to close down the clean energy and gas being produced in Australia? As I said, this amendment is simply a wedge piece by the Greens.


I wish Senator Milne were here to explain how they are going to enforce this. No-one takes more pride than our farmers and those who have lived all their lives in rural Australia and been on the land. I wish Senator Milne were here to answer this question—or perhaps Senator Waters might. How is this going to be enforced? If this were to go through, what law can the federal government enforce when the control of the land is under the Crown? Are they just going to change the Constitution with the wave of a stick and perform magic? We all know how hard it is to change the Constitution. That is the very point I make. I am sure my colleague Senator Birmingham has more to add to this.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-06-18,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:53):  I indicate my support for this amendment with some reluctance, because it seems to me that the status quo is not adequate. Senator Joyce did point out very well that there is a complete lack of balance of power between the farmers and some of these companies that buy in coal seam gas, that some people receive something like a slab of beer in extreme cases, when many millions of dollars are being made from these wells.


In terms of the constitutional issues which Senator Williams and, I think, Senator Birmingham as well referred to, I do not think there is an issue about the Commonwealth's ability in using this act or other powers, including the corporations power, to effectively legislate in this field. I note that the numbers are not with the Greens with this amendment, particularly in relation to the issue of informed consent on the part of a farmer for their land to be used in this way. I also note the very good history that Senator Joyce set out whereby farmers did have these powers to veto hydrocarbon exploration on their properties many years ago, but that was taken away.


My plea to the coalition, given the work that Senator Joyce and Senator Williams have done on coal seam gas, is to at least consider supporting parts (a) and (b) of this amendment. Those parts of the amendment ensure that a landowner has obtained independent legal advice and has obtained independent advice on the likely impacts of the taking of the action. I would have thought that, at the very least, the coalition should be going down that path because that is entirely consistent with their position. Having said that, my preference is to support the Greens amendment, because having informed consent is something that ought to be pursued in the absence of any other remedies for farmers.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Minister for Human Services) (13:55):  In closing, the proposed amendments require landholders and occupiers to consent before the environment minister can approve a project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in relation to the proposed water trigger. The proposed amendment would, in effect, allow a single owner or occupier of land to veto approvals of coal seam gas or coalmining development under the EPBC Act and in relation to the proposed water trigger. The government's advice is that there is constitutional uncertainty and risk associated with the proposed amendment and therefore the government does not support the proposed amendment.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:56): I welcome the government's commitment to oppose this amendment. I welcome very sincerely the fact that the government has corrected the record with regard to the advice that we heard yesterday that there are no constitutional impediments to any of the amendments before the Senate. Very clearly, there would be constitutional impediments in relation to this amendment proposed by the Greens. Very clearly, the Commonwealth would find itself going straight to the High Court from action taken by the states were this amendment to be adopted as legislation.


We should not forget at all, in looking at this amendment, that were it to be passed it would be a complete subversion of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, because the EPBC Act deals with environmental approvals. It deals with setting out the types of standards for maintaining appropriate matters of national environmental significance and protecting those matters when allowing developments to proceed, whether they be building developments, mining developments or whatever the nature of those developments might be. Nowhere else in the EPBC Act does it seek to or attempt to use its powers as some type of land management provision. That is what the Australian Greens are seeking to do with this amendment. They want to take and expand Commonwealth powers and the powers under the EPBC Act into a whole different world of activity by dragging them into approving and assessing whether or not landowners have given valid consent to the use of their land. That is a whole different realm to the consideration of whether or not an action or a development actually has an impact on the land in terms of matters of national environmental significance.


We need to appreciate that this amendment, along with further amendments to be addressed by the Greens—which I note the government has yet to rule out—would expand scope into national parks and otherwise. It is really a type of Trojan horse amendment by the Greens to expand the nature of this bill quite dramatically, beyond its initial intent. In many ways, I would question the validity of an amendment like this before the chair, because it goes so much further than the intent of the bill under question, and it goes so much further than the base and intent of the act that this bill seeks to amend.


As I outlined previously, there are arrangements in place with regard to how land access is provided for developments—land access in relation to both exploration and production. As Senator Joyce rightly pointed out and added to my remarks, the evolution of these access arrangements at a state level has been undertaken for more than a century—and the arrangements have changed over time—but a common theme and thread is that the minerals and resources in the ground have been recognised to be the minerals and resources from which the wealth that should be shared by the people of the state is generated. The Greens, by seeking to pursue an amendment like this, are attempting to deny the people of every state in Australia the opportunity to share in those resources and the opportunity to benefit from the wealth that the development of those resources can provide. The fact is that the development of those resources can be used to fund schools, can be used to fund hospitals and can be used to protect the environment in other ways.

"Waters, Sen Larissa",AG,2013-06-18,"



Senator WATERS
 (Queensland) (13:12):  Given that we were rather rushed last night in the five minutes we had to discuss this amendment, I will recap: the amendment would allow landholders the right to say no to coal and coal seam gas mining on their land. Many communities across the east coast are now banding together to demand that right. Today a poll has been released showing that 86 per cent of New South Wales residents want the right to say no; they want to be able to lock the gate and to be not breaking the law when they do so.


I take this opportunity to acknowledge in the public gallery some members of the Lock the Gate Alliance. The alliance has been very courageous in the stand it has taken against this industry, which, as we know, threatens groundwater, threatens the climate and of course threatens the reef, and is impacting on rural communities—and increasingly on urban communities as the coal seam gas industry encroaches on the cities as well. We are honoured to be moving this amendment to give those communities the right to lock the gate and to do so lawfully.


As I outlined last night, this amendment does not change the ownership of the resource, it is perfectly constitutional and it does not lessen any of the other environmental requirements. This is purely an amendment to strengthen the bargaining position of communities and allow them to lock the gate against this dangerous and risky industry.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2013-06-18,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (13:14):  I rise to say how critical this amendment is, particularly for the future of rural and regional Australia and particularly for areas that will be growing our food in the future. It is disgraceful that permission has been given for coal seam gas exploration when the precautionary principle would have told you they have no idea what the impact on groundwater or the Artesian Basin will be, yet they have allowed this to proceed. Furthermore, they have no idea how much fugitive emissions of methane are going from those coal seam gas sites into the atmosphere.


I started my political career supporting the farmers at Wesley Vale against the North Broken Hill pulp mill. I have been out with Senator Waters. I have been out in New South Wales with Kate Fairman and Jeremy Buckingham—they are members of parliament there. I have been to the Felton Valley, I have been to Moree, I have been through Lismore and I have been out onto the Liverpool Plains. Everywhere I go, farmers say to me that they cannot believe that they have been sold out so badly by both the Liberal and the National parties, who have told them for years that they support them in what they do. Yet, when push comes to shove, those parties are selling out to the coal industry and the coal seam gas industry against the best interests of protecting agricultural land and water into the future.


I have been on some of those properties and it is very, very clear—particularly with those black soils—that you will get massive erosion if you allow the infrastructure for coal seam gas onto those properties. But, apart from anything else, farmers and farming communities ought to have the right to say no. The anger out there is extreme because the political process has said, 'Where the most votes are counts the most.' They have changed the law to protect communities where there are votes, like Western Sydney, but they have left rural communities high and dry. I can tell you that people recognise—as Lester Brown has said many times—that in this century food security is a major challenge: those responsible for producing food particularly need to do it in the face of extreme weather events and in the face of agricultural land being lost to urbanisation and other pressures. We must protect this land and we must give farmers the right to say no to coal seam gas and coal on their properties.


This is the era— (Quorum formed) As I was saying, Lester Brown has recognised that food is the new oil in this century, and land and water are the new gold. It is about time that in Australia we recognise the pressure that the environment is under and we protect our land, water and rural communities. I think this is a critical amendment to give farmers the right to say no. We have heard from the Leader of the Opposition—depending on which station he is being interviewed on at the time—that sometimes he supports farmers rights to say no and at other times he does not. It is about time we actually had this tested in the parliament. This is going to be a very significant vote as to whether people actually do want to support farmers being able to stand up.


When I was out on the Liverpool Plains, I met a gentleman who was 70 years old; his name was Bill. He came down to talk to me and he said he had spent his 70 years building up his property to the state that it is in now. It is a very beautiful property and he said he never expected that he would have to spend the rest of his life defending it. That is a pretty powerful statement for a farmer to make. He has coal seam gas next door. Other communities, like at Moree, have locked the gates—and good on them. Communities around the country are trying to do the same.


They are up against it because of the power of the fossil fuel lobby. When you look at what has happened in New South Wales—with ICAC in particular—and you find out how many of these permits have been granted and what the conditions of those are, you really have to scratch your head and ask, 'Why haven't they been revoked, in light of how they were granted in the first place? How is it possible that farming communities are being wrought asunder and yet the people who have facilitated this are getting away with it?' As far as the government is concerned, it is very late for Tony Burke—now the minister—to be concerned about it after he approved every coal seam gas project that came across his desk until now, including the Gloucester facility. That is why the Greens have argued strongly that these laws should apply retrospectively, particularly to those projects that have not actually been started. And they should be applied retrospectively to those that have started, to the extent of them being forced to report on the water and atmospheric impacts of the fugitive emissions coming from those projects.


There is no excuse. Eighty per cent of the fossil fuel reserves should stay in the ground if we are to be serious about global warming and constraining global warming to less than two degrees. That means no more new fossil fuel industries. It makes no sense to be driving a fossil fuel industry at the end of the fossil fuel age. You cannot stand up in here, day after day, and say, 'I believe the climate science,' and in the next breath give the go-ahead to the biggest coal mines and massive coal seam gas facilities from one end of the country to the other. It makes no sense. It is totally hypocritical. You either believe this climate science and get on with rolling out 100 per cent renewables and protecting agricultural land and water or you accept the fact that you are a climate sceptic, that you do not believe the climate science and that is why you want to drive the fossil fuel industry.


But you cannot have it both ways, and it is about time people started to face up to that. We are seeing the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef as I stand here, as a result of new coal ports. We have the government and the coalition driving the opening up of coal in the Galilee Basin and the Bowen Basin. The Galilee Basin alone, if it were a separate country, would be producing seven per cent of the world's emissions when that coal is burned. It has to stay in the ground. It is not only a bad thing for the atmosphere but a bad thing for economic development. We cannot have people investing in companies when we know that the share value is going to be written off, because the value is based on reserves and these reserves are not accessible if you are serious about the climate science. Let us get back and protect our farmers; let us give them the right to say no.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,2,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-06-18,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:23):  The coalition will most definitely be opposing this amendment of the Greens. I inform the Senate that we do so because the words of Senator Waters and Senator Milne, in suggesting that this amendment does not in any way change ownership, ring quite hollow when you look at the actual wording of the amendment. The amendment states:


The Minister must not approve, for the purposes of the controlling provision, the taking of the action, unless the Minister is satisfied that any owner, and any occupier, of land that would be likely to be affected by the taking of the action:


(a)  has obtained independent legal advice; and


(b)  has obtained independent advice in relation to the likely impacts of the taking of the action; and


(c)  has freely given informed consent in relation to the taking of the action.


This amendment would have two consequences that obviously spring to mind. The first is that an owner of the immediate property in question would be able to block access indefinitely, with a blank cheque, for as long as they want, until effectively they have extracted the price that they want for such access. That is what the effect would be. Unlike the historical provisions that I will turn to in a second in relation to how state laws around access have been governed for a long time, this is a blank cheque to block action with no automatic recourse to mediation, no opportunity for any type of fairness of recognition that the states' ownership of the minerals or the resource or the petroleum resource comes into play in the consideration of things. By giving the title owner, the landowner, that blank cheque to block access, you effectively give them a blank cheque to extract whatever price they want for the minerals that are in the ground.


Secondly, I highlight the fact that this amendment talks about any owner and any occupier of land that 'would be likely to be affected' by the taking of action. Those are important words, because we are addressing in the totality of the bill before the Senate amendments that relate to water resources and the protection of those water resources. Fundamental to the recognition that we must protect those water resources is a recognition that those water resources stretch across title boundaries into adjoining properties. The coalition acknowledges there must be appropriate science and research for the protection of those resources, but this amendment would lead to the possibility that not just the owner of the land on which the exploration or development activity is taking place would have to give permission but potentially adjoining landowners would also have to give permission. You could have a situation where the landowner in questioning extracts the price they want and are happy for it to go ahead, but adjoining landowners find themselves with the opportunity to block access until they extract a price that they are happy with.


This flies in the face of the entire understanding of land-use management in the history of the Australian Federation. Throughout that history it has been recognised that land-use management decisions lie with state governments. That is the fundamental understanding that has existed. The words 'lock the gate' that are thrown around emotively at times—and I know they have been used as a campaign slogan in this very emotive debate—are a demonstration that this is about a desire to stop development. Senator Milne talked about the fact that the coal has to stay in the ground for climate change reasons—a demonstration that the Greens' involvement in this space is driven not by genuine concerns for landowners, farmers or those who might be affected by these developments but by broader political objectives of the Greens political party.


As I said, this goes against the longstanding practice of states in their exclusive regulation of this area. Those longstanding practices have evolved over the years in recognising that there should be some firm processes in place for how landowners give consent and how such consent is given fairly. It tries to balance, at the state level around Australia, a recognition that, whilst the resources in the ground may belong to the state, there is an issue around the landowners and that landowners need to be reasonably respected and treated in a fair way for the giving of consent.


In New South Wales, such things date back to before the Mining Act 1906, which dealt not just with gold and other minerals but also with mineral oils or petroleum in outlining the types of provisions for obtaining landholder consent. The Mining Act 1906 was updated in relation to petroleum and gaseous products in 1955 with the passage of the Petroleum Act 1955 in New South Wales. Section 50 of that act contains the following provisions:




50. 
The holder of any licence or lease under this Act shall not carry out any prospecting or mining operations or erect any works on the surface of any land which is under cultivation unless the owner or the owner and occupier, as the case may be, of such land has or have consented thereto:





Provided that—





(a) the Minister may, if he considers that the circumstances so warrant, define an area of the prospecting or mining operations may be carried out or works may be erected, and may specify the nature of the operations to be carried out or the works to be erected, but before any such operations are commenced or works are erected, the warden shall assess the amount to be paid as compensation for any loss of or damage to any crop on such cultivated land;





(b) cultivation for the growth and spread of pasture grasses shall not be deemed to be cultivation within the meaning of this section unless, in the opinion of the Minister, the circumstances so warrant; and





(c) in the case of dispute as to whether land is or is not under cultivation within the meaning of this section the Minister's decision thereon shall be final.





So, a process has long been established and was set out there in the Petroleum Act of 1955 at the New South Wales level. That provided for the fundamental decision that owner or occupier should provide consent but, equally, a mediation process was in place there where the minister provide consent if it could be agreed to and there should be independent assessment of appropriate compensation to be paid.





In 1991 the Petroleum Onshore Act was passed in New South Wales and replaced the 1955 act, but it contained in s. 71 an almost identical provision in relation to land under cultivation and similar activities. In 1994 there were amendments that removed the requirement for landholder consent in relation to exploration licences and assessment leases but not in relation to production leases. These are important distinctions—and distinctions that I will be moving further amendments in relation to—that clearly separate the treatment of exploration or assessment activities from production activities.





The amendments also inserted a new part 4(a), with similar land access provisions to those introduced into the Mining Act of 1989. So, we had a new part 4(a) of the Petroleum Onshore Act 1991 that provided that the holder of a prospecting title may not carry out prospecting operations on any private land otherwise than in accordance with an access agreement (a) agreed between the title holder and the owner and occupier of the land or (b) determined by an arbiter. Since 1994 these provisions have been slightly amended but essentially remain in force in New South Wales, as do similar provisions in other jurisdictions.





When the Greens come to this place and others go to the other place to argue that somehow there is not a process in place that respects the rights of landholders, that is simply a falsehood. There are laws in place—long-established laws, century-old laws at a state level—that very clearly respect the rights of landholders whilst also respecting the right of the state to access the minerals contained within the lands. That recognises that those minerals are an important asset of the people of the state, not just of the individual landowner. Those laws have sat there for 100-plus years in Australian history, and longer if you go to 
the individual jurisdictions and longer still in places overseas. Such laws recognise that appropriate processes which ideally cover an access arrangement between the licensed company, which is developing the mineral resource and extracting the mineral resources, and the landowner. If that cannot be achieved—if the landowner cannot reach reasonable terms with the licence owner—then the state steps in via arbitration and establishes what those fair terms should be.





The Greens' amendment would simply turn this long-established practice at a state level completely on its head and suddenly there would be a situation where not just immediate landowners but other landowners on surrounding properties would have a complete right of veto and the federal environment minister would sit above all of the different ministers and authorities at a state level to have the final yea or nay say, with no process in the Greens amendment for how disputes might be arbitrated.





We on the coalition side recognise that there is a genuine concern that exists in many communities about how provisions such as those I have outlined are applied in the states. There is a real concern to make sure they are applied transparently. There are genuine concerns too about the way governments, like the New South Wales Labor government, may have given out some mining leases. That reeks of corruption and no doubt will be proven to be acts of corruption. But that does not mean that for the entire Commonwealth of Australia we should turn a century-plus of established law-making on its head. That would potentially shut down the appropriate management of mineral resources around Australia and, in doing so, shut down exploration, assessment and production activities that may likely be undertaken in the future. Essentially, that would be the 
outcome of the amendment proposed by the Greens.




I trust that the government will equally be opposing this and will oppose it with a similar concern—not just for its effects on an industry that is important to Australia and not just to trample on the federation and the rights of states that this amendment undertakes but to recognise that there is an appropriate balance to be achieved here. Such a balance should ensure that landholders are rightly compensated where access to their land is granted as part of a mineral or petroleum licence and that communities rightly receive a level of support and recognition for the way mining or petroleum development impacts on those communities. The balance should also make sure the people of a state receive the benefits of the utilisation of the resources of that state.

They are the things that need to be balanced. They are the things that should be balanced in state laws, not through some blunt, crude amendment such as this one proposed by the Greens today, which I trust the chamber will rightly reject.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2013-06-18,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (13:37):  The issue here is that of course we acknowledge that landholders have an absolute right to what is present on their land. But, by reason of state governments over such a long period of time stealing hydrocarbonist materials from underneath their ground, they have lost those rights. They have lost those rights by reason of state government actions. In Queensland they lost them with the 1915 Petroleum Act. In South Australia, where Senator Birmingham is from and you too, Temporary Chairman, they lost them in 1971. In the Territory they lost them in 1953. In New South Wales Neville Wran gave a splendid second reading speech on how he was stealing those rights in 1983. That was quite recent. So it is very clear that, when people say that landholders never had the rights to coal, gas and oil underneath their places, that is not correct. They have never had the rights to silver, gold and iron ore, but they have had the rights to hydrocarbonist material. The problem is that to restore those rights you have to restore them at a state level. You cannot restore them at a federal level; you have to restore them at a state level.


I think it is a great idea to give those rights back to landholders at a state level from where they were stolen. That would obviously give landholders a vastly greater say in what is happening. I would presume, much to the dilemma of the Greens, that far from stopping the further development of mineral resources it would actually assist the further development of mineral resources just like it does in Texas and other places. We can see that once people realise there is a substantial return that gives their family a better standard of living they are more than willing to engage with the mining companies. What is happening at the moment is that they are getting ripped off. We have said this quite clearly a number of times. We did in the 2011 Senate inquiry, which I wrote the extension of terms for, to deal in a transparent way with coal seam gas.


It is important to understand the principles that the National Party stands behind. No. 1 is: do not go onto prime agricultural land. No. 2 is: do not destroy aquifers. Even though my political adversary put forward a bill for $150 million for further investigation and you would think prima facie that we would be fighting against it, I fought to make sure it was agreed to. No. 3 is: do not go next to people's quiet enjoyment. That is a term borrowed from rental tenancy agreements. No. 4 is: make sure a return goes back to the community. Royalties for Regions—who came up with that policy? It was the National Party. No. 5 is: there be a baseline agreement that one per cent of the returns from the well head go back to the landholder. They were additional comments signed off by the National Party. This gives a clear understanding. That would mean in some areas, where it is not prime agricultural land and it is not going to destroy aquifers or be next to the quiet enjoyment of someone's house, a person gets a chance for a fair return.


The best well in Queensland, in Roma, returns $1 million a day. A one per cent return per year from that well would be around $3.3 million. That would be a great return for that landholder. That would be a great return for the town of Roma—or for Wallumbilla, Dulacca or Injune. It would give people the capacity to get a real return back into their local community. The person most likely to spend that money would of course be the landholder on whose property the well is. A very average well returns around $30,000 to $40,000 per day, so you are looking at in excess of $100,000 a year per well.


These are the sorts of things that would deal with so many arguments. What are they getting at the moment? We found one person who got a slab of beer. One person got $240 a year. Some people thought they were really getting ahead when they were getting $1,500 a year. It was only the Senate inquiry that brought transparency and gave a clear understanding of just how much was involved and how people should be getting a fairer return.


In the state of Texas in the United States of America they get 25 per cent of the gross at the well head. Then the federal government comes and taxes the landholder and then the state government comes and taxes the landholder. Do they have any problems with access agreements? Surprisingly, no. They have no problems with access agreements whatsoever. In fact, if you find a shoe box you will find an oil well or something sitting on top of it, because people are making quite a substantial return out of it. I think once this logic is taken on board, not by the federal government but by state governments and the mining companies, then a lot of these problems that have been dealt with here will be ironed out.


However, I do not think changing over constitutional law at a federal level is going to work. I do not quite know how that one is going to work today. What we have here, as always with the Greens—because I do not think this has not been supported in the lower house by any in the Labor Party or by the Independents—is a classic case of a form of a wedge. They do it for the purposes of saying, 'We'll work on the presumption that nobody actually knows what this is about.' At first blush they will say, 'This is just what we are looking for.' But the reality is that not only would it be constitutionally unviable; it just completely belies the historical facts that sit behind this thing, which is that you are looking for rights that are held by the states. You are trying to put conditions on them at a federal level and that is just not going to work.

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2013-06-18,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (13:44):  I would like to add some comments to this and ask some questions. Senator Milne said that food is the new oil. I tend to agree with her. Food is vital. But it always amazes me when we see properties like Toorale Station, with 93,000 hectares of good food-producing country, locked up, bought out and made into a national park to burn. That is what will happen to Toorale Station. It will burn, as sure as I am speaking here now, with no management, a lack of hazard reduction, fuel on the ground and no grazing. They say, 'Let's just lock the property up and let it burn.' As sure as I speak the rain will fall, the grass will grow, and then we will get the dry time. Then along comes a thunderstorm and the lightning will set off the fire on 93,000 hectares of country that has not been grazed for years. There will be up to 100 or 150 tonnes to a hectare of fuel, just like it was in the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, where half the country burned—it just happened in national parks. Of course, you cannot allow grazing in national parks; that is not allowed following the Greens' pressure on Minister Tony Burke. The coalition government put cattle into the alpine country to reduce those very fuel levels.


We see it in the Pilliga, between Narrabri and Moree, where the country has been locked up for national parks. It used to be forest. It used to be managed. It used to be grazed. And we see the hot fires go through with so much fuel, getting up into the crowns of the trees and killing them, where the koalas are literally cooked. If there is a huge fire on a hot day the strong wind goes through these huge fuel levels.


We have the irony of the Greens, where food is the new oil, and they say, 'Let's just lock up our food-growing country in the national parks. Let it burn! Let it destroy the environment!' Around 90 million tonnes of carbon dioxide was estimated to come out of the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria. But we have a carbon tax to reduce our carbon emissions. This is crazy! Let's let the country burn! Let the animals be killed and sizzled—koalas, native species, you name it! I find it quite amazing.


It is a fact that this country needs energy. When Senator Milne and the Greens can convince me that you can power a 9400 model John Deere tractor at about 380 or 400 horsepower, towing a 60- or 70-foot wide air seeder with a fertiliser and grain bin—when you can power that tractor with a solar panel on the roof of that tractor, I am going to be simply amazed. We need diesel to power that tractor. Perhaps the Greens want us to go back to the Clydesdale horse days with a single-furrow mouldboard plough, walking alongside. Shut the machines down! We need energy and here we have clean energy in Australia—gas—with fewer emissions, and it is not imported. So let's shut down gas! The current situation in New South Wales is that 95 per cent of the gas is imported into New South Wales. But let's close it all down. Then when people are knocking down the doors in my office asking, 'Why is gas so expensive?' I can say, 'Blame the Greens,' and lock the gate on others for shutting down industries. We have made it quite clear where the Nationals stand on this issue.


I am disappointed that Senator Milne has left the chamber, because I wanted to ask: if this amendment went through the Senate, where the farmer could say no to anyone going onto the property for mining projects, coal seam gas or whatever, how is it going to be enforced at a federal level when the land is controlled by the states? I want an answer to that. How are you going to enforce it as a federal law? I find that simply amazing. This is not about the farmers having a say, this is about a political wedge. That is all this is about.


When I talk to the large gas companies in Australia, they say they do not go onto properties when the farmers say, 'We don't want you here.' That has been the message clearly put to me. What I am saying is that we need energy. We need gas. We also need to look after our environment for future generations. One of the most, if not the most, important parts of our environment is the very topsoil that grows our food, not only for the 23 million Australians but also for millions of others around the world relying on the food production here in Australia. It is all very good to say, 'Let's shut this down, let's shut that down, let's go back and live in a cave and we'll issue three sticks of wood for a week—that's your quota to keep warm and do your cooking.' But that is not the real world. We live in the real world, where we need energy and we need to produce.


My leader in the Senate, Senator Joyce, just made quite clear to the Senate the policy that was released in November 2011: look after the land, look after the water, look after the environment, give a fair go. And here are the Greens looking for a wedge. How are we going to enforce this law? The minerals are owned by the states—the Crown—and the Rann government stole that off the farmers in 1981 or 1983 in New South Wales, with no compensation, just like when they shut down the farming country with the Native Vegetation Conservation Act. I was very pleased last week to hear Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner addressing that crazy issue.


I can give you an example about the food bowl, as Senator Milne said. If you have a farming country in New South Wales and you do not plough it for 10 years, then you are not allowed to plough it again. If you plough a good country you will get a tonne to the acre of wheat—you will yield 1,000 kilograms of wheat. Or you can leave it as grazing country under the native veg act and you might rear 20 or 25 kilograms, perhaps five kilograms of wool. Here we have the food bowl producing food, but under the Greens plan—and Senator Bob Carr, when Premier of New South Wales, said it would be the greenest government the state has ever seen—we have shut down the farmers from growing food and being productive. And what was the compensation? The compensation was zilch. Make the property owners pay for the environmental issues.


So do not ever talk about food being the new oil when the Greens' history is of shutting down the production of food in New South Wales. The history proves it. Thank goodness the New South Wales government is, after its inquiry, about to address that issue and bring some fairness back into the whole environmental debate in New South Wales. The landowners have been caned by the Greens; Senator Bob Carr; the minister—as John Laws used to refer to him, Kimberly Maxwell Yeadon—who we thought had a very capable staff; and Senator Penny Wong. This is the group hanging together, saying, 'Shut down the farmers, don't give them any compensation and don't worry about producing food.' That has been a problem in this country for too long.


We take our supply of food for granted. Around the rest of the world we see subsidies given to the farmers, and we have to compete against them. The point I make—and we made it quite clear—is that we need balance. We need energy, or you will take us back to the Clydesdales, walking behind the horse with the single-furrow plough and a couple of Clydesdales hooked together—a very slow process.


We have become a modern machinery farming enterprise, with huge production. We will not be going back to the horses. We will use energy. We require energy, and diesel will be part of that energy. Let us just shut down our local clean energy in gas and import diesel. Is that the plan? Is that the balance of payments plan? Is that the environmental plan? Is it to close down the clean energy and gas being produced in Australia? As I said, this amendment is simply a wedge piece by the Greens.


I wish Senator Milne were here to explain how they are going to enforce this. No-one takes more pride than our farmers and those who have lived all their lives in rural Australia and been on the land. I wish Senator Milne were here to answer this question—or perhaps Senator Waters might. How is this going to be enforced? If this were to go through, what law can the federal government enforce when the control of the land is under the Crown? Are they just going to change the Constitution with the wave of a stick and perform magic? We all know how hard it is to change the Constitution. That is the very point I make. I am sure my colleague Senator Birmingham has more to add to this.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-06-18,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (13:53):  I indicate my support for this amendment with some reluctance, because it seems to me that the status quo is not adequate. Senator Joyce did point out very well that there is a complete lack of balance of power between the farmers and some of these companies that buy in coal seam gas, that some people receive something like a slab of beer in extreme cases, when many millions of dollars are being made from these wells.


In terms of the constitutional issues which Senator Williams and, I think, Senator Birmingham as well referred to, I do not think there is an issue about the Commonwealth's ability in using this act or other powers, including the corporations power, to effectively legislate in this field. I note that the numbers are not with the Greens with this amendment, particularly in relation to the issue of informed consent on the part of a farmer for their land to be used in this way. I also note the very good history that Senator Joyce set out whereby farmers did have these powers to veto hydrocarbon exploration on their properties many years ago, but that was taken away.


My plea to the coalition, given the work that Senator Joyce and Senator Williams have done on coal seam gas, is to at least consider supporting parts (a) and (b) of this amendment. Those parts of the amendment ensure that a landowner has obtained independent legal advice and has obtained independent advice on the likely impacts of the taking of the action. I would have thought that, at the very least, the coalition should be going down that path because that is entirely consistent with their position. Having said that, my preference is to support the Greens amendment, because having informed consent is something that ought to be pursued in the absence of any other remedies for farmers.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Minister for Human Services) (13:55):  In closing, the proposed amendments require landholders and occupiers to consent before the environment minister can approve a project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act in relation to the proposed water trigger. The proposed amendment would, in effect, allow a single owner or occupier of land to veto approvals of coal seam gas or coalmining development under the EPBC Act and in relation to the proposed water trigger. The government's advice is that there is constitutional uncertainty and risk associated with the proposed amendment and therefore the government does not support the proposed amendment.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2013-06-18,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (13:56): I welcome the government's commitment to oppose this amendment. I welcome very sincerely the fact that the government has corrected the record with regard to the advice that we heard yesterday that there are no constitutional impediments to any of the amendments before the Senate. Very clearly, there would be constitutional impediments in relation to this amendment proposed by the Greens. Very clearly, the Commonwealth would find itself going straight to the High Court from action taken by the states were this amendment to be adopted as legislation.


We should not forget at all, in looking at this amendment, that were it to be passed it would be a complete subversion of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, because the EPBC Act deals with environmental approvals. It deals with setting out the types of standards for maintaining appropriate matters of national environmental significance and protecting those matters when allowing developments to proceed, whether they be building developments, mining developments or whatever the nature of those developments might be. Nowhere else in the EPBC Act does it seek to or attempt to use its powers as some type of land management provision. That is what the Australian Greens are seeking to do with this amendment. They want to take and expand Commonwealth powers and the powers under the EPBC Act into a whole different world of activity by dragging them into approving and assessing whether or not landowners have given valid consent to the use of their land. That is a whole different realm to the consideration of whether or not an action or a development actually has an impact on the land in terms of matters of national environmental significance.


We need to appreciate that this amendment, along with further amendments to be addressed by the Greens—which I note the government has yet to rule out—would expand scope into national parks and otherwise. It is really a type of Trojan horse amendment by the Greens to expand the nature of this bill quite dramatically, beyond its initial intent. In many ways, I would question the validity of an amendment like this before the chair, because it goes so much further than the intent of the bill under question, and it goes so much further than the base and intent of the act that this bill seeks to amend.


As I outlined previously, there are arrangements in place with regard to how land access is provided for developments—land access in relation to both exploration and production. As Senator Joyce rightly pointed out and added to my remarks, the evolution of these access arrangements at a state level has been undertaken for more than a century—and the arrangements have changed over time—but a common theme and thread is that the minerals and resources in the ground have been recognised to be the minerals and resources from which the wealth that should be shared by the people of the state is generated. The Greens, by seeking to pursue an amendment like this, are attempting to deny the people of every state in Australia the opportunity to share in those resources and the opportunity to benefit from the wealth that the development of those resources can provide. The fact is that the development of those resources can be used to fund schools, can be used to fund hospitals and can be used to protect the environment in other ways.

Does the minister agree with the AFP Deputy Commissioner, who said that law enforcement agencies around the world rely heavily on Interpol red notices and take in good faith the accuracy and content of them, and who also testified that, in his experience, he had not encountered an inaccurate notice; or does the minister support the view of the immigration minister, who stated yesterday in relation to red notices that quite often claims have been found to be wrong?

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (14:01):  No, I do not accept the premise of the question at all. As Mr O'Connor has said on a number of occasions, there is no contradiction here at all. Mr O'Connor has full confidence in the operational decision making of not only the AFP but every one of our hardworking security agencies. Mr O'Connor pointed out that he would have expected those opposite to already know that the AFP takes Interpol red notices very seriously and examines very carefully the veracity of the claims made in each notice, and in this instance Interpol did reissue a red notice in relation to a person. It is a simple statement of fact to say that from time to time Interpol notices are updated and amended.




Senator Cash:
  Mr President, I rise in relation to a point of order on relevance. I did not ask the minister about general statements that the minister for immigration had made. I asked the minister about a specific statement that the minister made yesterday, that statement being that, quite often, claims have been found to be wrong in relation to Interpol red notices. I contrasted that with the statement made by the AFP Deputy Commissioner, which was completely in opposition to that, and I asked the minister which statement he supported. I would therefore ask you to direct the minister to the question.



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Collins.




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Mr President, this is not a point of order. Senator Cash has taken the opportunity to express her views in what should be limited to a point of order. Senator Conroy was making general statements which are indeed relevant to the context of this question. Any suggestion that general statements rather than specific statements might be not relevant is ludicrous in this case.



The PRESIDENT:  I took it that the minister had finished his answer. That was my interpretation of the minister sitting down. But, if there is a point of order, the minister, as far as I was concerned, had concluded his answer. So there is no point of order at this stage, Senator Cash.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cash and Cormann today relating to asylum seekers.


I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Conroy and Senator Wong to questions asked by Senators Cash and Cormann. The answer that Minister Conroy gave in relation to the question that I asked him today confirms without a doubt this government's contempt for border protection policy and national security in Australia. I asked what was an exceptionally important question in relation to the almost non-detention of a then convicted jihadist terrorist. The minister, in answering my question, said the opposition were 'engaging in serial, reckless fear-mongering'. If that type of answer does not confirm that, when it comes to national security, those on the other side packed up their bags and left a long time ago, then I do not know what does. Those on the other side are now responsible for the greatest number of illegal arrivals to come to Australia in our history.


As at today, we have 42,520 people who have arrived here illegally by boat. Australia is currently trending at 100 people arriving per day. You have to remember to put that into context. The reason that the current Prime Minister politically executed the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd—and in a few days we will have the third anniversary of that—was that he had failed to stop the boats. If Mr Rudd had failed to stop the boats, I do not know what the Australian people must think the current Prime Minister has done. Maybe next week that will be the answer to the political execution of Ms Gillard: that Ms Gillard made a number of promises when she took over on 24 June 2010 and she has failed to discharge one of those promises. Let's wait and see what happens next week.


Most policy makers would acknowledge that the No.1 priority of any Commonwealth government is the security of its nation and its borders. If you do not have secure nations and if you do not have strong border protection in a country, then quite frankly you have nothing. If a government is serious about ensuring the security of its borders it will take action in terms of policy that does just that. But, when it comes to securing the borders of this country, this government gave up a long time ago. If we want further proof of that, it is what happened in relation to the Egyptian terrorist—the man with an INTERPOL Red Notice issued against him—who came here by boat, got through our immigration detention vetting process and was released into very low-security detention. The question that the Australian people need to ask is: how does it happen that a convicted jihadist terrorist can present himself to ASIO, the Federal Police and the immigration department and no-one seems to pick up that he is a convicted jihadist terrorist with an INTERPOL Red Notice against his name? The seriousness of the INTERPOL Red Notice has to be taken into consideration, because there was another man who had an INTERPOL Red Notice against his name and that man was Osama bin Laden.


Perhaps what is more serious is the contempt with which the Prime Minister reacted when she was made aware that a convicted jihadist terrorist was sunning it up in the Adelaide Hills. Basically, as far as the Prime Minister and those on the other side were concerned, it was not a breach of national security or a failure to protect our borders; it was just another incident under a failed Labor government. That is just not good enough. The government, through their handling of and response to this incident, have shown Australians that they have well and truly given up when it comes to border protection and national security in this country.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:08):  I rise to contradict much of what Senator Cash has just contributed to the chamber. Once again we have scare tactics—'Let's go out and scare people as much as we can. Let's inflame the conversations that might be had around the water cooler. Let's not talk about the measures that this government has actually implemented since it has been in government. Let's just keep on the very negative track that we have taken since we went into opposition. We can keep talking about the negative aspects. We can refer to people as being ""illegal"" when arriving in boats. We can talk about this, but we do not have to always talk about the facts.'


We know that those opposite seem to refer to The Australian on a regular basis. That is where they get their research material from when it comes to question time and tactics. I can understand that if you are as bereft of talent as they are on that side, that is probably what you have to do. I would just like to refer to Admiral Chris Barrie, former Chief of the Defence Force, and what he had to say on the opposition's policy of 'Stop the boats. Tow them back.' We can see Mr Abbott in his speedos swimming out to the boats and saying, 'Stop, stop. Don't come any further. You have to go back.' How ridiculous. I wonder how many of those people on the other side have actually spoken to any of the men and women in the Australian Navy who were put in that position in the past under the Howard government. How many have you actually spoken to? I have spoken to them. I have relatives in the Navy. They have been very, very emotional circumstances in which they have found themselves. That is not motivation for going into the Australian Navy. They are not there to make the decisions that the government should be making by having good policies like we have.


I will just come back to some comments that Admiral Chris Barrie made. He said: 'You can imagine that the opposition in government might be able to secure an arrangement with Indonesia. It might be possible for two armed forces to work together to execute some sort of policy. What worries me is that we have not got that far and we are making statements about what we are going to do without the agreement of the government of Indonesia. I connected the dots on this. When I look at the numbers that are starting to arrive in boats now, I wonder to myself if this is connected to the 14 September election date. Furthermore, it puts our people in the Navy, Border Protection Command and Customs in a very difficult situation—being, if you like, between the jaws of dealing compassionately with these people who want to come to Australia and policy being driven by people who frankly really do not want to see the problems for what they are. Putting our commanders and ships' companies in that situation, I think, is a terrible position for us to be in.'


He is quite right. It is a terrible position for us to be in. But, once again, when it comes to question time, we have those on the opposition resorting to scare tactics, trying to talk up the negativity that they are renowned for. They do not ask questions about the economy and how strong it is. They are not asking questions about the government's job plan. They do not come in here and ask any questions about reform in aged care and the benefits that that will bring to older Australians. They are not talking about the groundbreaking NDIS and the better quality of life that that is going to bring to those with disability and the better employment opportunities for those same people. Mr Deputy President, you yourself would know of the great benefit there is going to be for young Tasmanians with the pilot project that has been launched in our home state of Tasmania. These are the issues that this government has tackled—the hard decisions—after 11½ very long years of inaction from those opposite on the big issues.


The NBN was talked about in question time today. We are all of course concerned about the asbestos that has been found. But the opposition will not acknowledge the benefit that the NBN is going to bring to Tasmania and to the rest of the country, particularly rural Australia. Rural and regional residents are going to have the same capacity as those in the larger metropolitan cities. Here we are in the final two weeks of this parliament and what are they doing?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2013-06-18,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (15:13):  This Labor government has comprehensively stuffed up our border protection arrangements. By comprehensively stuffing up our border protection arrangements not only have they recklessly and irresponsibly put our national security at risk; they have also put huge additional pressure on our budget. Just as a result of Labor's ongoing border protection fiasco, the budget for this year is not worth the paper it was written on. You have to remember that the previous coalition government had fixed this problem. Through genuine offshore processing of all illegal arrivals, through temporary protection visas to ensure people smugglers no longer had a product to sell and by turning around these boats coming from Indonesia with Indonesian crew whenever it was safe to do so, the previous coalition government had fixed the problem.


But this Labor government, first led by then Prime Minister Rudd with Deputy Prime Minister Gillard at the time, thought they knew better. They comprehensively dismantled what was a successful policy framework and the results were there to see almost immediately. If you look at the graph over a long-term period you will see that as soon as the Labor government dismantled the policy framework on border protection that was put in place by the Howard government there was a huge spike in illegal boat arrivals that has not been reversed. Under this government, since they weakened our previously strong border protection arrangements, there have been 44,452 illegal arrivals on 724 boats. This year alone there have been 24,541 illegal arrivals on 384 boats.


The reason that is important is that this government's budget in 2012-13, incredibly and unbelievably, was based on an assumption that there would be just 5,400 illegal arrivals. In MYEFO they updated that to 12,000 illegal arrivals for 2012-13. But, guess what? The actual number of illegal arrivals so far is more than 4.5 times as high as what was predicted in the budget and twice as high as what was predicted in MYEFO.


I asked the minister today whether she stood by the prediction in the budget that between this year and next year the number of illegal arrivals would fall by about 46 per cent. The minister gave us a lecture on the methodology that was set out in the budget papers—we already knew that. But the one thing that the minister refused to do today was stand by the budget projection that the number of illegal arrivals by boat would reduce by 46 per cent. The reason for that is that she cannot. Given the current trend of about 100 illegal arrivals a day by boat, if the policies of the current government continue there is no way that there will be a sudden drop next year to just 36 illegal arrivals a day, as is predicted by the minister for finance in the expenditure projections in the budget. We call on the secretaries of Treasury and Finance to reflect on the current trend of illegal arrivals by boat and, if the government's current policy settings are maintained, make whatever adjustments to the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook they consider to be appropriate in their objective and independent judgment.


The government's record on border protection is outrageously incompetent. It has been an extraordinary fiasco. It is one that was predictable and was indeed predicted by the coalition. Not only have we a situation where we have had more than 44,000 illegal arrivals, we have actually had boats arrived in Geraldton undetected. For the people of Sydney that is the equivalent of an illegal boat arriving undetected in Port Macquarie. It is completely unacceptable. We have had a person with an INTERPOL Red Notice—a convicted jihadist terrorist—housed behind a pool fence. This government has to go just because of the absolute and comprehensive failure of its border protection arrangements. (Time expired)

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (15:18):  We talk about immigration policy and straightaway we go to the politicising of the very nature of that policy. What the questions asked today and this motion by the opposition to take note have demonstrated are the very politicising of the incredibly complex issue that is immigration.


We know very well that this is not a straightforward issue. That is why we had experts in the field—experts from the military and from civil society—come together to provide expert policy advice for us, to look at the way we could improve immigration policy issues in this country. As members of the expert panel have said, the results will begin to show when the full suite of measures is implemented. But the relentless negativity of the opposition has prevented us from doing that. They do not want a solution on this issue because they want to continue to be able to politicise and create negativity and divisiveness within the Australian community.


It is very timely that we should be talking about this, because this is Refugee Week. It is a week in which we reflect on the contribution that refugees have made to our nation. It is a week in which we reflect on the contribution by made refugees who have settled here; who have come from war-torn countries, from places of conflict, to settle and live a life of comfort, stability and freedom and to rebuild their lives. It is a week in which we reflect upon the heritage that they have, upon the families perhaps that they have left behind in order to settle, rebuild and create a new life here. We welcome them to do so. We welcome them because we are a supportive, compassionate nation. We are a nation that is a signatory to the refugee convention, which entails us to take in a number of refugees a year—as do other developed countries around the world, such as the US, the European Union and the like—to ensure that we can do our bit for the displaced people around the world. It is a compassionate policy. We in the Labor Party stand by it because we are a party based on the values of compassion, equality and doing what is right for people. However, those on the other side want to do the opposite. They want to demonise and politicise when it comes to issues regarding those who are seeking asylum in this country. We have just heard all of it from Senator Cormann, who was talking about illegals. I do not know how many times he uses the word 'illegals'—he loves that word 'illegals'; it is a positive word, isn't it?



Honourable senators interjecting—




Senator SINGH:
  Let us talk about illegal immigrants all the time! It is a divisive word, Senator Cormann. You are deliberately politicising this issue by using that sort of language because you want to divide the nation. The nation needs to wake up and recognise—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Singh, please do not place your comments across the chamber; direct them to the chair. Senators on my left: please do not interject.




Senator SINGH:
  My apologies, Mr Deputy President. It is the divisive language being used by the opposition that leads this issue to becoming a very politicised one. I found it disrespectful that, while I was trying to listen to Senator Wong's answer to Senator Cormann's question during question time, all I heard was heckling by Senator Cormann. I do not think he actually wanted to hear the answer from Senator Wong. Again, he just wanted to add fuel to the fire and politicise the issue. We know that, when it comes to this issue, the opposition do not have anything but slogans to offer—very simple words like 'stop the boats'.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator SINGH:
  Can you stop the boats? On the issue of stopping the boats, Julie Bishop has been contradicted by the Indonesian ambassador on her line of 'Yes, we're going to work with the Indonesia and turn back the boats.' That is absolutely untrue. There is no support from the Indonesian government for the opposition's policy to turn back boats. It is complete nonsense. I wonder how much longer we are going to hear these slogans of 'stopping the boats' and 'turning back the boats' when the opposition know very clearly that they are actually damaging our relationship with Indonesia. The opposition continually raise this issue like it is all done and dusted, when that is certainly far from the case. (Time expired)

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:23):  I have just been sitting back, flabbergasted, by what I have just heard from Senator Singh, because, in essence, what she has been saying for five minutes is that the current government's border protection policies are good, that they work and that she supports them. I am astonished that someone—anyone, actually—on that side of the chamber could get up and, hand on heart, defend the chaotic and irresponsible approach on border protection that prevails in this country.


I will just pick up on a couple of comments that Senator Polley made. I actually have a lot of personal regard for Senator Polley, but it does concern me that, when those opposite are asked about this issue, their response is such a defensive and reactive one. They direct their criticism at us, and all they can talk about is negative politics and scare tactics. The facts of the matter are quite simple, and that is that the failure of the border protection policies of this government is a national disgrace. Every one of you on that side of the chamber should bow your heads in shame at what is facing this country. It is a national disgrace.


It does not matter, as Senator Cash has already raised today, who is the leader of this Labor government: it does not matter whether it is Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith; it does not matter whether it is the current Prime Minister. The fact of the matter is that every one of them has supported this public policy, which has consistently failed year after year, month after month, week after week and day after day. As my colleagues Senator Cash and Senator Cormann have said, we are now seeing on average 100 unlawful maritime arrivals each and every day. The consequences of that for this country are huge. Until the senators on that side of the chamber get their heads around the national security significance of that and, may I say, the humanitarian consequences of that, they are actually condemning us all by their very actions.


This is an example of yet another promise that Prime Minister Gillard has broken—just as she has done with the carbon tax promise and just as she has done with so many of her other promises. I remember one of the very early ones that she made when she was education minister: every child at school will have a laptop. Everybody has stopped talking about that one, because that is just one of dozens of promises that she has broken either as a minister of this government or as the Prime Minister. But I have to say that this promise is one that the government will go down in history for and be judged on. Australians hold this Gillard government in contempt for their chaotic and shambolic approach to border protection, and of all their policies it will go down in history as the most damning one. We have heard, yet again, the government's denial of the significance of their failure with border protection policies for this country.


Senator Cash, today, quite rightly raised questions in relation to how the INTERPOL Red Notices were dealt with. These were matters that I raised during estimates. I asked how the integrity of the INTERPOL Red Notices were assessed, how they were ascertained and what the process was. Yet, what we heard from the minister responding today was just a rant. He did not deal with the essence of that question. He could not assure us as to how that was dealt with.


I want to briefly return to Senator Polley's question about whether any of us on this side have spent time with Customs and Border Protection officers or Navy men and women who are dealing with this issue. I have to tell her that, yes, we have. Only a couple of weeks ago, officers were telling me how difficult they are finding it. They did not join the Navy to be a ferry service; they joined to protect our country—and I support them in the work they do.


Question agreed to.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:34):  by leave—I present to the Senate a non-conforming petition relating to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to the petition.


Leave granted.




Senator PRATT:
  I acknowledge this petition and the lead petitioner, Jacob Lancaster, as well as all of the other young men and their families who have been in parliament today. Jacob has said in this petition: 'I am one of thousands of young Australians with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. I have not been able to walk for many years. My heart and breathing muscles are failing. My arms are so weak I can no longer lift a pen. Eventually, it will take my life. Clinical trials are the only hope we have, but we need money to fund them. Can you please help us?'


That petition is signed by Jacob and 32,049 other signatories using a mechanical arm. It is a really powerful way of sending a message about the way Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects the lives of thousands of young Australians, and the need for our nation to fund research to do something about it.


Petition received.

Name of bill:



Homelessness Bill 2013




Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:



The homelessness sector believes the bill is not rights based legislation (as was promised originally) that demonstrates or explicitly states the government is progressively committed to providing affordable housing.


As such, funding for homelessness services and housing provided under the National Affordable Housing Agreement and in the National Rental Affordable Scheme for example should be covered in a homelessness bill. No financial arrangements or commitments are covered in this bill.


It's also a confusing bill that talks about rights and obligations under Human Rights treaties-but the bill ends by stating it cancels out any legal obligation to give an avenue for recourse with regard to those treaties. Finally the definition of homelessness is problematic to the sector.


The homelessness sector is extremely concerned and disappointed this Bill has no teeth and adds no value to the homelessness response.


The long delay for this Bill is also a reason for concern. The bill was a recommendation from the Inquiry as part of the government's White Paper on homelessness in 2009.

Senator McEWEN:
  I move:


That the report be adopted.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Selection of Bills Committee</title>,COMMITTEES,6,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2013-06-18,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:40):  I speak to the motion that the report be adopted, to commend the adoption of report No. 6 and also to express my delight and surprise that the committee and the government accepted a number of the reference proposals that the opposition put forward to the committee, particularly in relation to some education bills and migration bills. I was also delighted and surprised that the government accepted the reporting dates that the opposition proposed.


I express my sincerest desire that the committees to which these references have been made feel under absolutely no pressure from the government to adopt reporting dates which would seek to circumvent the proper examination of the legislation that has been referred to these committees. I am sure that will not happen, but it would be disturbing if these committees felt pressured by the government to perhaps report earlier than the date which has been agreed upon by the committee and the dates which have been accepted by the Senate chamber.


I thought it was important to put on record my pleasure and delight at the work of the committee, the fact that it looks like the chamber will unanimously adopt this report, and that it would be a bad precedent if pressure were brought to bear on the committees in question to seek to subvert the will expressed by the committees and the will that is, I think, about to be expressed by this chamber. I am sure all interested stakeholders will be watching closely.


Question agreed to.

The long delay for this Bill is also a reason for concern. The bill was a recommendation from the Inquiry as part of the government's White Paper on homelessness in 2009.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:40):  I speak to the motion that the report be adopted, to commend the adoption of report No. 6 and also to express my delight and surprise that the committee and the government accepted a number of the reference proposals that the opposition put forward to the committee, particularly in relation to some education bills and migration bills. I was also delighted and surprised that the government accepted the reporting dates that the opposition proposed.


I express my sincerest desire that the committees to which these references have been made feel under absolutely no pressure from the government to adopt reporting dates which would seek to circumvent the proper examination of the legislation that has been referred to these committees. I am sure that will not happen, but it would be disturbing if these committees felt pressured by the government to perhaps report earlier than the date which has been agreed upon by the committee and the dates which have been accepted by the Senate chamber.


I thought it was important to put on record my pleasure and delight at the work of the committee, the fact that it looks like the chamber will unanimously adopt this report, and that it would be a bad precedent if pressure were brought to bear on the committees in question to seek to subvert the will expressed by the committees and the will that is, I think, about to be expressed by this chamber. I am sure all interested stakeholders will be watching closely.

Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:44):  I, and on behalf of Senators Abetz, Birmingham, Payne, Ronaldson and Smith, move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes:


(i) that although nearly 70 years have passed since the end of World War II and the Holocaust, antisemitism still exists,


(ii) the vital work of the London Declaration on Combating Antisemitism in drawing the attention of the democratic world to the resurgence of antisemitism in international affairs, politics and society, and


(iii) that more than 125 parliamentarians in over 40 countries have signed the Declaration;


(b) recognises the vast contributions made by the Jewish people to Australian society;


(c) expresses its solidarity with the Jewish people;


(d) affirms that antisemitic prejudice, rhetoric and hate campaigns, such as the Boycott, Divestments and Sanctions campaign, utterly contradict the democratic values Australian society and the Parliament hold dear; and


(e) encourages all senators, regardless of party or politics, to sign the Declaration and so assist to combat antisemitism across the globe.


I seek leave to make a short statement.


Leave granted.




Senator KROGER:
  The London Declaration on Combating Antisemitism, a declaration that asserts the need for international cooperation to fight anti-Semitism, is regrettably necessary today, just as it was 70 years ago. It is deeply disturbing that, whilst decades have past since World War II, when the world witnessed the holocaust, we are witnessing a resurgence in anti-Semitism across the globe that is manifesting itself in all sorts of ways. Only last week, I attended an event hosted by the Victorian state government to celebrate the 65th anniversary of Israel's Independence Day. Walking into that venue, I saw some 100 police inside and outside the doors. They were concerned about trouble that they had been advised was possible, and they were there to secure all—an extraordinary situation in Melbourne, a site where we have seen the BDS movement boycotting the Max Brenner chocolate business. I challenge all to expose those who engage in this racist behaviour and commend all coalition members and senators for supporting this.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (15:46):  by leave—I indicate the Greens will not be supporting this motion, but we will not be calling a division. The Australian Greens defend the right of all persons to be able to live in an environment without discrimination and violence. We do not tolerate or endorse anti-Semitism and we condemn all forms of discrimination on the basis of race, culture, ethnicity, religion or nationality. The Greens have championed antivilification legislation around Australia. It is an important mechanism in encouraging a tolerant community.


We oppose the motion and will not be signing the London declaration, which equates anti-Semitism with criticisms of the State of Israel. It is legitimate to criticise Israel for its actions against the Palestinian people, including blockades and expanding settlements. While the Australian Greens do not and have not supported the BDS campaign, we also do not believe the motion accurately reflects the campaign. The Australian Greens policy supports the legitimate rights and aspirations of both the Israeli and the Palestinian people to live in peace and security in their own independent sovereign states. It is the Greens view that the only way to achieve this is through a comprehensive, negotiated settlement of the conflict leading to a two-state solution with Israel and a Palestinian state living side by side within secure and internationally recognised borders.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (15:49):  I present the explanatory memorandum and move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT (GET A WARRANT) BILL 2013


This Bill strengthens the rules about collecting data about Australians. It returns us to the normal warrant procedures whee a law enforcement agency is required to obtain a warrant before accessing a person's private data.


Currently Australian law enforcement agencies (other than ASIO) are able to access vast amounts of private data without getting a warrant. This information includes data about telephone calls that you have made, emails you have sent, information that you have accessed online, and detailed information about the location of your mobile telephone. 


According to the Telecommunications Interceptions and Access Act (TIA) Annual report 2011-12, Australian law enforcement agencies were granted access to personal information about Australians 293,501 times throughout the 2011-12 year, without obtaining a warrant or having any judicial oversight. 


This Bill does not prevent law enforcement and intelligence from accessing material in order to carry out their functions; it simply requires that law enforcement agencies obtain a warrant prior to accessing the information. 


A member of the judiciary, a recognised cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law, will be required to provide independent and informed oversight of the use of coercive or invasive powers. Requests by ASIO will be required to obtain a warrant from the Attorney General.


Warrants not only protect citizens from the abuse of power by the State, they also provide legitimacy and authority to police or intelligence agencies carrying out their functions by ensuing that their actions are both necessary and proportional. 


While it is the government's role to promote collective protection against identity theft, online crime and acts of political violence, Australian citizens have a legitimate expectation that the government will defend their democratic right to privacy, freedom of expression and freedom from arbitrary acts of state surveillance or coercion. 


The Greens believe that changes made to the Telecommunications Act and the Telecommunications Interception and Access Act (TIA) in 2007 to normalise warrantless surveillance, radically and unnecessarily privileged national security concerns over the privacy and civil liberties of Australians. This Bill reinstates the balance between national security and privacy and treats Australians as citizens first with basic rights and protections, and not merely suspects.


In May 2013 the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor concluded that several of the 80 hastily made changes to Australian law after the events of September 11 were not effective, appropriate or necessary. The scope and reach of the laws were unprecedented, and included extraordinary powers of surveillance, detention and restriction and censorship on speech.


Citizen's human rights are protected when laws are transparently made, independently adjudicated, equally enforced and fairly applied. Among the rights recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the ""freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers,"" which is contained in Article 19 of that Declaration.


In June 2012, the UN Human Rights Council affirmed in resolution A/​HRC/​20/​L.13 that, ""the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, in particular freedom of expression, which is applicable regardless of frontiers and through any media of one's choice, in accordance with Articles 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights""


The online and offline human rights of Australians are being compromised when safeguards and privacy protections are insufficient to prevent widespread warrantless surveillance. 


Given that Australia's security agencies and police forces have been deployed against targets that fall well beyond threats to national security such as climate change demonstrators, the occupy movement, anti-whaling campaigners and supporters of the WikiLeaks publishing organization, the lines between terrorism, civil disobedience and healthy dissent are being routinely blurred. This Bill seeks to ensure that Australians are protected from indiscriminate monitoring by law enforcement agencies. 


The Australian Greens strongly support the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) recommendation that the Telecommunications Interception and Access Act (TIA) be reviewed in its entirety. 


Until an Australian government has the sense to implement the ALRC's recommendation, the TIA must be amended piecemeal, such as with this Bill, in an effort to return Australian law enforcement procedures to protecting the hard-won rights fundamental to a liberal democracy.


I commend this Bill to the Senate.

(iii) by 2020 it is estimated by the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics That the cost of traffic congestion in Melbourne will be $6.1 billion, double what it is today, and


(iv) as well as being an economic cost, congestion impacts on quality of life, including time spent with family;


(b) recognises that:


(i) the Victorian Government has proposed the development of an East West Link which would provide an alternate route across the city by connecting the Eastern Freeway with the Western Ring Road,


(ii) this East West Link would have significant benefits for Melbourne and Australia, as it would:


   (A) relieve bottle necks on the Eastern, Monash and West Gate Freeways and provide an alternative to the West Gate Bridge,


   (B) improve freight efficiency by catering for growth at the ports of Melbourne and Hastings and increase productivity by improving travel time reliability for freight,


   (C) enhance Victoria's competitive advantage globally, improve the key industry centres and support the knowledge precinct in Carlton and Parkville,


   (D) complete missing links between freeways to alleviate congestion and ensure travel time reliability for families and freight, and


   (E) reduce travel times, particularly for residents in Melbourne's east and west who travel to Melbourne to work, and


(iii) the Federal Coalition has committed $1.5 billion towards the construction of the East West Link; and

  What we have just witnessed is this government not supporting the people of Victoria. In voting against this motion, they have damned the people of Victoria, and it is an absolute indictment on them. The East West Link is a key infrastructure project for the people of Victoria and it has been identified by the RACV as the No. 1 project for the people of Victoria. It is a project that will change and improve the productivity of that state and make a real difference to the people, in particular to those who live in the eastern corridor.


It is a matter of great regret that the members for Bruce, Chisholm and Deakin—that is, Alan Griffin, Anna Burke and Mike Symon—have not lobbied the Prime Minister to fund this project. It is a disgrace. (Time expired)

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (16:50):  I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.


Leave granted.




Senator RUSTON:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I particularly wanted to speak on this Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee report given that the reason that Senator Xenophon decided to move the bill that this report refers to, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Material of Local Significance) Bill 2013, was that regional news services were being withdrawn from the area in which I live. WIN TV, the television broadcaster in the Riverland and the Mount Gambia area in South Australia, made a decision, very tragically, a few months ago that they were no longer in a position to be able to provide a news service. Only a matter of a few months prior to that, they had made a decision that they could afford only one news service—which actually combined both areas—and, subsequent to that, was their decision that they could no longer afford to do any news service at all.


Senator Xenophon's response, obviously, was out of concern for the people of that area and the lack of news service. But the main concern the coalition had with the bill related to the fact that, when WIN TV negotiated the deal to enable it to be the broadcaster in this area, no such requirements were placed on them. There was never any intention that a commercial operator should cross-subsidise and operate at a loss to enable the people of this area to receive their news services. We were concerned that a bill was being introduced which would suggest that in a retrospective way the WIN Television network were going to be required to provide a news service that was of significant cost to them when obviously they had made the decision that they were not commercially able to do so.


I draw this to the Senate's attention in the context of what is happening in this region. Because of a whole heap of reasons, the economic environment in this area of South Australia—I am sure this is the case across a lot of rural and regional Australia—cannot provide the money to support these kinds of activities. WIN TV had to make a decision on the basis of a huge reduction in the amount of commercial revenue that they were receiving for advertising, and they were in a position where they would have been losing money if they continued to plough into their new service the kind of money they had been spending. That is obviously very disappointing for the people of the Mt Gambier area and the people of the Riverland but, once again, it is not the place of a commercial broadcaster to be cross-subsidising its operations and providing an uneconomic service.


The retrospective nature of this measure was disappointing, hence the report from the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee indicating that we are not in support of this bill. It does not seem fair, when you have made a decision in possession of all the facts, that the facts can be changed after the event. We have seen that happen way too often, where businesses enter into an agreement in good faith, on the basis of a government policy, and then the situation changes. The decision about the Abel Tasman, which is tied up at Port Lincoln, is a classic example. I am pleased that the recommendation is not to support the requirement for WIN TV to provide a new service.


I also put this in the context of the changing media landscape that we find ourselves in at the moment. The way that we find information from new services is changing very significantly and at an extraordinarily rapid rate. You only have to look at the emergence of online activity. These days most of us have read the newspaper before we get out of bed in the morning. The obligation and responsibility to ensure that people in the country have the same sorts of facilities as their colleagues in the cities is highlighted by the likes of the requirement for Australia Post to collect and deliver letters anywhere in Australia at a standard rate. We are expecting the same thing with our telecommunication providers—that people in the country are able to access the same sorts of services as their colleagues who live in the city. However, we have noted that there are still an awful lot of people who are living in rural and regional areas, particularly remote areas, who still do not have the same sort of telecommunication access as their colleagues in the city.


The ABC is the national broadcaster. The ABC is the media outlet that is charged with the responsibility of ensuring there is some level of equity with the delivery of news services and regional content to people who live in places that are not necessarily highly populated or where it is not easily commercially viable to provide such services. I congratulate the ABC for the response it took to this issue in our area. The ABC immediately responded to the withdrawal of these news services by acting to employ video journalists through its radio stations in the area. My understanding from speaking to the local ABC radio business in the Riverland only last week is that a video journalist has been appointed and will start working out of the Renmark office very shortly, and the same thing will occur in Mt Gambier.


Whilst it is the responsibility of the ABC to undertake the delivery of uneconomic news services to those of us who live in areas where it is not commercially viable to have those services, it was with great delight that we saw that it responded so quickly to the problem. I would like to thank the ABC for that and I also note that I was delighted that the recommendation of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee was to oppose the bill on the grounds of the retrospective nature of a requirement to provide a news service where it was not commercially viable to do so and that requirement had not existed at the time of negotiating the contract.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-06-18,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:58):  I provided a dissenting report on this inquiry of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Material of Local Significance) Bill was my bill, and the bill was introduced because WIN TV in South Australia withdrew its local news bulletins. They said that was for commercial reasons but it is interesting to note that under the Broadcasting Services Act there is a requirement in the eastern states, from Far North Queensland all the way down to Tasmania, for regional broadcasters to have local content. That is an anomaly that this bill would have addressed.


The impact of losing those regional services, those news bulletins, in the Riverland and in the south-east of South Australia was quite profound. For those reasons this is a matter that still needs legislative reform. I have had discussions with Bruce Gordon, the owner of WIN TV—they were very cordial and fruitful discussions—and with Andrew Lancaster, the CEO of WIN TV. I hope they can reconsider their position so that those local news bulletins in the south-east and in the Riverland can be restored at some time in the future because of the important role those services have had in those local communities. I am pleased, as is Senator Ruston, that the ABC has filled some of the gap—but it is still not the same as those local communities in South Australia having their own local half-hour news bulletins.

Senator Xenophon's response, obviously, was out of concern for the people of that area and the lack of news service. But the main concern the coalition had with the bill related to the fact that, when WIN TV negotiated the deal to enable it to be the broadcaster in this area, no such requirements were placed on them. There was never any intention that a commercial operator should cross-subsidise and operate at a loss to enable the people of this area to receive their news services. We were concerned that a bill was being introduced which would suggest that in a retrospective way the WIN Television network were going to be required to provide a news service that was of significant cost to them when obviously they had made the decision that they were not commercially able to do so.


I draw this to the Senate's attention in the context of what is happening in this region. Because of a whole heap of reasons, the economic environment in this area of South Australia—I am sure this is the case across a lot of rural and regional Australia—cannot provide the money to support these kinds of activities. WIN TV had to make a decision on the basis of a huge reduction in the amount of commercial revenue that they were receiving for advertising, and they were in a position where they would have been losing money if they continued to plough into their new service the kind of money they had been spending. That is obviously very disappointing for the people of the Mt Gambier area and the people of the Riverland but, once again, it is not the place of a commercial broadcaster to be cross-subsidising its operations and providing an uneconomic service.


The retrospective nature of this measure was disappointing, hence the report from the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee indicating that we are not in support of this bill. It does not seem fair, when you have made a decision in possession of all the facts, that the facts can be changed after the event. We have seen that happen way too often, where businesses enter into an agreement in good faith, on the basis of a government policy, and then the situation changes. The decision about the Abel Tasman, which is tied up at Port Lincoln, is a classic example. I am pleased that the recommendation is not to support the requirement for WIN TV to provide a new service.


I also put this in the context of the changing media landscape that we find ourselves in at the moment. The way that we find information from new services is changing very significantly and at an extraordinarily rapid rate. You only have to look at the emergence of online activity. These days most of us have read the newspaper before we get out of bed in the morning. The obligation and responsibility to ensure that people in the country have the same sorts of facilities as their colleagues in the cities is highlighted by the likes of the requirement for Australia Post to collect and deliver letters anywhere in Australia at a standard rate. We are expecting the same thing with our telecommunication providers—that people in the country are able to access the same sorts of services as their colleagues who live in the city. However, we have noted that there are still an awful lot of people who are living in rural and regional areas, particularly remote areas, who still do not have the same sort of telecommunication access as their colleagues in the city.


The ABC is the national broadcaster. The ABC is the media outlet that is charged with the responsibility of ensuring there is some level of equity with the delivery of news services and regional content to people who live in places that are not necessarily highly populated or where it is not easily commercially viable to provide such services. I congratulate the ABC for the response it took to this issue in our area. The ABC immediately responded to the withdrawal of these news services by acting to employ video journalists through its radio stations in the area. My understanding from speaking to the local ABC radio business in the Riverland only last week is that a video journalist has been appointed and will start working out of the Renmark office very shortly, and the same thing will occur in Mt Gambier.


Whilst it is the responsibility of the ABC to undertake the delivery of uneconomic news services to those of us who live in areas where it is not commercially viable to have those services, it was with great delight that we saw that it responded so quickly to the problem. I would like to thank the ABC for that and I also note that I was delighted that the recommendation of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee was to oppose the bill on the grounds of the retrospective nature of a requirement to provide a news service where it was not commercially viable to do so and that requirement had not existed at the time of negotiating the contract.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-06-18,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:58):  I provided a dissenting report on this inquiry of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Material of Local Significance) Bill was my bill, and the bill was introduced because WIN TV in South Australia withdrew its local news bulletins. They said that was for commercial reasons but it is interesting to note that under the Broadcasting Services Act there is a requirement in the eastern states, from Far North Queensland all the way down to Tasmania, for regional broadcasters to have local content. That is an anomaly that this bill would have addressed.


The impact of losing those regional services, those news bulletins, in the Riverland and in the south-east of South Australia was quite profound. For those reasons this is a matter that still needs legislative reform. I have had discussions with Bruce Gordon, the owner of WIN TV—they were very cordial and fruitful discussions—and with Andrew Lancaster, the CEO of WIN TV. I hope they can reconsider their position so that those local news bulletins in the south-east and in the Riverland can be restored at some time in the future because of the important role those services have had in those local communities. I am pleased, as is Senator Ruston, that the ABC has filled some of the gap—but it is still not the same as those local communities in South Australia having their own local half-hour news bulletins.


Question agreed to.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,18,2,speech
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2013-06-18,"



Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (19:00):  I rise today to speak on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Freedom of Information) Bill 2013. At the outset I concur with remarks made by the government in the tabled second reading speech, and in the other place by the minister and the shadow minister. This bill amends the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to restore the longstanding and previously understood position of three parliamentary departments: the Department of Parliamentary Services, the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate. These three departments were historically excluded from the operation of the Freedom of Information Act.


There are longstanding justifications and reasons for this, particularly regarding the ability of members and senators to go about their respective duties and the rights and privileges of the houses to determine their own affairs. The Parliamentary Budget Office is not covered by this bill as it is already designated an agency exempt from the legislation that created it. I should add that the parliamentary departments cooperate with the spirit of the FOI act by providing access to administrative information when requested. Both DPS and the Department of the Senate also come before the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee during estimates hearings, are questioned in detail and provide information in that forum.


This bill is necessary due to the inadvertent removal of the exemption by the creation of a separate Parliamentary Service in 1999 that became apparent only last year. This became apparent to all members and senators when the parliamentary librarian was placed in a difficult position through a determination by the Information Commissioner that the assumed exemption had, for a long time, no longer applied. This placed the librarian in a conflicted position, with the Parliamentary Service Act requiring the role to be undertaken in confidence but with the FOI regime no longer guaranteeing this.


It is entirely correct that this issue be placed beyond doubt. If, at a future time, the parliament wishes to make certain aspects of the operations of parliamentary departments subject to the FOI regime then this bill preserves that possibility. The coalition supports the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Service Amendment (Freedom of Information) Bill 2013</title>,BILLS,21,1,speech
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2013-06-18,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (19:02):  The Parliamentary Service Amendment (Freedom of Information) Bill 2013 should retain the status quo of keeping parliamentary departments and office holders subject to the FOI act. As we know, it was long thought that the three parliamentary departments—the Department of the Senate, the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of Parliamentary Services—were exempt from FOI. Then, in May 2012 the Information Commissioner, in guidelines to the FOI act, noted that these departments were, in fact, covered. This bill is the government's attempt, with the support of the coalition, to close the loop opened by the Information Commissioner's ruling—a ruling which has the potential to do what the Prime Minister promised when she formed government, and what we often hear politicians speak about: provide open, transparent, accountable government. You can only achieve that with certain information being available.


The Greens oppose this bill as it is an obstacle to that transparency and reflects a watering-down of FOI laws. These parliamentary departments spend hundreds of millions a year in public money, and they should be open to public scrutiny. This will go a long way towards maintaining confidence in our democracy and will also avoid the potential for corruption. That is something we need to focus on, because we are aware of serious problems that can arise with governments. We have seen this in New South Wales. ICAC has been able to delve into this, but with greater availability and greater possibility for public scrutiny of how money is spent we have further obstacles to corrupt behaviour developing.


One of the Greens amendments would require MPs to disclose their pay and to link directly on their websites to the individual expenditure reports for their allowances. This should be nothing unusual, and should be standard practice. In the future, if this amendment passes, I am sure it will one day become standard practice. It is happening in many other jurisdictions. The Greens have always upheld the principle of greater transparency on MPs' expenses and other public spending. Sadly, the bill is being rushed through and pre-empts the tabling of a major FOI review, the Hawke review, which will look specifically at FOI coverage for parliamentary departments.


This bill, this debate, should not precede without us having the opportunity to be informed by that review.


When it comes to FOI, Australia lags behind other jurisdictions. For example Britain, the home of the Westminster system, is streets ahead of us when it comes to FOI. Current exemptions in FOI laws are sufficient to protect genuinely sensitive material. I want to give emphasis to this because often when I raise it there is a little bit of a scare comment put around like: 'This is not fair, because constituents would have their emails revealed.' We can put all the protections in place. The Greens amendments absolutely achieve that by putting the protections in place so that the issue of privilege is respected; and, at the same time, we can have the all-important thorough public scrutiny.


It had long been assumed that the three parliamentary departments were exempt from FOI. In May 2012 the Information Commissioner noted that these departments were, in fact, covered. The Attorney-General at the time, Nicola Roxon, characterised this as an anomaly. Coming from a government that came into office with a commitment to greater transparency, I was concerned at the language she used; it was very much downplaying the significance of this situation. Still, the Hawke review was established and the terms of reference for the review were designed to include review of the very issue that we are talking about now. That is why I say it is poor form that this bill is being rushed through before we can be informed by that review.


The exclusion of parliamentary departments has long been criticised in Australia. I think it is important that senators focus on that point because these are significant criticisms of the failure of these departments to be covered. The Australian Law Reform Commission recommended their inclusion in 1996. During this review the then Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, argued for the extension of the FOI Act to parliamentary departments, noting that exemptions already protect genuinely sensitive documents. I want to emphasise that that protection is there; it can be achieved. Once we have that protection in place, the arguments from Labor and the coalition, and their excuses for not opening up these departments to greater public scrutiny, fall away. The Greens submission to the Hawke review recommended that no amendments be made to exclude parliamentary departments from FOI.


Now that we are seeing this move from both the government and the coalition, it does highlight how Australia fails best practice in FOI. This is a real negative against a parliament that has so many fine aspects. One thing that I always find absolutely outstanding in this parliament is the committee process, and it is something that has certainly been picked up by other jurisdictions. But when it comes to FOI, it is an area where we cannot be proud.


The respected Carter Centre, in the USA, advocates that all three government branches be subject to FOI law, and that other jurisdictions should subject the parliament to FOI law. Westminster, as I said, has been subject to FOI law for eight years now, and government departments in Scotland, India, Ireland, South Africa and Mexico are covered to different degrees. That is why I gave emphasis to the fact that Australia is falling behind—and certainly it is not to our credit. Within our own country, the situation in Tasmania is interesting. They have made some positive moves in this area. Tasmania's Right to Information Act 2009 covers requests to parliamentary departments but is limited to administrative matters.


I go back to the example of Scotland. They have online, searchable records of MPs' expenditure. It is very easy to do. Again, in time, as the whole necessity of making information available is recognised more widely, I am sure this will happen. Hopefully, it will happen tonight, but from what I am hearing it does not sound likely. Certainly, Scotland have established that and it is something that we should look to. 


In 2012, the New Zealand Law Commission recommended FOI coverage, and those recommendations form the basis of the Greens' proposed amendments.


The UK Freedom of Information Act enables the Speaker of the House of Commons or the Clerk of the Parliaments to certify on a case-by-case basis that information is exempt when necessary to avoid infringement of the privileges of either house or where, in the reasonable opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons or the Clerk of the Parliaments, disclosure would be likely to prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs. I wanted to give that considerable emphasis because it highlights how protections and safeguards can be put in place. We can continue to do our work without undermining privilege. We can achieve a balance, and that is what the Greens' amendments are attempting to do.


I will briefly cover our amendments. The first Greens' amendment is designed to narrow the full application of FOI to the three parliamentary departments by specifically defining what information held by the parliamentary departments is subject to FOI. For example, documents subject to FOI would include salaries and additional salaries for office-holders, electorate allowances, superannuation, and services and facilities to support parliamentarians in Parliament House. The Greens believe there is no reasonable excuse for shielding this information about public expenditure from public scrutiny. The speeches that I heard from Labor and the coalition when this issue was being debated and spoken about provide no good reason why that should not occur. If they cannot come up with some good reasons, they start to look very self-serving. 


Now, if that amendment is voted down, the Greens will move a second amendment, to limit requests for access to documents relating to matters of an administrative nature only. It should be difficult for the major parties to justify not supporting this lesser, second amendment, because even the parliamentary departments themselves have publicly supported this position. I wanted to emphasise that, because we have found it difficult to get the government to focus on our amendments, but the parliamentary departments have themselves said that they support being covered that way—certainly, it is in limited form, which is not the Greens' first preference, but it is something that those departments support.


Neither of these amendments would affect the existing exemptions under the FOI Act—for example, for cabinet documents, national security, legal professional privilege, electoral rolls or contempt of parliament. The Greens' amendments explicitly ensure that these exemptions would still apply to enable these three parliamentary departments to protect sensitive material, including an absolute exemption for parliamentary privilege. Many of the likely applicable exemptions under the act are conditional exemptions, such as for deliberative documents, personal privacy and business affairs, which are also subject to a public interest test. Obviously, I commend to the Senate these Greens' amendments to keep the parliamentary departments subject to FOI as an important measure to protect the democratic principles of transparency and accountability.


I finish with the words of the Prime Minister herself, speaking on this issue back in September 2010, when she had just been elected. In her announcement about forming government, she stated:


What the Australian people told us, and they told us this in no uncertain terms on that day and on the days that have followed, is this: that we will be held more accountable than ever before, and more than any government in modern memory. We will be held to higher standards of transparency and reform, and it’s in that spirit that I approach the task of forming a government.


Then on the ABC's 7.30 Report, when she was interviewed at the same time, she stated:


People do want to see us more open, more accountable, more transparent.


That is a strong, clear statement. But how can that be achieved if we do not have FOI laws that are at least to the standard that other Westminster countries have now achieved?

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-06-18,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:15):  I will make a very short contribution. I think Senator Williams said that I had 2½ minutes, which is very generous of him. I indicate that the controversy in relation to this bill is that there is a perception that the parliament is exempt from the standards of freedom of information. I note that the second reading speech of this bill refers to this as an interim measure. It is a transitional measure, pending a review—an overall review; a long overdue review—of freedom of information legislation.


It is clear that there are some circumstances, when a parliamentarian obtains information, where there are good public interest reasons for that information not to be disclosed, particularly if you are dealing with constituents and other sensitive matters. I think that that would fetter the work of a parliamentarian. The amendments moved by Senator Rhiannon appear to me to be quite sensible. They are attempting to deal with matters that are currently the subject of the review, but I think that these amendments would improve this bill appreciably. It would lead to greater transparency, in a way that would not fetter the work of members of parliament when they are dealing with constituents or on matters where privilege may apply.


For those reasons, I can indicate that, whilst I support the bill with some reservations, I think this bill would be significantly improved with the amendments that Senator Rhiannon has proposed. I hope that these amendments will at least be considered seriously by my colleagues on both sides.

Freedom of Information Act 1982



1 After section 6A


   Insert:


6B Department of the House of Representatives, Department of the Senate and Department of Parliamentary Services


(1) This Act does not apply to any request for access to a document of the Department of the House of Representatives, the Department of the Senate or the Department of Parliamentary Services unless the document relates to matters of an administrative nature.


(2) For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to a document of an administrative nature in subsection (1) includes a document to the extent that is:


   (a) statistical information about the activities of the Department; or


   (b) information about the expenditure of public moneys; or


   (c) information about payments to a Senator or member of the House of Representatives; or


   (d) information about services and facilities provided to a Senator or member of the House of Representatives; or


   (e) information about assets, resources, support systems and other administrative matters of the Department.


(3) For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to a document of an administrative nature in subsection (1) does not include a document to the extent that it is:


   (a) research or advice provided to a Senator or member of the House of Representatives; or


   (b) information held on behalf of a Senator or member of the House of Representatives; or


   (c) information about how a Senator or member of the House of Representatives performs their role as a Senator or member of the House of Representatives; or


   (d) any advice provided to a Senator or member of the House of Representatives; or


   (e) information that is otherwise subject to parliamentary privilege.


(4) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section limits or infringes the powers, privileges and immunities of the Houses of the Parliament.


This amendment defines the FOI applications that can be made in relation to parliamentary departments and office holders. The amendment is that information relating to the parliamentary departments, office holders' use of public resources and departmental administrative functions should be subject to FOI, while information relating to parliamentary proceedings, matters of political strategy or an MP's activities—for example, when dealing with constituents—are not.


I would just like to spell it out and give you some examples of what that means. I would argue strongly that, when you look at the detail, it really is hard to understand why this is being opposed. FOI applications would be limited to statistical information about the department's activities; information about the expenditure of public money—including payments to members and senators, as well as payments to services and facilities to support parliamentarians in Parliament House; and information about the department's assets, resources, support systems and other administrative matters. The following would be excluded from FOI requests: research or advice to members of parliament provided by the Parliamentary Library; information held by the parliamentary departments solely as an agent for or on behalf of the House of Representatives, the Senate or a member of parliament, regardless of whether that information resides on facilities provided by the parliamentary departments; information held by a parliamentary department about a member of parliament in relation to the member's performance or his or her role and functions as a member; and advice provided by the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 staff, irrespective of whether or not parliamentary privilege applies to a member of parliament.


In fact, when you put those two together—what is in and what is out—it is very responsible. It is actually very limiting. As I said in the second reading debate, there is nothing in this group of amendments that limits or affects any privileges, immunities or powers of the House of Representatives or the Senate. That the Senate FOI regime would not apply to any matter subject to parliamentary privilege is clearly achieved. I commend the Greens amendment (1) to the Senate.

In our view, the parliamentary departments covered do a very extensive job of making relevant information available and, as I stated in my second reading contribution, this does not preclude the future consideration of it by the parliament. But, due to the unexpected removal of the exemption or the apparent nature of it, being made last year, we believe that this needs to be reinstated. A future parliament can reconsider it.


I will conclude by saying that I am happy to respectfully disagree with Senator Rhiannon, but I will not be lectured here on bills being rushed through, given I have sat in this very chair on many occasions on bills—that are on electoral matters and on audit matters—where the Greens have supported a government guillotine, where there was no opposition contribution in a second reading debate and there were no opposition, government or minor party contributions to the consideration of amendments to very important legislation. I think Senator Rhiannon might be able to come down a bit off the soapbox before we get a lecture.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity) (19:21):  I indicate that the government rejects this amendment. The effect of the proposed amendment is to make a substantive amendment to the FOI Act: to change the application of the FOI Act to include the parliamentary departments. The application of the FOI Act to the parliamentary departments has been considered by Dr Hawke's FOI review. It is premature for the government to take action to amend the FOI Act before it has had an opportunity to consider and respond to recommendations in the review. The government understands that Dr Hawke has completed his review and is in the process of preparing a report on that review. The Attorney-General expects to receive Dr Hawke's report in coming weeks. In the meantime, the government has agreed to the request of the Presiding Officers to amend the Parliamentary Service Act as an interim measure to ensure that parliamentary departments are not exposed to requests they are not currently in a position to handle.


The bill as drafted takes into account the views expressed by the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Department of the House of Representatives, the Department of the Senate, the Department of Parliamentary Services, the Joint Standing Committee on the Parliamentary Library, and the Parliamentary Library. Consequently, the government does not support the Greens amendment at this time. Once the government has received and has had an opportunity to consider a response to Dr Hawke's report, the government will make a fully considered decision on the application of the FOI Act to the parliamentary departments.

This limits FOI applications to documents of an administrative matter only. It really should be difficult for Labor and the coalition to justify not supporting this lesser second amendment. I call it a lesser second amendment because it is a much reduced form of FOI. Even the parliamentary departments—the Department of the Senate, the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of Parliamentary Services—have publicly supported this position. They are okay with this degree of openness. So, it will be interesting to hear the minister as to why they are not ready to support this amendment when the departments themselves are comfortable with it. For those three departments and office holders, while they are subject to the FOI Act, this amendment limits access to administrative matters only and this amendment excludes research or advice to members of parliament provided by the Parliamentary Library. It makes it explicit that nothing limits or affects any privileges, immunities or powers of the House of Representatives or the Senate. I do commend Greens amendment (2) to the Senate.

Parliamentary Allowances Act 1952



1 Section 4


   Omit ""There are payable"", substitute ""(1) Subject to subsection (2), there are payable"".


2 At the end of section 4


   Add:


(2) A member is only entitled to allowances if:


   (a) the member includes a link to the Department of Finance and Deregulation website in their biographical details on the Australian Parliament website; and


   (b) the link directs the user to the individual expenditure report of that member.


Note: In 2013, the Australian Parliament website is located at www.aph.gov.au.


This sets out a proactive publication requirement of MPs' expenditure. It is actually very minimal in what it sets out to do. It creates an obligation that all senators and members be required to provide a link on their official parliamentary website to their individual expenditure reports on the Finance website. I say it is minimal because we again need to remember the experience in Scotland. Scotland has online searchable records of MPs' expenditure. All this is about is providing a link. There are a few steps one has to go through to be able to obtain the information. Why shouldn't that information be public? It is public money; it should be publicly available and easy to search. It is not good enough to say no. It is one small step to achieve some level of scrutiny of the considerable public money that we as MPs have the privilege to use. I commend the amendment to the chamber.

Senator RYAN
 (Victoria) (19:00):  I rise today to speak on the Parliamentary Service Amendment (Freedom of Information) Bill 2013. At the outset I concur with remarks made by the government in the tabled second reading speech, and in the other place by the minister and the shadow minister. This bill amends the Parliamentary Service Act 1999 to restore the longstanding and previously understood position of three parliamentary departments: the Department of Parliamentary Services, the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate. These three departments were historically excluded from the operation of the Freedom of Information Act.


There are longstanding justifications and reasons for this, particularly regarding the ability of members and senators to go about their respective duties and the rights and privileges of the houses to determine their own affairs. The Parliamentary Budget Office is not covered by this bill as it is already designated an agency exempt from the legislation that created it. I should add that the parliamentary departments cooperate with the spirit of the FOI act by providing access to administrative information when requested. Both DPS and the Department of the Senate also come before the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee during estimates hearings, are questioned in detail and provide information in that forum.


This bill is necessary due to the inadvertent removal of the exemption by the creation of a separate Parliamentary Service in 1999 that became apparent only last year. This became apparent to all members and senators when the parliamentary librarian was placed in a difficult position through a determination by the Information Commissioner that the assumed exemption had, for a long time, no longer applied. This placed the librarian in a conflicted position, with the Parliamentary Service Act requiring the role to be undertaken in confidence but with the FOI regime no longer guaranteeing this.


It is entirely correct that this issue be placed beyond doubt. If, at a future time, the parliament wishes to make certain aspects of the operations of parliamentary departments subject to the FOI regime then this bill preserves that possibility. The coalition supports the bill.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,21,2,speech
"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2013-06-18,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (19:02):  The Parliamentary Service Amendment (Freedom of Information) Bill 2013 should retain the status quo of keeping parliamentary departments and office holders subject to the FOI act. As we know, it was long thought that the three parliamentary departments—the Department of the Senate, the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of Parliamentary Services—were exempt from FOI. Then, in May 2012 the Information Commissioner, in guidelines to the FOI act, noted that these departments were, in fact, covered. This bill is the government's attempt, with the support of the coalition, to close the loop opened by the Information Commissioner's ruling—a ruling which has the potential to do what the Prime Minister promised when she formed government, and what we often hear politicians speak about: provide open, transparent, accountable government. You can only achieve that with certain information being available.


The Greens oppose this bill as it is an obstacle to that transparency and reflects a watering-down of FOI laws. These parliamentary departments spend hundreds of millions a year in public money, and they should be open to public scrutiny. This will go a long way towards maintaining confidence in our democracy and will also avoid the potential for corruption. That is something we need to focus on, because we are aware of serious problems that can arise with governments. We have seen this in New South Wales. ICAC has been able to delve into this, but with greater availability and greater possibility for public scrutiny of how money is spent we have further obstacles to corrupt behaviour developing.


One of the Greens amendments would require MPs to disclose their pay and to link directly on their websites to the individual expenditure reports for their allowances. This should be nothing unusual, and should be standard practice. In the future, if this amendment passes, I am sure it will one day become standard practice. It is happening in many other jurisdictions. The Greens have always upheld the principle of greater transparency on MPs' expenses and other public spending. Sadly, the bill is being rushed through and pre-empts the tabling of a major FOI review, the Hawke review, which will look specifically at FOI coverage for parliamentary departments.


This bill, this debate, should not precede without us having the opportunity to be informed by that review.


When it comes to FOI, Australia lags behind other jurisdictions. For example Britain, the home of the Westminster system, is streets ahead of us when it comes to FOI. Current exemptions in FOI laws are sufficient to protect genuinely sensitive material. I want to give emphasis to this because often when I raise it there is a little bit of a scare comment put around like: 'This is not fair, because constituents would have their emails revealed.' We can put all the protections in place. The Greens amendments absolutely achieve that by putting the protections in place so that the issue of privilege is respected; and, at the same time, we can have the all-important thorough public scrutiny.


It had long been assumed that the three parliamentary departments were exempt from FOI. In May 2012 the Information Commissioner noted that these departments were, in fact, covered. The Attorney-General at the time, Nicola Roxon, characterised this as an anomaly. Coming from a government that came into office with a commitment to greater transparency, I was concerned at the language she used; it was very much downplaying the significance of this situation. Still, the Hawke review was established and the terms of reference for the review were designed to include review of the very issue that we are talking about now. That is why I say it is poor form that this bill is being rushed through before we can be informed by that review.


The exclusion of parliamentary departments has long been criticised in Australia. I think it is important that senators focus on that point because these are significant criticisms of the failure of these departments to be covered. The Australian Law Reform Commission recommended their inclusion in 1996. During this review the then Clerk of the Senate, Mr Harry Evans, argued for the extension of the FOI Act to parliamentary departments, noting that exemptions already protect genuinely sensitive documents. I want to emphasise that that protection is there; it can be achieved. Once we have that protection in place, the arguments from Labor and the coalition, and their excuses for not opening up these departments to greater public scrutiny, fall away. The Greens submission to the Hawke review recommended that no amendments be made to exclude parliamentary departments from FOI.


Now that we are seeing this move from both the government and the coalition, it does highlight how Australia fails best practice in FOI. This is a real negative against a parliament that has so many fine aspects. One thing that I always find absolutely outstanding in this parliament is the committee process, and it is something that has certainly been picked up by other jurisdictions. But when it comes to FOI, it is an area where we cannot be proud.


The respected Carter Centre, in the USA, advocates that all three government branches be subject to FOI law, and that other jurisdictions should subject the parliament to FOI law. Westminster, as I said, has been subject to FOI law for eight years now, and government departments in Scotland, India, Ireland, South Africa and Mexico are covered to different degrees. That is why I gave emphasis to the fact that Australia is falling behind—and certainly it is not to our credit. Within our own country, the situation in Tasmania is interesting. They have made some positive moves in this area. Tasmania's Right to Information Act 2009 covers requests to parliamentary departments but is limited to administrative matters.


I go back to the example of Scotland. They have online, searchable records of MPs' expenditure. It is very easy to do. Again, in time, as the whole necessity of making information available is recognised more widely, I am sure this will happen. Hopefully, it will happen tonight, but from what I am hearing it does not sound likely. Certainly, Scotland have established that and it is something that we should look to. 


In 2012, the New Zealand Law Commission recommended FOI coverage, and those recommendations form the basis of the Greens' proposed amendments.


The UK Freedom of Information Act enables the Speaker of the House of Commons or the Clerk of the Parliaments to certify on a case-by-case basis that information is exempt when necessary to avoid infringement of the privileges of either house or where, in the reasonable opinion of the Speaker of the House of Commons or the Clerk of the Parliaments, disclosure would be likely to prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs. I wanted to give that considerable emphasis because it highlights how protections and safeguards can be put in place. We can continue to do our work without undermining privilege. We can achieve a balance, and that is what the Greens' amendments are attempting to do.


I will briefly cover our amendments. The first Greens' amendment is designed to narrow the full application of FOI to the three parliamentary departments by specifically defining what information held by the parliamentary departments is subject to FOI. For example, documents subject to FOI would include salaries and additional salaries for office-holders, electorate allowances, superannuation, and services and facilities to support parliamentarians in Parliament House. The Greens believe there is no reasonable excuse for shielding this information about public expenditure from public scrutiny. The speeches that I heard from Labor and the coalition when this issue was being debated and spoken about provide no good reason why that should not occur. If they cannot come up with some good reasons, they start to look very self-serving. 


Now, if that amendment is voted down, the Greens will move a second amendment, to limit requests for access to documents relating to matters of an administrative nature only. It should be difficult for the major parties to justify not supporting this lesser, second amendment, because even the parliamentary departments themselves have publicly supported this position. I wanted to emphasise that, because we have found it difficult to get the government to focus on our amendments, but the parliamentary departments have themselves said that they support being covered that way—certainly, it is in limited form, which is not the Greens' first preference, but it is something that those departments support.


Neither of these amendments would affect the existing exemptions under the FOI Act—for example, for cabinet documents, national security, legal professional privilege, electoral rolls or contempt of parliament. The Greens' amendments explicitly ensure that these exemptions would still apply to enable these three parliamentary departments to protect sensitive material, including an absolute exemption for parliamentary privilege. Many of the likely applicable exemptions under the act are conditional exemptions, such as for deliberative documents, personal privacy and business affairs, which are also subject to a public interest test. Obviously, I commend to the Senate these Greens' amendments to keep the parliamentary departments subject to FOI as an important measure to protect the democratic principles of transparency and accountability.


I finish with the words of the Prime Minister herself, speaking on this issue back in September 2010, when she had just been elected. In her announcement about forming government, she stated:


What the Australian people told us, and they told us this in no uncertain terms on that day and on the days that have followed, is this: that we will be held more accountable than ever before, and more than any government in modern memory. We will be held to higher standards of transparency and reform, and it’s in that spirit that I approach the task of forming a government.


Then on the ABC's 7.30 Report, when she was interviewed at the same time, she stated:


People do want to see us more open, more accountable, more transparent.


That is a strong, clear statement. But how can that be achieved if we do not have FOI laws that are at least to the standard that other Westminster countries have now achieved?

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2013-06-18,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (19:15):  I will make a very short contribution. I think Senator Williams said that I had 2½ minutes, which is very generous of him. I indicate that the controversy in relation to this bill is that there is a perception that the parliament is exempt from the standards of freedom of information. I note that the second reading speech of this bill refers to this as an interim measure. It is a transitional measure, pending a review—an overall review; a long overdue review—of freedom of information legislation.


It is clear that there are some circumstances, when a parliamentarian obtains information, where there are good public interest reasons for that information not to be disclosed, particularly if you are dealing with constituents and other sensitive matters. I think that that would fetter the work of a parliamentarian. The amendments moved by Senator Rhiannon appear to me to be quite sensible. They are attempting to deal with matters that are currently the subject of the review, but I think that these amendments would improve this bill appreciably. It would lead to greater transparency, in a way that would not fetter the work of members of parliament when they are dealing with constituents or on matters where privilege may apply.


For those reasons, I can indicate that, whilst I support the bill with some reservations, I think this bill would be significantly improved with the amendments that Senator Rhiannon has proposed. I hope that these amendments will at least be considered seriously by my colleagues on both sides.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (22:00):  I rise to strongly condemn last Saturday's brutal and senseless rocket attack on Camp Hurriya, formerly known as Camp Liberty, near Baghdad that killed and injured camp residents. Two innocent people were killed and over 70 injured. On Saturday, 15 June 2013 over 40 107 millimetre missiles were fired into Camp Hurriya. Residents who were killed and wounded were in shelters whose protective T-walls had been transferred out of the camp by the government of Iraq.


This is the second deadly attack on Camp Hurriya this year. The first, on 9 February, claimed the lives of eight people and left scores injured. The more than 3,000 residents of the camp are men, women and children who are refugees from neighbouring Iraq. They and their families have suffered oppression, torture and murder at the hands of the Iranian regimes. Due to inaction and indolence at the highest level of the Iraqi government, they are trapped in unsafe, unsanitary and dangerous conditions with little prospect of resettlement and safety in third countries.


The Iraqi government is not taking effective action to protect the residents of Camp Hurriya. The question needs to be asked: how is it that these defenceless civilians can be subjected to rocket attacks while in a secure former military zone under the protection of the Iraqi government? The situation of camp residents is becoming increasingly dangerous as al-Qaeda and Iraqi Sunni extremists seek to revive sectarian conflict across Iraq. Residents are further in danger by the increasing fragility of the region, including the deteriorating situation in Syria and the increasingly aggressive and dangerous regional ambitions of the mullah regime in Iran. I do not believe that it is a coincidence that the attack on camp residents was on the same day that the result of the election of the new president of the Iranian regime was announced.


The continuing attacks on Camp Hurriya residents have drawn condemnation from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the Canadian government, US Secretary of State John Kerry and the Vice-President of the European parliament. Our foreign minister, Senator Carr, has condemned the attacks and called on the government of Iraq to take immediate steps to ensure the security of Camp Hurriya residents.


I call on the government of Iraq to render all possible medical assistance to the victims and ensure the safety of the camp's residents, consistent with its international commitments and obligations. I also call on the government of Iraq to investigate this attack and bring the perpetrators to justice. I also call on the UN to ensure that everything within their power is done not only to ensure the safety of Camp Hurriya and its residents but also to win the confidence of the Iraqi people that their human rights will be protected against oppressive elements in Iraq and from across the border in Iran. Every step must be taken by the government of Iraq and the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq to implement the 25 December 2011 agreement to quickly relocate the residents of Camp Hurriya outside Iraq. There must be a permanent and long-term solution that ensures their safety.


Finally, I would like to express my admiration for the work of the Camp Hurriya residents' tireless advocates here in Australia. Principal amongst them is Mohammed Sadeghpour. I have met with him many times since least 2010 and I never fail to be impressed with his humanity, his boundless patience and his deep and abiding commitment to justice and the freedom of his people.


This is an international disgrace. This is a situation that must be fixed. Australia has a responsibility as we have engaged in military activity in Iraq, and we have a responsibility to ensure that these defenceless civilians are provided protection by the UN and the international community.
