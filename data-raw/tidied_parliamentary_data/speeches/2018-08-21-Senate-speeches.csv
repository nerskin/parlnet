Senator GEORGIOU
 (Western Australia) (12:01):  I rise to set the record straight on behalf of One Nation. Let me be clear: we do not support the proposed company tax cuts nor any of the proposed amendments in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. One Nation has never received any draft legislation from government with any kind of detail where the big banks would be carved out from company tax cuts. In spite of all this, let me make some further points. The proposed company tax cuts are an indictment of where government values and morals lie, and that is in the deep pockets of big business. This government has not provided any policy or attempted to pay down the multibillion-dollar debt. In fact, this government, along with previous regimes, has left zero fat in the budget to pay down any debt.


Until multinational companies are pursued and forced to pay their fair share of taxes, we will stop allowing oil and gas companies to raid our natural resources without paying adequate royalties. One Nation cannot justify tax cuts beyond the $50 million threshold, which the party was instrumental in securing for small- to medium-sized businesses in this country. One Nation has taken a responsible approach for future generations in this country. If the government has billions of dollars to spend, then I look forward to working with the Treasurer and the finance minister on nation-building projects such as new roads, dams, bridges, railways and vital infrastructure that will benefit all Australians, not just the big end of town. 


We've got farmers committing suicide. We've got Australians losing their jobs that are being overtaken by 457 visa holders. We've got industry scaling back so fast. Once this country was the lucky country. Now we're quickly becoming the sellout country. One Nation would like to see the Commonwealth work with state governments to look at ways of reducing payroll tax, which is a bigger impost on businesses across the nation. This will help stimulate jobs across Australia.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (12:03):  As a parliament our responsibility is to ensure that Australians today and into the future have the best possible opportunity to succeed, to get ahead. To ensure that happens we need to ensure that the millions of businesses around Australia, who employ nine out of 10 working Australians, have the best opportunity to be successful and to get ahead. Australia is a country with a population of 25 million. We are an open trading economy. We have opportunities to sell more products and services around the world. But we're also globally exposed. We rely on foreign capital to develop our economy, and many parts of our key economic sectors are highly capital intensive. We compete for capital with businesses in other parts of the world, we compete for access to markets overseas and we compete for access to our own markets with businesses overseas. Keeping taxes on business in Australia high when countries around the world have substantially lowered theirs is making it deliberately harder for our businesses to be viable, competitive and successful into the future. 


If the Senate votes the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017—a proposal for a lower globally-more-competitive business-tax rate—down today the moment will come when this parliament will have to revisit this proposal. This is not only important for Australians today this is also important for future generations of Australians. If we want Australians today and into the future to be able to get a job, to have job security, to have the opportunity to build and develop a career here in Australia and to get wage increases then we need to ensure that the businesses around Australia who create those jobs through their enterprise and who pay those wages have the best possible opportunity to compete with businesses in other parts of the world and have the best possible opportunity to be successful into the future. Australia can only be successful into the future if we ensure that the businesses around Australia have the best possible opportunity to be successful into the future. The businesses that pay taxes on their profits help us fund a world-class health system, a world-class education system and an appropriately generous social safety net.


The opposition leader, at various times, talks about how his priority is jobs. 'Jobs, jobs, jobs', was what he said in one of his Press Club speeches in the past. But the truth is, unlike the coalition, Mr Shorten does not have a plan for jobs. Mr Shorten does not have a plan for jobs and growth. Let me tell you something, jobs don't grow on trees. Jobs are created by successful, profitable businesses. If you make it harder for businesses here in Australia to be successful into the future—guess what?—they will be less successful. I challenge anyone to credibly put forward an argument that a less successful business would hire more people than they otherwise would. A less successful business would hire fewer people. As businesses around Australia find it harder to compete with businesses in other parts of the world that pay substantially less tax and if businesses are hiring fewer people the unemployment rate would go up. That is the consequence of the socialist agenda pursued by Mr Shorten. Less successful businesses will hire fewer people, there will be less competition for workers and wages will go down.


I understand that business tax cuts, which can be described as a tax giveaway to big end of town, are not politically popular, but we don't have a job here in this chamber just to make decisions following the lead of what is popular today. We have a responsibility to make judgements about what is in the best interests of families around Australia into the future. We have a responsibility to make judgements about what is in our national interest into the future, and not just follow the lead of public opinion at one particular point in time.


I was interested to hear Senator Georgiou talk about spending money as we are proposing to lower the corporate tax rate for businesses around Australia. That is not government spending money. That is government taking less of other people's money, so they can invest it in their future success, so they can hire more Australians, so that those Australians who are more successful into the future pay more tax. Do you know what's happened over the 2017-18 financial year? Corporate tax revenue has gone up by about $10 billion compared to what was expected at budget time. That was after we legislated business tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million. Corporate tax revenue has gone up, which helps us pay for the important and essential services provided by government, which Australians expect.


Comments have been made about the big end of town. What we are doing here today, by keeping our taxes on businesses high in Australia, is deliberately making it harder for businesses like Qantas or Thomas Foods International in South Australia, with a turnover of $1.6 billion. I see Senator Storer there. He should have a chat to Thomas Foods International, a meat-processing business in South Australia which competes globally and which will tell you that a higher corporate tax rate in Australia makes it harder for it to be successful, which means it will hire fewer people than it could if only the Senate were to support a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate.


By standing in the way of our global champions out of Australia, by making it harder for the big employers of Australia—our big end of town, supposedly—to be competitive, what we are doing is helping the big end of town overseas. We are helping the big end of town in the US, in France, in Ireland and in the UK—all of these countries where the tax rate is lower. It is 21 per cent in the US. It is going to 17 per cent in the UK. It is going to 25 per cent in France. It is 22 per cent in Sweden. We are helping the big end of town in all of those countries to take business investment and jobs away from Australia, and do you know who is going to be the beneficiary? Workers in all those other countries, at the expense of Australian workers. Do you know who else is going to be the beneficiary? Small and medium-sized businesses in all of those countries, because the bigger businesses in the US, the UK, France and all these countries will not come and procure their products and services from small and medium-sized businesses here in Australia; they will procure their products and services from small and medium-sized businesses in their respective countries.


The Labor Party, of course, used to know all of this, and I would put it to the Senate that the Australian Labor Party still knows today what is in the workers' best interests. They know that a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate is necessary, is in our national interest and is in the best interests of working families around Australia. Bill Shorten has said it many times. I will just use one quote at random:


Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


Mr Bowen has also said it, and this is the one, I guess, that upsets me the most on behalf of working families around Australia. Seven months before we put a proposal for a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate into our budget, a proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent—not leading the world but putting us into the average of corporate tax rates around the world—this is what Mr Bowen said:


Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen says Labor accepts that company tax falls hardest on workers rather than wealthy shareholders, and aims for a 25 per cent company tax rate to spur economic growth.


I'm quoting him:


""I would like to see the corporate tax rate come down over time. I have previously said the nation should be aiming for a 25 per cent corporate tax rate,"" Mr Bowen said, adding that it would not be easy to do.


Of course, because Labor know that it's not easy to do, they have milked this for all it's worth politically. They know what is right for working families around Australia. They know that the future success of working families around Australia depends on the future success of the businesses that employ them. They know that keeping taxes in Australia high by international standards makes it harder for business in Australia to be successful. They know that making it harder for business to be successful leads to negative consequences for working families around Australia.


Yesterday we had a Greens senator, Senator Bartlett, talk about how we needed to fight poverty. I agree. We must fight poverty, and the way to fight poverty is to increase opportunity for people to get ahead. Stronger economic growth creates better opportunity, in particular, for low-income earners to get ahead. That is demonstrably the case. Proportionately speaking, the beneficial impact of stronger growth is most significant at the low-income end. The people that will suffer the most from making it harder for our businesses to be successful into the future are low-income Australians, who will find it harder to get into the workforce, harder to keep their job and harder to get a better job. If we condemn the businesses around Australia to an uncompetitive business tax rate, if we deliberately help businesses in other parts of the world to take business investment and jobs away from our businesses here, we make it harder, in particular, for low-income earners to get ahead.


Obviously part of the politics of all this is that the Labor Party have become quite good at sharpening their populist political message, and so it's all become about, 'This is just a tax giveaway to the big banks,' which of course is not what this is all about. But in order to ensure a lower company tax rate for the businesses around Australia who are exposed to global competition, whose workers are exposed to global competition, the government did propose to One Nation that we would be prepared to carve out the four big banks. We proposed that to others too. I've got to say I'm somewhat intrigued to hear Senator Georgiou say today, 'We never saw the amendments.' Let me tell you: the offer was very, very clear. We were so committed to ensuring that the businesses around Australia—including, in particular, the bigger businesses around Australia who are on the front line of global competition—have the best possible opportunity to be viable, to be competitive and to be successful into the future that we were prepared to carve out the four big banks. At no point were we prepared to put in a $500 million cap, because that would actually be counterproductive. It would damage the economy. It would cost jobs. As none other than Mr Shorten said—and I couldn't have put it better myself:


… lowering the corporate rate for smaller businesses only … creates an artificial incentive for Australian businesses to downsize.


In worse case scenarios some businesses might actually lay people off to get smaller - and the size based different tax treatment would create a glass ceiling on business workforce growth.


Instead we want a level playing field regardless of the size of the company.


That was a speech from Bill Shorten to ACOSS in Melbourne. Mr Shorten was right then, and he still believes this now. The reason he's arguing a different case is all politics. He is selling out the best interests of working families around Australia on what he perceives to be his ticket to the Lodge. He's very good at running the populist, sharp political lines. But you know what? I'm not here to run sharp political lines. I'm here to stand up for Australian families, to do the right thing by Australian families, today and into the future. That is why we have given this such a red-hot go. The Labor Party, of course, know this too.


A range of other issues were mentioned, like the claim that we needed to do more on multinationals. No government has done more than the Turnbull government to ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax. I think this is widely understood. None other than the Commissioner of Taxation, Chris Jordan, has spelt out in some great detail, at various Senate estimates hearings, what a significant impact our measures have had in terms of increased company tax revenue. In recent years we've implemented the multinational anti-avoidance law, the diverted profits tax and tougher penalties against tax avoidance. We've made improvements to transfer pricing laws and in relation to the public disclosure of tax information by large companies. We've pursued measures to implement country-by-country reporting. We've implemented changes to hybrid rules.


We were prepared to do more. We did talk—and it's a matter of public record—to the crossbench, to One Nation and others, about reforming the petroleum resource rent tax arrangements. I see Senator Burston here, a great, honourable man, because he was part of the deal that the government did with One Nation in March. He was there—it's a matter of public record—when we shook hands. You've got to remember that One Nation actually was prepared to back corporate tax cuts for all businesses, when the banks were included. Now Senator Georgiou comes in here and he says, 'I can't vote for this because, yes, the government might have told us that they were prepared to exclude the big four banks, but they never showed us the detailed amendments.' I mean, really? Let me just say that, if the Senate votes against a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate here in Australia, we will be letting down working families around Australia today and into the future. Everybody needs to be very conscious of that.


I will now turn to some of the other issues that were raised, starting with the One Nation suggestion that Senator Hanson made on the record here yesterday. She suggested that we should abolish the petroleum resource rent tax regime and replace it with a royalty regime offshore. We're talking about an industry that has made more than $200 billion worth of capital investment in a particular taxation regime. It is completely ludicrous, and completely reckless and irresponsible, to suggest that, as part of a negotiation for a lower globally more competitive business tax rate, we can make that sort of change to a taxation arrangement.


There's a good reason why Labor in government—the Keating government—introduced petroleum resource rent tax arrangements back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It has actually served Australia well in helping to attract massive capital investment that has helped generate a significant capital-intensive new industry, to the point where we are going to become the biggest exporter of LNG in the next few years. This has generated a massive number of jobs and massive additional income, which helps to pay for our hospitals, our schools, our Defence Force and you name it. The proposition that somehow a country like Australia, which relies on foreign investment, could turn around and abolish the PRRT arrangements and replace them with a royalty regime as part of a negotiation on reform to our corporate tax laws is completely and utterly unrealistic.


People in this debate have made the point, 'Oh, in the US this hasn't really worked.' In an interview with Fran Kelly last week, I made the point that, on the back of the Trump administration corporate tax cuts, the US recorded in excess of four per cent growth on an annualised basis in this most recent quarter; the US unemployment rate had a three in front of it; wages growth was the strongest it's been in a very long time; and massive capital investment had been returned to the country. I also said that the Trump tax cuts had led to stronger investment, stronger growth, a lower unemployment rate and higher wages.


And do you know what? I got a request from The Conversation to 'please substantiate' my assertions as part of a fact-check process. That was more than a week ago. I provided the evidence that in the US they've secured more than four per cent growth on an annualised basis in the most recent quarter; that the unemployment rate was now 3.9 per cent; that wages growth was the strongest it had been in a very long time; and that massive capital investment had been returned to the country. The IMF, the International Monetary Fund—hardly a right-wing conspiratorial organisation—updated their US growth forecast following the passage of the Trump tax cuts. They said:


The U.S. tax policy changes are expected to stimulate activity, with the short-term impact in the United States mostly driven by the investment response to the corporate income tax cuts.


But some people here will argue that black is white and that white is black. The truth is that, if the Senate stands in the way of a lower globally more competitive business tax rate here in Australia, the Senate stands in the way of the opportunity for working families around Australia today and in the future to get ahead. If we maintain one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, we will attract less investment and we will generate lower growth than we otherwise would, which means that we will see—




Senator Cameron:
  Why are you talking the country down?




Senator CORMANN:
  This was actually the Labor Party position. Nobody in Australia believes that you're taking a principled stand on this. Everybody knows that you are putting populist politics ahead of the national interest, and in history you will stand condemned for it. If this goes down today, there is no doubt that the Australian parliament will have to revisit this before long in order to protect our economic security into the future. On that basis, I commend the bill to the Senate.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the bill be read a second time.

(a) disregarding subsection 701‑1(1) (the single entity rule) both of the following apply:


   (i) the company is an *ADI;

In the interests of a compromise, the government is willing to move these amendments to exclude the large authorised deposit-taking institutions, the big four banks, from accessing the reduced company tax rate. The government has faithfully sought to implement our enterprise tax plan policy. We secured passage of the first stage of company tax cuts in March 2017. In May 2017, we then introduced this further bill to implement the remainder of the enterprise tax plan. We have continued to negotiate, respectfully, with the crossbench over many months.


The opposition, of course, have been running around the country claiming that the reason that they do not support this bill is that it provides a tax cut to the big banks. Well, the Labor Party now has the opportunity to support our amendments, to vote in favour of our amendments and to support opportunity for working families around Australia to get ahead. If you're genuinely concerned about a tax giveaway to the big banks, you now have the opportunity to vote in favour of these amendments to exclude the four big banks, to carve them out, and still protect jobs for working Australians around Australia by helping to ensure that our businesses around Australia can be internationally competitive. If you vote against these amendments, you will be exposed for the absolute hypocrisy of the political attack that you've been running for the last two years. If you genuinely care about working Australians, if you genuinely care about working families, you will help ensure that businesses around Australia who compete with businesses in other parts of the world have the opportunity to be viable, to be competitive and to be successful into the future. If it's all about the big banks, no doubt you will vote in favour of these amendments, and you will then vote in favour of the legislation as a whole.


So here is the proposition. These amendments will reduce the cost of corporate tax cuts for the period to 2027-28 by $7.9 billion. So this corporate tax reform package now costs $7.9 billion less. We've already indicated that we are prepared to pursue reforms to our petroleum resource rent tax arrangements, which would not have an impact over the forward estimates but which should have a positive revenue impact over the medium term and beyond.


Here we are. As a result of the vote by the Senate on the second reading, the Senate now has the opportunity to act in the best interest of working families around Australia for today and into the future. I urge the Senate to take that opportunity. I urge the Senate to support our amendments. If Labor votes against this amendment and this bill then it will be proof that Bill Shorten doesn't care about jobs, he doesn't care about investment into Australia, he doesn't care about economic growth and he's essentially just interested in the politics; he's just interested in doing everything he can to prevent the elected government of Australia from implementing our plan for more jobs and stronger growth.

Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (12:35):  What a pathetic performance that was from Senator Cormann, from a pathetic government that's on the rocks. It is a government that doesn't know what it's doing, a government that doesn't have an economic plan for this country, a government that would sacrifice working families, a government that would put big business before working families. This is not just about the banks; this is about an ideological obsession from this government: if you simply cut tax jobs will be created.


Contrary to what Minister Cormann has just indicated, wages are not growing in the United States. The Canadians have done this on a couple of occasions, and the companies that benefitted from the tax cuts produced fewer jobs than companies that did not benefit from tax cuts. This is an absolute joke. This is trickle-down economics in action. How disgraceful it is that we have One Nation again doing a deal to get us into a position where trickle-down economics is what this is all about. We have seen Senator Cormann stand up here and try, in my view, in vain, to defend trickle-down economics. He put up all these propositions. We don't know what this government is doing from one day to another. We certainly do not understand where this government is going. Whether it's on climate change or on economics, this government cannot be trusted. This is a government in absolute chaos. With this government you don't know who the leader will be from one day to another, because the battle is on within this government as to who is going to be the Prime Minister of this country. The sooner we go to an election and the sooner we get it resolved the better. We need to get to a position where working people can elect a government that truly cares about them and truly looks after them, and the sooner the better.


We've heard Senator Cormann say that this is about stopping an elected government doing what the elected government has promised to do. The elected government promised to hand over $80 billion to the big end of town. We saw their party room panic today, and we just saw Senator Cormann panic on the floor of the Senate when he tried to concede and give in on what they said was something they would not do: apply differential tax rates for different companies in this country. That's exactly what they've done.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  That's what you've been advocating. You've been advocating for that.




Senator CAMERON:
  I'll tell you what we're advocating, Senator Macdonald. We're advocating for fairness and decency in this country. We're advocating for a government that is a stable government. We're advocating for a government that can stand up and deliver for the working class of this country. That is something that you have never done and that the coalition has never done. Cast your mind back to when this government came in. They had their first budget in 2014-15, and their big economic argument then was that they would be increasing the GST. That's what they did. They said, 'We'll increase the GST.' Who suffers from that? It's working families. 




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Who said that?




Senator CAMERON:
  Who said it? Go back and have a look, Senator Macdonald. You had propositions going up to increase the GST. Then you had propositions going up to hand taxation back to the states. Both of those propositions did not last very long. They didn't last very long at all. Then, when those failed, what did it become? Trickle-down economics. That's what you've got at the moment. And before you got to them, you had an austerity budget in 2014 that Senator Cormann was right behind—celebrating cutting the pensions with the big, fat Havana cigar. Remember that? That's what we saw: austerity budgets cutting support mechanisms for the working poor in this country. That's what this mob were all about. They cannot be trusted on economic issues, they can't be trusted on the environment and they can't be trusted on power prices. This government are an absolute disgrace. They are a government that in absolute chaos. They are a government that have just not got it. 


The sooner we get to an election where the public can once again make a determination on these issues, the better. Remember Senator Cormann during the by-elections recently? That was going to be a test of the government's tax cuts. Well, the people in Longman and the people in Braddon made their point: they did not support this. That test failed. And it was going to be a test of the Prime Minister's leadership. Well, the voters around the country in those five by-elections made a call on that as well and said that this Prime Minister should not be leading the country. So both the Prime Minister's test and Senator Cormann's test, which they set for themselves, failed. 


The test this morning is in the party room of the coalition. Malcolm Turnbull nearly failed that test again, and it's only a matter of time before this Prime Minister hits the wall. So instead of going through all the contortions of who's going to be the leader and what changes you are going to make to your policies, take your policies to an election and let's give the public in this country, the citizens of this country, an opportunity to make a determination about this rabble of a government—this government that would cut social services, would cut health and would cut education. 


This is a government that no-one trusts. We've got a leader who not even the coalition party room trusts. We've got a leader who is on his last legs, a Prime Minister who, in the first challenge, was almost knocked off. If the other part of this government—the National Party—had been in that party room this morning, we would have had a new Prime Minister this morning. That's exactly what would have happened, because there is huge division in this government. Why any crossbencher would give any succour to this declining, deteriorating, decaying government, I don't know. We need a proposition here that indicates that this government will go to the election and take these issues to the public. That's what we should be doing. I will quickly ask Senator Cormann: Minister, can you confirm the cost, over the forward estimates and the medium term, of the tax cuts that we are debating today?

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (12:44):  These numbers have, of course, all been provided in public, and I'll confirm again that the cost of the tax cuts that are in front of the Senate today, as published in the explanatory memorandum, is $35.6 billion in the period to 2027-28, and the fiscal impact of the amendments that I've circulated over the period to 2027-28 is an increase in revenue of $7.9 billion.


As I'm on my feet, let me just deal with some of the comments that have just been made by Senator Cameron. It is so important for our future economic security and prosperity as a nation that we truly get our head around this. When Senator Cameron talks about trickle-down economics, that is a socialist insult to the free market. I happen to have seen the impact that different economic policy models have had on the quality of life of individuals, their families and the communities they live in. I happen to have seen the impact of the socialist model, the income and wealth distribution model where we want to pursue equality of outcome instead of offering equality of opportunity. I've seen the impact of that. It makes people poor. It makes people poor as individuals. It makes people poor as families. It makes communities poor. It leaves them worse off, because it removes the incentive to be the best you can be. It removes the incentive for people who can succeed and lift everybody up to do the best they can.


The reason I'm a Liberal, the reason I'm a proud member of the Liberal Party and of the Turnbull government, and the reason I'm standing here proudly promoting the benefits for Australian families of a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate is that I believe that policies of promoting freedom, free enterprise, reward for effort and encouraging people to risk themselves and take risks deliver the best possible opportunity for a high quality of life for individuals, their families and the communities they live in—yes, with an appropriately generous social safety net. And do you know what? That's what Paul Keating and Bob Hawke used to believe. That's what Bill Shorten and Chris Bowen used to believe when they were in government. That's what Chris Bowen used to believe as recently as 22 September 2015.


There's only one reason the Labor Party have taken the position that they have. It is because, in the lead-up to the 2016 election, Bill Shorten made a political decision that this was going to offer him the best political prospect to differentiate himself from the Turnbull Liberal-National Party government and that he could run an antibusiness populist agenda which would win him votes and help him, ultimately, to secure his political aspiration of becoming Prime Minister. He doesn't believe that he's pursuing the right agenda for Australia. Let me tell you: if we end up with a government that is elected on an antibusiness agenda of the politics of envy, class warfare and equality of outcome, all Australians will end up poorer, because an antibusiness agenda, making it harder for businesses to be successful across Australia, means that we'll have fewer jobs. We'll end up with fewer jobs. And do you know what happens when we create fewer jobs in the economy? There are more people unemployed and, as more people are unemployed, the wages of workers around Australia go down because there's less competition for workers. Less demand and increased supply means lower wages.


If we want to ensure that families around Australia today and into the future have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, we need to ensure that there is incentive for businesses to invest in their future growth. We've got to ensure that business has an incentive to take risks, to pursue opportunities and to sell Australian products and services around the world and here domestically. If we make it harder for Australian businesses to sell Australian products and services overseas and here in Australia, if we make it easier for businesses overseas to take business and investment away from us, we will be sending jobs from Australia overseas, and our children and grandchildren will not thank us for that.



Again, this is something that the Australian Labor Party used to understand. The Australian Labor Party used to understand that, in order to ensure that workers around Australia could succeed, the businesses that employed them had to have the opportunity to succeed. But this has changed under Mr Shorten as opposition leader and Leader of the Labor Party—sadly, supported by the Australian Greens and by a number of others, though not the majority in the Senate so far. A majority in the Senate was clearly prepared to give the government's plan for a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate the benefit of the doubt and is prepared to have this debate in committee, and we thank the Senate for that.


If we allow ourselves to be dragged down into this rhetoric around trickle-down economics and anti-business class-warfare politics-of-envy rhetoric Australians will end up poorer for it. Low-income Australians will be worse off as a result. We need to vote in support of business creating more jobs and attracting more investment so that the increased competition for workers around Australia drives up wages. As I said in my summing-up speech in the second reading debate, the evidence is very clear that in the United States, as a result of the Trump administration's tax cuts, that is precisely what is happening. That is what we should offer to workers here in Australia. The government, by moving the amendments that I've moved, is removing and carving out the big four banks. Let's take them out, but let's make sure that all of those big employers across Australia competing with big businesses from other parts of the world have the best possible opportunity to successfully compete with them so they can continue to hire millions of Australians and can continue to buy products and services from small and medium-sized businesses here in Australia—instead of helping businesses overseas hire people overseas and buy more products and services from small and medium-sized businesses overseas.

"Hinch, Sen Derryn",DHJP,2018-08-21,"



Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (12:51):  First of all, I don't want to let Senator Cameron off the hook with his Scottish brogue about this rabble of a government, which is his normal speech. What we're forgetting here is that if, or when, a Labor government comes in, they will want to cut the benefits already fought for for small and medium-sized businesses that have a turnover of more than $2 million. We may get them through Senator Wong and we may get them up to $10 million, but we've already legislated, and the government has folded to us and given us a $50 million turnover limit. That was organised last year. Labor wanted $2 million; former senator Jacqui Lambie and I got it to $10 million; and Senator Hanson, through One Nation, and I got it to $50 million. That's where it sits now.


But that makes a joke of Senator Cormann's saying we don't want a two-tier system of taxation. You've got one now. You agreed to it last year. Anybody who has a turnover of $50.1 million doesn't get it. In the same way, I'm pleased to see you're now carving the banks out, because I proposed that on Sky back in March. I'm pleased that you agreed to it. I will vote for your amendment to carve out the banks—the robber banks—who should never have been in there in the first place. At the royal commission, daily, we see what they are doing. Daily, we see the way they've been stealing money from estates. Daily, as I said yesterday, we see they have been doing what Mick Young, the Labor hero, used to say: stealing pennies from dead men's eyes. We see the disgraceful behaviour of the banks, and not just the big four but AMP and other people as well. And we have seen also what their superannuation funds have done. They do not deserve a tax cut. I'm thrilled, Senator Cormann, that you realise finally that the banks deserve to be carved out of this.


But don't give me this rubbish about a two-tier system, because, as I said back in March—and I've got an amendment coming up here in committee shortly—I believe what you should be doing now is taking the threshold from $50 million to $500 million. At the same time, I'd vote for you if you put up an amendment that said, 'I want to advance the tax cuts for the smaller companies from 27½ per cent to 25 per cent,' and that moved the cuts forward by one or two years. I wouldn't mind. I'd vote for that as well, because I believe in company tax cuts. I believe they should be there, but out there in the real world—the voter world—they don't believe you. You proved it in Longman. You made Longman an unofficial plebiscite on company tax cuts. You also made it a popularity contest between Prime Minister Turnbull and Bill Shorten, and that didn't work very well, did it? 


I would say to you, think again. Bring in an amendment that says $500 million. You have much vauntedly said, 'We'll take it to the election.' The Treasurer, Scott Morrison, has said, 'We'll take it to the election.' You said in this chamber last week, 'We'll take it to the federal election.' Well, take it to the election. I give you a pledge now that if you take it to the election in April or May—or if you change prime ministers and have one earlier, take it there as your major proposal—and the people of Australia vote you in on it I'll look at it again. In the meantime, the Justice Party has said since March, and we've stood firm despite all the things you've thrown up: 'We will go to $500 million for companies.' That will improve things for the business—and the workers, as you put it—of about 4,000 more companies. You're the one, Senator Cormann, along with Scott Morrison, who said to me that 'compromise' is the buzzword in Canberra and that 70 per cent of something is better than 100 per cent of nothing. Well, a $500 million company limit, giving 4,000 more companies tax cuts, is more than 70 per cent of something, and you should think it through again.

 (Tasmania) (12:55):  I have a couple of questions, Minister. Firstly, you mentioned, in response to Senator Cameron, what this is going to cost. I'll be a little bit more specific with my question: what is excluding the banks or ADIs over $500 billion going to cost your revenue projections? You said that was all in the explanatory memorandum, but I can't find any dollar figures in the explanatory memorandum at all. And could you explain to the Senate why you've chosen $500 billion as your cut-off point for a large ADI, when, for the purposes of legislation around the bank levy, a large ADI was $100 billion? Why the difference in this legislation versus what we saw in the bank levy?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (12:56):  I did actually explain before that, over the medium term to 2027-28, the revenue impact of removing the four big banks is increased revenue of $7.9 billion. Over the forward estimates, there is no impact, and the reason for that is that, under the Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan, the banks of that size don't actually become eligible for the lower corporate tax rate in that period. You've also got to remember that, while the banks are carved out from the enterprise tax plan altogether, they are still subject to the major bank levy, which is raising more than $2 billion a year from those banks.


In relation to why we have chosen the $500 billion threshold, that is based on advice that that was the appropriate threshold to put in. You've got to remember that the banks below that threshold are involved in putting competitive pressure on the major banks in a domestic context, and a number of them are also involved internationally. The four major banks are the ones that, essentially, have their activities concentrated domestically in Australia and, as such, arguably are less exposed to global competition.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:57):  I have a couple of questions I'd like to ask the minister, but before that can I just say that I was stuck in the chamber yesterday afternoon and I listened to Senator Hinch when he was talking about the amendment he was proposing. I thought he made some sense, and I'm pleased that his call in relation to the banks has been heeded by the government. I address the same comments to Senator Hanson. I know that Senator Hanson, a fellow senator from my home state of Queensland, has long campaigned, loudly and strongly, against giving the banks anything, for reasons which Senator Hanson and I well understand, coming from Queensland and seeing some of the things the banks have done to the citizens of our state, our constituents, in the past. I can well understand Senator Hanson's call.


Longman has been mentioned in this debate. I stood at the same polling booth in Longman with Senator Hanson's Queensland leader and with a team of Labor workers. At one stage, I seem to recall, both Senator Ketter and Senator Watt turned up to Caboolture East. I have to say it was mainly when their leader came around and the television cameras were around, but, notwithstanding that, they were there. And if I heard it once, I heard it a thousand times that day: the Labor Party—and, I might say, Senator Hanson's party—saying to voters, 'Don't give money to the big banks.' That was their main rhetoric as people walked into the polling booths: 'Here's a how-to-vote card, and don't let the government give money to the big banks.'


I've acknowledged Senator Hinch and Senator Hanson for their campaigns. I should perhaps, in fairness, acknowledge the Labor Party for that campaign too. But here we are today accepting what has been put to us by other parties, and quite frankly by many people within Australia, and yet the Labor Party are still choosing not to support it. I will interpret that—and I will interpret that very loudly back in my home state of Queensland—to mean the Labor Party are not in favour of not helping the banks. If you put that in another form, the Labor Party now seem to be helping the banks that they were so critical of. They weren't talking about other things at the Longman by-election; they were talking about, 'Don't let the government give the money to the big wealthy banks who've been such horrible people.' Here we are. We've listened to that. We're a government that acts in the best interests of people, and a government that listens. We're a government that actually is prepared to change policy where we're convinced that the Australian people are not with us. So here we are doing this and yet we still have opposition from the Labor Party. Forget about the Greens, because we know they'll always vote against the coalition regardless of what.


I would appeal to my Queensland colleague Senator Hanson, and her team, to seriously consider the new regime. I say to them: 'Well done; you've succeeded. I now urge your support for this package, with the banks excluded.' Senator Cameron rabbits on with his rhetoric in his 'broad Scottish brogue', as Senator Hinch said, about looking after the workers. But as I always say in this chamber—I think it's one statement I say that I get universal agreement on—I'm not very bright, but I can work out that companies need to have alternatives, options, on where to invest their money. If they can invest in country A and make a profit of 100, but they only pay 15 per cent tax on that profit, and if they can invest in country B—the same investment, the same return of 100—but they have to pay 25 or 30 per cent tax, then you don't have to be very bright to work out where they will make their investment. And, of course, if you don't have companies making investments in Australia, you don't grow industry and you don't employ people.


The Labor Party are all talking about how they're interested in the welfare of workers. We know they're not. In fact, I came across an article just recently about Senator Wong's favourite union. They're not my favourite union, I have to say, but Senator Wong's a member of CFMMEU. I see that even the CFMMEU has warned the Queensland government that its ambitious 50 per cent renewable energy target is 'not realistic' and that Labor should instead back new 'clean coal' power stations. This article, by Jared Owens, says:


The influential union, which represents workers at coalmines and generators, wrote to the—


Queensland—


government in May cautioning it against rushing to ""unreliable and expensive"" green energy.


The CFMEU, as I say, not a union I usually quote, go on to say:


The 50 per cent renewable target is not realistic. Whilst you can build solar and wind generation to achieve the target on paper, what do we expect is going to happen at night?


They say to read the advice of Treasury, released under the right to information laws. The quote from that is:


During the summer months it is still very warm into the evening … you will have high demand, no solar and potentially little wind generation.


I do remember the CFMEU. I remember them very fondly from when, as forestry minister back in 2004, I worked with Michael O'Connor, who was then the head of the forestry section of the CFMEU and who's now the boss of the bigger union. I remember how in those days, back in 2004, we worked together because we were interested in the jobs of workers in the forestry industry. And I have to say that, working in very close concert with the forestry section of the CFMEU at the time, we did achieve that. For a while, we saved the jobs of forestry workers. The CFMEU and Michael O'Connor were very courageous in standing up to the Labor Party in those days, because they knew what was best for their workers and for workers across Australia at the time.


Now, as I say, it's a bit of deja vu that I'm onside with the CFMEU in relation to renewable energy and clean coal. I agree with the CFMEU because I have an interest in the coal workers of North Queensland. The mines are not far from where I live. I know the wealth that's there. I know the jobs that are created there, and so do the CFMEU. I'm delighted to see that they are showing the same courage they had in the 2004 forestry debates by now getting stuck into the Labor Party for their stupidity on renewable energy.


I only mention that in this debate because, again, Senator Cameron talked about looking after the workers and looking after the poor people. I don't believe him, and neither does the CFMEU, I have to say, in the two instances I met. But, if Senator Cameron and the Labor Party are correct about not favouring the big banks, as they were talking about at the Longman by-election—I heard them all day; all day they were talking about not giving money to the big banks—if it's a win for them, well, so be it. But here we have a piece of legislation which excludes the big banks.


As I say, I was impressed with Senator Hinch's speech yesterday, and he's more or less repeated that just now. I concede that I'm not always one of those who take much notice of Senator Hinch, and some of the things he talks about we're directly opposed to. But I thought his contribution on this was very important.


As to what the limit is, that's something that Senator Cormann's answered. I will seek from Senator Cormann some additional explanation of that because I'm trying to understand what Senator Hinch is proposing. Dare I repeat, Senator Hinch, that you've had a success on the banks, but I would hope that, regardless of where the government goes on the other issue, you will at least support us in this amended legislation so that we can get it through. I think you accept, Senator Hinch—I think most of the crossbenchers do accept—that you don't relate to the Labor Party's rhetoric about looking after the poor people.


You understand, as I do—and, as I say, you don't have to be very bright to understand this—that, when companies have money to invest, they're going to invest in a place where they can keep the majority of their profits, and that is in a low-tax country. If we don't get that sort of investment in our country, we're not going to have the growth of industry. We're not going to have the jobs that we need in many of these industries, which these mainly foreign companies invest in. It's so simple. So I'm just begging Senator Hinch and Senator Hanson and her colleague to think in the broader picture. We do need that investment. I think they all accept that. But then we get tied down on where the cut-off should be. I'm going to ask Senator Cormann to again explain to me what exactly Senator Hinch is proposing and why the government isn't looking at it. Until I hear that, heaven knows where I will end up. It might even be that the government should look at it, but I don't fully understand it at this time.


I conclude by again appealing to my Queensland colleague Senator Hanson and her colleagues in One Nation to look at the bigger picture of investment in Australia and, for us, investment in Queensland. Senator Hanson, you and your colleague and Senator Hinch have had a success on the banks' carve-out. The government's gone along with that. I appeal to you because I'm interested in jobs for Queenslanders. I'm even interested, Senator Hinch, in jobs for Victorians. They're going to have a better chance of getting a job if there is investment coming into this country, and there won't be investment if companies can make more money by investing in a country with a lower tax regime. So, Minister, will you again explain, for my simple mind, what the government is proposing on the cut-off, what Senator Hinch is proposing on the cut-off and why one is better than the other?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (13:11):  I thank Senator Macdonald for that question. It's a very good question. When we legislated the first three years of our business tax cuts in March 2017 to a threshold of $50 million—which is the threshold that came into effect in the 2018-19 financial year, and that takes us now, in terms of our Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan, to 30 June 2019—it was always on the basis that we would seek to legislate the entire enterprise tax plan. Being able to make the case for lower, globally more competitive business tax rates for businesses with more than $50 million in turnover is hard enough. If we now lock in a $500 million cap we will never, ever revisit that. It'll be absolutely impossible to go to the Australian people and say, 'We want you to now support a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate just for businesses with a turnover of more than $500 million.' The practical effect of that is that we would be locking in, in a structural sense, on an ongoing basis, a five per cent higher tax rate on profits for businesses with a turnover of more than $500 million. So, as soon as you are a business that goes from $500 million to $500 million plus $1, you would end up getting hit with a five per cent tax increase on 100 per cent of your profits—from your first dollar in profit to, essentially, 100 per cent of your profits.


What that means is that we would be providing a perverse incentive to businesses around Australia who've been somewhat successful to downsize. Any business that is able to generate $500 million worth of turnover has been somewhat successful. They've proven that they've got the entrepreneurial flair, the ideas, the products, the services, the know-how, the workers, the team and the capacity to generate economic activity, generate jobs and pay wages. But, if we say to that business, 'If you have one additional dollar of turnover, we will hit you with a five per cent increase in tax on 100 per cent of your profits,' that is a massive disincentive to further growth. As Mr Shorten used to assertively argue, it provides a perverse incentive to downsize.


The reason we're so committed to lowering the corporate tax rate for all businesses, irrespective of their turnover—carving out the four big banks, but for all other businesses—is that we want to show that, down the track, they will have the benefit of a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate. They're making investment decisions now based on their expectations of future after-tax profitability. If you talk to fund managers around the world, they will tell you that what they consider when making investment decisions is the expected after-tax return on that investment.


Do you know what the biggest source of foreign direct investment into Australia is? The biggest source of foreign direct investment into Australia is the United States. And do you know what has happened in the United States? Their corporate tax rate, earlier this year, went from 35 per cent to 21 per cent. We compete with businesses in the United States for investment into Australia, and in the US, their home market, the corporate tax rate went from 35 per cent to 21 per cent. So how can we here in Australia—with a comparatively small population, a large continent, lots of opportunity, capital intensive industries and significant reliance on foreign capital in order to continue to generate stronger growth and create more opportunities for workers around Australia—say that we're going to tie the arms of our businesses behind their backs and we're going to put rocks into their backpacks to make it harder for them to compete with businesses overseas?


The impact of putting a cap in place that would likely never be able to be shifted would be that we would provide an incentive to bigger businesses to become smaller businesses, when what we should be wanting to do is provide an incentive to smaller businesses across Australia to become bigger businesses. If we say to a smaller business or one approaching the $500 million cap that if they are even that little bit more successful we're going to hit them with a five per cent additional corporate tax rate, the enthusiasm to pursue further growth opportunities will be hampered. And we shouldn't hamper that, because, in the end, who gets hurt when a business is less successful? The people who miss out on getting a job in that business.


The people in the US won't mind if we make it harder for businesses here to compete with businesses over there. We have to remember that the US has a big population and a big domestic capital market, comparatively speaking. The reason they were able to have a 35 per cent corporate tax rate for so long is that, the need for them to have a competitive business tax rate—compared to Australia; in a comparative sense—was actually less urgent. It is much more urgent for a country like Australia—an open trading economy, a globally focused but also globally exposed economy—to have a globally competitive business tax rate so that we can continue to attract capital investment into Australia from other parts of the word and continue to build our businesses here in Australia. People say, 'Big businesses is unpopular.' But, hang on: if big businesses employ more people, where do those people go to shop, to have their coffees, to go to restaurants? The flow-on effect goes throughout the economy.


I see Senator Brockman, from the great state of Western Australia, is here. We are a trading economy in many ways. We are part of a trading nation. We have got some big companies. FMG didn't exist in 2003; today it's a big company. BHP is a big company in Western Australia. They are exposed to changes in commodity prices which we don't influence. We don't have any control over them. We are price takers. When the iron ore price, which is 20 per cent of national export income and a significant proportion of the economic activity in Western Australia, goes from $180 a tonne down to $45 a tonne, forcing iron ore businesses and other businesses to seriously cut their costs in order to remain viable and competitive, what happens in the rest of the economy? It means less opportunity for small and medium-sized business. It means lower job security. It has an impact all the way through the economy. But that is something that is outside our control. Our tax rate is directly under our control. If we keep taxes in Australia high, it is a deliberate decision to make it harder for our businesses in Australia to compete with businesses in other parts of the word. It's a deliberate decision to make it harder for workers in Australia to get a job and pursue a career here in Australia, compared to workers in other parts of the world.


I see Senator Macdonald. Qantas was set up by three people in Longreach in Queensland. It was a small business that started with a mail run. Today they employ 30,000 people, and 3,000 small and medium-sized businesses supply goods and services to them. They operate in a fiercely competitive international industry. If Qantas has less opportunity to be viable, to be competitive, to be profitable and to be successful into the future, it has a direct impact on the job security of people working at Qantas. It has a direct impact on the job security of the many Australians working in small and medium-sized businesses supplying goods and services to Qantas. It has a direct impact on the job security of the many Australians working in cafes, restaurants and shopping centres around Australia, serving the people who work for Qantas and all of their suppliers. In Townsville, I believe there is a business that has secured the contract to paint the Qantas planes. Senator Macdonald is nodding. These are the sorts of things that a successful business can do.


If we here in Australia, as policymakers, make a deliberate decision to make it harder for our global champions—the businesses that have grown from employing three people to employing 30,000 people—and to put them at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy, it will hurt families around Australia, hurt our economy and cost jobs. If we genuinely want the best possible opportunity for Australians today and Australians in the future to get ahead, to get a job, to be able to build a career and to get wage increases, we've got to ensure that our policy settings facilitate business success, because nine out of 10 working Australians work for private sector businesses, and their future job opportunities, job security, career prospects and wage increases depend on the future viability, competitiveness, profitability and success of the businesses that employ them.


That is why I'm urging the Senate to get behind this very important reform. In an absolute sign of good faith and a demonstration of how important we believe this is, we have put forward these amendments to carve out the four big banks, because clearly, in the political debate, that was an issue that was making it harder for people to support otherwise good policy and otherwise important reform. So, given this concession by the government, we really would urge the Senate to reflect on the national interest here and to reflect on all of the things that Mr Shorten, Mr Bowen and Senator Wong have said in the past about how important it is for Australia to have a globally competitive business tax rate.


Senator Hinch is right. He was on the record for a long time. The reason I always heard him say that he wanted to put in the $500 million cap was that he wanted to exclude the big banks. Well, we want to exclude the big banks, but without hurting those businesses employing millions of Australians that are exposed to global competition. That is what we're putting to the Senate. Work with us. We have taken a step towards you—a significant step. Let us come together in the national interest. Let us come together in the interests of working families around Australia whose future job opportunities, job security and wage increases depend on the future success and profitability of businesses around Australia which employ them.

Senator PATRICK
 (South Australia) (13:22):  Centre Alliance will not be supporting these late-landing amendments. These amendments do carve out the banks. Of course, we understand the politics of that. The royal commissioner has found the conduct of not only banks but also other financial institutions to be poor, if not abhorrent. But the best way to deal with that conduct is directly, not indirectly by saying, 'We're going to carve you out of something else.' You need to take that on directly, and that means you need to have much tougher laws and regulations around the banks. You need to have very strong whistleblower laws so that every executive inside a bank understands that someone inside their organisation will call out misconduct and that, when they do so, they will be protected and those protections will be strong. It also includes having good enforcement. That's how you deal with misconduct in the banks: solid, strong enforcement. That includes criminal proceedings against executives that have breached criminal law. It also means stronger regulators—so making sure that ASIC, APRA and the ATO do their jobs properly. That's the way in which you tackle misconduct inside the banks. So that's the reason we won't support this. It's not good policy. You need to take on the banks directly in respect of their conduct.

Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (13:24):  I want to take a couple of moments to bring to the chamber's attention the reason we are now in the in committee stage and why the position Senator Hanson takes at the third reading stage, when we get to it, will be crucial to the outcome of this bill. I know today is a bit of a crazy day in Canberra. There's lots happening. I think as I speak we see Mr Dutton, the next Liberal Party leader, having a press conference to explain his actions. There is all of that craziness within the government. There has also been a bit of confusion about what's happening here on the vote regarding the company tax cuts.


What happened a little while ago was the vote on the second reading. It was lost, from the Labor Party's perspective, 35 to 34, so 35 people voted in favour of the second reading of the bill and 34 voted against it. What was very notable in that vote was the absence of one particular senator—Senator Hanson. My understanding is that she was not paired for that vote. It wasn't as if there were a prearranged situation where she wouldn't vote and someone else would refrain from voting as well. Senator Georgiou did come in here and vote with the opposition against the company tax cuts, but Senator Hanson was missing. As a result of that, the government succeeded in passing this bill at the second reading stage.


The vote was 35 to 34. If Senator Hanson had been here and had voted with Senator Georgiou, as they had indicated publicly they would do to kill off these company tax cuts, then the vote would have been tied at 35 all, which would have meant it would have been lost and we wouldn't be having this debate now. Senator Hanson's failure to vote or her abstention has meant that the government got the legislation through at the second reading stage by one vote, and that's why we're continuing to debate it now.


No-one seems very clear about what Senator Hanson's actions were based on—whether it was deliberate on her part to miss that vote or whether she had some legitimate reason why she was not here to cast her vote. Whether it was accidental or deliberate, her absence from that vote allowed the government to succeed in passing this bill at the second reading stage and has given new life to the possibility of these company tax cuts going through.



Government senators:  Hear, hear!




Senator WATT:
  As I said that, government backbenchers were cheering Senator Hanson on. Their hopes in passing this bill and getting these company tax cuts through rest on Senator Hanson's actions from here on in. If we are to take Senator Hanson at her word and believe her when she says that it was an accidental abstention and that she actually does intend to vote against these company tax cuts, as she has been indicating over the last 24 hours, fortunately for her there is an opportunity for her to come in here and make amends. When we get to the third reading stage of this bill she will have the opportunity to cast her vote and to follow through on her claims to oppose these company tax cuts by voting with the opposition to kill off this bill.


The acid test is really on Senator Hanson. Whether she actually supports these company tax cuts, whether she's going to vote against them with the opposition or whether she will simply abstain from that vote again and help the government out, Senator Hanson needs to be under no illusions what the consequences of her decision will be. If she does assist the government in passing these company tax cuts, then I think she knows very well what is coming her way. She needs to have a very close look at the results in the Longman by-election to understand what battlers in outer suburban areas and regional Queensland think about these company tax cuts. Let's hope she is telling the truth in having accidentally missed that vote and let's hope that she does make amends and, to make sure that these company tax cuts do not pass, votes with the opposition when we get to the third reading stage.

Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (13:29):  I'm very pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important legislation in the committee stage—the government's enterprise tax plan. I'm very pleased that the government has already been able to secure the first stage of this plan. I'm very pleased about the early results of the success of the first stage of the government's plan. In a moment, Minister, I'll be asking you about some of those results, but I want to take the opportunity, since we are in the committee stage, to revisit some of the issues that we've considered in this debate.


As the minister said in an answer to a previous question, Australia is in a global economy. Although we are an island geographically we are not isolated from the rest of the world. The rate of company tax that we charge our companies here in Australia does have bearing on how much investment we have here in Australia. We can pretend if we like that that's not the case. We can dig our heads in the sand and think that it doesn't matter that the rest of the world is moving on the company tax rate and that company tax rates around the world are falling. But, ultimately, we will see the results of that. Ultimately, we will pay the price of that.


It's not just the United States, as Senator Cormann mentioned, that has dramatically lowered their company tax rates but other major trading partners in similarly arranged economies like the United Kingdom have drastically cut their corporate tax rate. In our region, we are now dangerously uncompetitive with our corporate tax rate. Even in the OECD—not exactly renowned for being a club of low-taxing countries—on the corporate tax rate average, we are getting dangerously out of step and we will soon be one of the highest company taxing countries within the OECD.


Investors don't invest in Australia just because we have great weather, because we have nice beaches and because we have cute animals; they invest in Australia because they can get a good return on investment in Australia. The relative return on investment that they need to justify an investment in Australia is going to be higher for every percentage point higher our company tax rate is. A like-for-like return on investment between New Zealand and Australia, with a lower corporate tax rate in New Zealand, means that dollar of investment is going to go to New Zealand instead of Australia.


The multinational corporations who operate in this country have to justify to their parent companies internationally why they are deserving of investment here in Australia. Why the best return on investment for them will be here domestically. Their task in doing so, their task in convincing head office that Australia is a great place to invest, only becomes harder when our company tax rate becomes dangerously out of step.


Minister, I want to return though to the question that I flagged earlier in my contribution. Of course, the government has already legislated part of the enterprise tax plan for small businesses. I'm interested to know from you what the result of that legislation has been in many aspects, but in particular what the result of that has been in terms of receipts from company taxes for the federal government. The reason why I ask that question, Minister, and why I flag that question to you, is that often it is the case—and I'd be interested to know the data from Australia—that when rates of tax are cut internationally, whether that be company tax or personal income tax, revenue from companies doesn't decrease, as you might intuitively expect it to, but it increases for a range of reasons. Companies are encouraged to invest more, they are encouraged to employ more and they are encouraged to deploy more capital. Their economic activity increases and so their profits increase. And sometimes they even choose to bank more of their profits, if it's an option for them, within a jurisdiction that now has a lower rate of tax. Minister, I'm interested whether you could enlighten the Senate on what the results on company tax revenues have been from the first stage of the company tax cut plan.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (13:33):  I thank Senator Paterson for that question. As I said in my summing up speech, in the period since we legislated the first three years of company tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million, economic growth is up, employment growth is up and just under $10 billion in higher company tax receipts have been collected compared to our expectations in the 2017-18 budget. If you look at the 2017-18 budget and you compare that with the actual performance as reported in the monthly financial statements, what you will be able to see is that company tax receipts are actually going up, which is very good news in terms of our objective to put funding for important social services, for health, for education and for national security on a fiscally sustainable foundation trajectory for the future.


In the end, a strong economy is central to everything. It is central to making sure that Australians today and into the future—Australian families today and into the future—have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, to reach their full potential, to have a great quality of life. It is also central to making sure that the government can generate the necessary revenue moving forward. The experience on the back of our plan for stronger growth and more jobs is that, as more jobs have been created, not only have more company tax receipts been collected but also we've had significant increases in personal income tax receipts compared with what was expected.


The good news doesn't end there. We've had significant reductions in expenditure on welfare payments because more people are in jobs than was expected. So we've got more revenue—more revenue from company tax, more revenue from personal income tax—and we've got less expenditure on welfare, because more people are in employment than had been anticipated. I would have thought that would be something everyone in the Senate would and should welcome. In fact, the proportion of working-age Australians on welfare today is at its lowest level in 25 years. That is one of the proud achievements of the Turnbull government. That is why we say that our plan for a stronger economy, our plan for more jobs, our plan to help families around Australia to have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, is the best recipe against poverty.


But, if we make it harder for business to be successful, low-income earners will be hurt the most, because it is low-income earners around Australia who are the most exposed to the negative impact of lower growth, who are the most exposed to the negative impact of lower business growth, because invariably it is at the lower income end that people are trying to break into the jobs market. It is often at the lower-income end that people are most exposed to the variability in hours worked. Stronger growth means a better opportunity for more working hours, a better opportunity for permanent employment instead of casual employment.


These are all things that come from helping to ensure that businesses around Australia have the best possible opportunity to be successful. I say again what I said in my summing-up speech: if we make decisions that make it harder for business to be successful, they will be less successful. And as businesses are less successful they will hire fewer people than they otherwise would have and will invest less in their future growth. As businesses around Australia hire fewer people than they otherwise would have, employment growth will be less, the unemployment rate will be higher, the demand for workers will be less, the supply of workers will be higher, the wages that can be secured by workers will be lower and the revenue for government will be less.


So, it is lose, lose, lose, lose, whereas what we have demonstrated—certainly the data is obvious in our monthly financial statements, and later in September the Treasurer and I will be releasing the final budget outcome for 2017-18. People will be able to see how the Australian economy and Australian businesses have performed in 2017-18 compared with what was estimated in May 2017. And people will be able to see, based on the data that I've already released, that company tax receipts, even in just the one calendar year, are substantially higher than what had been anticipated, to the tune of nearly $10 billion.


To put that into context, the cost of the remaining unlegislated business tax cuts, per the explanatory memorandum that was tabled with the legislation, is $35.6 billion to 2027-28. So, just in 2017-18 we have raised $10 billion more than had been anticipated. The cost for the remaining unlegislated tax cuts to 2027-28 is $35.6 billion. We've put an amendment on the table in relation to the four major banks which, I'm advised, would reduce the cost of corporate cuts to 2027-28 by $7.9 billion. We've already flagged that we are considering reforms to the petroleum resource rent tax arrangements, which would not have an impact over the short term, over the forward estimates, but which also would have a revenue impact over the medium term, further reducing costs.


If you look at the cost of the opportunity to make businesses around Australia internationally competitive, it is actually very low when you put it next to the opportunity to create more jobs, create more personal income tax revenue for government and create more company tax revenue for government on the back of stronger growth, rather than on the back of higher taxes. As certainly as night follows day, the Labor Party agenda—the Labor Party antibusiness, politics of envy, higher taxes agenda—would lead to less investment, lower growth, fewer jobs, higher unemployment and, on the back of higher unemployment, lower wages; whereas our agenda, which is all about encouraging business to invest more by making sure that businesses have the best possible opportunity to sell Australian products and services around the world and in Australia, is all about attracting more investment to deliver stronger growth and more jobs. As more jobs are created and the unemployment rate continues to come down, the increased competition for workers drives up wages. As more people are employed and as wages go up, personal income tax revenue goes up, as does company tax revenue, on the back of more profitable businesses. That is the win-win-win that we believe Australian families deserve and that is the win-win-win that we are asking the Senate to support.

"Storer, Sen Timothy",IND,2018-08-21,"



Senator STORER
 (South Australia) (13:41):  This amendment appears to emerge from the public concern surrounding the behaviour of the big banks, uncovered by the royal commission. There is no doubt that many of the practices that have been exposed have been appalling and that many ordinary people have suffered greatly. Many of the senators have spoken about this today and at other times in this place. But I have made it clear that I regard a consideration of the company tax cuts to be distinct and separate from the behaviour of the big banks, and I said as much to the government, and publicly, when I opposed the consideration, in March, of the initial legislation. I have considered the case for and against the company tax cuts thoroughly, on their merits and on the basis of evidence, but I do not believe that the government bringing forward legislation today to exclude the big banks is the appropriate way to prosecute their case, which they have been doing consistently for the past months in which I've been here as a senator.


I spoke yesterday regarding the bill as presented previously, and my focus was on that and on the future of the economy and the future of our families. I am, as a South Australian, a passionate advocate of South Australian businesses—and I note that Senator Cormann referenced a South Australian business today. I do note that business is the backbone of the economy and I will do all that I can to encourage business growth and prosperity. But my review of the evidence to date about the tax cuts legislated already is that they have not delivered the changes in employment and wages, as indicated by the modelling provided to me by Treasury and other sources, upon which this legislation was based. I have consistently noted that I found the legislation too narrowly based and the benefits too small to outweigh the costs. Whilst they've now been reduced from $35.6 billion to perhaps $7.9 billion less, they are still very considerable in terms of the future need for funds to tackle the budget deficit and growing government debt and also the services that Australian people wish to have. I reference the intergenerational reports, which indicate a further and growing need, particularly in aged care and retirement as the populace grows older. So I see the tax cut itself, even with the big banks removed, as not true tax reform. I don't believe that it's in line with the clear principles outlined within the Henry tax and transfer review. There were at least seven principles, of which a company tax cut was one, and Senator Cormann has noted that with me previously. But it was one of seven principal feature reforms that were all to be brought about together.


So I will not be supporting these amendments. I believe that the conduct of the banks should be referenced in another forum—be it the royal commission findings or APRA and other entities set up to do so—and that putting forward a piece of legislation just to remove the big banks in order to gain support is not an appropriate way to move forward. So I remain opposed to the extension of the tax cuts as legislated, even with the removal of the big banks or, under Senator Hinch's proposal, a threshold of $500 million in turnover. The evidence I've seen on the changes from 2015 is that they have not delivered what was indicated, and we have significant gross government debt and future requirements for services that need to be funded.


There are arguments that many foreign investors are looking at Australia in terms of many, many aspects alongside, but outside of, the company tax rate headline figure, which is often quoted by government senators and other advocates of this. It's a misleading argument because, to date, we have gained significant foreign investment into Australia against other economies, even in our region, that have much lower headline company tax rates. Investors come to Australia for a variety of reasons. So to indicate that there's going to be a massive problem with investors choosing not to invest in our country, given our headline tax rate compared to the headline company tax rates of other countries, is slightly misleading. In summary, I have considered the case for and against these company tax cuts thoughtfully, on their merits and on the basis of evidence, and I remain opposed to any extension of the tax cuts as legislated, even with the changes made today.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (13:47):  I am interested in this debate, and I am listening to contributions made by other senators. In relation to the last contribution, as I keep saying, I'm not terribly clever, but you don't have to be clever to work out what companies will do with their investment strategies. If they can get a cheaper tax rate in a similar country to Australia, they're looking at their profits, and so they'll make their investment in a country that gives them and their shareholders the greatest return. That's relatively easy to understand. We are a country that does need investment, particularly foreign investment, but the foreign investors have plenty of options. As Senator Cormann mentioned in answer to a previous question of mine, most of the foreign investment that comes into Australia is from the United States. They are reducing their taxes to a much lower rate, and I'm sure it makes investors in the United States wonder why they should be investing in Australia when they can invest in their own country and return a lot more of their profits to their shareholders.


Senator Cormann, in answer to a previous question from me, spoke about Qantas and spoke about it being a Queensland company that started off with three people and now employs tens of thousands right around the world and supports lots of small businesses. That sort of brought it home to me. We tend to talk in the abstract in this place and throw around billions of dollars and use Treasury terminology. It's always very easy to get out of the realm of reality, and this building is very good at doing that.


Again I come back to Senator Hinch's amendment of companies over $500 million turnover being excluded. I've asked the minister's advisers to give me some information, which they have. But I find it difficult to accept that this is what Senator Hinch's amendment would do, because the companies that would not receive the reduced tax, which means they'd be paying more, are companies like Mackay Sugar. The company, self-grown in the Mackay area of my state, just down the road from where I live, owns quite a few sugar mills. It crushes the cane of thousands of farmers in the Mackay region and it employs thousands of workers in its mills. But, under Senator Hinch's amendment, Mackay Sugar would pay more tax than other companies. 


The same applies to Sun Metals, a Korean company set up in Townsville to refine zinc. That is a company which made an investment in Australia some years ago, when energy was cheap, I have to say—when electricity was cheap. That's one of the reasons they came to Australia, and I suspect they often regret it nowadays, with the cost of electricity, particularly in North Queensland. But that's a company that can make investments anywhere in the world. Are they going to put more investment into Townsville when they know that a bigger share of any profit they make is going to be taken from them and their shareholders than if they invested their money somewhere else? They have refineries in other parts of the world, so why would they invest in Australia and create more jobs for Australians if they're going to be penalised by paying more tax? 


I note in this list of companies—I can't believe it's true, but I'm sure it is if it was given to me by the minister's advisers—is Mantra Group, which owns a lot of hotels around Australia and employs thousands and thousands of Australians. But, under Senator Hinch's amendment, they're going to be paying a penalty tax rate not paid by some of their competitors. JJ Richards & Sons are a waste collection group. I think they're based in Brisbane; they certainly have lots of operations around my home state of Queensland. They fall into the category that would be caught by Senator Hinch's amendment. And I know they're a family company. I've heard presentations they've made before, and they are a home-grown company. But they will be penalised in the tax they pay, if I understand what's being proposed. 


Brisbane Airport, another group that, according to my figures, has a turnover of well above the $500 million mark, will be paying more tax than its competitors. The Kilcoy Pastoral Company are an Australian food manufacturing company in Queensland. Senator Hanson would know the Kilcoy Pastoral Company well because it employs a lot of Queenslanders. I dare say, her party having stood at the Longman by-election and seen who took whose card—Kilcoy is, I think, in the Longman electorate. If it's not, certainly the workers at Kilcoy would be living in the electorate of Longman. Kilcoy would pay a penalty rate of tax.


I'm pleased to see Senator Hinch coming back into the chamber. I'm just saying, Senator Hinch, a lot of the companies that would be caught by your amendment about $500 million turnovers—so they'd be getting less of a tax cut—are little companies like the Kilcoy Pastoral Company that Senator Hanson and I know well. I mentioned Brisbane Airport; JJ Richards and Sons; and Sun Metals, the refinery in Townsville. These are all companies that will pay more tax than their competitors. And I repeat, again for your benefit, Senator Hinch—




The TEMPORARY CHAIR 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  Senator Macdonald, I will just remind you to direct your remarks through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I beg your pardon, Chair; you're quite right. I just wanted to repeat for other senators' benefit what I'd said earlier. Sun Metals is an international Korean company that came to Townsville a couple of decades ago to refine zinc. They have refineries all around the world, and if they're going to expand, they can make investments anywhere, which means that they won't invest in Australian plants, which means fewer jobs for Australians. A couple of weeks ago I was opening the Mount Isa Rodeo Hall of Fame, and I met Australians who work for Sandvik Mining and Construction, a Swedish company that earns more than $500 million in income and thus will not be eligible for the tax cuts, which means the guys I was talking to at the rodeo may find that their head company in the future invests more in Africa or South America than they do in Mount Isa.


The list goes on. ERM Power, a homegrown Australian electricity supply company, will not be in the same race competitively with tax. Aurizon, a company involved in railway transportation in Queensland, partly owned by the Queensland government, will not get the same tax cuts as other people in the transport industry. Senator Cormann mentioned Qantas in response to my question. Not only Qantas but also Virgin Airlines will not benefit from increased investment, because they're not going to get the tax cut.


I continue with the higher-range turnovers: Wilmar Australia Holdings. In the town that I live in, Wilmar is not always the best name to mention—although they own four or more sugar mills, crush the cane and employ thousands of workers. They're a Singaporean company who can and do invest anywhere in the world. Why would they be interested in increasing investment in Australia when they can invest in other parts of the world and take home more of the profits they earn? Similarly Glencore, which now operates the Mount Isa mines, is a Swiss company. They can invest in Australia, or they can invest in Africa or the Americas. They know that, if they do that, they'll get a better return, because they'll pay less tax, since the Australian tax system is not competitive.


Teys Australia Ltd, a homegrown Rockhampton based meat-processing company with processing facilities in Rockhampton and Biloela, is on this list. They're not going to be eligible for reduced tax. Teys compete against some big multinationals in the meat-processing area. I know Senator Hinch is very keen on processing meat within Australia, and here is an Australian company doing it. With the limit Senator Hinch is proposing, Teys will not have the benefit of reduced taxes, which means their investment will be more circumspect. I go to the bigger companies. Myer employs tens of thousands of Australians in its various operations. This list goes on and on.


Progress reported.

"Georgiou, Sen Peter",PHON,2018-08-21,"



Senator GEORGIOU
 (Western Australia) (12:01):  I rise to set the record straight on behalf of One Nation. Let me be clear: we do not support the proposed company tax cuts nor any of the proposed amendments in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017. One Nation has never received any draft legislation from government with any kind of detail where the big banks would be carved out from company tax cuts. In spite of all this, let me make some further points. The proposed company tax cuts are an indictment of where government values and morals lie, and that is in the deep pockets of big business. This government has not provided any policy or attempted to pay down the multibillion-dollar debt. In fact, this government, along with previous regimes, has left zero fat in the budget to pay down any debt.


Until multinational companies are pursued and forced to pay their fair share of taxes, we will stop allowing oil and gas companies to raid our natural resources without paying adequate royalties. One Nation cannot justify tax cuts beyond the $50 million threshold, which the party was instrumental in securing for small- to medium-sized businesses in this country. One Nation has taken a responsible approach for future generations in this country. If the government has billions of dollars to spend, then I look forward to working with the Treasurer and the finance minister on nation-building projects such as new roads, dams, bridges, railways and vital infrastructure that will benefit all Australians, not just the big end of town. 


We've got farmers committing suicide. We've got Australians losing their jobs that are being overtaken by 457 visa holders. We've got industry scaling back so fast. Once this country was the lucky country. Now we're quickly becoming the sellout country. One Nation would like to see the Commonwealth work with state governments to look at ways of reducing payroll tax, which is a bigger impost on businesses across the nation. This will help stimulate jobs across Australia.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (12:03):  As a parliament our responsibility is to ensure that Australians today and into the future have the best possible opportunity to succeed, to get ahead. To ensure that happens we need to ensure that the millions of businesses around Australia, who employ nine out of 10 working Australians, have the best opportunity to be successful and to get ahead. Australia is a country with a population of 25 million. We are an open trading economy. We have opportunities to sell more products and services around the world. But we're also globally exposed. We rely on foreign capital to develop our economy, and many parts of our key economic sectors are highly capital intensive. We compete for capital with businesses in other parts of the world, we compete for access to markets overseas and we compete for access to our own markets with businesses overseas. Keeping taxes on business in Australia high when countries around the world have substantially lowered theirs is making it deliberately harder for our businesses to be viable, competitive and successful into the future. 


If the Senate votes the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan No. 2) Bill 2017—a proposal for a lower globally-more-competitive business-tax rate—down today the moment will come when this parliament will have to revisit this proposal. This is not only important for Australians today this is also important for future generations of Australians. If we want Australians today and into the future to be able to get a job, to have job security, to have the opportunity to build and develop a career here in Australia and to get wage increases then we need to ensure that the businesses around Australia who create those jobs through their enterprise and who pay those wages have the best possible opportunity to compete with businesses in other parts of the world and have the best possible opportunity to be successful into the future. Australia can only be successful into the future if we ensure that the businesses around Australia have the best possible opportunity to be successful into the future. The businesses that pay taxes on their profits help us fund a world-class health system, a world-class education system and an appropriately generous social safety net.


The opposition leader, at various times, talks about how his priority is jobs. 'Jobs, jobs, jobs', was what he said in one of his Press Club speeches in the past. But the truth is, unlike the coalition, Mr Shorten does not have a plan for jobs. Mr Shorten does not have a plan for jobs and growth. Let me tell you something, jobs don't grow on trees. Jobs are created by successful, profitable businesses. If you make it harder for businesses here in Australia to be successful into the future—guess what?—they will be less successful. I challenge anyone to credibly put forward an argument that a less successful business would hire more people than they otherwise would. A less successful business would hire fewer people. As businesses around Australia find it harder to compete with businesses in other parts of the world that pay substantially less tax and if businesses are hiring fewer people the unemployment rate would go up. That is the consequence of the socialist agenda pursued by Mr Shorten. Less successful businesses will hire fewer people, there will be less competition for workers and wages will go down.


I understand that business tax cuts, which can be described as a tax giveaway to big end of town, are not politically popular, but we don't have a job here in this chamber just to make decisions following the lead of what is popular today. We have a responsibility to make judgements about what is in the best interests of families around Australia into the future. We have a responsibility to make judgements about what is in our national interest into the future, and not just follow the lead of public opinion at one particular point in time.


I was interested to hear Senator Georgiou talk about spending money as we are proposing to lower the corporate tax rate for businesses around Australia. That is not government spending money. That is government taking less of other people's money, so they can invest it in their future success, so they can hire more Australians, so that those Australians who are more successful into the future pay more tax. Do you know what's happened over the 2017-18 financial year? Corporate tax revenue has gone up by about $10 billion compared to what was expected at budget time. That was after we legislated business tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million. Corporate tax revenue has gone up, which helps us pay for the important and essential services provided by government, which Australians expect.


Comments have been made about the big end of town. What we are doing here today, by keeping our taxes on businesses high in Australia, is deliberately making it harder for businesses like Qantas or Thomas Foods International in South Australia, with a turnover of $1.6 billion. I see Senator Storer there. He should have a chat to Thomas Foods International, a meat-processing business in South Australia which competes globally and which will tell you that a higher corporate tax rate in Australia makes it harder for it to be successful, which means it will hire fewer people than it could if only the Senate were to support a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate.


By standing in the way of our global champions out of Australia, by making it harder for the big employers of Australia—our big end of town, supposedly—to be competitive, what we are doing is helping the big end of town overseas. We are helping the big end of town in the US, in France, in Ireland and in the UK—all of these countries where the tax rate is lower. It is 21 per cent in the US. It is going to 17 per cent in the UK. It is going to 25 per cent in France. It is 22 per cent in Sweden. We are helping the big end of town in all of those countries to take business investment and jobs away from Australia, and do you know who is going to be the beneficiary? Workers in all those other countries, at the expense of Australian workers. Do you know who else is going to be the beneficiary? Small and medium-sized businesses in all of those countries, because the bigger businesses in the US, the UK, France and all these countries will not come and procure their products and services from small and medium-sized businesses here in Australia; they will procure their products and services from small and medium-sized businesses in their respective countries.


The Labor Party, of course, used to know all of this, and I would put it to the Senate that the Australian Labor Party still knows today what is in the workers' best interests. They know that a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate is necessary, is in our national interest and is in the best interests of working families around Australia. Bill Shorten has said it many times. I will just use one quote at random:


Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


Mr Bowen has also said it, and this is the one, I guess, that upsets me the most on behalf of working families around Australia. Seven months before we put a proposal for a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate into our budget, a proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent—not leading the world but putting us into the average of corporate tax rates around the world—this is what Mr Bowen said:


Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen says Labor accepts that company tax falls hardest on workers rather than wealthy shareholders, and aims for a 25 per cent company tax rate to spur economic growth.


I'm quoting him:


""I would like to see the corporate tax rate come down over time. I have previously said the nation should be aiming for a 25 per cent corporate tax rate,"" Mr Bowen said, adding that it would not be easy to do.


Of course, because Labor know that it's not easy to do, they have milked this for all it's worth politically. They know what is right for working families around Australia. They know that the future success of working families around Australia depends on the future success of the businesses that employ them. They know that keeping taxes in Australia high by international standards makes it harder for business in Australia to be successful. They know that making it harder for business to be successful leads to negative consequences for working families around Australia.


Yesterday we had a Greens senator, Senator Bartlett, talk about how we needed to fight poverty. I agree. We must fight poverty, and the way to fight poverty is to increase opportunity for people to get ahead. Stronger economic growth creates better opportunity, in particular, for low-income earners to get ahead. That is demonstrably the case. Proportionately speaking, the beneficial impact of stronger growth is most significant at the low-income end. The people that will suffer the most from making it harder for our businesses to be successful into the future are low-income Australians, who will find it harder to get into the workforce, harder to keep their job and harder to get a better job. If we condemn the businesses around Australia to an uncompetitive business tax rate, if we deliberately help businesses in other parts of the world to take business investment and jobs away from our businesses here, we make it harder, in particular, for low-income earners to get ahead.


Obviously part of the politics of all this is that the Labor Party have become quite good at sharpening their populist political message, and so it's all become about, 'This is just a tax giveaway to the big banks,' which of course is not what this is all about. But in order to ensure a lower company tax rate for the businesses around Australia who are exposed to global competition, whose workers are exposed to global competition, the government did propose to One Nation that we would be prepared to carve out the four big banks. We proposed that to others too. I've got to say I'm somewhat intrigued to hear Senator Georgiou say today, 'We never saw the amendments.' Let me tell you: the offer was very, very clear. We were so committed to ensuring that the businesses around Australia—including, in particular, the bigger businesses around Australia who are on the front line of global competition—have the best possible opportunity to be viable, to be competitive and to be successful into the future that we were prepared to carve out the four big banks. At no point were we prepared to put in a $500 million cap, because that would actually be counterproductive. It would damage the economy. It would cost jobs. As none other than Mr Shorten said—and I couldn't have put it better myself:


… lowering the corporate rate for smaller businesses only … creates an artificial incentive for Australian businesses to downsize.


In worse case scenarios some businesses might actually lay people off to get smaller - and the size based different tax treatment would create a glass ceiling on business workforce growth.


Instead we want a level playing field regardless of the size of the company.


That was a speech from Bill Shorten to ACOSS in Melbourne. Mr Shorten was right then, and he still believes this now. The reason he's arguing a different case is all politics. He is selling out the best interests of working families around Australia on what he perceives to be his ticket to the Lodge. He's very good at running the populist, sharp political lines. But you know what? I'm not here to run sharp political lines. I'm here to stand up for Australian families, to do the right thing by Australian families, today and into the future. That is why we have given this such a red-hot go. The Labor Party, of course, know this too.


A range of other issues were mentioned, like the claim that we needed to do more on multinationals. No government has done more than the Turnbull government to ensure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax. I think this is widely understood. None other than the Commissioner of Taxation, Chris Jordan, has spelt out in some great detail, at various Senate estimates hearings, what a significant impact our measures have had in terms of increased company tax revenue. In recent years we've implemented the multinational anti-avoidance law, the diverted profits tax and tougher penalties against tax avoidance. We've made improvements to transfer pricing laws and in relation to the public disclosure of tax information by large companies. We've pursued measures to implement country-by-country reporting. We've implemented changes to hybrid rules.


We were prepared to do more. We did talk—and it's a matter of public record—to the crossbench, to One Nation and others, about reforming the petroleum resource rent tax arrangements. I see Senator Burston here, a great, honourable man, because he was part of the deal that the government did with One Nation in March. He was there—it's a matter of public record—when we shook hands. You've got to remember that One Nation actually was prepared to back corporate tax cuts for all businesses, when the banks were included. Now Senator Georgiou comes in here and he says, 'I can't vote for this because, yes, the government might have told us that they were prepared to exclude the big four banks, but they never showed us the detailed amendments.' I mean, really? Let me just say that, if the Senate votes against a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate here in Australia, we will be letting down working families around Australia today and into the future. Everybody needs to be very conscious of that.


I will now turn to some of the other issues that were raised, starting with the One Nation suggestion that Senator Hanson made on the record here yesterday. She suggested that we should abolish the petroleum resource rent tax regime and replace it with a royalty regime offshore. We're talking about an industry that has made more than $200 billion worth of capital investment in a particular taxation regime. It is completely ludicrous, and completely reckless and irresponsible, to suggest that, as part of a negotiation for a lower globally more competitive business tax rate, we can make that sort of change to a taxation arrangement.


There's a good reason why Labor in government—the Keating government—introduced petroleum resource rent tax arrangements back in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It has actually served Australia well in helping to attract massive capital investment that has helped generate a significant capital-intensive new industry, to the point where we are going to become the biggest exporter of LNG in the next few years. This has generated a massive number of jobs and massive additional income, which helps to pay for our hospitals, our schools, our Defence Force and you name it. The proposition that somehow a country like Australia, which relies on foreign investment, could turn around and abolish the PRRT arrangements and replace them with a royalty regime as part of a negotiation on reform to our corporate tax laws is completely and utterly unrealistic.


People in this debate have made the point, 'Oh, in the US this hasn't really worked.' In an interview with Fran Kelly last week, I made the point that, on the back of the Trump administration corporate tax cuts, the US recorded in excess of four per cent growth on an annualised basis in this most recent quarter; the US unemployment rate had a three in front of it; wages growth was the strongest it's been in a very long time; and massive capital investment had been returned to the country. I also said that the Trump tax cuts had led to stronger investment, stronger growth, a lower unemployment rate and higher wages.


And do you know what? I got a request from The Conversation to 'please substantiate' my assertions as part of a fact-check process. That was more than a week ago. I provided the evidence that in the US they've secured more than four per cent growth on an annualised basis in the most recent quarter; that the unemployment rate was now 3.9 per cent; that wages growth was the strongest it had been in a very long time; and that massive capital investment had been returned to the country. The IMF, the International Monetary Fund—hardly a right-wing conspiratorial organisation—updated their US growth forecast following the passage of the Trump tax cuts. They said:


The U.S. tax policy changes are expected to stimulate activity, with the short-term impact in the United States mostly driven by the investment response to the corporate income tax cuts.


But some people here will argue that black is white and that white is black. The truth is that, if the Senate stands in the way of a lower globally more competitive business tax rate here in Australia, the Senate stands in the way of the opportunity for working families around Australia today and in the future to get ahead. If we maintain one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, we will attract less investment and we will generate lower growth than we otherwise would, which means that we will see—




Senator Cameron:
  Why are you talking the country down?




Senator CORMANN:
  This was actually the Labor Party position. Nobody in Australia believes that you're taking a principled stand on this. Everybody knows that you are putting populist politics ahead of the national interest, and in history you will stand condemned for it. If this goes down today, there is no doubt that the Australian parliament will have to revisit this before long in order to protect our economic security into the future. On that basis, I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for International Development and the Pacific (Senator Fierravanti-Wells) and the Minister for Regional Communications (Senator McKenzie) to questions without notice asked by Senators McAllister and Gallacher today relating to the Turnbull Government.


We saw something quite extraordinary in the chamber earlier today. The government introduced amendments to amend its own legislation, which used to seek to extend the tax cuts to the banks but now excludes the banks. Who would have thought it? Who would have thought that we would see this government turning its back on the two things which can truly be said to define it—a love of the banks and a love of corporate tax cuts. Unbelievable! These seemed to be the two issues that this government was willing to take any amount of political heat on to pursue. They resisted the royal commission until the banks had the good sense to understand that, unless they asked for one, unless they wrote a letter to the Prime Minister, this wouldn't come to an end. But now tax cuts for banks seem set to join the pile of policies that the Prime Minister has sacrificed to try and save himself.


Think about the republic. Just reflect for a moment on this. After the referendum, Mr Turnbull said, of the then Prime Minister John Howard, that he had broken the nation's heart. Now that Malcolm Turnbull is in the Lodge, what has he done? In the last 12 months he floated briefly the possibility of a plebiscite after Queen Elizabeth ceases her role. He was forced within 24 hours—within 24 hours!—to burst his own thought bubble, because he is willing to put aside anything and everything he believes in if a backbencher raises his or her voice against it.


On climate change Mr Turnbull once said:


Climate change is real, it is affecting us now, and it is having a particularly severe impact on Australia. And yet, right now, we have every resource available to us to meet the challenge of climate change except for one: and that is leadership.


The Prime Minister used to say that he offered leadership on climate change. In fact, he crossed the floor 10 years ago to vote for the emissions trading scheme. He said, 'I will not lead a party that is less committed to climate change than me.' Well, not yesterday, because yesterday he capitulated again—again to those who had a fundamental beef with science, who urged him to drop any reference to the Paris commitments, to the commitments to emissions reduction, in his redesign of the energy system, and he just gave in. He gave in to save his own skin. What does this man stand for? I will tell you: he stands for absolutely nothing except himself. The only project that the Prime Minister has thrown himself into, without equivocating, without holding back, is himself—the Turnbull project—and despite this project consuming all of his political energy, he hasn't even done it that well. Thirty-five members of the Liberal Party party room don't want him as leader. If you add in the National Party, it starts to become a much bigger number indeed. But even for the Liberal Party that's 41 per cent of the party room, which is almost as much as the 55 per cent of Australians who don't want him as Prime Minister, according to the latest Ipsos poll.


It is often said of Mr Turnbull that he does not lack confidence—that he's possessed of extraordinary self-belief. Well, it is good that he has confidence in himself, because nobody else seems to at all. Today in question time we saw minister after minister falling over themselves to avoid saying that they supported him. Senator Fierravanti-Wells wouldn't even repeat his name. She couldn't even bring herself to say his name out loud when I asked her if she supported him and what he stands for.


I don't know where we go from here. How does the Prime Minister stand in the parliament without flinching, knowing that the member for Warringah and the member for Dickson are sitting behind him. Worse, how does he stand in front of the mirror, looking at himself and knowing that selling out everything—everything that he once believed in—doesn't seem to have won him a single vote from the Right. In fact, the great lesson in all of this is that the more you capitulate to the bullies, the more you give in, the more they ask for. You can never win by capitulating. I say this to Mr Turnbull: have the courage of your convictions and call an election.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:07):  I'm not quite sure what the republic and climate change had to do with the questions asked. But what I do know is that every minister who was asked indicated that they supported and continued to support the Prime Minister. As Senator Smith just whispered to me, if that's the strength of the attack by the Labor Party on a day like today, well, we're looking pretty good for the next election.


Sorry, Senator McAllister, I meant to start by congratulating you on your appointment as yet another shadow assistant minister. It's interesting that in opposition you can just keep appointing shadow assistant ministers. Is there anyone over that side—apart from you, Senator Watt, and I can understand why you haven't!—who doesn't have a job? When Mr Shorten has problems, when he knows Mr Albanese is snapping at his heels, what does he do? He buys off a few more members of the caucus by saying, 'Look, I will appoint you to an important job'—yet another shadow assistant minister. And so it goes. You can tell why Mr Shorten chose to do this today—I'm not quite sure. But clearly he is worried about Mr Albanese, and quite frankly I'm worried about Mr Albanese. I just hope you keep Mr Shorten there, because Mr Shorten guarantees us success at the next election, whereas Anthony Albanese, nice fellow, would be a good campaigner. I'm pleased you keep him well under wraps, and long may Mr Shorten continue appointing shadow assistant ministers. You might even get a job, Senator Watt! He must eventually get down there.


But it's interesting that the question of climate change was raised, because the CFMEU, which is not a union that I usually quote—Senator Wong's union, of course—I'm pleased to see has joined forces with the coalition, just as Michael O'Connor did back in 2004 in the forestry debates. I remember, as forestry minister, I sat with Michael O'Connor in the cabinet room and we plotted together to win the election so that we would create jobs for workers. That's what he was interested in, that's what I was interested in and that's what Prime Minister Howard was interested in.


But I see the CFMEU are now back on my side, on our side and on Mr Turnbull's side, saying that the Labor Party's 50 per cent renewable energy target is 'not realistic' and that Labor should instead be backing clean coal options. These are exactly the sorts of comments and urgings that I and most on my side have been making for some time, which I'm pleased to say will be part of the new National Energy Guarantee project as it comes forward. The newspaper report I have here by Jared Owens—I think it's from The Australian—said, quoting the CFMEU:


""The 50 per cent renewable target is not realistic. Whilst you can build solar and wind generation to achieve the target on paper, what do we expect is going to happen at night?"" read the advice to Treasury, released under state Right to Information laws. ""During the summer months it is still very warm into the evening … you will have high demand, no solar and potentially little wind generation.""


So you'll have to go with base-load clean coal power stations. I'm delighted that the CFMEU have come to that conclusion. If I recall correctly, I think the AWU is also on that trajectory. I wonder how my Queensland colleagues on the other side—Senator Chisholm and Senator Watt—are getting on in their Queensland caucus meetings now that the unions in Queensland are starting to understand that coal generation is important for their members. As we've been saying for years, it's all about jobs for working Australians and for the families of those working Australians. That's why we support a wide mix of energy, but we include clean coal in that. I wonder if the Labor Party is going to continue their opposition to that in the face of a strong campaign by the CFMEU and the AWU, and I think the ETU were also in on the same campaign. It's good to see the unions are eventually joining us in looking after jobs for Australians.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2018-08-21,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:12):  It's good to see that Senator Macdonald has still not gotten over being dumped as a minister all those years ago and is still obsessed with people on this side of the chamber getting promotions. I do feel for you, Senator Macdonald. You never know—you're going to be around for a few more months, or maybe weeks—you might get looked after. There's going to be a reshuffle now that Peter Dutton has stood down. We know other ministers are probably going to have to stand down. Finally, your talents might be recognised by your party and you might rise to the lofty heights of assistant minister for something quite irrelevant.


Again today, on display here in Canberra, we've seen what an utter shambles the Turnbull LNP government has become. The Longman by-election was only a small number of weeks ago, but ever since that night this government has been absolutely falling apart. I was very pleased to be at the Longman election night party with a number of my colleagues when we pulled home a great win—and, again, congratulations to Susan Lamb and all of her team for winning that by-election. You could actually feel the temperature change; you could feel the atmosphere change in Australian politics that night when, after months of pressure on our side of the politics, we actually came through. The people of Longman were good enough to return Susan Lamb as the member for that electorate, and all of a sudden the pressure was back on the government, having lost the by-elections. And have they not coped! Haven't they fallen apart ever since that by-election loss that night! They were immediately at each other's throats and immediately worrying about their primary vote falling below 30 per cent. Then it spilled into their policies about energy. Then it spilled into who should be their leader. Ever since that night they have not been able to hold a single policy together or stand together on any matter whatsoever.


We saw it reflected again here today in question time, when Senator Fierravanti-Wells was unable and unwilling to say who she had voted for in this morning's leadership ballot. She was given an opportunity to assure the Senate that she had stuck by her Prime Minister and voted for Mr Turnbull in that leadership ballot, but she refused to take that opportunity and refused to say who she voted for. We can only assume that she was one of the 35 people who voted for Mr Dutton, and I expect that before too long we should see her resignation as a minister if she so lacks confidence in Mr Turnbull. She was so unwilling to back Mr Turnbull as the leader of the Liberal Party that, when asked what the point of Mr Turnbull was, not only could she not give us one example of anything that Mr Turnbull has done as Prime Minister but she couldn't even begin to use his name, could not let the words 'Malcolm Turnbull' cross her lips. That's how far she wanted to be removed from this dying and mortally wounded Prime Minister.


We then moved to Senator McKenzie, the Deputy Leader of the National Party, who was asked about reports from her own side of politics that the health minister, Mr Hunt, had not only voted for Mr Dutton but was also planning to stand for Deputy Prime Minister as his running mate. This is the Mr Hunt who not that long ago was swearing at and scaring older women who hold elected positions in the Northern Territory. She wouldn't take the opportunity to say where Mr Hunt lined up. More importantly, as the Deputy Leader of the National Party, she would not reveal whether the National Party stands behind the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, at this point in time. We know that Mr Turnbull has only barely hung on as the Leader of the Liberal Party, and we're starting to find out from comments by Senator McKenzie and in the media today by the member for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, that they want to see a leadership change as well.


Unfortunately all of this shows that the Liberal and National Party members of parliament in this place have completely forgotten why they are here: to work hard for people back in their electorates and home states. They have become so desperate to hang on to their own jobs that 35 members of the parliamentary Liberal Party today voted for Mr Dutton—a man who has been voted the worst health minister in Australia's history, who cut hospital and dental funding and tried to introduce a GP tax—to become their new leader. This is the best person this party has to offer as an alternative to Malcolm Turnbull as their leader.


Fortunately, back in Queensland there is one candidate focused on the real issues facing Dickson. Her name is Ali France. She is already out there knocking on doors to win back the seat and provide people with the representation they deserve. (Time expired)

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (15:17):  We see from the opposition a complete failure of leadership. All they can do is throw slurs backwards and forwards across the chamber. That's what the Labor Party, particularly Senator Watt, has been reduced to: not really interested in doing anything other than casting aspersions on other members of the parliament, regardless of their considerable contributions to the Australian people. If you look at the achievements of the Australian government since we were elected in 2013 but particularly since the election in 2016, you'll find that this government has delivered and continues to deliver for the Australian people. Over one million Australians are in new jobs since we came to government in 2013. Strong economic management and leadership, despite all the other circumstances we've had to manage over the last five years, have put us in a strong position economically, where the Australian economy has created over one million jobs, 770,000 of which were created since September 2015 and 339,000 in the last 12 months. It's one of the best periods of jobs growth on record.


In my patch, where jobs are important, that sort of economic leadership makes a difference. During the Braddon by-election campaign, in which I participated quite closely, over a period of three weeks 800 new jobs were announced, which shows that there is business and economic confidence in the community. The biggest threat to that is the complete failure of leadership from the Labor Party. They no longer believe the things that they believed while in government.


I watched Bill Shorten on a polling booth. He stood there for 30 minutes and nobody wanted to talk to him. He spoke to three people in 30 minutes—




Senator Carol Brown:
  That's not true—




Senator COLBECK:
  You weren't there, Senator; I was. Three people spoke to him in 30 minutes. In fact, one of them turned around and abused him as she walked away. She wasn't impressed with Mr Shorten. While Mr Turnbull was walking with us through the streets of Ulverstone, taking selfies and welcoming people outside their stores, Mr Shorten was sitting on his own outside Banjo's in the mall in Devonport. Nobody wanted to talk to him. The business community in Devonport spoke with their feet—in fact, with their wallets.


When the Devonport Chamber of Commerce invited businesses to come and speak to Mr Shorten—with three weeks notice of when Mr Shorten was coming to Devonport for a business lunch—15 people signed up. The Devonport Chamber of Commerce even warned the Labor Party a week and a half out that they had only 15 people who wanted to come and see him. They did nothing about it. The function was downgraded to the downstairs unit as a working lunch over sandwiches. The Labor Party, obviously, did a bit of a ring around the night before and they got it back to 30, which was the benchmark to move back upstairs into the restaurant.


A similar event for the Prime Minister was sold out in 24 hours. People came in to speak to the Prime Minister to understand our policies. 



Senator Chisholm interjecting—




Senator COLBECK:
  What happened at the by-election? Effectively a zero swing. It's a very different circumstance to Queensland. But I can tell you there is no interest in Mr Shorten, and that's because he no longer believes the things he said in government. He will not repeat the statements that he made in government.


He used to believe in tax cuts for business. He doesn't now. He used to believe in a whole range of things that would benefit the Australian economy, but now, for purely crass political purposes, he just walks away from that. He has sold out. He doesn't believe in workers, he doesn't believe in growth of the economy and he doesn't believe in the things that will make a difference. All he's interested in is cheap, nasty political pointscoring. That's all he's interested in. He's like Senator Watt. That's all he's interested in doing—nothing constructive, just cheap, nasty political pointscoring, like Senator Watt. Unfortunately, Senator Watt gets a bit tetchy about these things but that's the life of this place. We have a record of delivering for the Australian people, much unlike the ALP.

"Chisholm, Sen Anthony",ALP,2018-08-21,"



Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:22):  I would ask that Senator Colbeck check the scoreboard, because the scoreboard in Braddon told a completely different story. We know that Justine Keay is sitting as the member for Braddon. We know, as Senator Watt talked about, the great result in Longman. For what we've seen over the last few days, I have got three words that I want to use. Over Friday and the weekend, we had the capitulation. Then today we had the humiliation and what we're seeing is the consequence of this, a debilitating effect on the Australian government. There are so many policy issues that give cause to the effect of this, that are going to have an impact and that need to be highlighted. What also needs to be highlighted is the Prime Minister's role in how this has played out over the last 12 months and, indeed, the five years of a Turnbull-Abbott government.


When you look at energy policy, the fact is that they have been working on it for 12 months and the sole No. 1 aim of their energy policy was to get it through the backbench. That was their No. 1 aim. Everything else—families, Australians and workers—came a distant second, third and fourth. Their No. 1 aim was to come up with an energy policy and get it through their caucus room, and they failed at that. They have been working on it for 12 months and still we are no clearer today as to what their energy policy is. That's in this chamber, let alone what Australian people think of this—Australian families, Australian businesses and those workers who rely on and need energy for their workplace to create jobs and to support their families, which is so important. With this mob opposite, despite having been in government for five years and despite having been working on this policy for 12 months, here we are today none the wiser and seven votes off Peter Dutton becoming Prime Minister. This is the sad state of affairs. We saw the capitulation from the Prime Minister over the last four days. It is a really sad state of affairs for something that he has been saying was his signature policy. We sit here today none the wiser.


We also know the moves that he made at the end of last year and the beginning of this year to secure his leadership. He went down the path of getting rid of former Senator Brandis overseas so Senator Cormann could take over. He created the Home Affairs portfolio to keep Peter Dutton in check. Here we are, eight months on, and that has all blown apart. Peter Dutton is on the backbench. There's going to have to be a new home affairs minister. Every trick and manoeuvre that Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister made to keep his government and hold them together has been blown apart—and the actual losers in this have been the Australian people.


We know the government can't piece together an energy policy. The only thing that unites them is giving a tax cut to big banks and big business. That's the only thing that is keeping these guys together: the fact that they want to fork out money to big business and their corporate partners, because that is something that unites them. What we saw during the by-elections—what we saw in Braddon; what we saw in Longman—is that the Australian people rejected them. And the Australian people are increasingly losing faith in the government.


I think you've got to compare where they are when it comes to tax with where they are on energy. The backbench are so disunited when it comes to energy policy, but, when you compare that to where they are on tax policy, they are hand-over-fist eager to support big business and the big banks. Yet, when it comes to looking after Australian families and Australian businesses, ensuring that they can get ahead on energy policy, they just fight like cats. They are not putting the Australian people first when it comes to the important policy areas.


This comes to how debilitating this is for the government. It is absolute dysfunction and chaos when it comes to policy. We know that they're seven votes away from having Peter Dutton as Prime Minister. Imagine if an empty chair had run today. How many votes would an empty chair have got versus Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister?


The reality is that they are a government that are rudderless. The Australian people are seeing through them. They are a government now without an agenda. They don't have an agenda when it comes to the economy. They don't have an agenda when it comes to energy. On two of the most important issues that the government have been saying that they have been working to tackle now for months and years, they do not have an agenda. They have absolutely no direction from the Prime Minister, someone who has been humiliated through the course of today, and the government are suffering as a result.


The Australian people will come to the only conclusion that is necessary, and that's to send these guys to opposition, because that's the only way they are going to be able to sort out their problems. They have no faith in their ability to govern. They need to send them to opposition to sort out their problems. (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2018-08-21,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (15:54):  I rise to address this matter of public importance regarding the Turnbull government. Unfortunately, this is a matter of public importance that could have been presented to the chamber on virtually any of the 780 days since the previous federal election, yet the disunity and chaos of the Turnbull government was on display more prominently today than usual. Ramping up its war on coherent policy and legislative progress yesterday, Prime Minister Turnbull ditched his third iteration of the National Energy Guarantee in an attempt to shore up support from the hard right wing of his out-of-touch government, but, true to form, he abandoned policy at the first sign of difficulty. That was followed by a resounding declaration of dissent from more than 40 per cent of his party. That's right: 41 per cent of Prime Minister Turnbull's own party voted against him as leader, only a day after he, in order to win support, junked what was supposed to be his defining policy priority. So, he was in trouble, and, to win support, he decided that the only way to try to shore up the Right of his party was to junk what he had already claimed was a defining policy priority. We know what happened then. People moved quickly to support Mr Dutton.


Nothing could more completely embody an absence of coherent policy than this Prime Minister, the Prime Minister, who stated, 'I will not lead a party that is not as committed to climate change as I am'—then going on to decide that he no longer supported an emissions trading scheme. What an embarrassment. The 'climate change Prime Minister' first decided he no longer believed in an emissions trading scheme and then that he no longer supported a clean energy target. Now, this Prime Minister doesn't even support his own National Energy Guarantee. Writing for Fairfax newspaper this week, Sean Kelly summed it up best:


That the Coalition might be about to tear itself apart over climate again is an indication of insanity.


Insanity is exactly what it is, because this is the self-defined issue for this Prime Minister, and to walk away from this issue, simply for political expediency, shows just how little this Prime Minister is willing to fight for.


So, what exactly does this government stand for? We know that it does stand for division. Not only has this Prime Minister come to lead the government by throwing his predecessor under a bus; but he's thrown himself under a bus. There is so much division inside this party that the Prime Minister decided to call a spill motion, just to pre-empt his own colleagues. The nation is going through an incredible period of drought during winter, but, instead of taking serious action on climate change, this out-of-touch government is self-obsessed and focused on infighting.


Nothing will change the problems of this government. This government's problems are of its own making. It comes from a lack of a policy agenda and a complete bankruptcy of vision. We've stood by and watched as the Prime Minister has sold out principle after principle, ideal after ideal, and now we're left with no action on climate change, because the Liberal Party is being governed by its hard right wing. What a case of the tail wagging the dog. Perhaps that's why the government continues to dive in the polls and, by the Prime Minister's own yardstick, it's time for a change of leader. It's no wonder that the member for Dickson decided today that it was time to challenge the Prime Minister. And what a choice we had. We have a Prime Minister who believes in nothing and we have an opponent in Mr Dutton who believes in all the wrong things.


By his own measure, this Prime Minister has failed. He's failed to change the course of his party after 38 successive Newspoll losses. That's eight more than the number that he decided was enough to challenge the previous Prime Minister. It's no wonder that Mr Dutton decided it was time for a challenge. I can see why Minister Dutton, as a member of a government that has continued to show no coherence in its policy development, a government that's shown no sensible legislative agenda, had, in a very short period of time, more than 40 per cent of his colleagues decide that this Prime Minister isn't right for the job. 


Considering this challenge has been put to bed for today, we can only wonder—and Australians can only wonder—what we can look forward to tomorrow. We can look forward to a government united in its commitment to give away money to big banks and big business. But where is the legislative agenda to deal with runaway climate change? Where is the legislation that's now been junked despite the Prime Minister's supposed commitment to climate action? It seems that all we have from this government is a commitment to infighting and rewarding its mates in the banks and big business. Perhaps that's why, aside from ditching its own energy policy and fighting amongst itself, what this government is best known for is it's $440 million gift to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation and its gift to big business and the banks—gifts so unanticipated that the very recipient of the $440 million grant, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, described it as 'like winning lotto'. One really has to wonder where the priorities for this government have gone.


It's not just the Prime Minister's federal colleagues who are asking this question. His own Liberal Party colleagues in my home state of Tasmania have been left wondering. As little as 11 days ago, when the Hodgman Liberal government signed up to what was the energy policy of the federal government at the time, energy minister, Mr Guy Barnett, proudly stated:


The NEG is good for Tasmanian jobs and puts more downward pressure on power prices—


and—


This important step continues to build the case for increased interconnection and Tasmania's position as the Battery of the Nation delivering clean, reliable and affordable electricity to Tasmanians and the nation.


What a slap in the face. When Minister Barnett signed up to the NEG publicly, little did he know that, less than two weeks later, the Prime Minister would ditch the very policy he'd signed up to. Unfortunately, he should have known. This government has stood for nothing other than political expedience. It throws out policies at the first sign of a challenge and focuses on nothing other than itself. This is a government that cut funding to schools and hospitals. It's a government focused on cutting funding to the ABC. But when it comes to an actual agenda, an actual set of principles that it's likely to achieve, we're left wondering. Why is it that this government insists on cutting funds to these essential services when it doesn't even have a coherent agenda that it wishes to fund as an alternative? What does this government stand for other than tax cuts to banks and billionaires and handing out money to foundations without a public tender process or any explanation? That's why Minister Dutton managed to garner over 40 per cent support in his own party, and it's why I'm sure we haven't seen the last of him. 


When there's no vision to rally behind, what else are Prime Minister Turnbull's colleagues to do but look for an alternative leadership candidate? This matter of public importance couldn't have come at a more appropriate time. This is a matter that needs addressing immediately. As another former colleague of this Prime Minister put it recently:


If Peter Dutton is the answer, you have to ask yourself what the hell is the question.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (16:04):  The presentation from Labor just then demonstrates exactly where they are in the broader policy debate. They've got one focus—politics, climate change—and that's about as far as it goes. That's all they're worried about. They're not interested in the economy. They're not interested in delivering jobs for Australians. They're all just interested in politics and climate change.


The government, over our two and a bit terms of parliament, have been focused on delivering economic returns for the Australian people, and we've been successful. The prediction, particularly after the 2016 election, was that we weren't going to be able to get anything done: this chamber was too complicated; the diversity of the crossbench would not allow us to get anything done. In fact, the opposite has been the truth. We've managed to get media reform through this parliament after a 20-year hiatus. We were told it couldn't be done. We have done it. It has been achieved. All credit to Minister Fifield for negotiating that process with industry, and then, of course, we negotiated it through the parliament.


We have delivered tax cuts for Australians. We were told it couldn't be done. The Labor Party opposed those tax cuts for Australians. They proposed instead to tax our nans and pops up to 30 per cent of their total income, raising billions of dollars over a decade to pay for their proposals for tax reform. It was: take money off your nan and pop to get a tax cut. It's a pretty average way of raising money when Nan and Pop have to have a reduction in their total income of up to 30 per cent to pay for somebody else's tax cut. That's not looking after the community like the Australian government has.


We've achieved tax cuts for small business. We were told we wouldn't get them through the parliament, and we have. While the Labor Party try to decide what a small business is—they still can't work out what that might be—we have achieved, passed through the parliament, tax cuts for small business. We've also passed through the parliament tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million. Because we persisted, because we were prepared to negotiate with the crossbench, we got those tax cuts past the parliament. In the by-election campaigns recently, the Labor Party tried to pretend that they were going to match those tax cuts and wouldn't be reversing them or passing any legislation to wind them back. They lied to the Australian people. They lied to Australian businesses when they said that there wouldn't be any legislated rollbacks. They knew that their tax cut regime was going to be 27½ per cent, when the government had already legislated to reduce the taxation regime for small business, or businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million, to 25 per cent. The then candidate for Braddon, now the member for Braddon, Ms Justine Keay, said to a chamber of commerce lunch that I was at that there would be no legislated rollback. She knew that wasn't true. In a prepared speech she said it to the assembled members of the Burnie Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Devonport Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Central Coast Chamber of Commerce and Industry. She tried to con them into believing that they would pay the same tax rate under a Labor regime as they would under the coalition government's already legislated process. It was a lie. If Labor get elected, they will raise taxes for business from the legislated rate that currently exists, 25 per cent, up to 27½ per cent. But we were told we wouldn't get those things through the parliament.


We've passed reforms to the Corporations Act. We've increased penalties for businesses who are misbehaving. We've passed legislation to ensure that international businesses operating in Australia pay their fair share of tax. We've put in place a range of economic measures that are paying dividends to the Australian people.


We've just heard again the lie that we're cutting funds to the health system. Even the ABC fact checker agrees that we are increasing health funding to record levels—an increase of 42 per cent in my home state of Tasmania—and yet the Labor Party continue to peddle the rubbish that we're cutting it. The fascinating thing is that the electorate is now starting to tell us that they know the Labor Party is lying to them. They know Bill Shorten's not being straight with them, and that's why they're not interested in engaging with Mr Shorten.


One of my favourites is in defence. When we came to government, we looked to see what the Labor Party had done in the Defence portfolio. The cupboard was completely bare. They'd done absolutely nothing—not a thing. They hadn't even commissioned a study on a canoe, to quote a famous phrase in this place. So what have we done? There have been 54 ships, including 12 submarines, commissioned since we came to government. The Land 400 project has been commissioned since we came to government. The training academy for shipbuilding is being developed in South Australia in conjunction with the Australian Maritime College in UTAS, I'm very proud to say—as would be Senator Bushby, as a graduate of the Australian Maritime College. It is one of the key partners in the development of that project.


These are all things that the Labor Party just kicked down the road for six years. They did absolutely nothing in the context of defence of the nation. Something that I'm very pleased to talk about—and I know Senator Bushby is also interested in it—is the feasibility work that's going on right now into a defence innovation hub based at the Australian Maritime College in Tasmania. This is a concept brought to the parliament by the coalition. The other side is completely devoid. They are not looking at the future. They are not looking to see what positives the R&D that could be developed out of defence might have for the economy in Australia, let alone in the northern part of Tasmania. If we can get that defence innovation hub up and running, doing the R&D for the build of those 54 vessels, including 12 submarines, at the Australian Maritime College in Launceston, that R&D could then be commercialised and spun off into new businesses operating in the Tasmanian community. It would be a huge opportunity, and there would be potential for growth in employment.


These are all serious, solid economic proposals that this government has put into place. The other side of politics has given them nary a thought. I've been into the businesses that are already benefitting from the defence spend in Tasmania. Taylor Bros is a great business doing work in the accommodation space for Defence. Direct Edge in Burnie is looking for another 35 people—with 15 of those to be apprenticeships—as a direct result of the Australian government's decision to have a domestic defence-building capacity. This opens up opportunities for global export markets. These are real achievements. We are not trying to scare the Australian people with stories and misinformation around funding. We are working on and delivering an economic plan that has put a million jobs into the Australian economy since we came to government, and we're continuing to build proposals that will continue to grow the economy and will provide opportunities for businesses like Penguin Composites, whom Ms Justine Keay said she stood beside. In fact, she's standing in the way of them getting a tax cut. She's just standing in the way.


These are the things that this government is doing. They are practical measures. We were told we couldn't get legislation through the parliament. Yet under the leadership of Senator Cormann we have been continuously successful. In fact, we are still discussing tax cuts for larger businesses, because we know it's good for the economy. The Labor Party used to believe that. We still do, and we will continue to act in the interest of the Australian people.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AG,2018-08-21,"



Senator BARTLETT
 (Queensland) (16:14):  The item before us in the Senate at the moment, described as a matter of public importance, 'The inability of the Turnbull Government to progress any coherent policy or legislative agenda,' which has been put forward by the Labor Party as a chance for the Senate to spend an hour talking about the travails of the Turnbull Liberal-National Party coalition government, is very similar to what we had yesterday. As I said yesterday, I don't think that's particularly important; what is important is the horrendous and growing inequality in our community, the massive danger we are facing from extreme climate change, the lack of action in regard to dealing with that, the lack of action in regard to homelessness in our community, the refusal to increase the rate of Newstart, and the continuing punishment of the poor. Unfortunately, punishing the poor and favouring the wealthiest is a coherent policy of this government. The problem is not the internal enmity in the Liberal and National parties, who both have their own significant difficulties; the problem is that their ideological and legislative agenda, such as it is, specifically makes life much harder for the majority of Australians and, inasmuch as they can manage to implement it, assists the big end of town.


Some important things, though, are becoming even more clear as a result of the shambles that this government currently is in—that is, the very understandable and massive disillusionment of the majority of the Australian community with the entire political system. This government currently has huge difficulties, but that's just a manifestation of its internal philosophical incoherence and lack of solid value base that has been there for many years. That's why so many people, young and old, think our political system is broken. The public can see it every day. On days like today they can see it very starkly, but they know it's there every day. It's not because of the personal disputes, the leadership squabbles, the travails of the previous Prime Minister, or the accusations back and forth about section 44 of the Constitution; our political system is broken because the majority of people in this building—not just the elected representatives but so much of the press gallery as well—are so caught up in the irrelevant soap opera within this little bubble that they're don't care about what happens in the real world outside.


We see today the consequences of that: the suffering of so many people because of homelessness, poverty, inadequate wages, insecure jobs, massive financial pressures and inadequate health services; the people facing horrendous, unimaginable suffering on Nauru or Manus Island; and the massive environmental damage that is happening because of the lack of action—or, in some cases, deliberate action—that causes further harm to the environment. But it is not just a feeling; it is a recognition. People don't just sense things are broken; they know it and can see it. That is what is important, and it is important not just today; it is important every day. The fact that it's normally covered up by a veneer of nice words around the place hasn't stopped people from seeing that. Days like today are just when it breaks through the surface and people can see the political process in this country for the joke and shambles that it is.


A report today in The Guardian is headlined, 'Overwhelming majority of Australians believe federal politicians are corrupt'. That's a matter of public importance, not the squabbles amongst the Liberal Party at the moment. They believe that about federal politicians in general, all of us here. That's what we should be concerned about. That research showed:


About 85% of respondents said they believed some, most or all of the federal members of parliament were corrupt …


Perhaps that poll was a little bit rubbery. Perhaps it's a little bit larger than might reflect general public views—maybe 85 per cent is a bit high—but, frankly, if you're getting above 10 or 20 per cent of people feeling that, we're in big trouble. A clear majority of people feel the political process is broken, is corrupted. That doesn't mean they think everybody has money coming in in brown paper bags; they recognise that the process is corrupt and broken.


The soap opera stuff we're seeing today occupies the minds—I would guarantee—of 90 per cent of people in this building. That's all they're talking about right now: the latest piece of gossip about the internal machinations of the Liberal Party. We all know that a month or so ago, before those by-elections, it was all gossip about whether the Leader of the Opposition was in some difficulties, and everybody could talk about that. That this process works to focus on those sorts of things, so we can all just ignore the fact that this parliament is delivering outcomes that are not working for the Australian community, is the matter of public importance, not the failures of the Turnbull government.


Another extremely telling quote—anonymous but genuine nonetheless, I assume—came out today from a worried Liberal backbencher in a Sydney Morning Herald article by Peter Hartcher about the whole situation and why the minds of the members of the Liberal Party are so occupied at the moment:


A lot of our people are facing that fact that they are in the last six months of their political careers. They've got houses, school bills, cars that they've set up for themselves on the basis that they're earning $200,000 plus—


Of course, as we all know, federal parliamentarians get cars as part of the salary package on top of earning $200,000 plus—


What do they do if they're suddenly out of work?


Welcome to the real world! You're getting over $200,000 a year and a car and phones and everything else, and you're worried you might be out of work? That's what's exercising the minds of members of the government. How about exercising your minds about all of those Australians who are already out of work and all those Australians who are in full-time work and getting $40,000 or $30,000 a year and don't get everything with it? Exercise your minds about that for a bit! No wonder people think the system is broken. Of course people want to hang onto their jobs. I understand that—speaking as somebody who is about to give up their job at the end of this week in an attempt to try to change things by focusing on winning a lower house seat—




Senator Paterson:
  Because you got rolled.




Senator BARTLETT:
  I will note the interjection there. As an informed intellectual, you would know I am under no obligation to leave at all. I was not rolled; I chose not to run, because I recognise the need to get rid of you lot, and the only way to get rid of you lot properly and get transformational change is to start winning seats in the lower house. I've chosen to step out of my job early to focus all my energies on winning lower house seats so we can totally transform this political system. I could have stayed here on that $200,000 a year salary with cars and all the things your people are reportedly so keen to keep; I'm not. I'm not seeking a medal for that; all I'm saying is we need to be focusing on what will create change for the Australian public, not on our own interests. That is why so many Australians have had enough of the political system overall. That's why they think the whole place is not working in their interests. They can see that, inside this bubble, people are focused on what works for them, their mates and their donors. That's the matter of public importance, and the thing we need to change.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2018-08-21,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:24):  I rise to make a contribution on this MPI: the inability of the Turnbull Government to progress any coherent policy or legislative agenda. This morning the Liberal government's caucus demonstrated to the Australian people once again that they're a disunited rabble. In fact, it goes further than that now. The Prime Minister himself called for a spill of positions; he no longer has the support of the government.


When Mr Turnbull was elected he promised he would deliver stable government. But what we've seen for the entire period for which he has been elected, from the last election, is disunity within the government. The old saying, 'If you can't govern yourselves you can't govern the country' is absolutely correct. There is no better evidence of that than when you have a caucus of your colleagues voting 35 to 48. That's just over 40 per cent of the Liberal caucus no longer having faith in the Prime Minister. I'd have to suggest that the clock is in fact ticking down. We're now waiting to see when the next caucus meeting will be called and when there'll be a further challenge.


Why do I suggest that? It's because, unfortunately, during our term in government we used the same playbook. But we have learnt from it. Those on the other side have been trying to suggest in the last 48 hours that the Labor Party, under Bill Shorten, is divided. Well, there's nothing further from the truth. We are more united than I have ever experienced, having been in this place for some 12 years. I'm very confident that under Bill Shorten's leadership we will have better policies. We've been able to listen to the community and we have taken on board their concerns. This government, election after election, in making their policy statements, have broken promises, one after the other. They've cut funding to our hospitals. That's had a dramatic effect in my home state of Tasmania. They have cut funding to schools, and there's been murmuring that the Prime Minister wanted to try to clean up this mess whereby the education minister put offside Catholic Education in this country. Why? Because they're hell-bent on doing what they do best, and that is trying to punish those people who can least afford to be punished.


We've seen the Prime Minister and this government attacking workers. They stood by when, on a number of occasions, legislation was put before them to stop any cuts to penalty rates. But what did they decide to do? They put their hands up in the air and said, 'You're on your own.' That has had a devastating effect on the workers in my home state. Those in the hospitality industry already have very low wages, and they rely on their penalty rates. People who work in shops, in retail, are some of the lowest paid workers in this country and they have been impacted. We know that the hairdressers around this country are next on the list. My real concern is for those people who work in the aged-care sector, because they're not covered. We already have a crisis brought about by this government. They've had three ministers for aged care. There has not been a minister for ageing in cabinet who has any real authority when it comes to the budget, and they've failed. What is it now? The home care package waiting list—although we had to wait three extra months to get the data, which was finally released on Friday. There are 108,000 older Australians who are vulnerable and who need to have support to be able to stay in their home but who have been failed by this government, because the government hasn't invested.


This government will be judged very harshly when we do come to the next election, whether that's under Mr Dutton or whether, by some miracle, the Prime Minister manages to survive. But my money is on having another caucus meeting where he will be challenged, and I believe that Mr Dutton will end up with the amount of support he needs. Then the country could expect to go to an early election before people start to realise how little Mr Dutton really has to offer and whether or not he is going to change the direction of this government and, once and for all, put Australians before the big end of town. We know they want to give $17 billion to the big banks and we know they want $80 billion to go to multinational— (Time expired)

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (16:29):  I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to rise to contribute to this matter of public importance debate this afternoon regarding the Turnbull government. Before I turn to the substantive issues in the debate, I just have one technical correction that I feel compelled to make, and that is that the Liberal Party does not have a caucus. It's not a mistake that only you make, Senator Polley; it's a mistake that many people in the media made. I have a rule of thumb that if you ever read an article from a journalist talking about what's happening in the Liberal Party caucus then they probably don't know what they're talking about, since we don't have a caucus. Senator Polley, for your future reference the Liberal Party has a party room. I think it is an important distinction. I know that you have a caucus.


Turning to the more substantive issue before the chamber this afternoon, I'm very proud to talk about the impressive legislative agenda and achievements of the Turnbull government. I particularly want to focus on the achievements of the government in the economic sphere, because, I think, they've been particularly significant, and because I know that they are of the most interest and the most importance to my constituents in Victoria. It is our economic performance and the results of the economic agenda that we've had here in the parliament that they care most about in terms of employment in particular.


One of the recent and most significant achievements of the Turnbull government is legislating quite significant personal income tax reform. This year, in fact, the Turnbull government has passed personal income tax reforms, which ensure that all working Australians are better off. Taxes in this country, as a result of this legislative change successfully passing the parliament, will now be lower, fairer and simpler. It is the biggest and most significant tax reform package since the Howard government. It provides tax relief to more than 10 million taxpayers, with 4.4 million Australians receiving the full $530 of benefit of the new low- and middle-income tax offset.


It also, really importantly, protects Australians from bracket creep. Bracket creep is a problem which has been a subject of much commentary in the media and even occasionally by those opposite. And, yet, they quibbled when our tax package effectively abolished the concept of bracket creep for low- and middle-income earners. What the package did is it took the $87,000 tax threshold to $90,000 in 2018-19—that is this financial year—and then to $120,000 in 2022-23. That tax relief provided, under the offset in step one, will also be locked in permanently from 2022-23 by taking the $37,000 tax threshold to $41,000 and lifting the low-income tax offset to $645. Effectively, what has happened here is an entire tax bracket has been abolished and removed. It ensures that 94 per cent of Australian workers will not face a higher marginal tax rate of more than 32½c in the dollar. This is a really important reform, because, as we know, bracket creep is one of the things that discourages people from taking on more work, it discourages people from taking risks and it makes our tax system needlessly complex and inefficient. For most workers, for most of their working lives, they will just face one simple, new, lower rate of tax than they did before. That is this government acting on a complaint often raised, including by those opposite, and addressing it.


We know that the Labor Party fought tooth and nail to stop the Australian people getting this important income tax relief. It's clear that if they are successful at the next election they will reverse much, if not all, of this tax relief for working Australians—meaning higher taxes for Australian workers and meaning a smaller pay packet every fortnight. Combined with the Labor Party's other $200 billion in higher taxes they've already announced, they're now seeking to impose around $300 billion in higher taxes on the Australian economy over the next decade. It doesn't require a PhD in economics to forecast what impact that will have on people's lives and the economy.


The government's also been successful in legislating the first stage of its enterprise tax plan, and that's something that I welcome very much. I know the small and medium-sized businesses who are the beneficiaries of it in my home state of Victoria also really welcome it. Australian businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million will now pay a lower rate of tax thanks to the Turnbull government, dropping to a rate of 25 per cent by 2026-27. That's around three million Australian businesses, and those businesses employ around seven million Australian workers. That is millions of people who will benefit from companies that are more competitive, more efficient and more able to attract investment from abroad. All of these companies, as we know, will face a higher rate of tax if the Labor Party is elected. It plans to increase the rate of tax remarkably on small businesses in this country. The government is committed to extending these tax cuts to all Australian businesses, and I hope that the Senate looks very favourably on that when we consider that question later today.


The government's also had a very comprehensive free trade agreement agenda, which works in tandem with the corporate and personal income tax cuts that we've delivered. We know that, since the coalition government was elected in 2013, we've completed and signed free trade agreements with virtually all of Australia's major trading partners that we didn't already have trade agreements with, and, for any trading partners that we don't already have agreements with, they are under negotiation, including the United Kingdom, the European Union and Indonesia. Those already enforced, negotiated and signed under this coalition government are, of course, the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership—something that the Labor Party told us not to bother with and to give up on; luckily, the trade minister, Steve Ciobo, did not take their advice and persisted with that—the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement, and the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations. That means more export opportunities for Australian businesses and farmers, it means a cheaper cost of goods for Australian businesses that need to import inputs, and it means consumers have more choice and lower prices for the things that they need to buy.


Those are the inputs. 'What are the outputs?' would be a fair question to ask. Very clearly, the major output of this is the record jobs growth numbers under the Turnbull government, something that this government is very proud of because it's something that changes people's lives for the better. Going from not having a job to having a job is one of the most profound improvements someone can go through in their life, and there are a million people that can say they did that under the coalition. That's a pretty amazing statistic—1,086,806, to be precise, in less than five years since the coalition came to office. Since September 2015, 770,000 new jobs have been created, and more than half of those, 410,900, were full time. In the past 12 months, 339,018 new jobs have been created. The jobs growth over the past 12 months, of 2.7 per cent, massively outstrips the growth under the former Labor government, of 0.8 per cent.


So the Turnbull government has a very comprehensive economic agenda. It has successfully negotiated it through the parliament, despite the difficulties that this chamber occasionally poses to governments seeking to legislate, and that successful agenda is leading to real change for real Australians in their lives. Their lives are better because of the successful economic agenda prosecuted by this government.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2018-08-21,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (16:37):  Today we have seen a line-up of Liberal politicians facing the media one by one, telling the story about themselves, defending themselves, explaining themselves, and wondering if they have a job or don't have a job and who will be the leader—an extraordinary display that says more about the character and the content of the cabinet of the Turnbull government. We saw a government bleeding today—not bleeding for the country but bleeding for themselves and their own jobs. We see a divided cabinet. We see a government so hopelessly in disarray that the best alternative for a leader they could think of did not even support the national apology to First Nations people in this country. For shame! What have they become? They fight over energy, they fight over climate change, they fight over tax, they fight over industrial relations, they fight over education and they fight over principles that they have long since abandoned. They fight for their own jobs, but they will not fight for the Australian people.


While this internal bickering continues and the member for Dickson rallies his troops, the people of Australia suffer, and the people of the Northern Territory suffer because of the lack of housing. We hear the minister stand up in this house, talking about thousands and thousands of jobs that are being created across the country for First Nations people. Well, where are those jobs? Where I sit and where I travel across the regions of remote and regional Australia, they are not there. Industries are closing, businesses are closing and there are not enough houses—certainly for those who are homeless and certainly for those people who have been demanding their fair share and rights to homes in this country.


Last week in this place, we saw a vote against a bill to restore the rights of the territories. That is because the government only care about themselves. They certainly did not care about the people of the Northern Territory when we sat here last week in this parliament. Last week, we saw Senator Jane Hume say that, due to the Territory's small population, the people of the Northern Territory were incapable of making decisions on complex social policy issues. Why do I raise that? It is not because it was part of the debate in the political arena but because it was a statement that was made on Sky News after the debate and its devastating outcome for the people of the Northern Territory. It wasn't enough that the people of the Northern Territory felt enormously aggrieved, deeply hurt and completely betrayed by this house; they were then insulted. Talk about rubbing salt into the wound. It wasn't enough that you won the vote by two, mind you—and we're going to have another go at some point. It wasn't enough; you had to go out there and insult the people of the Northern Territory. I've written to the Prime Minister, demanding an apology, although I doubt he will have time to even think about the people of the Northern Territory now that he's busy trying to save himself. 


On that point, the Prime Minister—Malcolm Turnbull, that is—stands in front of the press conference today and talks about how 'we must give back to the people of Australia', how 'we must govern for the people of Australia'. Yes, that's right, you must, Prime Minister. However, you very much contributed to eroding the rights of citizens in the Northern Territory and in the ACT, not because you believed that they shouldn't have equal citizenship but because you did not want to have that as a problem in the House. That's not governing for all Australians, and that's not doing it in fairness, for what this country stands for and for the values of democracy in this country. You were so busy trying to prevent a debate going to your House that you were going to do anything to make sure that, in this place, senators voted the way you wanted them to vote, even though it was a conscience vote. That is a clear example of your inability, and the inability of the Turnbull government, to progress any coherent policy or legislative agenda in either this place or the other one. 


It is shameful that this parliament decided that the people of the Northern Territory are second-class citizens. We do deserve the same rights as all Australians. And, while we wait for the government to decide whom it should have as its leader, the Northern Territory suffers, just like every other jurisdiction in this country. And, while we wait and continue to wait, we wonder about the pieces of legislation and policy that this mob over there should be progressing to improve the lives of Australians.


The city deal for Darwin, for example, sits on the Prime Minister's desk, gathering dust. The funding for Central Arnhem Road and Buntine Highway remains unclear and unaccounted for, and yet you stand up here saying that it's in the budget. But the amount of money that's in the budget is only going to cover a couple of hundred kilometres. The Central Arnhem highway goes for 600 or 700 kilometres. So don't do us any favours in the Northern Territory. Be genuine and real about what you're trying to do. But you can't, because you're distracted. You're too busy looking at your own selves. The funding for our schools remains unaccounted for. The funding for our hospitals remains unclear. Every day that the government talk about themselves is another day that Australians pay the price of nothing getting done. Our costs for accessing health care are higher than ever. Energy bills and the cost of living—which you on that side cannot seem to get sorted—are skyrocketing under the Liberals, and wage growth is lower than ever. 


These are not conditions in which the people of the Northern Territory, or the people of Australia, can thrive. These conditions only make our situation worse. This is a government that claims to stand up for regional and rural Australians. Really? Really? A pic fac out in Forbes says you care? Come on, guys, get your act together. You cut funding to ABC short-wave radio, allowing China to fill the void in the South Pacific. You cut funding to Charles Darwin University, damaging our future in the north. And don't let me go to the north Australia policy. What about the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility—$5 billion over nearly four years, and what have you got to show for it? You keep hanging it out in front of people who desperately need the infrastructure to build, the businesses to grow. You tease the people of northern Australia—you tease them—and then you come back here and you jostle for your jobs, you jostle for the leadership: who's gonna be in the cabinet? You're too busy wondering whether you're gonna get that extra dollar. And yet people out there are hungry. They're starving, they're homeless, and all you can do is think about yourselves.


You've stuffed up the NBN. You've cut funding to our primary schools and high schools. You've neglected even the First Nations media organisations, with no policy direction or new funding commitments and no support for creating real jobs and career pathways. And what about the royal commission into youth detention, which was caused by an incompetent Country Liberal Party government bearing your brand?


You continue to impose the disastrous and discriminatory CDP program in remote communities, despite empty promises of change and illusory improvements. What you're doing is entrenching poverty among the most disadvantaged Australians in this country. But you wouldn't be thinking about that right now, would you? The entrenched poverty out there can keep going so long as your wealth in here gets sorted.


This government is a shambles. Not only has this government lost the confidence of its own team, its own party, its own cabinet; this government has lost the confidence of all Australians.

"Brockman, Sen Slade",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (16:47):  Before I start my contribution, I'll address a few of the comments from Senator McCarthy. She talked about the importance of improving the life of Australians. Well, getting the fundamental settings in the economy right to see a million new jobs created in five years is improving the life of Australians. Getting our welfare numbers down to the lowest level in 20 years is improving the life of Australians. That is solely what this government has been and continues to be focused upon.


This government has delivered lower, simpler and fairer personal income taxes for all Australians. The Personal Income Tax Plan, which was passed by this place earlier this year, means low- and middle-income earners receive additional tax relief of up to $530. That is significant. We've got changing of the tax brackets to address the issue of bracket creep, which has recently forced so many more hardworking Australians into higher and higher tax brackets. What's the final phase of the legislated plan, the plan that has passed through this parliament? It's to abolish an entire tax bracket so that 94 per cent of Australians will be paying no more than 32½c in each dollar of their personal income. That is a significant achievement of this government and shows that the priority of this government is to improve the lives of all Australians. It was a big win for hardworking Australians when we saw those personal income tax cuts passed by this chamber and the parliament. It allows people to keep more of their own money in their own pockets to make their own decisions. We've already seen the small and medium-sized business tax cuts, designed to keep Australian businesses competitive in a very highly competitive global marketplace, legislated through this parliament. We want the hardworking Australians, the small and medium-sized businesses of Australia, to be the absolute best they can be, and we do this through taking the burden of taxation off them.


We've still got before this chamber—perhaps somewhat surprisingly—a very important set of business tax cuts to extend the company tax cuts to all businesses. That is about extending the opportunity to more people across the entire economy. Our philosophy is based entirely around getting people off welfare and into jobs and around getting business to grow to get more people into work—to improve their wages, to improve their standard of living and to improve their opportunities into the future. That is what this government has been delivering.


We've delivered it in a number of other ways, such as through the signing of a record number of free trade agreements. We've seen the free trade agreements with China, Peru, Korea and Japan. We've seen the work on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. There are also negotiations underway with the European Union and a post-Brexit United Kingdom, and obviously there's a lot more water to go under the bridge until those things are finalised. And those free trade agreements are not just pieces of paper. They deliver real results to people on the ground, particularly in the areas I'm interested in, the agricultural exports area. We've seen some phenomenal growth in some of those markets, particularly, for example, the Korean market, where we've seen individual commodities increase by up to 50 per cent per annum—quite extraordinary growth rates and wonderful opportunities.


I'll loop back around to where I started, which is record jobs growth. Jobs are what it's all about: 412,300 jobs created last year, 75 per cent of them full-time jobs. More Australians are in work today than ever before. That is great news for Australian families. That is what improves the lives of Australian families. Over a million jobs have been created in fewer than five years, since the coalition came into office. That improves the lives of all those Australians and all those who are supported by the people in jobs. There have been 770,000 new jobs created since September 2015—again, more than half of them full-time. There have been 339,000 new jobs created over the last 12 months. Jobs growth has been at 2.7 per cent over the last 12 months. Compare that with the 0.08 per cent growth over the last 12 months of the last Labor government. Female participation in the economy is at a record high, at 60.6 per cent. The number of Australians who are unemployed has fallen by 59,000 since September 2015, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 6.1 per cent to 5.4 per cent. In Labor's last year in office, unemployment rose by 33,000, and underemployment increased by 39 per cent.


So, you can see that there is a very strong track record of achievement, a strong track record of achieving very, very good results for the hardworking Australians who want to keep as much of their own money as they possibly can, through our Personal Income Tax Plan, and for growing small and medium-sized businesses, who want to keep as much of the money as they can from our company tax plan, to ensure the growth, the jobs of the future and the wage growth of the future and through all those things ensure that we have a successful and prosperous economy into the future.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:54):  by leave—I table and present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the 138th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which was held in Geneva, Switzerland, from 24 to 28 March this year. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report. 


Leave granted.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


The delegation to this session of the IPU Assembly included Senator Catryna Bilyk, who has asked to be associated with the brief words I will make on this report, and also the member for Fremantle, Mr Josh Wilson. The assembly is sort of a parliament of parliamentarians from around the world and it's always very informative. Australia is a regular participant who is well regarded. We are seen as one of the more serious and reliable nations around the world and one of the serious contributors to debate in the assembly.


There was a general debate on issues, which both Senator Bilyk and I spoke to. Mr Wilson spoke on the Standing Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade, representing Mrs Nola Marino, who is the official leader of the delegation but who couldn't make it to that conference. Mr Wilson also proposed a topic on fair trade to be debated at the next session of the conference, to be held in October this year.


It's a fairly full program. It's almost a week of continual meetings with the various sections of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, including the Twelve Plus group, which is a group that Australia is part of, as well as the Asia-Pacific Group. In addition to that, there's always opportunity to speak to other parliamentary delegations from various countries. In this particular assembly, we took the opportunity of speaking with the delegates from Ukraine.


As always we attended a meeting of delegates from the Pacific Islands nations. Australia and New Zealand have a certain obligation to try and help the Pacific Islands nations, and we do that. We meet at every conference of the IPU to try and build solidarity amongst the Asia-Pacific nations in the broader sense, and also with our Pacific Islander neighbours, and that was convened by New Zealand.


We had discussions with nations involved in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the free trade agreement, and that was convened by Mexico. We were able to meet with most of the nations involved in the TPP and had some very useful discussions.


I will again thank the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who assisted us with information. I emphasise that this is a meeting of parliamentarians, not of governments, but we do seek the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in getting information for some of the matters that are debated at this conference. The Parliamentary Library also helped in that work, and I particularly want to acknowledge the work of Ms Cat Barker on that and Raymond Knight from the IPRO, who always assists with sometimes somewhat complicated travel arrangements—getting to and from the various locations of the IPU conferences.


We don't mention her in our written report, but I specifically want to mention Toni Matulick, our secretary, who does a wonderful job in mothering us and helping us in everything that we do. It's only not mentioned in the report because Ms Matulick refuses to allow us to put it in writing. But I do, on behalf of this delegation and other delegations that I have been involved in to the IPU, particularly want to acknowledge her very considerable help and assistance in all aspects of Australia's contributions to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly, as they're held. I commend the report to the Senate.

The speeches read as follows—



Space Activities Amendment (Launches and Returns) Bill 2018


On 24 October 2015, the Turnbull Government announced that we would review the Space Activities Act 1998. 


The aim of the review was to ensure that Australia's space regulation accommodates technological advancements and does not unnecessarily inhibit innovation in Australia's space capabilities.


The review concluded in November 2016. 


It found that the Space Activities Act should have additional flexibility to accommodate the changing operating environment for space activities and support innovation and investment in the sector.


The Space Activities Amendment (Launches and Returns) Bill does just that. 


It reduces red tape for businesses undertaking space-related activities in Australia.


The Turnbull Government is committed to ensuring businesses are able to grow and create more jobs without the burden of unnecessary red tape. 


The Bill will support innovation and investment, and provide additional flexibility to adjust to the changing operational environment of the space industry—while balancing safety and risk of potential damage with the national interest.


The global space sector is worth over USD 345 billion, and growing at 10 per cent annually. 


Australian businesses represent just 0.8 per cent of this industry internationally: a disproportionately small share considering our immense capability in space-related sectors, including our immense advanced manufacturing capability, and our world-leading work in fields such as automated mining and precision agriculture. 


Combined with our expertise, the extraordinary growth of this global industry makes it vital for Australian businesses to be able to participate with minimal regulatory burden, while maintaining Australia's international obligations. 


I would like to thank all stakeholders who have participated in the review's consultation processes, as well as the subsequent consultations on an appropriate legislative framework. 


Today's introduction of the Space Activities Amendment (Launches and Returns) Bill 2018 is the culmination of these processes.


The Bill broadens the regulatory framework to unlock potential further opportunities for space sector growth in Australia and reduce barriers to participation in the space industry. 


It will bring us in line with agreed international practice and standards by streamlining the approvals process and insurance requirements for launches and returns. 


The Bill will encourage our businesses to innovate, invest and create jobs. 


The global space sector is a major source of technological advancement that provides broader applications and benefits across industry and society—not just in space exploration, but in sectors spanning communications, defence, mining, transportation and agriculture, to name but a few. 


This Bill will allow our emerging space industry to keep pace with international and technological developments, while updating and streamlining regulation to encourage private investment. 


It will create a more flexible regulatory environment to make it easier for these businesses to tap into global supply chains and access the benefits on offer for all Australians.


To reflect the changing nature of launch facilities, the Bill includes licencing arrangements for launches from Australian aircraft in flight, in addition to more traditional ground launches. 


The Bill also provides appropriate safeguards to mitigate the risk of damage from the launch or return of a space object, or from the launch of a high power rocket.


This Bill will enable Australian business to engage more fully with the global space industry, supporting extraordinary opportunities to create jobs right across the economy. 


I commend the bill to the Chamber.


Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Sector Regulation) Bill 2018


Over the life of this Government, we have consistently demonstrated our commitment to building a financial sector that is unquestionably strong, unquestionably accountable, and robustly competitive. 


This Bill takes the next step on this path and delivers on promises that we made in the 2017-18 Budget to ensure that our regulatory architecture keeps pace with changes to the financial environment. It includes two measures relating to financial sector ownership restrictions and bank licensing that will work in tandem to make this critically important sector of our economy more contestable, more innovative, and improve overall choices and outcomes for consumers. 


We are building on reforms including:


the major bank levy, which is already ensuring that our largest banks pay their fair share; 


relaxing restrictions on the use of the term 'bank'; 


the introduction of crowd sourced equity funding—along with other aspects of the Government's innovation strategy—that are already increasing entrepreneurs' access to finance; and


the announcement in the 2018-19 Budget of the introduction of Open Banking which will have the potential to transform the competitive landscape in financial services and the way in which Australians interact with the banking system. 


Today's Bill significantly reduces barriers to entry that are preventing the innovation that our financial system needs, while still prioritising the safety of consumers and the broader financial system. 


In particular, and consistent with the draft recommendations of the Productivity Commission's review into competition in the financial sector: 


Schedule 1 to this Bill relaxes ownership restrictions in the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 for all financial sector companies—banks as well as life and general insurance providers—and creates a new simplified approval path for new and recent entrants with concentrated ownership; and 


Schedule 2 amends the Banking Act 1959 to support the operation of APRA's restricted Authorised Deposit Institution licensing framework. 


I will now provide additional detail on these reforms. 


Under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act, no individual can hold greater than 15 per cent of a financial sector company without being subject to approval under a national interest test. 


This is an important mechanism to ensure, among other factors, that prudentially regulated institutions have access to sufficient financial resources during times of stress and that their owners have the capabilities necessary to fulfil their responsibilities.


However, as identified by the House of Representatives Economics Committee in its first review of the Four Major Banks, the criteria against which a national interest determination is made are not transparent, and this can have unintended consequences, particularly for start-ups. 


The Government believes the broadness of a national interest test is warranted when assessing significant transactions under the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act. However, the Government agrees with the view that it is less justifiable when considering ownership of small institutions when they are just starting out, given that due to their size they pose limited risks to financial stability or a large numbers of consumers. This is particularly true given that:


start-ups are more likely to have a concentrated ownership structure as a normal part of the business life cycle and thereby require Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval; and


uncertainty about obtaining Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval is limiting start-ups access to the finance they need to grow, given the perceived risk of an investment becoming 'stranded' should approval against 'national interest' not be granted. 


This is an unacceptable outcome that this Bill will fix in two ways. 


Firstly, the ownership threshold beyond which Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval will be required for all financial sector companies will be increased from 15 to 20 per cent, in line with the threshold that exists in the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975. There is no policy rationale for this discrepancy. Making the two Acts consistent will simplify investment in the financial sector and remove a significant regulatory hurdle for institutions where owners are seeking to hold 15 to 20 per cent of available shares. 


Secondly, we will introduce a streamlined Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval path for small domestically incorporated financial sector companies—that is, banks and life insurance companies with less than $200 million in assets and general insurance companies with less than $50 million in assets—that are seeking a prudential licence for the first time or have been licenced for fewer than five years. 


Under this model, qualifying institutions will not be assessed against the national interest framework. Instead, as long as the firms' owners are 'fit and proper' and the firm itself undergoes regular reviews of its ownership structure and provides relevant information to APRA each year, Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval will be granted. 


To ensure, however, that new-entrants receiving approval under this framework do not receive a competitive advantage relative to existing firms, or grow so large that their ownership structure begins to pose risks to consumers, once such firms grow beyond the relevant asset threshold their owners will be required to either:


divest their holdings such that no one holds more than 


20 per cent of the institution within two years; or


apply for regular Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval subject to the existing national interest test within three months. 


Together, these two elements of the Bill will ensure:


that the perceived risk of an investment getting stranded in a start-up is dramatically reduced, stimulating investment; and


that start-ups have a number of years to test their business in a lighter-touch regulatory environment, before having to comply with the same rules as everyone else, preserving competitive neutrality and system resilience. 


While Schedule 1 to this Bill makes significant inroads to cut red tape in relation to new businesses' ownership structure, the Government recognises that the power of this change on its own is limited. Even with an Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act approval in hand, start-ups need to obtain an APRA-licence and be ready to comply with a range of prudential requirements covering everything from financial resources to corporate governance and remuneration policies from the day that they start operations. 


Meeting these requirements is a central part of Australia's regulatory architecture and APRA's prudent approach to managing financial sector risks was key to Australia's relative success during the Global Financial Crisis. As such, this is not a structure that any Government would want to undermine. However, where there are opportunities to reduce barriers to entry without increasing risks, we support them being investigated. 


That is why the Government fully endorses APRA's new restricted Authorised Deposit Institution licensing framework. This will be similar to the United Kingdom's model, which, since 2014, has seen more than 10 new banks commence operations—compared to only one start-up bank in Australia in the last decade. 


Under APRA's approach, start-up banks will be able to obtain a restricted licence for up to two-years, or a time specified by APRA. During this time they will be subject to a limited suite of prudential requirements and strict caps on the size of their business, granting them the opportunity to prove their business model and attract the funding they need to successfully compete in the long term. After two years, successful licences will transition to meet the full framework. 


Building on our reforms of the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act, Schedule 2 to this Bill therefore makes a number of technical amendments to the Banking Act to support this new licensing approach. In particular, the Bill grants APRA the power to:


impose a 'time limited' condition on banking licences where institutions are seeking a restricted Authorised Deposit Institution licence; and


remove such licences—without merits review—when the licence holder is found to be non-compliant with their regulatory requirements or not able to develop sufficient resources to acquire a full unrestricted banking licence. 


While the revocation of a licence without the possibility of merits review is a significant step, it is a necessary protection when banks are being allowed to operate at lower regulatory requirements and a bank's continued operations during an appeal process would pose unacceptable risks to consumers. It is also necessary, more broadly, to protect the reputation of all 'restricted Authorised Deposit Institutions' at a time when they are trying to build their businesses and attract customers. 


Under this approach, natural justice would still be provided to time-limited licensees, with APRA required to provide notice of its intent to revoke a licence in writing and allow the licensee to make submissions in its defence. This adequately balances the need for licenced institutions to have their rights protected, against those protections required by the broader community. It will also have no impact on existing banks, or new banks that acquire a full banking licence. 


To conclude, this Bill is yet another example of the Government's commitment to creating more competition in the financial sector which ultimately leads to better outcomes for consumers. This two-pronged approach to simplifying the process of setting up a new financial institution—relaxing both ownership restrictions and licensing rules for new entrants—will support investment and drive the kind of robust competition necessary to create better, cheaper, products for all Australians. 


Full details of the measure are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.


Unexplained Wealth Legislation Amendment Bill 2018


Serious and organised crime syndicates are operating in an increasingly fluid manner across jurisdictional borders. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission estimates that the cost is at least $36 billion per annum. 


Depriving criminals of their wealth is a key measure in combatting these insidious individuals. Unexplained wealth laws provide a valuable tool for law enforcement to confiscate the assets of these criminals where they cannot demonstrate that this wealth has been lawfully obtained.


However the scale and complexity of this criminal threat has necessitated an enhanced focus on cooperative, cross-jurisdictional responses by Australian governments.


The Unexplained Wealth Legislation Amendment Bill 2018 will provide a national approach to target unexplained wealth. It will enable all participating jurisdictions to work together to effectively deprive these criminals of their wealth, irrespective of the jurisdictions in which they operate.


Through a referral of powers from participating States, the scheme will allow Commonwealth unexplained orders to be used where a person or property can be linked to a broader range of State and Territory offences.


This will allow the AFP to use a single unexplained wealth order to target criminal syndicates instead of the patchwork of orders that would otherwise be sought by Commonwealth, State and Territory law enforcement agencies.


The scheme will also enhance the capability of State and Territory agencies to contribute to national efforts by providing access to enhanced information gathering powers and the ability to use lawfully intercepted telecommunications information in unexplained wealth matters. 


The Bill also incentivises greater cooperation between jurisdictions through the establishment of new equitable sharing arrangements. These arrangements will give participating jurisdictions preferential treatment in the distribution of seized assets.


The scheme will not replace existing unexplained wealth schemes around the country, but rather create a more effective and cooperative network of law enforcement working towards a common goal.


I thank the States and Territories that have worked with the Commonwealth to design the national cooperative scheme on unexplained wealth. In particular I acknowledge the efforts taken in New South Wales, with the introduction of the necessary referring legislation in their Parliament earlier this month. I will continue to negotiate with the remaining States to secure their support to ensure the benefits of the scheme are maximised.


I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this critical legislation. Together we can demonstrate we are committed to working collaboratively to strengthen unexplained wealth laws and strike at the heart of organised crime.

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (17:51):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement.


I rise to take note of the ministerial statement commemorating the 75th anniversary of the election of Dame Enid Lyons to the federal parliament, representing the electorate of Darwin—which is essentially now Braddon—in my home state of Tasmania. Dame Enid served as the member for Darwin from 1943 until 1951 and was the first woman elected to the House of Representatives and the first woman to serve in federal cabinet. I should be careful to note here that Dame Enid was not the only woman elected to parliament at the time, as at that same election Dame Dorothy Margaret Tangney DBE was elected to the Senate for Western Australia. The 1943 election was certainly a good election for women and for the two women who were elected—a high benchmark for all those seeking to enter politics, men and women alike.


Dame Enid was born Enid Muriel Burnell in Smithton on Tasmania's north-west coast. She lived in various towns in Northern Tasmania and trained as a schoolteacher in Hobart. In April 1915, 17-year-old Enid married Joseph Lyons, who was 18 years her senior and to whom she remained married till his death in 1939. As his wife, Dame Enid remained active in the political life of Joseph, encouraging his split from the Australian Labor Party and movement to the erstwhile United Australia Party, motivated by the unease she felt at witnessing the Labor Party's handling of the Depression and the subsequent financial strife, which hit Australians particularly hard at the time.


After Joseph Lyons's death in office as Prime Minister of Australia in 1939, the grief-stricken mother of 12 felt compelled to battle the idleness and the shadow of anguish with action and made the decision to make a run at the type of career she had so astutely participated in with her husband in the preceding two decades. Dame Enid did just that, from 21 August 1943 until 19 March 1951 as the federal member for Darwin.


In her maiden speech, delivered on 29 September 1943, Dame Enid laid down a number of philosophies that would guide her as both a politician and a person. She, not without irony, noted that, yes, she was a woman and that, no, it would not be a limitation. As a firm believer in individual hard work and agency, she contended that her experiences as a woman, a mother and a wife of a former Prime Minister, no less, would, in her words, 'imply an ever-widening outlook on every problem that faces the world'. She was not wrong. Fusing her domestic duties and home life with her political persona, Dame Enid echoed the words of King George V in her maiden speech to parliament, stating:


The foundation of a nation's greatness is in the homes of its people.


She saw the strength of this great nation starting in the homes and at the hearths of those who inhabited it. As a consequence, Dame Enid was an advocate for what she called 'conscious citizenship'.


A strong yet compassionate egalitarian, Dame Enid not only touted the importance of contributing to a society greater than oneself but also that the Australian society was one that provided women with the same opportunities as men, particularly following universal suffrage and the enabling of women to be voted to public office. On this, Dame Enid said:


Any woman entering the public arena must be prepared to work as men work; she must justify herself not as a woman but as a citizen; she must attack the same problems, and be prepared to shoulder the same burdens.


She being the first woman elected to the House of Representatives, I believe she spoke with some authority on the matter and that her parliamentary record is one that embodies this spirit.


Whilst a passionate speaker on topics that traditionally related closely with women, such as housing, clothing, baby foods, maternity services, discrimination against married women in the workforce, widows pensions and the like, she did not confine herself to such topics, proving that she could and would attack the same problems as any other MP would do at the time. To this end, she spoke also to issues that specifically affected Tasmania, including air and shipping services, agricultural development and the aluminium industry, which remain important Tasmanian industries to this day. In 1949, Enid was sworn in as Vice-President of the Executive Council, thereby being the first woman member of a federal cabinet, serving in the Menzies government.


Unfortunately, ill health caused her to resign from the cabinet in 1951, and she did not contest the following election in that same year. She refused to become idle, however, and remained active in her home community in a number of women's organisations, choosing to keep in close contact with those whom she served as the member for Darwin.


It is undoubtable that Enid Lyons was a compassionate woman and a skilled politician and possessed the fortitude to rise to the challenge of being Australia's first female lower house member. She defined herself not by her background or her status as a mother or a wife—although these things were extremely important to her—but by her ability to be a self-reliant, free-thinking person and compelling speaker, passionate about Tasmania and dedicated to serving Tasmanians. Despite her death in 1981, Dame Enid Lyons's mark was well and truly left on the Australian parliament, not only blazing the trail for women in the public sphere but also serving Tasmania with great skill, dedication and compassion.

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (17:57):  I, too, would like to take note of the ministerial statement. It is an extraordinary honour indeed to once again stand in this chamber and reflect on one of the most momentous events in the political history of our nation. It was indeed 75 years ago today that Dame Enid Lyons, the member for the Tasmanian electorate of Darwin, was elected to this parliament, along with Western Australian Dame Dorothy Tangney—though at that stage she was not Dame but Mrs Tangney—who was elected to the Senate.


It is Dame Enid Lyons I would like to reflect on. I think I can safely say that I am the southern-most female Liberal senator. It's a terrible shame, and I look to my colleagues in the rows ahead of me in this chamber to say that, yes, they have a responsibility to fix that so that perhaps before we get to the 76th anniversary of Dame Enid Lyons's entry to parliament we can have a female Tasmanian senator from our great party reflecting on this momentous occasion.


I would like to devote some attention specifically to Dame Enid and the triumphs and challenges that characterised her place in history. Of course, while she is best known as Australia's first female parliamentarian, she certainly wasn't new to the demands of political life. Dame Enid grew up in Tasmania to parents who were Methodist. Her father worked in timber mills—if memory serves correctly—and her mother, sadly, was a member of the Labor Party. She was a political activist and she brought—




Senator Cameron:
  That's where the good genes come in.




Senator HUME:
  It's alright; she eventually saw the light, Senator Cameron. She was brought up in a very politically active household where political discourse was encouraged around the table, and her mother also believed in the value of female education. You can imagine that this was quite an unusual feature at the turn of the last century. She went to a teachers' college in Tasmania to pursue her education. That was the only option. At a Labor Party her mother introduced her event to her future husband, Joe Lyons, who was at that stage—I can't remember what seat he was the member for; perhaps Senator Abetz might remind me—I think, the Treasurer of the Tasmanian parliament. She married Joe Lyons when she was only 17 and he was 35, so there was a significant difference between them, but it was a marriage of great affection and love that lasted until his death. I should remind the chamber that Joe Lyons was Treasurer of Tasmania—he was Premier of Tasmania, wasn't he?




Senator Bushby:
  Labor Premier.




Senator HUME:
  Although he was a Labor Premier of Tasmania, he went on to become a UAP Prime Minister of Australia. He was our prewar Prime Minister. While Joe Lyons was Prime Minister, Dame Enid Lyons had a gruelling public speaking schedule in support of her husband. You can only imagine what that must have been like. During the period of time when Joe Lyons was either Treasurer, Premier or Prime Minister, Dame Enid gave birth to 12 children, which is quite extraordinary. There might have been a couple of miscarriages along the way; I think there were 15 pregnancies in all. One of her children died very young, of whooping cough, so she had 11 by the time Joseph Lyons died in office, which was a tragic, sudden and unexpected event. She did once reflect that her hardest role in life was that of the Prime Minister's wife. I wonder whether Lucy Turnbull would give the same answer today; I wouldn't be at all surprised.


It was terribly tragic when Dame Enid's husband died in 1939 and left her a widow at only 41 years of age. At that stage she truly retreated into grief, went back to Tasmania and watched a number of her older sons go off to the Second World War. You can only imagine combining grief with that stress. World War II saw Australia change quite profoundly. Over the war years the number of women in the workforce increased dramatically, by a third, and there was a newfound respect for the changing roles of women, their abilities and their contributions. Before the Second World War only a handful of women had been elected to Australian state parliaments, and at that stage the mere suggestion of female parliamentarians was considered something of an outrageous experiment whose outcome was very uncertain.


But in the midst of the social change of World War II a vacancy arose in the seat of Darwin. I like the fact that it was Dame Enid's daughter who talked her into running for that seat. She won that ballot by only 800 votes. On entering she was a very popular member. I think she was nominated as deputy leader the moment she entered parliament, which is quite an honour indeed. Being a woman who was extraordinarily modest, she declined that nomination. I wonder whether we would see people do that today. She had a political toughness and a folksy charm that characterised a very unique style and personal appeal. Her speeches were known for their humour but also their very sentimental nature. Indeed, Sir Robert Menzies said of her speeches—I love this phrase:


She could reduce me to tears about the state of a railtrack …


I might have done the same in this chamber, but probably tears of boredom as opposed to tears of sentiment.




Senator Cameron:
  This is the same speech you gave last night.




Senator HUME:
  Don't you love that quote? She was a trailblazer just for being here, but she also had some extraordinary achievements while in office. Hers was a reasonably short parliamentary career, only eight years. She left out of ill-health in the end. This is extraordinary: she had an undiagnosed broken pelvis, which was from one of her earliest pregnancies. You can imagine, after 12 children, to have an undiagnosed broken pelvis, to have run for parliament and to have sat in the House of Representatives all that time, was an extraordinary physical achievement, if nothing else, and the travel back and forth to Tasmania. We could only imagine what that would have been like.


While she was here, she made some very significant contributions to issues that were important not just to women but also to the nation and specifically with regard to women and children. She had a very unique perspective on women's issues. Things like maternal health care, the widows pension, elimination of employment discrimination and particularly the extension of child endowment to first children. She also fought to see legislation passed which secured citizenship rights for women after marriage to foreigners. It was unusual at that stage for women to maintain their cultural identity after marriage. Also, and I love this one in particular, she ensured that allowances to servicewomen who returned from the Second World War matched those of returned servicemen.


Her electoral successes were also enviable. The 800 votes that she won by in her first ballot she tripled in her primary vote at the next election and quadrupled it after that. If only those of us in this place, and in the other place, could experience such electoral success today I think we'd be very pleased with ourselves.


Prime Minister Robert Menzies promoted her to be vice-president of the Executive Council, which made her the first woman to hold a cabinet position—although it wasn't a portfolio that she held. It was widely regarded that she was certainly capable of being a cabinet minister and holding a portfolio, but her ill health caught up with her. Prior to the 1951 election, she was in quite a significant car accident, went to hospital and had a number of operations. That was what it was that eventually forced her retirement.


I think that her insights, her policy legacy, her wit and her wisdom have endured throughout time. It is, in fact, timeless. She once reflected, and I have used this quote before, that our nation:


… is still a land of promise. We cannot afford to neglect some recognition of our past, even though we gaze into the future.


She certainly was a woman who blazed a trail. In a political climate where voters remain distrustful and removed from their representatives, it's women like Dame Enid Lyons and their legacy that remind us of why we're here, the importance of what we do and the importance of representing not just one section of Australia but all Australians.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (18:07):  Today we celebrate a great Australian, a great Tasmanian and a great woman. Seventy-five years ago she won the first seat for a woman in the House of Representatives, a milestone in the history of the development of our democracy in Australia. I'm very pleased to say that she did so as a member of the party that I have the honour of representing, just as much as the party that I have the honour of representing can also boast the fact that we achieved the first Aboriginal in this parliament in Senator Neville Bonner and, of course, the first Indigenous minister in the honourable Ken Wyatt. The Liberal Party has a proud history in this regard.


Today we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the election of Enid Lyons to the seat of Darwin, and as has been recalled it was a very close call on the first occasion; the second occasion, a bigger margin; and the third time an even bigger margin, which is indicative of the way that she was able to interact with her fellow citizens. She was a much loved woman right around Australia, given that she had such a high profile—especially for those days—as the wife of Prime Minister Joe Lyons.


Indeed, he knew her electoral dynamism that much that on many occasions when they travelled he would physically encourage her to go onstage to talk to the people that he had also been addressing. He acknowledged how very successful she was in his political career. Theirs was a true partnership, a partnership of love to each other, dedication to each other and their family, and also service to the nation.


It was one of those things that, as the then Prime Minister Joe Lyons lay dying in a hospital bed, she was able to come up from Tasmania and see him before he passed—something that was very poignantly recorded for us in some of the wonderful writings of Anne Henderson, who has written on both Joe Lyons and Enid Lyons and has recorded their very important role in Australia's development, especially through the Great Depression. Mr Lyons was able to manage the Australian economy in ways that allowed us to recover from the Great Depression so much more quickly and better than, for example, the United States. I have no doubt that part of that economic management and the plan for that—that when times are tough you tighten your belt a bit—would have come from Enid Lyons herself, the strength that was so important to the success of Prime Minister Lyons's time in office and, of course, to the great benefit to the Australian people. 


Enid Lyons was a person who served her God, who served her family and who served her nation, and somebody who was more than willing to put service above self. Indeed, many a time, she suffered from the long absences of her husband—because, when Mr Lyons first started, getting to parliament wasn't a simple aeroplane trip; you had to get a steamer across Bass Strait and then a train to Canberra. Just for the record, Mr Lyons was the first Prime Minister that entered into an election campaign travelling by commercial airline, and it was seen as something quite fantastic that a Prime Minister could appear in Melbourne and Sydney on the same day to give election speeches. Nowadays, I think they do about four or five capital cities in the one day, given the various time zones. In those days, it was trailblazing—but it was also very, very long absences from each other for a couple whose love for each other was there on display, for all to see. 


It was a great privilege of mine to be able to actually meet Dame Enid Lyons when she came to a few Liberal Party state council meetings when I was a few years younger. She was a hit. Irrespective of who may have been the guest speaker or the parliamentary leader at the time, everybody wanted to make a beeline for Dame Enid Lyons and shake her hand. She really was a person of great stature, metaphorically speaking, because she was not physically of great stature but a wonderful individual, a person who lit up the room when she entered it and whom everybody fussed over. And that was very much deserved by her, given her wonderful contribution, her selfless contribution, first to her husband and her family, and then to her nation, rising to be not only the first woman elected to the House of Representatives but the first woman in a cabinet position. 


It is appropriate that we as a nation do stop from time to time to consider these milestones in our electoral and democratic system, and Dame Enid Lyons's contribution has to be seen as one of those very, very significant milestones. I simply finish by saying that Dame Enid Lyons was a role model for everybody, irrespective of whether you were male or female. But, of course, she was a trailblazer for women in this country. She's someone we should all aspire to emulate, irrespective of our political branding. Tonight I'm delighted to be able to join in saluting the service of Dame Enid Lyons and celebrating the occasion of the 75th anniversary of her election to this parliament.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (18:14):  I too would like to associate myself with remarks celebrating the 75th anniversary of the election of Dame Enid Lyons to the House of Representatives. There has been a lot spoken about the way that Dame Enid conducted herself, the separation that she suffered from her husband, Joe, and the difficulties that she faced as a woman at that particular point in time. I think the first speech that we heard here this evening indicates how far we've come from the time when Dame Enid made such a spectacular entry into the Australian parliament.


As Senator Abetz has just said, she had quite a commanding presence. I didn't meet her at Liberal Party functions, as Senator Abetz did. I wasn't a member of the organisation by the time we'd lost—




Senator Cameron:
  Were you in the Labor Party?




Senator COLBECK:
  No, Senator Cameron. There was never any fear of that, I can promise you! But I did happen to be at the Devonport Town Hall when Dame Enid made a speech at what turned out to be her last public appearance, and the town hall on that night was so quiet. To quote an old, hackneyed line: you literally could have heard a pin drop. The entire audience hung on her every word.


While we talk about the 75th anniversary of her election, it's not as if she was an overnight success. The strength of the relationship between her and Joe was such that she was actually one of the best known prime ministerial wives, even in those days. She wrote articles for newspapers. She made radio broadcasts and open-air speeches. So she was clearly a practitioner, and Joe quite obviously was very comfortable to share the limelight and to work closely with her, as Senator Abetz has said.


She clearly had a strong presence in the community, and the important thing, I think, is that the community continues to recognise the value of the contribution that she made. The Rotary Club, of which I'm a member, as a bicentenary project constructed a tribute to both Joe and Dame Enid Lyons in Roundhouse Park in Devonport, where bronze portraits of Joe and Dame Enid were erected and continue to stand today. Both of them rest in the Mersey Vale cemetery just outside of Devonport, and their residence is one of the very few prime ministerial residences in Australia that remain open to the Australian public. In fact, it's very much as it was when Dame Enid passed away.


I've had occasion to visit there quite often. In fact, recently there was a lecture by Tim and Merridie Costello about the life and times of both Joe and Dame Enid. So it continues to be a centrepiece not just to celebrate Joe and Dame Enid, who played significant political roles in Australia and Tasmania, but as a reminder of the importance of the fact that both of them communicated to the rest of the country from that residence, which had one of the first telephone lines to a house in Tasmania when the phone was put on. So I think it's appropriate that tonight there's a dinner being held to celebrate the 75th anniversary, and I certainly believe that it's appropriate that this chamber recognises that significant event in the progress of our democracy and the fact that Dame Enid not only made such a significant contribution to the parliament but then continued to make a significant contribution to her community throughout the rest of her life. She was very active in the community and was held in very, very high regard by her community, and she continues to be held in that regard locally in my home town of Devonport, where she and Joe lived at their residence, Home Hill.

Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (18:22):  Minister, I want to ask you a question about the impact of an uncompetitive corporate tax rate on businesses, particularly those businesses with turnovers above $50 million. But, before I get you to answer a question on that, I just want to preface it by talking a little bit about and reminding you of a visit we did earlier this year to a medium-sized Western Australian company called Legeneering in the Henderson area of Western Australia.


A few years earlier, Legeneering would have been what you would describe as a small business. It was a small engineering contracting firm that, through positive relationships with what could only be described as a very large Western Australian business, grew over time. It grew its number of employees significantly, up to around 200, I believe—I am stretching my memory a little. But, in turn, it was able to grow a network of contractors and support businesses that fed into its services. The large company that was involved in this particular network of relationships was Woodside Energy, and what you saw there was the direct action of what the other side sometimes mockingly calls 'trickle down'. You see a large business contracting to medium-sized businesses, who contract to smaller businesses. The jobs flow out from those large businesses to the medium-sized businesses and to a large number of small businesses. In that way, a significantly increased number of jobs is provided at that small-business level.


Minister, as we see the impact of international corporate tax cuts start to flow through and we see the need to have a globally competitive tax system, I think what I'm trying to get at is: what will the impact be if these amendments and this bill are not supported? Who is ultimately going to bear the burden in the economy of globally uncompetitive corporate tax rates, particularly for those larger businesses with turnovers above $50 million?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (18:24):  I couldn't put it any better than the current shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, who very succinctly pointed out that the burden of company tax falls hardest on workers, rather than wealthy shareholders. And that stands to reason, because, if we make it harder for businesses here in Australia which employ millions and millions of Australians to compete with businesses in other parts of the world, then we will lose business to other parts of the world and the beneficiaries of that will be workers in other parts of the world.


The principal beneficiaries of a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate here in Australia, as none other than Dr Ken Henry, the then Secretary of the Treasury to Wayne Swan as Treasurer, clearly pointed out, would be workers here in Australia. That is because, if businesses here in Australia are in a better position to compete with businesses in other parts of the world, they have a better opportunity to grow and expand. As they grow and expand, they will hire more people than they otherwise would, and, as they hire more people than they otherwise would, of course, that means the unemployment rate is lower than it otherwise would be. Demand for workers is higher than it would be. With shrinking supply and increasing demand, wages would have to go up because there's increased competition for a diminishing resource. This is all stuff that the Labor Party used to understand.


Just to put this into context, across Australia, about nine out of 10 working Australians work in a private sector business. So, Australia-wide, there are just under 11 million Australians working in a private sector business out of 12½ million working Australians all up—about 3½ million in New South Wales, about 2.9 million in Victoria, about 2.1 million in Queensland, 725,000 in South Australia, 1.2 million in Western Australia, 210,000 in Tasmania and 107,000 in the Northern Territory who all work in private sector businesses.


Even in the Australian Capital Territory where, of course, we have a larger proportion of public sector workers, the overwhelming majority of working Australians actually work for private sector businesses. Some 63.8 per cent of working Australians in the ACT work for private sector businesses, and 36.2 per cent work for the public sector. In the ACT, self-evidently, the proportion of private sector workers is lower than in other parts of Australia, but, nationally, it's about nine out of 10. What we need to understand is that future job opportunities, future job security, future career prospects and future wage increases for these nine out of 10 Australians—these 10.9 million Australians—working for private sector businesses depend on the future success, profitability and competitiveness of businesses here in Australia and their capacity to compete with businesses in other parts of the world.


And there's a long list of businesses who will be affected by this bill as amended by our proposal to carve out the four big banks, including Aurizon and JBS Australia, a meat-processing company which is headquartered out of North Queensland. I see Senator Ian Macdonald here, a proud LNP representative, representing, in particular, the great people of North Queensland. The managing director of JBS Australia is on the record as saying that a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate will enable them to invest in the expansion of their business and will enable them to hire more Australians. In fact, I see that in the gallery we have Renee Viellaris from The Courier-Mail, and I think The Courier-Mail might have reported the managing director of JBS Australia, earlier this year, making the point very strongly that the lower, globally more competitive business tax rate is critically important to securing future investment and future job opportunities and to ensuring that businesses here in Australia can compete with equivalent businesses in other parts of the word. Virgin Australia, Qantas, John Deere, Domino's Pizza, you name it—there's a whole bunch—these are not what you would describe as the nasty big end of town. These are big employers. These are businesses that provide job opportunities and job security to millions of Australians.


But if we make it harder for them to be successful, they'll hire fewer people. If we make it harder for them to be successful then more Australians will be unemployed. This is the core point, Senator Brockman, in answer to your question: if we keep the taxes on businesses with a turnover of $50 million a year higher by international standards, when countries around the world have substantially lowered theirs, then we help businesses in other parts of the world, who take business investment and jobs away from us. If we help workers in other parts of the world, they take jobs away from workers here in Australia. That is a fact. People talk about this proposition that somehow this is a benefit to some abstract people that nobody knows. Well, the abstract people that supposedly nobody knows are about 11 million Australians working for private sector businesses across Australia.


So, we've put forward the proposal to ensure that we have a corporate tax rate that is globally competitive for all businesses across Australia. But in order to give ourselves the opportunity to secure a consensus across the chamber we have put forward this amendment to carve out the four big banks. But we do believe that it's very important for all these other businesses to get the benefit of a globally more competitive business tax rate. And yes, people have made the point in this debate that this is just a headline tax and there are other taxes—individual states in the US will charge taxes as well as the federal government. Well, that is true in Australia, too. In Australia we've got federal taxes and we've got state taxes. But whatever the equivalent combination is, the headline US corporate tax went from 35 per cent plus other taxes to 21 per cent plus other taxes. That is a 14 per cent reduction in the United States, where most of our direct foreign investment into Australia to generate our future economic growth comes from.


Businesses in Australia will find it harder to secure investment out of the US into Australia if the after-tax profit in the United States is going to be higher than the after-tax profit for the same level of risk here in Australia. In the end, fund managers around the world will assess opportunities around the world. Capital is globally mobile. They will assess opportunities around the world across a whole range of indicators. But for the same level of risk they will look at where they can secure the highest after-tax return on their investment, and that is where the money will go. If we can't continue to attract it into Australia, because the after-tax level of return is materially lower here than it would be elsewhere, then the money will go elsewhere. And, as I've said, compared with the US and compared with Europe we have a much smaller domestic capital market. The United States and Europe—the European Union has a common market—have a much more substantial domestic capital market. But even in Europe—say, France: the President of France is hardly a right-wing ideologue. President Emmanuel Macron, when I first met him, was the minister for the economy in the socialist administration—the Parti Socialiste. Don't get yourselves upset by my using the word 'socialist'; they were literally the socialist administration of Francois Hollande. France, with Emmanuel Macron as their President, a left-leaning President—and he won't mind me saying it—is lowering their corporate tax rate from 33 per cent to 25 per cent by 2022 because they want to protect jobs in France, because they know that if they don't lower the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent in France they will help businesses in other parts of the world take business and investment and jobs away from France.


And France actually is in a safer position than Australia. Australia is more exposed. France is in the middle of Europe. France is in the middle of a 500-million-people market. Australia is a 25-million-people market with significant capital investment requirements in order to continue to develop our economy. France is an established economy in a large, 500-million-people domestic market. It is actually not as exposed to competitive pressures as we are. So you've got France going to 25 per cent. Scandinavia is meant to be the social democratic—




Senator Dean Smith:
  Nirvana.




Senator CORMANN:
  nirvana. Thank you very much, Senator Smith. Do you know who the Prime Minister of Sweden is? The Prime Minister of Sweden is a former Swedish union leader. He's a former leader of the equivalent of the ACTU in Sweden. Supposedly Scandinavia has this high-taxing, high-spending, high-welfare type of approach. Do you know what its business tax rate is? Twenty-two per cent! So you've got the United Kingdom, which has been going from 30 per cent, now to 19 per cent, on track to go to 17 per cent. You've got the United States under President Trump going from 35 per cent to 21 per cent. You've got France going from 33 per cent to 25 per cent.


Now, in Australia, we're not proposing to chase things down to the bottom. We're proposing to ensure that we don't lose touch with the average. We don't want to be left behind. We don't want businesses in Australia to be forced to carry burdens that their competitors in other parts of the world don't have to carry, because we know that, if we force businesses in Australia to carry burdens that their competitors in other parts of the world don't have to carry, the ultimate victims of that will be workers across Australia—11 million workers working in private sector businesses across Australia.


Some people would say, 'Oh, it won't really matter to the person working in the coffee shop or in the shopping centre or in the local grocery stores.' Well, it does because, if the big businesses end up hiring fewer people because they lose business, investment and jobs overseas, fewer people will go to cafes, shopping centres and grocery stores, and not only that; they'll buy fewer products and fewer services from small and medium-sized businesses here in Australia. And they'll end up hiring fewer people, and there'll be even fewer people going into coffee shops, restaurants, shopping malls and grocery stores.


The whole point is: we are one economy. If you deliberately weaken our global champions that are engaged in global competition, if you force our global champions to carry rocks in their backpacks that their competition in other parts of the world doesn't have to carry, you will slow them down. If you slow them down, they'll hire fewer people. If you slow them down, you help businesses overseas sell more of their products and services at our expense. And where are the jobs going in that circumstance? The jobs will be going to those businesses overseas and to the small and medium-sized businesses overseas that will supply products and services to them.




Senator Cameron:
  Absolute rubbish! Tax is one issue!




Senator CORMANN:
  Sure, tax is one issue.




Senator Cameron:
  It's one issue!




Senator CORMANN:
  It is one issue. Senator Cameron says tax is one issue. Well, it's a pretty central issue; let me tell you. When fund managers around the world look at where to invest—let me tell you—the after-tax return is a key issue, and it happens to be an issue that we directly control.


I'll tell you: there's another issue. Sure, the profitability of a company like BHP or FMG and so on is also driven by how much they can get for their commodity exports. But, as it happens, we don't control what commodity prices are globally. We don't control what happens to global prices for our key commodity exports. So we are price takers there.


We control what happens with our policy settings. When you've got countries around the world lowering their business tax rates, it is completely untenable for us to have one of the highest tax rates in the world when we are an open trading economy that is globally focused in terms of opportunities but also globally exposed.

The first question I'd like to ask—although it's probably not you who should answer this but perhaps Senator Cameron, if he could—is: why is it that Mr Shorten is clearly on record supporting these sorts of tax cuts? There's no doubt about it. When he was a minister, it was part of his proposal, his approach and his government's direction. I can't work out why it is he has now done a complete about-face. I'm wondering if the minister, or perhaps Senator Cameron, might be able to tell me what it is that changed Mr Shorten's mind. If Mr Shorten has explained that, then I've missed it. And, if I have missed it, perhaps Senator Cameron could—




Senator Cameron:
  You've been too busy carving each other up!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Cameron, will you be able to tell me why Mr Shorten changed his mind? Just a few short years ago he was very much in favour of this policy, but now he isn't. Did he give some reason? Is there some explanation as to why he's done a complete about-face on this particular policy? He and his Treasurer at the time, I think it was—




Senator Cameron:
  It's called priorities.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It's called what?




Senator Cameron:
  It's called health; it's called education; it's called infrastructure.



The CHAIR:  Order, Senator Cameron!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  So Mr Shorten wasn't educated before, Senator Cameron? I don't quite understand your interjected answers to my questions. Perhaps you could get up and explain how Mr Shorten could just a few short years ago positively advocate for this policy when he's now done a complete about-face. I stand to be corrected, but I don't think he's ever given any explanation as to why he changed his mind, so perhaps you could tell us why that is, or perhaps Senator Cormann has seen some credible explanation from Mr Shorten on why a few short years ago this was his government's policy. He was an economic minister in a government that was advocating this—a government that Senator Cameron was part of for a short period of time. And I'm flabbergasted. Not many people believe Mr Shorten on anything, but we did hear him strongly advocating for his government at the time to introduce these sorts of tax concessions. Why? Because Mr Shorten understood that, to remain competitive, we had to meet the market, so to speak, with the rate of tax. So that's one of my questions, Minister, if you could answer it. If not, perhaps Senator Cameron could answer.


Earlier in the day in this committee stage debate, I asked about some Queensland companies which are not big companies by relative standards. JBS was one that you mentioned, Minister. It's a meat processor based in Townsville and it employs a lot of Townsville people—a lot of meatworkers. Brent Eastwood has, as you rightly pointed out and as was reported in The Courier Mail, called upon the parliament to support these tax breaks for his company and for other companies similar to his, because he understands the tough world of business. He has to compete with imported meat products, and it's very difficult for him to do that when he is paying a rate of tax greater than that paid by his competitors in other countries.


I also mentioned the case of Teys Brothers, which have meat processing plants at Rockhampton and Biloela. I can't speak for them. I haven't heard them say anything about this particular tax reduction, but I can make a pretty fair assumption that they also would be very much in favour of it, because, in the times I visited their premises at Rockhampton and Biloela, I was told that this meat processing business is a pretty tough business. They're always competing with imports from the Americas—mainly South America, as I recall—and they rightly say that they pay their workers in Australia properly, as they're required to and as they're happy to do, but they have to compete with workers in other countries who are not on the same wage scale and conditions as Australian workers. But they understand that and they still compete.


When it comes to taxation, here is a way that we can allow JBS and Thiess Bros to actually compete. Senator Storer, in his contribution earlier on, said that he couldn't see the advantage of it, couldn't see how this would be passed on to help Australian workers and Australian jobs. Could I suggest to him that he might give the managing director of JBS a call and hear why he thinks—




Senator Cameron:
  JBS hasn't paid tax.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, Senator Cameron, these Australian businesses employ Australian people. Why would they disadvantage themselves by having to pay a tax rate that is far more than that of their competitors? I can never understand it, Senator Cameron. You keep saying you support the workers. The only—



The CHAIR:  Senator Macdonald, I remind you to go through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, I'll speak through you—thank you, Chair. I'm really just responding to Senator Cameron's disorderly interjections. But you're right. I'll resist responding to his interjections and speak to you. Of course, I hear from down in the corner—



The CHAIR:  Senator Macdonald, if you would resume your seat please. Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I'd like to call your attention to the state of debate in the chamber, but I will call your attention to the state of the chamber.



(Quorum formed)





Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I want to thank Senator Cameron for going and giving instructions to Senator Whish-Wilson to call a quorum so that more people would come in and listen to the question I'm putting to the minister. So I thank the Labor Party and the Greens for filling up the chamber to listen to my words of wisdom—well, not really words of wisdom, but the serious questions that I'm asking the minister in relation to this.


I was indicating that Senator Storer couldn't understand how this would help Australian workers. But, as I say, I would ask him, really, to speak to some of the business leaders who do understand this—who have skin in the game, so to speak—and understand the importance of the Australian tax system being competitive with others.


I also raise the issue of some other Queensland companies. I'm sorry for being parochial, but I'm familiar with these Queensland companies. Senator Hanson, who's also from my own state, knows these companies. You know the Kilcoy processing company there. You know Teys Bros. You know JBS. You know the AA Company, another company involved in meat processing with substantial Queensland assets. Senator Hanson, like me, you understand and know these companies. These are not the huge multinationals. These are Australian companies struggling to compete in a very competitive world. As I mentioned before, they all pay their workers proper wages, as they're required to do in Australia.




Senator Cameron:
  JBS?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, if they're not doing that, Senator Cameron, I don't know what you and your union mates are doing if they're allowing substandard wages to be paid. I know that's not true, of course, but you always scoff on one hand and, in doing that, you're clearly saying to your union mates they're not doing their job. I know they are doing their job, because all of these Australian companies I mention actually pay proper wages in accordance with the Fair Work Commission and the relevant awards. They're competing against countries with far lower wages. They're happy to do that, but we can help them by at least not requiring them to compete in the taxation area, where their competitors will be paying far less tax, as other countries understand what this is all about.


I also mentioned that in Townsville there's a bit of a difficulty in the labour market, if I can put it that way, with the closure of Queensland Nickel and the downturn of the mining industry generally. But there are two bright sparks in Townsville. One is the copper refinery owned by Glencore, which is one of the companies that are important here. That's why I'm concerned about Senator Hinch's amendment, in that these companies would pay a higher rate of tax than other competitors in Australia and certainly much more than competitors overseas. But I digress slightly. In Townsville we have Glencore, who run the copper refinery. We also have Sun Metals, a subsidiary of KoreaZinc, who a couple of decades ago, at the invitation and encouragement of, I think, the Fraser government, set up in Australia because we had cheap electricity in Australia in those days and they're big power users. They created the zinc refinery in Townsville, which employs a lot of people in the Townsville area, and they continue to try to expand their operations. But they have been struggling as well, mainly because of power prices, thanks to years of Labor governments, particularly state governments, who've been ripping off the energy market.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Cameron laughs at that. I know why he laughs: because he's in cahoots with the Queensland Labor government, who run the only generating supplier in North Queensland. It's a state-government-owned business entity. They gouge the prices and rip-off the businesses in North Queensland. They do that and pay the proceeds of their ill-gotten gains into the Queensland Treasury to try to help Senator Cameron's mates in the Queensland government to balance their books, which they never do, of course.


But Korea Zinc is one of those companies that would not benefit if Senator Hinch's amendment were passed, yet they are struggling to compete with zinc refiners elsewhere in the world. And the list goes on. I urge senators to have a look at the home-grown Australian companies—and there are certainly a lot of multinational companies on the list, who invest in Australia and we want to keep them investing in Australia, because they create jobs—that are trying to continue operating and creating jobs for our fellow Australians. If we can't compete in the taxation area, they are going to struggle to continue to exist. I ask particularly the crossbenches—I know the Labor Party is ideologically opposed to this now, but they weren't a few years ago when Mr Shorten was advocating this!—to have a look at the list of Australian companies that are trying to compete in a very difficult world in many areas where we can't have any influence. But we can at least compete on the tax front. So, I again ask the minister to elaborate on those companies, those home-grown Australian companies—Queensland companies, in my case—that will struggle to compete if we don't have a competitive tax rate. I wanted to speak further, but I know my colleagues have questions that they want to raise with the minister, too, so I will leave my contribution there, but perhaps later on the minister might be able to respond to some of the questions I have raised.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-08-21,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (18:57):  Firstly, I would like to explain to the chamber that my absence for the second reading division was simply unfortunate and not designed to give any further time to this debate, given my very clear stance on not supporting any further corporate tax cuts. We find ourselves with an amendment that Treasurer Scott Morrison claims was given to me last week. Let me make it clear to this chamber that I had not seen this amendment until it was emailed to my office at 12.09 pm today.


This week has been a complete shambles—an embarrassment to every Australian. You've got the Liberals knifing each other and Senator Cameron was caught dancing down the corridors with his air tambourine, singing Oh Happy Day. The people are over it. They're tired of every single one of you urinating their money up against a brick wall. If they could bang your heads against the same wall they would—both of you: Labor and the coalition. You have left the people in this country with a filthy hangover today. When I go shopping, people ask, 'Why can't the government help the farmers instead of these big companies?' They're right. The bulk of multinationals don't pay their fair share of tax in this country. People ask me, 'Why do we send billions overseas in the form of foreign aid?' It's a good question, isn't it, especially when every single one of you drives past at least six homeless people sleeping near Outback Jacks on Northbourne Avenue here in Canberra. And let's not forget the other 105,000 homeless people we have in this country. I've got cane farmers across Queensland, who want a code of conduct. Nothing else—no money, just surety for their industry, which employs tens of thousands of Australian workers and pumps $2 billion in cash through this economy. Why aren't we looking after those people? Aren't these tax cuts about saving jobs?


I'm tired of the people of this country sitting at their dining-room tables saying: 'Did you hear what those clowns in Canberra did today? They don't care about us.' They are talking about us. Tonight I'm voting with the lion's share of people in Rockhampton. I'm voting with the bulk of mums and dads in Tamworth. I'm voting with the majority of people in Coal Point, Townsville, Ipswich, Toowoomba, Beerwah, Bowen, Kilcoy, thousands of towns across my home state of Queensland and thousands more across the country. The majority of people don't want these tax cuts for businesses with turnover greater than $50 million. You know why they don't want me to support these tax cuts? You refused to fix the PRRT. Let me explain the PRRT. It is a tax imposed on the gas offshore in North West Australia. This is 15 per cent plus. Over the period of time that we've had the PRRT, companies like Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell have now cumulated $290 billion in tax credits, so that they say they will not be paying tax in this country for a long time to come.


Countries like Japan are making more money in excise tax out of ships with our gas on them, around $3 billion, than we do. We made about $800 million off our sales of approximately $55 billion this year. You refuse to collect billions in royalties from Commonwealth waters. Qatar made $26.6 billion in gas and oil sales, and we made $800 million—and you're worried about investment in this country, that the multinationals won't come here unless we reduce corporate taxes? I don't think you have it right. The whole fact is they will come here, because they are not paying the right taxes in the first place. Why wouldn't they come here?


You refuse to acknowledge that our tax system is different to that of every other country. You made a reference to America, who dropped their rate to 21 per cent. Yes, but their state taxes are between two and 12 per cent on top of that. You don't refer to their different tax systems. You can't compare apples with oranges. Every country has a different taxation system. Just because they drop their taxes doesn't mean that we do. You say they are dropping it every year, and that other countries are going to drop it to 17 per cent. Is this a race to the bottom? Who can give the lowest tax rates, so that we don't lose the investment? If they are not going to pay taxes in this country, what are we losing? They are only more competitive for the Australian businesses here who are struggling and trying to do the right thing. America has lower wages. That's another thing. I'm definitely not advocating that we have lower wages in Australia.


What have your free trade agreements done? You have signed away the workers. You talk about more jobs, but your free trade agreements have allowed these multinational companies to bring in their own workers. You are destroying our own workforce. America has half-price energy. There's your problem. Reduce the cost of energy in Australia, so industries and manufacturing can compete, instead of escalating prices. America has 325 million people in their domestic market and, more importantly, trading partners on their doorstep. There are a combined 450 million people in Canada and South America that they can sell their products to. They have also applied tariffs to imports—fancy that! I recall a younger version of myself calling for tariffs 20 years ago. These countries protect their homegrown industries—in Australia, we tie our companies up in red tape—and flood our market with cheap junk. 


As for suggestions on how to spend the money if you don't do this, because you're going to end up with about $4 billion in the coffers, what about long-term-vision projects, infrastructure projects like roads and rail? What about dams and the Bradfield water scheme, which would drought-proof our nation and help the poor farmers out there that are on their knees? What about the watering Australia program to bring the water down from the Territory, the Ord scheme, so we actually water Australia? These are projects that would make our country prosper and help those that are in dire need. This country is not going to grow or move forward if we don't provide the water that it needs. We have countries like Israel that have put in a watering project that can water their country. But we can't do it? 


There is no vision in this country whatsoever for future generations. What about railway projects like the Carmichael mine and duplication of the Sunshine Coast Railway through to Nambour? Why aren't we duplicating the Bruce Highway from Brisbane to Cairns for tourism and freight? Coal-fired power stations to produce the dispatchable energy that we need to reduce the power prices in this country; hydro power like the Tully-Millstream project—why aren't we doing these projects? Where's the debate on nuclear energy? Why don't we do that?


I have respectfully listened to the government's arguments, and I do thank Senator Cormann for his good-natured negotiations. But I cannot support a shift in the threshold to increase further corporate tax cuts, carving out the big four banks. My question is: what about the other banks? They have to answer for the wrong they've done to many people across this country, and the damage and the heartache that they've caused. It's more than just the four banks. 


My obligation is to the everyday people of this country and to ensure we start paying down the mounting debt. One Nation supported tax cuts up to a $50 million turnover. That's a cost to the budget of $35 million. We supported the personal tax cuts; that's another $144 billion. You want to pass these further corporate tax cuts; that's a further $45 billion. And you're talking about in eight years time. How do we know the state of this economy in eight years time? How do we know if this country will be able to afford it? How do we know who's going to be holding the chequebook—because I don't trust any one of you. I've seen it. Under Labor, when it changed over to the coalition, the country was in debt by about $270 billion. Now we're reaching nearly $600 billion. There has to be a debt ceiling put on, because someone has to curtail your spending. No-one's talking about future generations and how we're paying down this debt.


You talk about how it's going to create jobs. I'll tell you the only way you will create jobs in this country and get a better, higher wage increase: please work with your state counterparts and investigate reducing payroll tax, which is a bigger impost on business across the nation. That will—it will—stimulate jobs in this country. That's why I say to you that you can't guarantee corporate tax cuts are going to create employment and bring higher wages. For a lot of these businesses, what I hear all the time is that the biggest problem in this whole country is payroll tax. I know it's not a federal issue; it is a state issue. You have to work with the states to compensate them for slowly reducing the payroll tax, which will increase employment. Why would these businesses put more money into their companies and businesses through a corporate tax cut when they know that, if you create more employment and higher wages, that's going to put them over the threshold and they're going to be paying more in payroll tax? It needs to stop. Address your free trade agreements and stop these companies bringing in their workers from overseas—and that is actually happening. Ensure that we as a nation can afford this. You haven't proven that to me. 


I'm worried about the future generations and the debt we are going to leave them. You can sit there and promise me all these things, but with all the deals that you may have done in this chamber with the other senators, there is no guarantee of who's going to be the Prime Minister of this country next week—whether or not it's going to be Malcolm Turnbull. If we go to an early election, are these deals going to be secure? They possibly won't be. So, I want to know that the future of this nation is in good hands. I don't feel that it is.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (19:10):  There are a few things that I need to address before we rise tonight. Firstly, in relation to the amendment we are discussing, to carve out the big four banks, I can confirm that the official minute was circulated today. But of course I did raise it in one of the many very good and constructive discussions Senator Hanson and I have had over the months. I did raise that with Senator Hanson last week. In relation to the oil and gas industry in Australia, it is a relatively less mature industry compared with Qatar's. Qatar has had massive investment, generating massive production of oil and gas, for decades and decades. We had the most significant investment. The oil and gas investment out of Gorgon, Wheatstone and Pluto is very recent. These are highly capital-intensive projects. Not only did the significant capital investment of well in excess of $100 billion lead to massive increases in construction jobs and massive increases in economic prosperity for Australia but they will do so into the future. As Senator Hanson knows—and we had consensus in relation to this earlier in the year—we were absolutely prepared to pursue sensible reforms to the petroleum resource rent tax arrangements, and we will still pursue those sensible reforms to the petroleum resource rent tax arrangements. But we of course explored in good faith with the Senate crossbench the opportunity to land a consensus around a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate that is manifestly in the national interest.


Senator Hanson asked us to convince her that we can afford those. Well, the figures are there in the budget for all to see. I mean, our performance against the budget for the last two years now has been better than what had been estimated when the budget was delivered. If you look at the trajectory over the medium term in terms of our budget forecasts and projections, we had forecast to return to balance in 2019-20 and to remain in surplus over the medium term to exceed a surplus of one per cent as a share of GDP by 2026-27, which is when the Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan to reduce corporate tax to 25 per cent is designed to come into full effect. In fact, the reason we are not reducing corporate taxes for all businesses immediately is that we wanted to do it in a way that was fiscally affordable. We wanted to get the budget back into surplus as soon as possible while also making sure that businesses in Australia have the advantage and the benefit of a globally competitive business tax rate. Providing the signal to the bigger businesses with bigger turnovers that over the next few years the corporate tax rate for them would progressively come down to 25 per cent would provide them with the incentive to make investment decisions now in the knowledge that they will have an improved after-tax return on their investment.


It has always been thus. If you want to attract more investment, one of the key considerations is your tax policy settings. Countries around the world are not lowering their corporate tax rate out of fun; they're doing it because they're making a judgement that it is in the best interests of their economy, of families, of jobs created by businesses in their respective economies.


There is no question that the day will come when Australia will have to do this. Sadly, it looks as if we might not be able to get there on this occasion. If the Senate decides to vote this down today, it will become obvious in the years to come that it was a decision that exposed Australia to economic harm, that put us in a weaker position, that cost jobs and that put wage increases at risk. The day will come when, given what happens in the rest of the world in terms of business tax policy settings, this parliament will have to revisit this question—no question.


Senator Hanson talks about free trade agreements. That is something that used to have bipartisan consensus, I have to say. It was under the Hawke and Keating governments that Australia decided to open up the Australian economy to global competition, to position the Australian economy to be globally focused, because there was an appreciation and an understanding that there was so much opportunity for Australian businesses to sell Australian products and services around the world. You don't become rich by selling to yourself; you become rich and wealthy by selling your products and services to the massive global market.


Of course, on the flipside, for consumers, opening up our economy has delivered massive benefits to consumers, because it means that we can get the best products and services from other parts of the world at competitive prices. Prices in Australia would be higher, the quality of products and services would be lower, and there would be fewer jobs in Australia today if we had not opened up the Australian economy to the world, if we hadn't decided to become a genuinely globally focused open-trading economy. Becoming a genuinely globally focused open-trading economy has unquestionably lifted living standards across Australia. A commitment to open markets and free trade has lifted living standards around the world.


We have to accept that the world around us is as it is. We don't have a choice about the fact that businesses in other countries want to take business away from us. They want to sell more of their products and services to markets around the world at our expense. And, if they're more successful in selling more products and services that they have produced around the world, we will sell less. If the capital investment that could have come to Australia goes to Brazil, the US, Canada, New Zealand or France and doesn't come here then it will create jobs in those economies, in those countries. Over time, if we stay on that trajectory and don't adjust the trajectory to get ourselves into a more competitive position again, it will be working families across Australia who will pay the price. And the first people to pay the price will be low-income earners. People trying to get into the job market will be the first to pay the price, because they'll find it harder to get a job. People who are part of the casual workforce, who work part-time and want to have additional hours, will find it harder because those are the jobs that disappear first. As businesses have to shrink because the government's policy settings are making it harder for them to be successful, as bigger businesses have to cut costs because they are selling fewer of their products and services and attracting less investment, the first people who lose their jobs are those—




Senator Cameron:
  Malcolm Turnbull is going to lose his job.




Senator CORMANN:
  I know that for Senator Cameron this is all just one big joke. You know what? I actually care about this. I don't think anyone in this chamber—we might have disagreements; we might have a different perspective—can say that I'm prosecuting an argument that I don't believe in. I passionately believe that this is something we need to do to protect jobs, to create opportunity, for people to get ahead.




Senator Cameron:
  Oh, rubbish!




Senator CORMANN:
  You can say that's rubbish, but let me tell you, I have seen what socialist agendas lead to. I've seen what equality-of-outcome type income distribution and wealth distribution policies lead to, and let me tell you: they lead to poverty. They make everyone poorer. That is not a path that any of us should want for the Australian people. We should want a path where the Australian people can have opportunities to be the best they can be, and part of that is making sure that the businesses that employ them have the best possible opportunities to be successful into the future. In the end, this is going to be voted on tomorrow, and I'd like each senator to think about this overnight and make a decision that is in our national interest.

Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (18:22):  Minister, I want to ask you a question about the impact of an uncompetitive corporate tax rate on businesses, particularly those businesses with turnovers above $50 million. But, before I get you to answer a question on that, I just want to preface it by talking a little bit about and reminding you of a visit we did earlier this year to a medium-sized Western Australian company called Legeneering in the Henderson area of Western Australia.


A few years earlier, Legeneering would have been what you would describe as a small business. It was a small engineering contracting firm that, through positive relationships with what could only be described as a very large Western Australian business, grew over time. It grew its number of employees significantly, up to around 200, I believe—I am stretching my memory a little. But, in turn, it was able to grow a network of contractors and support businesses that fed into its services. The large company that was involved in this particular network of relationships was Woodside Energy, and what you saw there was the direct action of what the other side sometimes mockingly calls 'trickle down'. You see a large business contracting to medium-sized businesses, who contract to smaller businesses. The jobs flow out from those large businesses to the medium-sized businesses and to a large number of small businesses. In that way, a significantly increased number of jobs is provided at that small-business level.


Minister, as we see the impact of international corporate tax cuts start to flow through and we see the need to have a globally competitive tax system, I think what I'm trying to get at is: what will the impact be if these amendments and this bill are not supported? Who is ultimately going to bear the burden in the economy of globally uncompetitive corporate tax rates, particularly for those larger businesses with turnovers above $50 million?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (18:24):  I couldn't put it any better than the current shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, who very succinctly pointed out that the burden of company tax falls hardest on workers, rather than wealthy shareholders. And that stands to reason, because, if we make it harder for businesses here in Australia which employ millions and millions of Australians to compete with businesses in other parts of the world, then we will lose business to other parts of the world and the beneficiaries of that will be workers in other parts of the world.


The principal beneficiaries of a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate here in Australia, as none other than Dr Ken Henry, the then Secretary of the Treasury to Wayne Swan as Treasurer, clearly pointed out, would be workers here in Australia. That is because, if businesses here in Australia are in a better position to compete with businesses in other parts of the world, they have a better opportunity to grow and expand. As they grow and expand, they will hire more people than they otherwise would, and, as they hire more people than they otherwise would, of course, that means the unemployment rate is lower than it otherwise would be. Demand for workers is higher than it would be. With shrinking supply and increasing demand, wages would have to go up because there's increased competition for a diminishing resource. This is all stuff that the Labor Party used to understand.


Just to put this into context, across Australia, about nine out of 10 working Australians work in a private sector business. So, Australia-wide, there are just under 11 million Australians working in a private sector business out of 12½ million working Australians all up—about 3½ million in New South Wales, about 2.9 million in Victoria, about 2.1 million in Queensland, 725,000 in South Australia, 1.2 million in Western Australia, 210,000 in Tasmania and 107,000 in the Northern Territory who all work in private sector businesses.


Even in the Australian Capital Territory where, of course, we have a larger proportion of public sector workers, the overwhelming majority of working Australians actually work for private sector businesses. Some 63.8 per cent of working Australians in the ACT work for private sector businesses, and 36.2 per cent work for the public sector. In the ACT, self-evidently, the proportion of private sector workers is lower than in other parts of Australia, but, nationally, it's about nine out of 10. What we need to understand is that future job opportunities, future job security, future career prospects and future wage increases for these nine out of 10 Australians—these 10.9 million Australians—working for private sector businesses depend on the future success, profitability and competitiveness of businesses here in Australia and their capacity to compete with businesses in other parts of the world.


And there's a long list of businesses who will be affected by this bill as amended by our proposal to carve out the four big banks, including Aurizon and JBS Australia, a meat-processing company which is headquartered out of North Queensland. I see Senator Ian Macdonald here, a proud LNP representative, representing, in particular, the great people of North Queensland. The managing director of JBS Australia is on the record as saying that a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate will enable them to invest in the expansion of their business and will enable them to hire more Australians. In fact, I see that in the gallery we have Renee Viellaris from The Courier-Mail, and I think The Courier-Mail might have reported the managing director of JBS Australia, earlier this year, making the point very strongly that the lower, globally more competitive business tax rate is critically important to securing future investment and future job opportunities and to ensuring that businesses here in Australia can compete with equivalent businesses in other parts of the word. Virgin Australia, Qantas, John Deere, Domino's Pizza, you name it—there's a whole bunch—these are not what you would describe as the nasty big end of town. These are big employers. These are businesses that provide job opportunities and job security to millions of Australians.


But if we make it harder for them to be successful, they'll hire fewer people. If we make it harder for them to be successful then more Australians will be unemployed. This is the core point, Senator Brockman, in answer to your question: if we keep the taxes on businesses with a turnover of $50 million a year higher by international standards, when countries around the world have substantially lowered theirs, then we help businesses in other parts of the world, who take business investment and jobs away from us. If we help workers in other parts of the world, they take jobs away from workers here in Australia. That is a fact. People talk about this proposition that somehow this is a benefit to some abstract people that nobody knows. Well, the abstract people that supposedly nobody knows are about 11 million Australians working for private sector businesses across Australia.


So, we've put forward the proposal to ensure that we have a corporate tax rate that is globally competitive for all businesses across Australia. But in order to give ourselves the opportunity to secure a consensus across the chamber we have put forward this amendment to carve out the four big banks. But we do believe that it's very important for all these other businesses to get the benefit of a globally more competitive business tax rate. And yes, people have made the point in this debate that this is just a headline tax and there are other taxes—individual states in the US will charge taxes as well as the federal government. Well, that is true in Australia, too. In Australia we've got federal taxes and we've got state taxes. But whatever the equivalent combination is, the headline US corporate tax went from 35 per cent plus other taxes to 21 per cent plus other taxes. That is a 14 per cent reduction in the United States, where most of our direct foreign investment into Australia to generate our future economic growth comes from.


Businesses in Australia will find it harder to secure investment out of the US into Australia if the after-tax profit in the United States is going to be higher than the after-tax profit for the same level of risk here in Australia. In the end, fund managers around the world will assess opportunities around the world. Capital is globally mobile. They will assess opportunities around the world across a whole range of indicators. But for the same level of risk they will look at where they can secure the highest after-tax return on their investment, and that is where the money will go. If we can't continue to attract it into Australia, because the after-tax level of return is materially lower here than it would be elsewhere, then the money will go elsewhere. And, as I've said, compared with the US and compared with Europe we have a much smaller domestic capital market. The United States and Europe—the European Union has a common market—have a much more substantial domestic capital market. But even in Europe—say, France: the President of France is hardly a right-wing ideologue. President Emmanuel Macron, when I first met him, was the minister for the economy in the socialist administration—the Parti Socialiste. Don't get yourselves upset by my using the word 'socialist'; they were literally the socialist administration of Francois Hollande. France, with Emmanuel Macron as their President, a left-leaning President—and he won't mind me saying it—is lowering their corporate tax rate from 33 per cent to 25 per cent by 2022 because they want to protect jobs in France, because they know that if they don't lower the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent in France they will help businesses in other parts of the world take business and investment and jobs away from France.


And France actually is in a safer position than Australia. Australia is more exposed. France is in the middle of Europe. France is in the middle of a 500-million-people market. Australia is a 25-million-people market with significant capital investment requirements in order to continue to develop our economy. France is an established economy in a large, 500-million-people domestic market. It is actually not as exposed to competitive pressures as we are. So you've got France going to 25 per cent. Scandinavia is meant to be the social democratic—




Senator Dean Smith:
  Nirvana.




Senator CORMANN:
  nirvana. Thank you very much, Senator Smith. Do you know who the Prime Minister of Sweden is? The Prime Minister of Sweden is a former Swedish union leader. He's a former leader of the equivalent of the ACTU in Sweden. Supposedly Scandinavia has this high-taxing, high-spending, high-welfare type of approach. Do you know what its business tax rate is? Twenty-two per cent! So you've got the United Kingdom, which has been going from 30 per cent, now to 19 per cent, on track to go to 17 per cent. You've got the United States under President Trump going from 35 per cent to 21 per cent. You've got France going from 33 per cent to 25 per cent.


Now, in Australia, we're not proposing to chase things down to the bottom. We're proposing to ensure that we don't lose touch with the average. We don't want to be left behind. We don't want businesses in Australia to be forced to carry burdens that their competitors in other parts of the world don't have to carry, because we know that, if we force businesses in Australia to carry burdens that their competitors in other parts of the world don't have to carry, the ultimate victims of that will be workers across Australia—11 million workers working in private sector businesses across Australia.


Some people would say, 'Oh, it won't really matter to the person working in the coffee shop or in the shopping centre or in the local grocery stores.' Well, it does because, if the big businesses end up hiring fewer people because they lose business, investment and jobs overseas, fewer people will go to cafes, shopping centres and grocery stores, and not only that; they'll buy fewer products and fewer services from small and medium-sized businesses here in Australia. And they'll end up hiring fewer people, and there'll be even fewer people going into coffee shops, restaurants, shopping malls and grocery stores.


The whole point is: we are one economy. If you deliberately weaken our global champions that are engaged in global competition, if you force our global champions to carry rocks in their backpacks that their competition in other parts of the world doesn't have to carry, you will slow them down. If you slow them down, they'll hire fewer people. If you slow them down, you help businesses overseas sell more of their products and services at our expense. And where are the jobs going in that circumstance? The jobs will be going to those businesses overseas and to the small and medium-sized businesses overseas that will supply products and services to them.




Senator Cameron:
  Absolute rubbish! Tax is one issue!




Senator CORMANN:
  Sure, tax is one issue.




Senator Cameron:
  It's one issue!




Senator CORMANN:
  It is one issue. Senator Cameron says tax is one issue. Well, it's a pretty central issue; let me tell you. When fund managers around the world look at where to invest—let me tell you—the after-tax return is a key issue, and it happens to be an issue that we directly control.


I'll tell you: there's another issue. Sure, the profitability of a company like BHP or FMG and so on is also driven by how much they can get for their commodity exports. But, as it happens, we don't control what commodity prices are globally. We don't control what happens to global prices for our key commodity exports. So we are price takers there.


We control what happens with our policy settings. When you've got countries around the world lowering their business tax rates, it is completely untenable for us to have one of the highest tax rates in the world when we are an open trading economy that is globally focused in terms of opportunities but also globally exposed.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2018-08-21,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:39):  Minister, I do have some questions to ask you. The first question I'd like to ask—although it's probably not you who should answer this but perhaps Senator Cameron, if he could—is: why is it that Mr Shorten is clearly on record supporting these sorts of tax cuts? There's no doubt about it. When he was a minister, it was part of his proposal, his approach and his government's direction. I can't work out why it is he has now done a complete about-face. I'm wondering if the minister, or perhaps Senator Cameron, might be able to tell me what it is that changed Mr Shorten's mind. If Mr Shorten has explained that, then I've missed it. And, if I have missed it, perhaps Senator Cameron could—




Senator Cameron:
  You've been too busy carving each other up!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Cameron, will you be able to tell me why Mr Shorten changed his mind? Just a few short years ago he was very much in favour of this policy, but now he isn't. Did he give some reason? Is there some explanation as to why he's done a complete about-face on this particular policy? He and his Treasurer at the time, I think it was—




Senator Cameron:
  It's called priorities.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  It's called what?




Senator Cameron:
  It's called health; it's called education; it's called infrastructure.



The CHAIR:  Order, Senator Cameron!




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  So Mr Shorten wasn't educated before, Senator Cameron? I don't quite understand your interjected answers to my questions. Perhaps you could get up and explain how Mr Shorten could just a few short years ago positively advocate for this policy when he's now done a complete about-face. I stand to be corrected, but I don't think he's ever given any explanation as to why he changed his mind, so perhaps you could tell us why that is, or perhaps Senator Cormann has seen some credible explanation from Mr Shorten on why a few short years ago this was his government's policy. He was an economic minister in a government that was advocating this—a government that Senator Cameron was part of for a short period of time. And I'm flabbergasted. Not many people believe Mr Shorten on anything, but we did hear him strongly advocating for his government at the time to introduce these sorts of tax concessions. Why? Because Mr Shorten understood that, to remain competitive, we had to meet the market, so to speak, with the rate of tax. So that's one of my questions, Minister, if you could answer it. If not, perhaps Senator Cameron could answer.


Earlier in the day in this committee stage debate, I asked about some Queensland companies which are not big companies by relative standards. JBS was one that you mentioned, Minister. It's a meat processor based in Townsville and it employs a lot of Townsville people—a lot of meatworkers. Brent Eastwood has, as you rightly pointed out and as was reported in The Courier Mail, called upon the parliament to support these tax breaks for his company and for other companies similar to his, because he understands the tough world of business. He has to compete with imported meat products, and it's very difficult for him to do that when he is paying a rate of tax greater than that paid by his competitors in other countries.


I also mentioned the case of Teys Brothers, which have meat processing plants at Rockhampton and Biloela. I can't speak for them. I haven't heard them say anything about this particular tax reduction, but I can make a pretty fair assumption that they also would be very much in favour of it, because, in the times I visited their premises at Rockhampton and Biloela, I was told that this meat processing business is a pretty tough business. They're always competing with imports from the Americas—mainly South America, as I recall—and they rightly say that they pay their workers in Australia properly, as they're required to and as they're happy to do, but they have to compete with workers in other countries who are not on the same wage scale and conditions as Australian workers. But they understand that and they still compete.


When it comes to taxation, here is a way that we can allow JBS and Thiess Bros to actually compete. Senator Storer, in his contribution earlier on, said that he couldn't see the advantage of it, couldn't see how this would be passed on to help Australian workers and Australian jobs. Could I suggest to him that he might give the managing director of JBS a call and hear why he thinks—




Senator Cameron:
  JBS hasn't paid tax.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, Senator Cameron, these Australian businesses employ Australian people. Why would they disadvantage themselves by having to pay a tax rate that is far more than that of their competitors? I can never understand it, Senator Cameron. You keep saying you support the workers. The only—



The CHAIR:  Senator Macdonald, I remind you to go through the chair.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Yes, I'll speak through you—thank you, Chair. I'm really just responding to Senator Cameron's disorderly interjections. But you're right. I'll resist responding to his interjections and speak to you. Of course, I hear from down in the corner—



The CHAIR:  Senator Macdonald, if you would resume your seat please. Senator Whish-Wilson.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I'd like to call your attention to the state of debate in the chamber, but I will call your attention to the state of the chamber.



(Quorum formed)





Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I want to thank Senator Cameron for going and giving instructions to Senator Whish-Wilson to call a quorum so that more people would come in and listen to the question I'm putting to the minister. So I thank the Labor Party and the Greens for filling up the chamber to listen to my words of wisdom—well, not really words of wisdom, but the serious questions that I'm asking the minister in relation to this.


I was indicating that Senator Storer couldn't understand how this would help Australian workers. But, as I say, I would ask him, really, to speak to some of the business leaders who do understand this—who have skin in the game, so to speak—and understand the importance of the Australian tax system being competitive with others.


I also raise the issue of some other Queensland companies. I'm sorry for being parochial, but I'm familiar with these Queensland companies. Senator Hanson, who's also from my own state, knows these companies. You know the Kilcoy processing company there. You know Teys Bros. You know JBS. You know the AA Company, another company involved in meat processing with substantial Queensland assets. Senator Hanson, like me, you understand and know these companies. These are not the huge multinationals. These are Australian companies struggling to compete in a very competitive world. As I mentioned before, they all pay their workers proper wages, as they're required to do in Australia.




Senator Cameron:
  JBS?




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Well, if they're not doing that, Senator Cameron, I don't know what you and your union mates are doing if they're allowing substandard wages to be paid. I know that's not true, of course, but you always scoff on one hand and, in doing that, you're clearly saying to your union mates they're not doing their job. I know they are doing their job, because all of these Australian companies I mention actually pay proper wages in accordance with the Fair Work Commission and the relevant awards. They're competing against countries with far lower wages. They're happy to do that, but we can help them by at least not requiring them to compete in the taxation area, where their competitors will be paying far less tax, as other countries understand what this is all about.


I also mentioned that in Townsville there's a bit of a difficulty in the labour market, if I can put it that way, with the closure of Queensland Nickel and the downturn of the mining industry generally. But there are two bright sparks in Townsville. One is the copper refinery owned by Glencore, which is one of the companies that are important here. That's why I'm concerned about Senator Hinch's amendment, in that these companies would pay a higher rate of tax than other competitors in Australia and certainly much more than competitors overseas. But I digress slightly. In Townsville we have Glencore, who run the copper refinery. We also have Sun Metals, a subsidiary of KoreaZinc, who a couple of decades ago, at the invitation and encouragement of, I think, the Fraser government, set up in Australia because we had cheap electricity in Australia in those days and they're big power users. They created the zinc refinery in Townsville, which employs a lot of people in the Townsville area, and they continue to try to expand their operations. But they have been struggling as well, mainly because of power prices, thanks to years of Labor governments, particularly state governments, who've been ripping off the energy market.



Senator Cameron interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Cameron laughs at that. I know why he laughs: because he's in cahoots with the Queensland Labor government, who run the only generating supplier in North Queensland. It's a state-government-owned business entity. They gouge the prices and rip-off the businesses in North Queensland. They do that and pay the proceeds of their ill-gotten gains into the Queensland Treasury to try to help Senator Cameron's mates in the Queensland government to balance their books, which they never do, of course.


But Korea Zinc is one of those companies that would not benefit if Senator Hinch's amendment were passed, yet they are struggling to compete with zinc refiners elsewhere in the world. And the list goes on. I urge senators to have a look at the home-grown Australian companies—and there are certainly a lot of multinational companies on the list, who invest in Australia and we want to keep them investing in Australia, because they create jobs—that are trying to continue operating and creating jobs for our fellow Australians. If we can't compete in the taxation area, they are going to struggle to continue to exist. I ask particularly the crossbenches—I know the Labor Party is ideologically opposed to this now, but they weren't a few years ago when Mr Shorten was advocating this!—to have a look at the list of Australian companies that are trying to compete in a very difficult world in many areas where we can't have any influence. But we can at least compete on the tax front. So, I again ask the minister to elaborate on those companies, those home-grown Australian companies—Queensland companies, in my case—that will struggle to compete if we don't have a competitive tax rate. I wanted to speak further, but I know my colleagues have questions that they want to raise with the minister, too, so I will leave my contribution there, but perhaps later on the minister might be able to respond to some of the questions I have raised.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2018-08-21,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (18:57):  Firstly, I would like to explain to the chamber that my absence for the second reading division was simply unfortunate and not designed to give any further time to this debate, given my very clear stance on not supporting any further corporate tax cuts. We find ourselves with an amendment that Treasurer Scott Morrison claims was given to me last week. Let me make it clear to this chamber that I had not seen this amendment until it was emailed to my office at 12.09 pm today.


This week has been a complete shambles—an embarrassment to every Australian. You've got the Liberals knifing each other and Senator Cameron was caught dancing down the corridors with his air tambourine, singing Oh Happy Day. The people are over it. They're tired of every single one of you urinating their money up against a brick wall. If they could bang your heads against the same wall they would—both of you: Labor and the coalition. You have left the people in this country with a filthy hangover today. When I go shopping, people ask, 'Why can't the government help the farmers instead of these big companies?' They're right. The bulk of multinationals don't pay their fair share of tax in this country. People ask me, 'Why do we send billions overseas in the form of foreign aid?' It's a good question, isn't it, especially when every single one of you drives past at least six homeless people sleeping near Outback Jacks on Northbourne Avenue here in Canberra. And let's not forget the other 105,000 homeless people we have in this country. I've got cane farmers across Queensland, who want a code of conduct. Nothing else—no money, just surety for their industry, which employs tens of thousands of Australian workers and pumps $2 billion in cash through this economy. Why aren't we looking after those people? Aren't these tax cuts about saving jobs?


I'm tired of the people of this country sitting at their dining-room tables saying: 'Did you hear what those clowns in Canberra did today? They don't care about us.' They are talking about us. Tonight I'm voting with the lion's share of people in Rockhampton. I'm voting with the bulk of mums and dads in Tamworth. I'm voting with the majority of people in Coal Point, Townsville, Ipswich, Toowoomba, Beerwah, Bowen, Kilcoy, thousands of towns across my home state of Queensland and thousands more across the country. The majority of people don't want these tax cuts for businesses with turnover greater than $50 million. You know why they don't want me to support these tax cuts? You refused to fix the PRRT. Let me explain the PRRT. It is a tax imposed on the gas offshore in North West Australia. This is 15 per cent plus. Over the period of time that we've had the PRRT, companies like Chevron, ExxonMobil and Shell have now cumulated $290 billion in tax credits, so that they say they will not be paying tax in this country for a long time to come.


Countries like Japan are making more money in excise tax out of ships with our gas on them, around $3 billion, than we do. We made about $800 million off our sales of approximately $55 billion this year. You refuse to collect billions in royalties from Commonwealth waters. Qatar made $26.6 billion in gas and oil sales, and we made $800 million—and you're worried about investment in this country, that the multinationals won't come here unless we reduce corporate taxes? I don't think you have it right. The whole fact is they will come here, because they are not paying the right taxes in the first place. Why wouldn't they come here?


You refuse to acknowledge that our tax system is different to that of every other country. You made a reference to America, who dropped their rate to 21 per cent. Yes, but their state taxes are between two and 12 per cent on top of that. You don't refer to their different tax systems. You can't compare apples with oranges. Every country has a different taxation system. Just because they drop their taxes doesn't mean that we do. You say they are dropping it every year, and that other countries are going to drop it to 17 per cent. Is this a race to the bottom? Who can give the lowest tax rates, so that we don't lose the investment? If they are not going to pay taxes in this country, what are we losing? They are only more competitive for the Australian businesses here who are struggling and trying to do the right thing. America has lower wages. That's another thing. I'm definitely not advocating that we have lower wages in Australia.


What have your free trade agreements done? You have signed away the workers. You talk about more jobs, but your free trade agreements have allowed these multinational companies to bring in their own workers. You are destroying our own workforce. America has half-price energy. There's your problem. Reduce the cost of energy in Australia, so industries and manufacturing can compete, instead of escalating prices. America has 325 million people in their domestic market and, more importantly, trading partners on their doorstep. There are a combined 450 million people in Canada and South America that they can sell their products to. They have also applied tariffs to imports—fancy that! I recall a younger version of myself calling for tariffs 20 years ago. These countries protect their homegrown industries—in Australia, we tie our companies up in red tape—and flood our market with cheap junk. 


As for suggestions on how to spend the money if you don't do this, because you're going to end up with about $4 billion in the coffers, what about long-term-vision projects, infrastructure projects like roads and rail? What about dams and the Bradfield water scheme, which would drought-proof our nation and help the poor farmers out there that are on their knees? What about the watering Australia program to bring the water down from the Territory, the Ord scheme, so we actually water Australia? These are projects that would make our country prosper and help those that are in dire need. This country is not going to grow or move forward if we don't provide the water that it needs. We have countries like Israel that have put in a watering project that can water their country. But we can't do it? 


There is no vision in this country whatsoever for future generations. What about railway projects like the Carmichael mine and duplication of the Sunshine Coast Railway through to Nambour? Why aren't we duplicating the Bruce Highway from Brisbane to Cairns for tourism and freight? Coal-fired power stations to produce the dispatchable energy that we need to reduce the power prices in this country; hydro power like the Tully-Millstream project—why aren't we doing these projects? Where's the debate on nuclear energy? Why don't we do that?


I have respectfully listened to the government's arguments, and I do thank Senator Cormann for his good-natured negotiations. But I cannot support a shift in the threshold to increase further corporate tax cuts, carving out the big four banks. My question is: what about the other banks? They have to answer for the wrong they've done to many people across this country, and the damage and the heartache that they've caused. It's more than just the four banks. 


My obligation is to the everyday people of this country and to ensure we start paying down the mounting debt. One Nation supported tax cuts up to a $50 million turnover. That's a cost to the budget of $35 million. We supported the personal tax cuts; that's another $144 billion. You want to pass these further corporate tax cuts; that's a further $45 billion. And you're talking about in eight years time. How do we know the state of this economy in eight years time? How do we know if this country will be able to afford it? How do we know who's going to be holding the chequebook—because I don't trust any one of you. I've seen it. Under Labor, when it changed over to the coalition, the country was in debt by about $270 billion. Now we're reaching nearly $600 billion. There has to be a debt ceiling put on, because someone has to curtail your spending. No-one's talking about future generations and how we're paying down this debt.


You talk about how it's going to create jobs. I'll tell you the only way you will create jobs in this country and get a better, higher wage increase: please work with your state counterparts and investigate reducing payroll tax, which is a bigger impost on business across the nation. That will—it will—stimulate jobs in this country. That's why I say to you that you can't guarantee corporate tax cuts are going to create employment and bring higher wages. For a lot of these businesses, what I hear all the time is that the biggest problem in this whole country is payroll tax. I know it's not a federal issue; it is a state issue. You have to work with the states to compensate them for slowly reducing the payroll tax, which will increase employment. Why would these businesses put more money into their companies and businesses through a corporate tax cut when they know that, if you create more employment and higher wages, that's going to put them over the threshold and they're going to be paying more in payroll tax? It needs to stop. Address your free trade agreements and stop these companies bringing in their workers from overseas—and that is actually happening. Ensure that we as a nation can afford this. You haven't proven that to me. 


I'm worried about the future generations and the debt we are going to leave them. You can sit there and promise me all these things, but with all the deals that you may have done in this chamber with the other senators, there is no guarantee of who's going to be the Prime Minister of this country next week—whether or not it's going to be Malcolm Turnbull. If we go to an early election, are these deals going to be secure? They possibly won't be. So, I want to know that the future of this nation is in good hands. I don't feel that it is.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance, Special Minister of State and Vice-President of the Executive Council) (19:10):  There are a few things that I need to address before we rise tonight. Firstly, in relation to the amendment we are discussing, to carve out the big four banks, I can confirm that the official minute was circulated today. But of course I did raise it in one of the many very good and constructive discussions Senator Hanson and I have had over the months. I did raise that with Senator Hanson last week. In relation to the oil and gas industry in Australia, it is a relatively less mature industry compared with Qatar's. Qatar has had massive investment, generating massive production of oil and gas, for decades and decades. We had the most significant investment. The oil and gas investment out of Gorgon, Wheatstone and Pluto is very recent. These are highly capital-intensive projects. Not only did the significant capital investment of well in excess of $100 billion lead to massive increases in construction jobs and massive increases in economic prosperity for Australia but they will do so into the future. As Senator Hanson knows—and we had consensus in relation to this earlier in the year—we were absolutely prepared to pursue sensible reforms to the petroleum resource rent tax arrangements, and we will still pursue those sensible reforms to the petroleum resource rent tax arrangements. But we of course explored in good faith with the Senate crossbench the opportunity to land a consensus around a lower, globally more competitive business tax rate that is manifestly in the national interest.


Senator Hanson asked us to convince her that we can afford those. Well, the figures are there in the budget for all to see. I mean, our performance against the budget for the last two years now has been better than what had been estimated when the budget was delivered. If you look at the trajectory over the medium term in terms of our budget forecasts and projections, we had forecast to return to balance in 2019-20 and to remain in surplus over the medium term to exceed a surplus of one per cent as a share of GDP by 2026-27, which is when the Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan to reduce corporate tax to 25 per cent is designed to come into full effect. In fact, the reason we are not reducing corporate taxes for all businesses immediately is that we wanted to do it in a way that was fiscally affordable. We wanted to get the budget back into surplus as soon as possible while also making sure that businesses in Australia have the advantage and the benefit of a globally competitive business tax rate. Providing the signal to the bigger businesses with bigger turnovers that over the next few years the corporate tax rate for them would progressively come down to 25 per cent would provide them with the incentive to make investment decisions now in the knowledge that they will have an improved after-tax return on their investment.


It has always been thus. If you want to attract more investment, one of the key considerations is your tax policy settings. Countries around the world are not lowering their corporate tax rate out of fun; they're doing it because they're making a judgement that it is in the best interests of their economy, of families, of jobs created by businesses in their respective economies.


There is no question that the day will come when Australia will have to do this. Sadly, it looks as if we might not be able to get there on this occasion. If the Senate decides to vote this down today, it will become obvious in the years to come that it was a decision that exposed Australia to economic harm, that put us in a weaker position, that cost jobs and that put wage increases at risk. The day will come when, given what happens in the rest of the world in terms of business tax policy settings, this parliament will have to revisit this question—no question.


Senator Hanson talks about free trade agreements. That is something that used to have bipartisan consensus, I have to say. It was under the Hawke and Keating governments that Australia decided to open up the Australian economy to global competition, to position the Australian economy to be globally focused, because there was an appreciation and an understanding that there was so much opportunity for Australian businesses to sell Australian products and services around the world. You don't become rich by selling to yourself; you become rich and wealthy by selling your products and services to the massive global market.


Of course, on the flipside, for consumers, opening up our economy has delivered massive benefits to consumers, because it means that we can get the best products and services from other parts of the world at competitive prices. Prices in Australia would be higher, the quality of products and services would be lower, and there would be fewer jobs in Australia today if we had not opened up the Australian economy to the world, if we hadn't decided to become a genuinely globally focused open-trading economy. Becoming a genuinely globally focused open-trading economy has unquestionably lifted living standards across Australia. A commitment to open markets and free trade has lifted living standards around the world.


We have to accept that the world around us is as it is. We don't have a choice about the fact that businesses in other countries want to take business away from us. They want to sell more of their products and services to markets around the world at our expense. And, if they're more successful in selling more products and services that they have produced around the world, we will sell less. If the capital investment that could have come to Australia goes to Brazil, the US, Canada, New Zealand or France and doesn't come here then it will create jobs in those economies, in those countries. Over time, if we stay on that trajectory and don't adjust the trajectory to get ourselves into a more competitive position again, it will be working families across Australia who will pay the price. And the first people to pay the price will be low-income earners. People trying to get into the job market will be the first to pay the price, because they'll find it harder to get a job. People who are part of the casual workforce, who work part-time and want to have additional hours, will find it harder because those are the jobs that disappear first. As businesses have to shrink because the government's policy settings are making it harder for them to be successful, as bigger businesses have to cut costs because they are selling fewer of their products and services and attracting less investment, the first people who lose their jobs are those—




Senator Cameron:
  Malcolm Turnbull is going to lose his job.




Senator CORMANN:
  I know that for Senator Cameron this is all just one big joke. You know what? I actually care about this. I don't think anyone in this chamber—we might have disagreements; we might have a different perspective—can say that I'm prosecuting an argument that I don't believe in. I passionately believe that this is something we need to do to protect jobs, to create opportunity, for people to get ahead.




Senator Cameron:
  Oh, rubbish!




Senator CORMANN:
  You can say that's rubbish, but let me tell you, I have seen what socialist agendas lead to. I've seen what equality-of-outcome type income distribution and wealth distribution policies lead to, and let me tell you: they lead to poverty. They make everyone poorer. That is not a path that any of us should want for the Australian people. We should want a path where the Australian people can have opportunities to be the best they can be, and part of that is making sure that the businesses that employ them have the best possible opportunities to be successful into the future. In the end, this is going to be voted on tomorrow, and I'd like each senator to think about this overnight and make a decision that is in our national interest.

Senator BROCKMAN
 (Western Australia) (19:20):  I rise tonight to speak briefly on a couple of very important issues for my home state of Western Australia, in particular the live export trade and the recent events in the United States that may potentially impact on the use of the weedkiller glyphosate. Firstly, I will go very briefly to the live sheep trade.


The live sheep trade is a critical industry for Western Australia, and it is absolutely imperative that we reject the radical and uninformed activists in their push to jeopardise the livelihoods of thousands of hardworking Western Australians and Australians by ending that trade. The live export trade is worth more than $1.4 billion to the Western Australian economy every year. The events on the Awassi Express that we've all seen many times were truly dreadful, but they were also the exception, not the rule. There have been many myths and untruths peddled about the trade. As someone who has been involved in agriculture for a significant part of my life and whose family has sold many thousands of sheep for export, I think it is important that I take the opportunity to address some of these fictions.


The first myth I'd like to address is that we can simply replace the live trade with chilled meat. This simply will not take place. We saw previously, during an episode involving Bahrain, the disruption and damage done to our export trade relationships when live export was ended; the void simply was not filled by Australian chilled meat. We may help our competitors elsewhere, but we certainly will not help ourselves.


Myth No. 2 is that banning the sheep trade will improve animal welfare. I think this is a complete myth, because when we export the animals—be it our sheep or our cattle—we also export Australian standards of animal welfare. That has meant that, elsewhere in the world, for every one Australian animal that is slaughtered in an Australian registered and accredited facility, some three or four animals from elsewhere in the world are also killed to Australian standards in those facilities. That is the direct export of our animal welfare standards through the Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System. Banning the Australian trade will not result in a reduction in the number of live sheep being transported to the Middle East. They'll just come from elsewhere. They'll potentially come from a lot further away, from countries with significantly lower standards of animal welfare than Australia.


The final point I would like to address is the question of whether mass mortality events are very frequent. Heat stress events like those on the Awassi Express are not a frequent occurrence. Between 2010 and 2017, the annual mortality rate was between 0.62 and 0.89, with an average of 0.76. Over this time, in excess of 17 million sheep were exported from Australia, the vast majority of these, some 85 per cent, from Western Australia. There may be some opposite who point to this rate as relatively high, but the reality of farming is that you'll get a death rate in paddocks of a significant amount over the same period of time. These rates have been trending down over time and are actually a positive reflection of the interest the industry has taken in animal welfare standards.


Very briefly, I just want to talk about the situation with glyphosate. We've recently seen a court case in the US where a significant award was made on the basis of a link between glyphosate and a particular cancer. We must remember that the US court system is not making that determination based on scientific evidence. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that glyphosate based weed control products are safe for use on crops. In fact, there are more than 800 scientific studies supporting this proposition. Those calling for a ban on glyphosate are doing so from a political position, not a position of science. And it's exceedingly important that in Australia we always have decisions on the use of chemicals and the regulation of chemicals made by independent scientific organisations based on independent scientific advice.
