Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:39):  I would like to say a few words about this Orwellian titled bill. The Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 is part of a growing tradition within this parliament to see legislation presented in the most partisan and most cynical of ways so that you get a highly politically charged description of a bill rather than its title going to the content of the bill. 


What we see is the government calling upon this chamber to adjust its deteriorating budget position—a position that the Labor Party acknowledges, but you would not get any sense of that from the discussion of the government. I recall just before the last election the proposition that the current government could fix the deficit; they could reduce the debt. They gave no recognition whatsoever throughout the term of the previous Labor government of the deteriorating revenue position of the Commonwealth. Those positions have now come back to haunt the government itself. 


Let me again put the facts on the record. This government has actually doubled the budget deficit in just 12 months, after promising to fix it. This was their biggest election promise, but like all their election promises it is a promise that has just evaporated. The Treasurer, Mr Hockey, has doubled the budget deficit in one year from $17.1 billion to $35 billion in 2015-16. Over the four-year period from 2013-14 to 2016-17, Mr Hockey has presided over a cumulative deterioration of some $96 billion in the deficit compared to the figures he inherited from Labor. We can see these figures quite clearly set out in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook—a position that was made independently of the previous government and a position made very clear by the Public Service in the run-up to the last election. This change, the subject of this bill, was already factored into the forward estimates, and so if the bill does not pass by 30 June the consequence will be a further blow-out in the budget deficit, which is, as I say, already at $35 billion. 


We have a government which, having abandoned all of those election promises, went through and produced a budget in its first year, which, of course, went down like a lead balloon. The government's political position has deteriorated so badly that it has now even abandoned that proposition in its public rhetoric. It has abandoned the rhetoric around fiscal rectitude in a desperate pursuit to rebuild its electoral fortunes and it is now in the process of preparing itself for an early election. But the reality is simple: the budget is built on a house of cards. The projected budget surplus is built on a change in the accounting rules that allows for the earnings of the Future Fund to be recorded and calculated in the deficit—not through any responsible measures. As we know, Mr Hockey's number are underpinned by unfair measures, which will never pass the Senate. We have seen this chamber on several occasions now reject measures which are fundamentally unfair and offer nothing in the way of rebuilding the prosperity of this nation. 


When we talk of a house of cards, we need look no further than the proposals that the government is seeking to pursue in higher education. Not content with its unfair and unnecessary plans for the $100,000 degrees, which have been voted down twice by this chamber, the government continues to maintain its quixotic crusade. Embedded—in fact, hidden—in this year's budget, is the 20 per cent cut in university funding. There are cuts to the training of our research students. There are cuts to the funding to address student equity. There are $5.4 billion worth of cuts to universities, to students and to research. 


These are cuts that the government cannot deliver but underlie the assumptions within this budget. So we have these phantom arrangements that the government seeks to pursue. The cuts that have been included in this budget are of course aimed at bodging up the figures to make them look better than they are. It is truly a fantasy budget—a fantastical dream in the imagination of Senator Cormann and his partners in crime, the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and of course the hapless fixer, the minister for education. But the Australian people understand that, if these measures ever were implemented, the enormous costs that they would have to this nation's future.


The stated purpose of this bill—and this is the really interesting point; we do not find this in the title. This is not an amendment bill; in effect, what it is is a proposition that in reality is nothing more than an attempt to change the Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates Amendments) Act 2011 and the Clean Energy (Tax Laws Amendments) Act 2011 so that both acts have their future operative provisions repealed. You would have thought that would be the appropriate way to actually to present these bills as amendments to those measures.


Both acts have provisions already in operation, and these would not be repealed. As such, the bill would repeal an increase in the nominal tax threshold from $18,200 in 2014 to $19,400 in 2015-16. They maintain the second personal marginal tax rate at 32.5 per cent rather than increase it to 33 per cent from 2015-16. They maintain the maximum value of the low-income tax offset at $445 rather than change the maximum value of the offset to $300 million in 2015-16 and they seek to maintain the threshold below which a person may receive the offset at a taxable income of $66,667 and the withdrawal rate at 1.5 per cent rather than the income threshold increasing to $67,000 and the withdrawal rate falling to one per cent from 2015-16.


Of course in these circumstances these were perfectly fair measures introduced at the time in which, as a package of measures, we proceeded in government to ensure that there was fairness about the climate change polices that we were pursuing. So we are now faced with this difficult position and, as a result, if the legislation does not pass by June, these measures of course will further undermine the fiscal position of the Commonwealth.


The shadow Treasurer said in the other place that the opposition has reflected on these matters and the circumstances of the mismanagement of the budget placed upon this Commonwealth. Ultimately, we have resolved to support the bill. 


The opposition notes that the tax-free threshold trebled from $6,000 to $18,200 during our time in office. The change that this bill will repeal, while it would have been welcome, would have been a smaller percentage of the increase increasing the amount to $19,400. But, despite the spin that the government has sought to put on this, this action is not something we would have done in office. These are not measures that the Labor Party would have pursued in office. The difficulty of the decision is that we have to pick our battles, and we are trying to the best that we can to ensure that people enjoy the support of this parliament who need it most. Our focus will always be on protecting the most vulnerable from this government just as we are the only party that is responsible enough to call out this government on the issue of the unsustainability of our superannuation system, which of course rewards for those who are most advantaged in this country, or making it clear about the need to change the taxation arrangements for multinational companies so that multinational corporations actually pay their fair share of tax. 


That is why we are opposing as well the government's latest rounds of cuts to the pension. I noticed overnight that the Greens have had their Meg Lees moment where they are seeking to adopt the position of the conservatives on the issues of the defence of the pensioners of this country. I look forward to seeing how that goes, because we know how this story ended for another great party, the Democrats. We understood the consequence when the Democrats went down this road of accommodating the reactionary forces in this country. And of course we saw the circumstances whereby, in time, the Democrats were obliterated. So, we are going to see the great party of protest, the great party that wants to express its views about the need to fundamentally transform this country, lining up with the reactionaries to defend this government's attack on the most vulnerable in our country, the pensioners. I look forward to seeing how the latter-day Meg Leeses get on in this circumstance!


This government, unfortunately, has sought to attempt to rewrite history. This is a government that made a number of commitments prior to the last election, all of which have been broken. This is a government that played big on the rhetoric of deficit and debt, all of which have been demonstrated to be hollow. This is a government that we now see wants to present to this parliament measures that of course would continue the great inequalities of this country—in fact, make it much worse—by the pursuit of a tax upon the most vulnerable. This is a government that wants to undermine our universal health system, wants to undermine our highly effective pension system. This is a government that wants to smash equity in higher education. And this is a government that of course is now desperate to present itself as something other than it really is.


We have suggested that there needs to be an alternative approach, and that is what the Labor Party will argue strongly for and defend vigorously in the run-up to the next election—which I say, on all the science, is not that far away. The opposition has outlined alternative measures that can be taken to secure the fiscal position of this country while maintaining fairness and social justice. The Labor Party has a very, very different view about ensuring that we have a country in which prosperity is genuinely shared throughout the community and in which we can ensure that our industries are innovative and modern and able to provide the employment opportunities so that everybody in this country has the right to expect the living standards that a country like ours can afford.


We have to make sure that this is about building priorities into the budget process that defend the fundamental democratic values, and I am afraid you will not find that on the opposition benches. Unfortunately, I now see that the Greens are falling for the old line about how responsible they are, how thoroughly respectable they are, how desperate they are to actually appease those on the other side. I look forward with interest to how that unfolds.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-06-17,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:52):  I rise to oppose the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014. Under the law of the land, the tax office will start taking slightly less of your income in a fortnight's time. This is good news, but the coalition and Labor cannot stand it. So today the coalition and Labor will combine to pass a bill that cancels the slight reduction in income tax scheduled for July—a reduction I was responsible for retaining in my first week in the Senate last July. This bill proves that the coalition and Labor are a unity ticket. If you want big taxes to fund a government that can spend your income better than you can, vote for either of them. They will give you want you want.


The tax cut we are talking about is not huge. If you earn $66,000, the tax office currently takes away around $14,300. Next year, with no change, they would take away around $14,220. So, around $80 less would be taken from you. The coalition and Labor believe they can spend that $80 better than you can. In fact, as this bill gets waved through the Senate, they will say that they cannot afford to give you the $80—as if the $80 is theirs.


The mindset of the coalition and Labor is that of someone who believes that all your income is owned by the government, and you get to keep some of it only because of government generosity or absentmindedness. This mindset leads to tax increases being called budget savings. We would not put up with this abuse of language anywhere else. If a business claims that it is making savings, that means it is spending less; it does not mean that it is jacking up prices. This mindset also leads some in the coalition and Labor to treat tax deductions, offsets and exemptions as a government handout, to be withdrawn when the going gets tough. In reality, tax deductions, offsets and exemptions just represent instances where the tax office is taking less money than some imagined tax take. The approach of some in the coalition and Labor is akin to a pickpocket skimming your wallet of notes and then expecting gratitude because this time they left the coins behind.


Yes, governments need to spend money and raise taxes, but our governments are spending more money and raising more taxes than ever in Australia's history. Fifty years ago, taxes were around $5,000 per person after adjusting for inflation. This grew each decade, until now the tax burden is around $19,000 per person. Those bleating about crashing revenues are on another planet. Their complaint, in essence, is that taxes ought to grow even faster. There is no justification for the ever-expanding tax burden. Living standards for all groups of people have risen over the last 50 years, which means the need for government welfare services has declined, and we have not uncovered new forms of effective government intervention either. To the contrary, the prosperity-promoting effects of free markets and the many failings of government involvement have been demonstrated time and time again.


Yes, governments need to spend money and raise taxes, but our taxes are high even by the standards of the stagnant economies that make up the OECD. The average tax burden in the OECD is 30 per cent of GDP. This average accounts for the different populations of OECD countries, as well as the social security contributions in many OECD countries that serve a similar purpose to Australia's compulsory superannuation guarantee payments. In contrast, Australia's tax burden, after including Australia's compulsory superannuation guarantee payments, is 31 per cent of GDP. Having a higher tax burden than the OECD average is extremely concerning, particularly as the OECD average is high compared to prosperous and dynamic non-OECD countries like Singapore.


Yes, governments need to spend money and raise taxes, but every tax expert knows that income tax is the most damaging tax on the Commonwealth government's books. It discourages working, saving, starting a business and taking risks. At times, this coalition government has raised concerns about bracket creep imposing ever higher income tax burdens on middle Australia, but we have experienced considerable bracket creep since the last time there were income tax cuts, and, when a scheduled income tax cut comes along that would return just a fraction of this bracket creep, the coalition government nips it in the bud. For the coalition, this is akin to the cry of St Augustine: 'Lord, give me chastity and continence, but not yet.'


The Liberal Democrats have a comprehensive plan to significantly reduce government spending and an unshakable conviction that your income is yours, not the government's. That is why I am defending the $80 tax cut that is due to each Australian taxpayer in a fortnight's time. But, sadly, the conspiracy of the big government forces of the coalition and Labor will cancel this tax cut through the bill before us today. When the date of the election comes, the taxpayers of Australia will remember.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-06-17,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:59):  We have been told in the last 18 months by this government that we have a budget crisis in Australia. If there is a budget crisis in this country, it is not an expenditure crisis, it is not an entitlement crisis; it is a revenue crisis. My party, very proudly, played a significant role in the clean energy package and a price on carbon. That price on carbon over the forward estimates under a costing by the Parliamentary Budget Office would deliver $18 billion in revenue to this country.


With the ruthless and cynical campaign by this government going into the last election about axing the mining tax and the carbon tax, what they did not tell you was that they were axing billions of dollars in revenue that could be used in our economy. It could be reallocated towards transformative behaviour to move the Australian economy and to diversify the Australian economy in areas of renewable energy, science, technology and innovation, diversifying the risks of being reliant on a mining economy and creating new, clean, green and clever jobs across this country. That revenue could be used for a whole range of important things in this country like giving a tax break to low-income earners. That is exactly what we did. With the mining tax we reallocated money towards the small business sector—$5.4 billion to be precise—which, incidentally, was ripped up by the Liberal government at the last budget. It was replaced in this new budget—rather cynically as a new measure—but most of the measures were similar.


A budget, to be balanced, needs revenue and, of course, we have expenditures on the other side. A focus on cost saving that attacks the most vulnerable in our society was never going to get through the Senate because we understand that we need to make brave decisions around tax reform to raise revenue in this country. Governments play a number of critical roles in our society, and we do have some differences of philosophy in this place as to what the role of government should be. My party believes that one of the key roles is levying a fair and equitable tax system, a tax system that is progressive and that, as much as it possibly can, puts equity and equality right up there with efficiencies. Some of the money from that carbon price that was going to be collected from some of the dirtiest polluters on the planet—those who are creating the emissions and the gases that lead to global warming and the devastating effects that that is forecast to have in terms of its impact on a whole range of not just the economy but ecosystems around the planet—was going to be used to support a tax break for the poorest and most vulnerable in this country.


It is very disappointing to see the Labor Party, in 24 hours, turn their back not once but twice on low-income earners in this country. These are supposedly the bread-and-butter supporters of and voters for the Labor Party. Senator Carr talks about our support of the government's measures to bring in a more progressive system on pension payments to help low-income people get more money on the full pension. That is a progressive tax policy. When the Howard government changed it in 2007, the Greens took a very strong stance opposing that because it was not a progressive tax policy. We wanted to help low-income earners in this country, and it is exactly the same situation today. If we abolish this break for low-income earners, it is just going to put more pressure on the poor and vulnerable in our society who actually need the assistance the most. Giving them a leg up and helping them where we can not only takes pressure off other roles of government—the provision of emergency services and other services such as health care and education—but also helps our economy and also helps the circular flow of income. It helps the circular flow of income. So there are all sorts of secondary effects that are really important.


My party is proud to stand in here today and say that we oppose taking away tax breaks for the poorest Australians. Senator Carr said that these decisions are difficult when you are in opposition—if they were in government, they would not do it. I have heard the same thing said about supporting dangerous ISDS clauses—giving corporations the right to sue governments in free trade deals. That is a total cop-out. If you do not stand for something, Senator Carr, you will fall for anything. You need to make a strong statement in this chamber, to those people listening, that you support low-income earners in this country. My party does. We support a progressive tax system that levies money right across the economy from different categories of income, and that is what our society should be based on—the fair and equitable distribution of taxes and incentives.


How many times was this explained by our Prime Minister in the lead-up to the last election and how many times has it been explained by Senator Cormann? In the three short years I have been in the Senate I have heard him talk about axing the tax, getting rid of the job-destroying carbon tax and the mining tax. How many times has this government ever been honest and said that they were revenue raising measures and that revenue was necessary—necessary to balance budgets, necessary to provide a fair and equitable society. It is easy to come in here and cut spending, especially for the most vulnerable in our society. It is a lot more difficult to make brave decisions to support a progressive taxation system, to support a progressive pension system, to tax the bads, the pollutions. When I was at university I remember the rules being pretty simple in any economics textbook—a government should tax the bads, like pollution and health risks like sugar and tobacco; they should levy taxes so our common pool resources, like our mineral wealth, are equally shared amongst those who own them—the Australian voters, Australian taxpayers; and, just as importantly, where possible they should reduce taxes on work and effort. 


My party has supported taking a tax off small business to allow them to get a leg up, but we want to see a progressive taxation system in this country. We want to see the bads taxed. We want to see a really simple, sensible, rational, logical price on carbon, and we want to see that money reallocated in the economy to where it is needed the most. If the government come in here and remove this tax break for low-income earners, I want them to explain why they were too gutless to do this when they removed the carbon price last year. I did not hear any of you in here telling low-income Australians that they were going to lose their tax break when you removed the carbon price. In fact, I remember you saying exactly the opposite—that they would get to keep their tax breaks. Now you are taking them away. These are the people who need a leg up, and I am deeply disappointed that the Labor Party are taking the weak decision of saying they would not do this if they were in government but they are going to have to do it in opposition. Low-income Australians want to see someone standing up for them in parliament. I think most Australians support a progressive taxation system, and the Greens will not be supporting this measure in the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-06-17,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:09):  I thought for a moment the Greens under their new leadership might be starting to show some economic sense and rationality. Indeed, today's headlines in the newspaper seem to suggest that they are not just going to take the 'we are against anything the Liberal Party wants to do' approach, which has been the approach of the Greens political party, particularly under their former leadership. And I thought, 'Gee, there's a glimmer of hope!' I am not sure that that was real good for the Liberal Party, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, because if the Greens start looking like they are a sensible, mature political party then perhaps they will take a couple of votes off us! I think they know they will take a lot more off the Labor Party, as they have been doing. But that glimmer of hope and rationality that I thought might be around has just been dissipated by the previous speaker.


I do not know which university he went to, but they must have been teaching him some funny economics there. I might say, Senator Whish-Wilson, that I did not go to a university; I could not afford that. I started work as an articled clerk and did my university qualifications externally, at night-time after working all day. So I did not get the privilege of popping into an economics class run by what sounds to have been a very left-wing group of tutors and lecturers. I am just not sure where it comes from. But I always thought it was the Greens political party's approach that we did not tax people enough in Australia—that there had been too many cuts. Again, it is a bit difficult to find out where the Greens are, economically.


As for the Labor Party, I am delighted that they are, at last, going to support a measure which they did actually introduce, Senator Whish-Wilson. I am not here to defend the Labor Party, I can tell you that! But you wrongly accused them. The Labor Party did do something about this when they were in government. They actually made a commitment to the Australian people before the election that they would do exactly what this bill does now. So, far from berating the Labor Party, you should at least be giving them credit for actually carrying out the promise they made before the last election. We know that Labor Party promises before elections are not particularly reliable. We all remember, prior to the 2010 election, the commitment: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' We all remember that commitment on the eve of the election. But then, having watched the last couple of episodes of TheKilling Season, one can never quite understand the personalities, the bitternesses and the hatreds in the Labor Party which seem to be their modus operandi. That is what seems to direct policy decisions in the Labor Party.



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Order! Order, colleagues. Senator Macdonald, resume—through the chair, if you would, please.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Carr, shout all you like, but I have actually taped the first two episodes and I can send them to you, if you want just a bit of a reminder about the part you and most of your friends on the front bench played in the atrocious disloyalty and dishonesty that has been so clearly exposed in those two episodes of The Killing Season about the Labor Party and how it operates.


And, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, why would you expect better from the Labor Party? I just have to divert a fraction and mention that I read an article in the Hobart Mercury the other day from a dear old friend of mine, former Senator Margaret Reynolds. She was a Labor senator based in Townsville when I first entered the Senate. And I liked Margaret; I was disappointed when she left the north and went down to Tasmania. But she wrote this article for the Hobart Mercury berating the major political parties for the way they select Senate candidates. I was obliged to reply to the Hobart Mercury—I suspect they did not print it, but I did reply—and I said, 'My old friend Margaret Reynolds was clearly talking about the Labor Party, not the Liberal or National parties,' because, as I pointed out, there is a difference. We have just been through a preselection for a senator in Queensland, and we were very fortunate in having Senator Jo Lindgren elected. But I have to tell you: Senator Lindgren was not selected on a 'captain's pick' or by a couple of union cabals getting together and determining who they would put into the position; Senator Lindgren actually faced over 300 ordinary Australians who make up the selection process of the LNP in Queensland, and she contested against eight other candidates all of whom were people of quality. And Senator Lindgren, through her own abilities, and through the presentation she made, was selected. So I said to Margaret Reynolds, 'You might be talking about the Labor Party, where the Northern Territory branch of the Labor Party preselects a sitting senator and Julia Gillard comes in over the top and says: ""Forget about the Labor Party; forget about the ordinary people who select this in the Northern Territory; I want that person.""' So the difference could not be more stark. That is why I say you would not know where the Labor Party is coming from.


I might mention, as to my own last preselection, that I had been a sitting senator for some time, but there were actually 15 people opposing me. We had a preselection panel of over 450 people. I am delighted to say that I won on the first ballot, and I thank the LNP for that; I am always grateful to them for that. But that shows the stark difference between how the Liberal and National parties make economic decisions—make any decisions—and how the Labor Party does.


I will get back to the bill—just in case there is anyone listening to this and they might be interested in what this bill, the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014, is all about. The Labor Party introduced a carbon tax. They knew it would put up the cost of living of ordinary Australians. So, in an attempt to in some way ameliorate that bad policy decision of the carbon tax, they did say: 'We will give carbon tax related personal income tax cuts, just to compensate for the increased cost of living'—which they knew would happen with the carbon tax. They based that on a floating price for the carbon tax of $29 per tonne. Originally, when the carbon tax came in, the price was at $25.4 per tonne. It was going to float up to $29. And so the Labor Party said, 'We'll introduce these tax cuts to compensate.' But, lo and behold, the Labor Party suddenly realised how corrupt the market was for carbon tax permits, and they realised that their floating price estimate of $29 a tonne was not going to really achieve more than about $12 a tonne—less than half of what was originally expected. So the Labor Party, in a flash of economic responsibility, said: 'Well, the price is not going to go up quite as much as we thought; therefore, those personal income tax cuts that we were going to give won't now be necessary. So, as a budget repair measure, we're going to cancel them.' So, Senator Whish-Wilson, the Labor Party actually acknowledged that and said it was a tax that did not have the same substantive underlying reason as it originally did. So the Labor Party announced that they were going to get rid of these cuts.


Having promised that before the last election, they did a typical Labor-Greens thing: promise something before the election, and after the election come in and do the exact opposite. Twice the coalition has attempted to introduce Labor's removal of their promised income tax cuts. We have tried twice already in this parliament to allow the Labor Party to honour their commitment. Twice we have failed. But I am pleased to say—and all credit where credit is due—that the Labor Party are now, fortuitously, and sensibly, I might say, going to support this government measure, which is purely and simply the proposal that the Labor Party put before the last election.


The coalition made a commitment before the last election, and that commitment was broad; it was clear; it was sensible; it was direct. Nobody—no Australian voter—could have misunderstood what the coalition's principal election promise was before the last election. It was: to fix the budget. We all know that when the Labor Party came into power they had a credit, $60 billion, in the 'piggy bank'. The $60 billion was there for the incoming Labor government because of the good work of Peter Costello and John Howard in the Howard government over many years. The Howard government had paid off previous Labor governments' debts and, more than that, they had put some money away for a rainy day. There were $60 billion sitting there waiting for the new Labor government.


It took the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government only a few months to blow that $60 billion and run up a debt which, if it had not been addressed, would have got up to around $700 billion. Senator Whish-Wilson is happy about that, I guess. He must be, because the Greens political party supported the Gillard and Rudd governments every time they took measures that would blow that out to $700 billion. Senator Cormann might help me here. That means we are currently paying—how much a day in interest, Senator Cormann?




Senator Cormann:
  Way too much: $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion a month.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Australian taxpayers are paying $1.3 billion a month to overseas lenders. They are paying $1.3 billion a month on Labor's debt runner—from $60 billion in credit to approaching $700 billion in deficit and already costing the Australian taxpayers over $1 billion a month in interest on those payments.


The promise the coalition made before the last election was to prepare the budget, and everybody knew that. Everybody was concerned about the unsustainable nature of Labor's borrowings and reckless spending. That is why they voted for the Abbott government and—in spite of continuous opposition by the Labor Party—the Abbott government has already started to turn around that approach to $700 billion in debt that the Labor Party left us.


Our government has not been perfect. I had some concerns about the 2014 budget, which I thought did not quite meet our targets or the aspirations and understanding of the Australian voter. I am pleased to say this is a government that is not too proud to say, 'Perhaps we didn't get it right, then,' and it has done something about fixing it. That never happens with the Labor Party—until today. Today the Labor Party have decided that (a) they will, at least, keep this promise, (b) they will do what they said they would do and understand should be done, and (c) in this small measure, the Labor Party will appreciate that the current government has a huge job to do in repairing the budget balance run up by Labor.


Senator Whish-Wilson: do not be surprised. The Labor Party are not catching you out. They are doing exactly what they said they would do. They have since voted against it, twice, but credit where credit is due. Now they are agreeing with that. In this small way, the coalition will be able to continue on its path of repairing the budget measures that Labor created for this country.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-06-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania) (10:24):  I rise today to speak on this Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014. What an interesting situation. We have so much talk about tax reform—when what we are actually talking about is a tax grab. Tax reform suggests you might seriously consider how you are raising taxes in this country and for what purposes you are raising them and whether that needs to change in the 21st century. But no—tax reform is simply a word for 'How can we get a bigger tax grab from the Australian people?'


The first question you need to be asking if you are serious about tax reform is: where do you raise the money to spend on a public purpose and, in raising that money, how are you trying to shift the economy and the society to respond to the overwhelming challenges of the time? The overwhelming challenge of this century is global warming, the resource extraction of a planet going to nine billion people, where resource extraction is completely unsustainable. At the same time we have overwhelming wealth and income inequality. 


If you are looking at the two megatrends, one is global warming, unsustainable and non-renewable resource use around the planet and destruction of ecosystems and, at the same time a widening gap between the rich and poor, then genuine tax reform would look at tax and the bads—that is, the extraction and unsustainable use of resources that are destroying ecosystems, destroying the atmosphere, turning the oceans acid and, at the same time, reducing the gap as much as you can, with structural change to make sure that you reduce income and wealth inequality. That is what genuine tax reform would do. That is why I was extremely proud of the fact that the regime we brought in to address global warming in this country was genuine tax reform. It was the first major tax reform in decades because it said, 'We need to bring down greenhouse gas emissions in this country so we are going to put a price on pollution because the earth cannot sustain the level of waste being put into atmosphere and oceans from the burning of fossil fuels. So we will tax that pollution. We will charge for that pollution. In taxing the bad, we will use that to relieve the tax burden on the poorest and the least able in our democracy.' Is that not genuine tax reform addressing those two megatrends in this century? Of course it is. 


What we did was to say, 'Let us make sure that from those who are making the mega profits, we socialise the costs of their work, to pay for that cost.' We said that those people who are burning fossil fuels will pay for it through a carbon price. We introduced the carbon price and at the same time we said that low-income earners should get a break. So we trebled the tax-free fresh threshold. Before, once you earned $6,000 in Australia, you started to pay tax. After the carbon price it went up to $18,200. So it meant an incredible amount to a large number of people. To give an example, it gave tax relief of $300 a year to anyone earning up to $65,000 a year or $600 for people earning $20,000 a year. When you talk about people working part-time—students, low-income earners—it gave them a substantial tax break and, at the same time, it said to BHP and to the Rios of this world, 'You can stop paying for the cost of the extreme weather events that you are imposing on the rest of the community.' 


Not only did they run a mega campaign against the mining tax and the carbon price but at the very same time as they were out there running their ad campaign on the Australian community saying, 'What jolly good fellows are we, the mining industry!' they had set up marketing hubs in Singapore to avoid their tax. The biggest tax avoiders in the country were the people saying, 'We shouldn't have to pay a carbon price, we shouldn't have to pay a mining tax.'   They were setting up their hub in Singapore, sending billions offshore and paying multimillions to their chief executives who were laughing all the way to the bank as they laughed at the Liberal government that was prepared to give them even more tax relief than they deserved. Now who is going to pay the price of global warming? Who is going to pay for the damage to the infrastructure around Australia from extreme weather events? It is the community, who have to pay through the tax take. Now what we have is a government that is moving to shift the tax burden once again away from the Gina Rineharts of this world and away from the Rios and the BHPs, and onto the lowest income earners in the country. 


As my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson said a moment ago, these are really dishonest activities of a government. If the government was honest when they came into power and moved to abolish the carbon price, they should have, at the same time, said to the Australian people: 'Look, we were taking billions of dollars from the big polluters, and we were recycling it through to you, the people. Now that we have decided not to charge those companies those billions of dollars, we are going to take the tax breaks that you had away from you. We are going to reduce the tax-free threshold back down to $6,000, and you will all start paying the tax again.' But they did not. What they said was, 'We will forgo the revenue from the carbon price, and we will maintain those compensation measures'. Anyone with half a brain could see that that left a mega hole in the budget—$18 billion over the forward estimates. It is an $18 billion hole that Prime Minister Abbott decided he wanted. He wanted a big tax hole, and he wanted to add to that tax hole by abolishing the mining tax, which the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, at the time identified as worth around another $6 billion. 


It was an amazing effort by a Prime Minister to say: 'Rather than see the tax on the richest corporations and the biggest polluters in the country, we want to impose it on ordinary people. We want to do that.' That is exactly what the government did. In order to disguise that, they went out last year saying: 'We'll keep the compensation from the carbon price but, hey, you have to pay a Medicare co-payment, we are going to deregulate universities and charge students more, we are going to reduce pensions, and we are going to attack the poorest in this country in order to recoup the hole that we made when we decided to let the big polluters and the big miners off the hook.' That is the disaster that we are now inheriting here in Australia. 


What is very interesting is the title of this bill. It shows that—to the extent to which we have a government talk about failure of grown-up government—we now have what can only be described as student politics. We have a government that is introducing a bill called Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014. The reason that they have done that is, again, the cynicism of politics. In the agreement on the carbon price that the Greens signed with the Gillard government, this tax-free threshold increase was locked in to go up from $18,200 to $19,400. Once the ink was dry, what the Gillard government then did—sneakily, in my view—was defer that increase to $19,400. That is why the government have decided to call it Labor's budget savings measures. 


Interestingly, last year, when this very same proposition was put to the Senate at this time, Labor stood up in here and said that they would not stand for the tax-free threshold being wound back, or for the projected increase not going ahead. They would not stand for it last year, and this year they are standing for it. Why? Because 12 months has gone past, because they know that politics moves so fast that the community will not have put two and two together, and they will not have realised that what Labor are now doing is exactly the opposite of what they did last year. There is just no consistent philosophical view from either side of government—except, you can guarantee with the Liberals and the Abbott government that every time the word 'tax' is mentioned it means mega tax relief for the wealthiest and the richest in the country. You can guarantee that, when it comes to Labor Party on the issue, there is no consistent philosophical view. It is wherever is pragmatic at the day that they will do. That is why last year they voted against this proposition, and it is why this year they are going to support the government in voting for this proposition. 


I can tell you that, where the Greens are concerned, there is a consistent philosophical view which says very clearly that we should be raising money by taxing the 'bads', and we should be reducing the impact on low-income earners and on those people who are suffering the most in our community wherever we can. That is precisely what we need to be doing. This is not only in terms of the carbon price compensation; with the mining tax we see the government taking away the low-income superannuation investment of $500 a year to people earning less than $37,000. Of course, that is ultimately to go in the deal that the government made with Clive Palmer, Senator Lambie, Senator Lazarus and Senator Wang last year. They all voted to take away the low-income superannuation contribution in the mining tax. 


The mining tax abolition cost the Australian community $6.5 billion over the forward estimates. The miners are laughing all the way to bank, and low-income people are suffering from it. With their superannuation, the increase in super from nine per cent to 12 per cent was delayed out to 2025. We are already seeing that—every which way you look at it—the people in Australia who are the ones who have suffered the most are the ones who continue to suffer the most. The richest tax avoiders get away with it, and they get away with it time and time again. What should we be doing? What we should be doing is recognising that—as the International Energy Agency has done this week, and as every other country is now doing as it faces up to the challenge of global warming—we have to absolutely and rapidly change this economy to a low carbon/zero carbon economy. This is why the Greens have said clearly that we need net carbon zero by 2040, that we need to be out to an 80 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 and that we need to bring that down to 50 per cent at least by 2025 


Now, if we are going to do that—as the International Energy Agency says—we have to increase energy efficiency in industry, buildings, and transport; we have to reduce the use of the least efficient coal-fired power plants, and ban their construction; we have to increase investments in renewable energy technology; we have to phase out fossil fuel subsidies; and we have to reduce methane emissions in oil and gas production—and yet, every which way the Australian tax system is considered, we have a situation where this government has moved to destroy those initiatives which would bring down greenhouse gas emissions. That is the task that we should be addressing.


We should also be addressing the other overwhelming trend—that is, wealth accumulation by the very smallest group of people of Australia, and the increasing stress on the remainder of the population. Mr Acting Deputy President, I can tell you that there are an awful lot of people out there who are now sitting back but who did not realise at the time that the reason they had the tax-free threshold was because of the carbon price, and because of the fact that the big polluters were paying so that ordinary people could have a tax break. That was surely a very good idea. At the same time, we had the government out there at the time telling people that the cost of living would fall because the carbon price was going—that everybody would be $500 better off. Well, I am yet to find anyone who is $500 better off because the carbon price has gone. And that is because the main driver of electricity prices was not the carbon price, nor is it the Renewable Energy Target; the main driver of electricity price hikes is the network system. And is anyone interested in fixing that? Not in the government, that is for sure, and not in Labor either. There are very clear measures you could take in the National Electricity Market to address this, but neither Liberal nor Labor are interested in doing so—because the network system is a back-pocket tax. Talk about axing the tax! If you were serious about axing the tax, you would take on the electricity networks and the National Electricity Market in Australia.


The cost of living has not come down. Emissions are now going up. People are more anxious than ever about extreme weather events. The insurance industry is absolutely worried now about how they are going to cover the costs of insurance. And who is going to pay, Mr Acting Deputy President? If this government has its way, it will not be the big miners, it will not be the BHPs and the Rios, and it will not be the Gina Rineharts of this world who will pay, in order to deal with not only mitigation but also adaptation—it is not they who are going to contribute to reducing income and wealth inequality in this country; in fact, they want to drive wages and conditions even lower than they already are. It will be ordinary people who will pay.


So I stand again to say: if we want genuine tax reform in this country, this tax white paper had better address what it is that tax is meant to do. Where is it going to come from, and what is the rationale for why it would come from that sector of the community? And how is it going to be distributed in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the costs of global warming, and to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor? That is what we need to be doing with our tax system. I really am appalled: we had a situation where people in here were standing up and dancing when the carbon price was repealed, and now we have a situation where those very same people are going out and taking away the capacity for low-income earners to get an additional tax break—in order to facilitate the wealthiest people in this country becoming wealthier; that is, the big miners in particular. Those same people—and it was every one of the people in the Liberal Party, every one of the Nationals; everyone who was in the Palmer United Party at the time; all of the Independents—were all sitting there abolishing the carbon price. And now, in the face of a huge gap in the budget—deliberately created by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister— they are saying to low-income earners across Australia: 'we are not going to honour the increase in the tax-free threshold; we would much rather see the pockets of corporate Australia get fatter at the expense of ordinary people'.


That is why the Greens are going to stand here and oppose this legislation. We are going to stick with our commitment to Australians—that is, we are going to say that the big polluters should pay their way. We did not support an $18 billion hole in the budget over the forward estimates. We are going to remind Australians that they have not got the windfall gain that they thought they were going to get—because the Prime Minister misled them every step of the way on the impact of the cost of pollution. And now the Australian people are inheriting the cost of pollution. The extreme weather events are going to cost Australians with their lives as well as their livelihoods—while those people who have benefited from the abolition of the mining tax and the carbon price laugh; while they insulate themselves from the cost of pollution as they watch an overwhelming majority of people suffer.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-06-17,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (10:42):  I rise to briefly contribute to and oppose this proposed legislation before the Senate, the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014. The technical description of the bill's purpose is:


The purpose of the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 (the Bill) is to amend the Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates Amendments) Act 2011 and the Clean Energy (Tax Laws Amendments) Act 2011 so that both Acts have their future operative provisions repealed. Both Acts have provisions already in operation and these would not be repealed.


However, the simple explanation is this: if this bill passes, we will be taking money away from low-income earners—the Australian battlers—and I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, they are already battling. I am not going to be a part of that—no way. I am very disappointed with Labor; I cannot believe Labor is being a part of this. With everything that they stand for—the battler, the blue-collar worker—I just cannot believe that they are supporting this legislation. There are better ways to raise revenue and to address this issue of budget repair.


I have put forward a proposal for tax reform calling for the establishment of an FTT—a financial transactions tax. We could pass an FTT instead of agreeing to this legislation. We could actually do that. I launched a plan on how the Australian government could raise an extra $1.4 billion per annum—and that is a minimum—of revenue, and link it to aged Australians' and veterans' pensions by introducing a financial transactions tax. I am disappointed that neither the government nor the opposition have taken the time to properly consider and debate my plan—or speak to me—to protect and boost our pensions through a targeted financial transactions tax, which would only affect about half-a-dozen high-frequency share-trading companies in Australia. High-frequency share traders account for 30 per cent of financial trades in Australia and, in America, similar high-frequency share traders account for 70 per cent of the financial markets. Before 2007 they did not exist.


 I am happy to talk with either side of politics about pensions but, first, they have to tell me why they will not introduce a financial transactions tax that would work. It would work and would raise a decent amount of revenue. It would look after our pensioners and our veterans.


The financial experts from the Australia Institute say that France and Italy have introduced FTTs to fund their budget measures. Once again, we are not leading by example. We do not want to get on the front foot and show how a country can lead when it comes to FTTs! The rest of the European Union will follow the same course of action early next year. But we are still sitting here. Neither side will talk to me about an FTT. Does that not tell you something? Why can't we do the same?


I am very concerned that ASIC itself has failed to identify the number and the names of the high-frequency share-trading companies operating in Australia. How embarrassing that ASIC cannot even name these companies. It may be lying to me, which is even more disturbing. It makes up 30 per cent of our trade market. ASIC officials could not properly answer my questions and yet I am informed that high-frequency traders often take advantage of everyday investors, including self-funded retirees, and mum and dad investors. But neither side of politics gives a stuff about that. I can see you are hanging your heads and I would, too. You are skimming $3 billion of profits from those mum and dad investors every year. It is a pretty poor performance.


ASIC's Greg Medcraft and Cathie Armour said that they have a team of rocket scientists whose job it is to be on top of market intelligence, yet they cannot tell me who the high-frequency traders are. Fair go! How are ASIC supposed to ensure high-frequency traders are not front-running or scamming the market, as Greg Medcraft said was ASIC's priority, if they do not even know who they are dealing with? There are mum and dad investors out there who are investing their hard-earned cash and who are at risk of being taken advantage of—and they are being taken advantage of; there is no doubt about that and no argument there—because ASIC have clearly not been able to properly manage this money-making scheme for people who speculate on our share market with high-speed supercomputers and advanced computer programs. That is why we need a financial transactions tax. Not only will it put high-frequency traders on the same playing field as mum and dad investors and regulate them so they cannot affect market prices; it will also raise a minimum of $1.4 billion. I say that again: that is just a minimum. High-frequency traders are a handful of big companies which use technology to get an inside advantage. A financial transactions tax will create another pool of revenue without burdening Australians, struggling to make ends meet.


After what has been going on this morning, it is clear that both major parties have not recognised that there are many battlers out there. So I do wish you luck in the next election, because you are going to need it. I can now see the ads; I am looking forward to running them myself.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:48):  I thank all senators who have contributed to the debate on the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014, which repeals the second round of carbon tax related personal income tax cuts that were due to start on 1 July 2015.


We have to remember that this bill will legislate the budget improvements that the former government announced and banked in their last budget but never legislated. The beneficial impact from this bill on the budget bottom line will be around $2.8 billion over the current forward estimates period. This measure has already been put to the Senate twice and, so far, of course the Senate has voted it down on both occasions. However, the government welcomes the change of heart by the Labor opposition. The government welcomes the fact that on reflection Labor has decided to back its own budget improvements measure after voting against it twice.


The 1 July 2015 round of personal income tax cuts were originally introduced to provide additional assistance to households, following an expected increase in the carbon tax, from a fixed price of $25.40 in this financial year to $29 next financial year. However, in its final budget, the 2013-14 budget, the former Labor government revised their carbon price estimates for next financial year, down to around $12, and on that basis they said that there was no longer a need for this second round of income tax cuts until such time as the carbon tax got back up to $25.40 a tonne. Of course, we know that, as a result of the policies of the government, supported by the parliament, the carbon tax is now at zero—not $12, not $25.40, not $29 a tonne—no longer pushing up the cost of electricity, no longer pushing up the cost of doing business and no longer pushing up the cost of living for families. And that is why, given that we are in a much stronger position now than we were under the previous government when they made a decision that this particular tax cut was no longer appropriate, it is appropriate that we press ahead with this measure, particularly given the state of the budgets that we inherited from the previous Labor government. Not only did the previous Labor government spend about $200 billion more in their first five budgets than they raised in revenue but they left behind $123 billion in forward projected deficits in their last budget. And of course we know that Labor left behind a budget trajectory and a debt growth trajectory, taking Australia to government gross debt of $667 billion by 2023-24 and rising beyond that period. Under the trajectory that we were on as a result of the policy decisions of the previous government, there were deficits as far as the eye could see and there was debt growth as far as the eye could see. We have been able to reduce that spending-growth trajectory quite significantly as a result of the decisions that were made in our first and second budgets. It is good to see that, one by one and step by step, all of the various measures initiated by the government to improve the budget bottom line are being dealt with by the parliament and by the Senate.


It is good to see that we are now able to deal with one of the outstanding measures to improve the budget bottom line from the 2013-14 budget. On occasion I am asked how we are going with implementing budget measures from the 2014-15 and 2015-16 budgets, and I always point out to people that we are still working to do Labor's job for them. We are still working to implement budget measures way back from 2013 that Labor initiated and banked in their last budget. They banked the beneficial effect on the budget bottom line in their last budget, but never legislated. We are still working to do their work for them, with Labor, until today, opposing their own budget improvement measure.


I conclude by thanking all senators who have contributed to this debate. This is one of the measures from Labor's last budget that we said, while in opposition, we would support in government. We are sticking to that commitment we made in the lead-up to the last election. We are pleased that the opposition has come on board in supporting their own budget measure as well. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-06-17,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (09:39):  I would like to say a few words about this Orwellian titled bill. The Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 is part of a growing tradition within this parliament to see legislation presented in the most partisan and most cynical of ways so that you get a highly politically charged description of a bill rather than its title going to the content of the bill. 


What we see is the government calling upon this chamber to adjust its deteriorating budget position—a position that the Labor Party acknowledges, but you would not get any sense of that from the discussion of the government. I recall just before the last election the proposition that the current government could fix the deficit; they could reduce the debt. They gave no recognition whatsoever throughout the term of the previous Labor government of the deteriorating revenue position of the Commonwealth. Those positions have now come back to haunt the government itself. 


Let me again put the facts on the record. This government has actually doubled the budget deficit in just 12 months, after promising to fix it. This was their biggest election promise, but like all their election promises it is a promise that has just evaporated. The Treasurer, Mr Hockey, has doubled the budget deficit in one year from $17.1 billion to $35 billion in 2015-16. Over the four-year period from 2013-14 to 2016-17, Mr Hockey has presided over a cumulative deterioration of some $96 billion in the deficit compared to the figures he inherited from Labor. We can see these figures quite clearly set out in the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook—a position that was made independently of the previous government and a position made very clear by the Public Service in the run-up to the last election. This change, the subject of this bill, was already factored into the forward estimates, and so if the bill does not pass by 30 June the consequence will be a further blow-out in the budget deficit, which is, as I say, already at $35 billion. 


We have a government which, having abandoned all of those election promises, went through and produced a budget in its first year, which, of course, went down like a lead balloon. The government's political position has deteriorated so badly that it has now even abandoned that proposition in its public rhetoric. It has abandoned the rhetoric around fiscal rectitude in a desperate pursuit to rebuild its electoral fortunes and it is now in the process of preparing itself for an early election. But the reality is simple: the budget is built on a house of cards. The projected budget surplus is built on a change in the accounting rules that allows for the earnings of the Future Fund to be recorded and calculated in the deficit—not through any responsible measures. As we know, Mr Hockey's number are underpinned by unfair measures, which will never pass the Senate. We have seen this chamber on several occasions now reject measures which are fundamentally unfair and offer nothing in the way of rebuilding the prosperity of this nation. 


When we talk of a house of cards, we need look no further than the proposals that the government is seeking to pursue in higher education. Not content with its unfair and unnecessary plans for the $100,000 degrees, which have been voted down twice by this chamber, the government continues to maintain its quixotic crusade. Embedded—in fact, hidden—in this year's budget, is the 20 per cent cut in university funding. There are cuts to the training of our research students. There are cuts to the funding to address student equity. There are $5.4 billion worth of cuts to universities, to students and to research. 


These are cuts that the government cannot deliver but underlie the assumptions within this budget. So we have these phantom arrangements that the government seeks to pursue. The cuts that have been included in this budget are of course aimed at bodging up the figures to make them look better than they are. It is truly a fantasy budget—a fantastical dream in the imagination of Senator Cormann and his partners in crime, the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and of course the hapless fixer, the minister for education. But the Australian people understand that, if these measures ever were implemented, the enormous costs that they would have to this nation's future.


The stated purpose of this bill—and this is the really interesting point; we do not find this in the title. This is not an amendment bill; in effect, what it is is a proposition that in reality is nothing more than an attempt to change the Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates Amendments) Act 2011 and the Clean Energy (Tax Laws Amendments) Act 2011 so that both acts have their future operative provisions repealed. You would have thought that would be the appropriate way to actually to present these bills as amendments to those measures.


Both acts have provisions already in operation, and these would not be repealed. As such, the bill would repeal an increase in the nominal tax threshold from $18,200 in 2014 to $19,400 in 2015-16. They maintain the second personal marginal tax rate at 32.5 per cent rather than increase it to 33 per cent from 2015-16. They maintain the maximum value of the low-income tax offset at $445 rather than change the maximum value of the offset to $300 million in 2015-16 and they seek to maintain the threshold below which a person may receive the offset at a taxable income of $66,667 and the withdrawal rate at 1.5 per cent rather than the income threshold increasing to $67,000 and the withdrawal rate falling to one per cent from 2015-16.


Of course in these circumstances these were perfectly fair measures introduced at the time in which, as a package of measures, we proceeded in government to ensure that there was fairness about the climate change polices that we were pursuing. So we are now faced with this difficult position and, as a result, if the legislation does not pass by June, these measures of course will further undermine the fiscal position of the Commonwealth.


The shadow Treasurer said in the other place that the opposition has reflected on these matters and the circumstances of the mismanagement of the budget placed upon this Commonwealth. Ultimately, we have resolved to support the bill. 


The opposition notes that the tax-free threshold trebled from $6,000 to $18,200 during our time in office. The change that this bill will repeal, while it would have been welcome, would have been a smaller percentage of the increase increasing the amount to $19,400. But, despite the spin that the government has sought to put on this, this action is not something we would have done in office. These are not measures that the Labor Party would have pursued in office. The difficulty of the decision is that we have to pick our battles, and we are trying to the best that we can to ensure that people enjoy the support of this parliament who need it most. Our focus will always be on protecting the most vulnerable from this government just as we are the only party that is responsible enough to call out this government on the issue of the unsustainability of our superannuation system, which of course rewards for those who are most advantaged in this country, or making it clear about the need to change the taxation arrangements for multinational companies so that multinational corporations actually pay their fair share of tax. 


That is why we are opposing as well the government's latest rounds of cuts to the pension. I noticed overnight that the Greens have had their Meg Lees moment where they are seeking to adopt the position of the conservatives on the issues of the defence of the pensioners of this country. I look forward to seeing how that goes, because we know how this story ended for another great party, the Democrats. We understood the consequence when the Democrats went down this road of accommodating the reactionary forces in this country. And of course we saw the circumstances whereby, in time, the Democrats were obliterated. So, we are going to see the great party of protest, the great party that wants to express its views about the need to fundamentally transform this country, lining up with the reactionaries to defend this government's attack on the most vulnerable in our country, the pensioners. I look forward to seeing how the latter-day Meg Leeses get on in this circumstance!


This government, unfortunately, has sought to attempt to rewrite history. This is a government that made a number of commitments prior to the last election, all of which have been broken. This is a government that played big on the rhetoric of deficit and debt, all of which have been demonstrated to be hollow. This is a government that we now see wants to present to this parliament measures that of course would continue the great inequalities of this country—in fact, make it much worse—by the pursuit of a tax upon the most vulnerable. This is a government that wants to undermine our universal health system, wants to undermine our highly effective pension system. This is a government that wants to smash equity in higher education. And this is a government that of course is now desperate to present itself as something other than it really is.


We have suggested that there needs to be an alternative approach, and that is what the Labor Party will argue strongly for and defend vigorously in the run-up to the next election—which I say, on all the science, is not that far away. The opposition has outlined alternative measures that can be taken to secure the fiscal position of this country while maintaining fairness and social justice. The Labor Party has a very, very different view about ensuring that we have a country in which prosperity is genuinely shared throughout the community and in which we can ensure that our industries are innovative and modern and able to provide the employment opportunities so that everybody in this country has the right to expect the living standards that a country like ours can afford.


We have to make sure that this is about building priorities into the budget process that defend the fundamental democratic values, and I am afraid you will not find that on the opposition benches. Unfortunately, I now see that the Greens are falling for the old line about how responsible they are, how thoroughly respectable they are, how desperate they are to actually appease those on the other side. I look forward with interest to how that unfolds.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2015-06-17,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (09:52):  I rise to oppose the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014. Under the law of the land, the tax office will start taking slightly less of your income in a fortnight's time. This is good news, but the coalition and Labor cannot stand it. So today the coalition and Labor will combine to pass a bill that cancels the slight reduction in income tax scheduled for July—a reduction I was responsible for retaining in my first week in the Senate last July. This bill proves that the coalition and Labor are a unity ticket. If you want big taxes to fund a government that can spend your income better than you can, vote for either of them. They will give you want you want.


The tax cut we are talking about is not huge. If you earn $66,000, the tax office currently takes away around $14,300. Next year, with no change, they would take away around $14,220. So, around $80 less would be taken from you. The coalition and Labor believe they can spend that $80 better than you can. In fact, as this bill gets waved through the Senate, they will say that they cannot afford to give you the $80—as if the $80 is theirs.


The mindset of the coalition and Labor is that of someone who believes that all your income is owned by the government, and you get to keep some of it only because of government generosity or absentmindedness. This mindset leads to tax increases being called budget savings. We would not put up with this abuse of language anywhere else. If a business claims that it is making savings, that means it is spending less; it does not mean that it is jacking up prices. This mindset also leads some in the coalition and Labor to treat tax deductions, offsets and exemptions as a government handout, to be withdrawn when the going gets tough. In reality, tax deductions, offsets and exemptions just represent instances where the tax office is taking less money than some imagined tax take. The approach of some in the coalition and Labor is akin to a pickpocket skimming your wallet of notes and then expecting gratitude because this time they left the coins behind.


Yes, governments need to spend money and raise taxes, but our governments are spending more money and raising more taxes than ever in Australia's history. Fifty years ago, taxes were around $5,000 per person after adjusting for inflation. This grew each decade, until now the tax burden is around $19,000 per person. Those bleating about crashing revenues are on another planet. Their complaint, in essence, is that taxes ought to grow even faster. There is no justification for the ever-expanding tax burden. Living standards for all groups of people have risen over the last 50 years, which means the need for government welfare services has declined, and we have not uncovered new forms of effective government intervention either. To the contrary, the prosperity-promoting effects of free markets and the many failings of government involvement have been demonstrated time and time again.


Yes, governments need to spend money and raise taxes, but our taxes are high even by the standards of the stagnant economies that make up the OECD. The average tax burden in the OECD is 30 per cent of GDP. This average accounts for the different populations of OECD countries, as well as the social security contributions in many OECD countries that serve a similar purpose to Australia's compulsory superannuation guarantee payments. In contrast, Australia's tax burden, after including Australia's compulsory superannuation guarantee payments, is 31 per cent of GDP. Having a higher tax burden than the OECD average is extremely concerning, particularly as the OECD average is high compared to prosperous and dynamic non-OECD countries like Singapore.


Yes, governments need to spend money and raise taxes, but every tax expert knows that income tax is the most damaging tax on the Commonwealth government's books. It discourages working, saving, starting a business and taking risks. At times, this coalition government has raised concerns about bracket creep imposing ever higher income tax burdens on middle Australia, but we have experienced considerable bracket creep since the last time there were income tax cuts, and, when a scheduled income tax cut comes along that would return just a fraction of this bracket creep, the coalition government nips it in the bud. For the coalition, this is akin to the cry of St Augustine: 'Lord, give me chastity and continence, but not yet.'


The Liberal Democrats have a comprehensive plan to significantly reduce government spending and an unshakable conviction that your income is yours, not the government's. That is why I am defending the $80 tax cut that is due to each Australian taxpayer in a fortnight's time. But, sadly, the conspiracy of the big government forces of the coalition and Labor will cancel this tax cut through the bill before us today. When the date of the election comes, the taxpayers of Australia will remember.

"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2015-06-17,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:59):  We have been told in the last 18 months by this government that we have a budget crisis in Australia. If there is a budget crisis in this country, it is not an expenditure crisis, it is not an entitlement crisis; it is a revenue crisis. My party, very proudly, played a significant role in the clean energy package and a price on carbon. That price on carbon over the forward estimates under a costing by the Parliamentary Budget Office would deliver $18 billion in revenue to this country.


With the ruthless and cynical campaign by this government going into the last election about axing the mining tax and the carbon tax, what they did not tell you was that they were axing billions of dollars in revenue that could be used in our economy. It could be reallocated towards transformative behaviour to move the Australian economy and to diversify the Australian economy in areas of renewable energy, science, technology and innovation, diversifying the risks of being reliant on a mining economy and creating new, clean, green and clever jobs across this country. That revenue could be used for a whole range of important things in this country like giving a tax break to low-income earners. That is exactly what we did. With the mining tax we reallocated money towards the small business sector—$5.4 billion to be precise—which, incidentally, was ripped up by the Liberal government at the last budget. It was replaced in this new budget—rather cynically as a new measure—but most of the measures were similar.


A budget, to be balanced, needs revenue and, of course, we have expenditures on the other side. A focus on cost saving that attacks the most vulnerable in our society was never going to get through the Senate because we understand that we need to make brave decisions around tax reform to raise revenue in this country. Governments play a number of critical roles in our society, and we do have some differences of philosophy in this place as to what the role of government should be. My party believes that one of the key roles is levying a fair and equitable tax system, a tax system that is progressive and that, as much as it possibly can, puts equity and equality right up there with efficiencies. Some of the money from that carbon price that was going to be collected from some of the dirtiest polluters on the planet—those who are creating the emissions and the gases that lead to global warming and the devastating effects that that is forecast to have in terms of its impact on a whole range of not just the economy but ecosystems around the planet—was going to be used to support a tax break for the poorest and most vulnerable in this country.


It is very disappointing to see the Labor Party, in 24 hours, turn their back not once but twice on low-income earners in this country. These are supposedly the bread-and-butter supporters of and voters for the Labor Party. Senator Carr talks about our support of the government's measures to bring in a more progressive system on pension payments to help low-income people get more money on the full pension. That is a progressive tax policy. When the Howard government changed it in 2007, the Greens took a very strong stance opposing that because it was not a progressive tax policy. We wanted to help low-income earners in this country, and it is exactly the same situation today. If we abolish this break for low-income earners, it is just going to put more pressure on the poor and vulnerable in our society who actually need the assistance the most. Giving them a leg up and helping them where we can not only takes pressure off other roles of government—the provision of emergency services and other services such as health care and education—but also helps our economy and also helps the circular flow of income. It helps the circular flow of income. So there are all sorts of secondary effects that are really important.


My party is proud to stand in here today and say that we oppose taking away tax breaks for the poorest Australians. Senator Carr said that these decisions are difficult when you are in opposition—if they were in government, they would not do it. I have heard the same thing said about supporting dangerous ISDS clauses—giving corporations the right to sue governments in free trade deals. That is a total cop-out. If you do not stand for something, Senator Carr, you will fall for anything. You need to make a strong statement in this chamber, to those people listening, that you support low-income earners in this country. My party does. We support a progressive tax system that levies money right across the economy from different categories of income, and that is what our society should be based on—the fair and equitable distribution of taxes and incentives.


How many times was this explained by our Prime Minister in the lead-up to the last election and how many times has it been explained by Senator Cormann? In the three short years I have been in the Senate I have heard him talk about axing the tax, getting rid of the job-destroying carbon tax and the mining tax. How many times has this government ever been honest and said that they were revenue raising measures and that revenue was necessary—necessary to balance budgets, necessary to provide a fair and equitable society. It is easy to come in here and cut spending, especially for the most vulnerable in our society. It is a lot more difficult to make brave decisions to support a progressive taxation system, to support a progressive pension system, to tax the bads, the pollutions. When I was at university I remember the rules being pretty simple in any economics textbook—a government should tax the bads, like pollution and health risks like sugar and tobacco; they should levy taxes so our common pool resources, like our mineral wealth, are equally shared amongst those who own them—the Australian voters, Australian taxpayers; and, just as importantly, where possible they should reduce taxes on work and effort. 


My party has supported taking a tax off small business to allow them to get a leg up, but we want to see a progressive taxation system in this country. We want to see the bads taxed. We want to see a really simple, sensible, rational, logical price on carbon, and we want to see that money reallocated in the economy to where it is needed the most. If the government come in here and remove this tax break for low-income earners, I want them to explain why they were too gutless to do this when they removed the carbon price last year. I did not hear any of you in here telling low-income Australians that they were going to lose their tax break when you removed the carbon price. In fact, I remember you saying exactly the opposite—that they would get to keep their tax breaks. Now you are taking them away. These are the people who need a leg up, and I am deeply disappointed that the Labor Party are taking the weak decision of saying they would not do this if they were in government but they are going to have to do it in opposition. Low-income Australians want to see someone standing up for them in parliament. I think most Australians support a progressive taxation system, and the Greens will not be supporting this measure in the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-06-17,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (10:09):  I thought for a moment the Greens under their new leadership might be starting to show some economic sense and rationality. Indeed, today's headlines in the newspaper seem to suggest that they are not just going to take the 'we are against anything the Liberal Party wants to do' approach, which has been the approach of the Greens political party, particularly under their former leadership. And I thought, 'Gee, there's a glimmer of hope!' I am not sure that that was real good for the Liberal Party, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, because if the Greens start looking like they are a sensible, mature political party then perhaps they will take a couple of votes off us! I think they know they will take a lot more off the Labor Party, as they have been doing. But that glimmer of hope and rationality that I thought might be around has just been dissipated by the previous speaker.


I do not know which university he went to, but they must have been teaching him some funny economics there. I might say, Senator Whish-Wilson, that I did not go to a university; I could not afford that. I started work as an articled clerk and did my university qualifications externally, at night-time after working all day. So I did not get the privilege of popping into an economics class run by what sounds to have been a very left-wing group of tutors and lecturers. I am just not sure where it comes from. But I always thought it was the Greens political party's approach that we did not tax people enough in Australia—that there had been too many cuts. Again, it is a bit difficult to find out where the Greens are, economically.


As for the Labor Party, I am delighted that they are, at last, going to support a measure which they did actually introduce, Senator Whish-Wilson. I am not here to defend the Labor Party, I can tell you that! But you wrongly accused them. The Labor Party did do something about this when they were in government. They actually made a commitment to the Australian people before the election that they would do exactly what this bill does now. So, far from berating the Labor Party, you should at least be giving them credit for actually carrying out the promise they made before the last election. We know that Labor Party promises before elections are not particularly reliable. We all remember, prior to the 2010 election, the commitment: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' We all remember that commitment on the eve of the election. But then, having watched the last couple of episodes of TheKilling Season, one can never quite understand the personalities, the bitternesses and the hatreds in the Labor Party which seem to be their modus operandi. That is what seems to direct policy decisions in the Labor Party.



Honourable senators interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Order! Order, colleagues. Senator Macdonald, resume—through the chair, if you would, please.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Carr, shout all you like, but I have actually taped the first two episodes and I can send them to you, if you want just a bit of a reminder about the part you and most of your friends on the front bench played in the atrocious disloyalty and dishonesty that has been so clearly exposed in those two episodes of The Killing Season about the Labor Party and how it operates.


And, Mr Acting Deputy President Back, why would you expect better from the Labor Party? I just have to divert a fraction and mention that I read an article in the Hobart Mercury the other day from a dear old friend of mine, former Senator Margaret Reynolds. She was a Labor senator based in Townsville when I first entered the Senate. And I liked Margaret; I was disappointed when she left the north and went down to Tasmania. But she wrote this article for the Hobart Mercury berating the major political parties for the way they select Senate candidates. I was obliged to reply to the Hobart Mercury—I suspect they did not print it, but I did reply—and I said, 'My old friend Margaret Reynolds was clearly talking about the Labor Party, not the Liberal or National parties,' because, as I pointed out, there is a difference. We have just been through a preselection for a senator in Queensland, and we were very fortunate in having Senator Jo Lindgren elected. But I have to tell you: Senator Lindgren was not selected on a 'captain's pick' or by a couple of union cabals getting together and determining who they would put into the position; Senator Lindgren actually faced over 300 ordinary Australians who make up the selection process of the LNP in Queensland, and she contested against eight other candidates all of whom were people of quality. And Senator Lindgren, through her own abilities, and through the presentation she made, was selected. So I said to Margaret Reynolds, 'You might be talking about the Labor Party, where the Northern Territory branch of the Labor Party preselects a sitting senator and Julia Gillard comes in over the top and says: ""Forget about the Labor Party; forget about the ordinary people who select this in the Northern Territory; I want that person.""' So the difference could not be more stark. That is why I say you would not know where the Labor Party is coming from.


I might mention, as to my own last preselection, that I had been a sitting senator for some time, but there were actually 15 people opposing me. We had a preselection panel of over 450 people. I am delighted to say that I won on the first ballot, and I thank the LNP for that; I am always grateful to them for that. But that shows the stark difference between how the Liberal and National parties make economic decisions—make any decisions—and how the Labor Party does.


I will get back to the bill—just in case there is anyone listening to this and they might be interested in what this bill, the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014, is all about. The Labor Party introduced a carbon tax. They knew it would put up the cost of living of ordinary Australians. So, in an attempt to in some way ameliorate that bad policy decision of the carbon tax, they did say: 'We will give carbon tax related personal income tax cuts, just to compensate for the increased cost of living'—which they knew would happen with the carbon tax. They based that on a floating price for the carbon tax of $29 per tonne. Originally, when the carbon tax came in, the price was at $25.4 per tonne. It was going to float up to $29. And so the Labor Party said, 'We'll introduce these tax cuts to compensate.' But, lo and behold, the Labor Party suddenly realised how corrupt the market was for carbon tax permits, and they realised that their floating price estimate of $29 a tonne was not going to really achieve more than about $12 a tonne—less than half of what was originally expected. So the Labor Party, in a flash of economic responsibility, said: 'Well, the price is not going to go up quite as much as we thought; therefore, those personal income tax cuts that we were going to give won't now be necessary. So, as a budget repair measure, we're going to cancel them.' So, Senator Whish-Wilson, the Labor Party actually acknowledged that and said it was a tax that did not have the same substantive underlying reason as it originally did. So the Labor Party announced that they were going to get rid of these cuts.


Having promised that before the last election, they did a typical Labor-Greens thing: promise something before the election, and after the election come in and do the exact opposite. Twice the coalition has attempted to introduce Labor's removal of their promised income tax cuts. We have tried twice already in this parliament to allow the Labor Party to honour their commitment. Twice we have failed. But I am pleased to say—and all credit where credit is due—that the Labor Party are now, fortuitously, and sensibly, I might say, going to support this government measure, which is purely and simply the proposal that the Labor Party put before the last election.


The coalition made a commitment before the last election, and that commitment was broad; it was clear; it was sensible; it was direct. Nobody—no Australian voter—could have misunderstood what the coalition's principal election promise was before the last election. It was: to fix the budget. We all know that when the Labor Party came into power they had a credit, $60 billion, in the 'piggy bank'. The $60 billion was there for the incoming Labor government because of the good work of Peter Costello and John Howard in the Howard government over many years. The Howard government had paid off previous Labor governments' debts and, more than that, they had put some money away for a rainy day. There were $60 billion sitting there waiting for the new Labor government.


It took the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government only a few months to blow that $60 billion and run up a debt which, if it had not been addressed, would have got up to around $700 billion. Senator Whish-Wilson is happy about that, I guess. He must be, because the Greens political party supported the Gillard and Rudd governments every time they took measures that would blow that out to $700 billion. Senator Cormann might help me here. That means we are currently paying—how much a day in interest, Senator Cormann?




Senator Cormann:
  Way too much: $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion a month.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Australian taxpayers are paying $1.3 billion a month to overseas lenders. They are paying $1.3 billion a month on Labor's debt runner—from $60 billion in credit to approaching $700 billion in deficit and already costing the Australian taxpayers over $1 billion a month in interest on those payments.


The promise the coalition made before the last election was to prepare the budget, and everybody knew that. Everybody was concerned about the unsustainable nature of Labor's borrowings and reckless spending. That is why they voted for the Abbott government and—in spite of continuous opposition by the Labor Party—the Abbott government has already started to turn around that approach to $700 billion in debt that the Labor Party left us.


Our government has not been perfect. I had some concerns about the 2014 budget, which I thought did not quite meet our targets or the aspirations and understanding of the Australian voter. I am pleased to say this is a government that is not too proud to say, 'Perhaps we didn't get it right, then,' and it has done something about fixing it. That never happens with the Labor Party—until today. Today the Labor Party have decided that (a) they will, at least, keep this promise, (b) they will do what they said they would do and understand should be done, and (c) in this small measure, the Labor Party will appreciate that the current government has a huge job to do in repairing the budget balance run up by Labor.


Senator Whish-Wilson: do not be surprised. The Labor Party are not catching you out. They are doing exactly what they said they would do. They have since voted against it, twice, but credit where credit is due. Now they are agreeing with that. In this small way, the coalition will be able to continue on its path of repairing the budget measures that Labor created for this country.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-06-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania) (10:24):  I rise today to speak on this Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014. What an interesting situation. We have so much talk about tax reform—when what we are actually talking about is a tax grab. Tax reform suggests you might seriously consider how you are raising taxes in this country and for what purposes you are raising them and whether that needs to change in the 21st century. But no—tax reform is simply a word for 'How can we get a bigger tax grab from the Australian people?'


The first question you need to be asking if you are serious about tax reform is: where do you raise the money to spend on a public purpose and, in raising that money, how are you trying to shift the economy and the society to respond to the overwhelming challenges of the time? The overwhelming challenge of this century is global warming, the resource extraction of a planet going to nine billion people, where resource extraction is completely unsustainable. At the same time we have overwhelming wealth and income inequality. 


If you are looking at the two megatrends, one is global warming, unsustainable and non-renewable resource use around the planet and destruction of ecosystems and, at the same time a widening gap between the rich and poor, then genuine tax reform would look at tax and the bads—that is, the extraction and unsustainable use of resources that are destroying ecosystems, destroying the atmosphere, turning the oceans acid and, at the same time, reducing the gap as much as you can, with structural change to make sure that you reduce income and wealth inequality. That is what genuine tax reform would do. That is why I was extremely proud of the fact that the regime we brought in to address global warming in this country was genuine tax reform. It was the first major tax reform in decades because it said, 'We need to bring down greenhouse gas emissions in this country so we are going to put a price on pollution because the earth cannot sustain the level of waste being put into atmosphere and oceans from the burning of fossil fuels. So we will tax that pollution. We will charge for that pollution. In taxing the bad, we will use that to relieve the tax burden on the poorest and the least able in our democracy.' Is that not genuine tax reform addressing those two megatrends in this century? Of course it is. 


What we did was to say, 'Let us make sure that from those who are making the mega profits, we socialise the costs of their work, to pay for that cost.' We said that those people who are burning fossil fuels will pay for it through a carbon price. We introduced the carbon price and at the same time we said that low-income earners should get a break. So we trebled the tax-free fresh threshold. Before, once you earned $6,000 in Australia, you started to pay tax. After the carbon price it went up to $18,200. So it meant an incredible amount to a large number of people. To give an example, it gave tax relief of $300 a year to anyone earning up to $65,000 a year or $600 for people earning $20,000 a year. When you talk about people working part-time—students, low-income earners—it gave them a substantial tax break and, at the same time, it said to BHP and to the Rios of this world, 'You can stop paying for the cost of the extreme weather events that you are imposing on the rest of the community.' 


Not only did they run a mega campaign against the mining tax and the carbon price but at the very same time as they were out there running their ad campaign on the Australian community saying, 'What jolly good fellows are we, the mining industry!' they had set up marketing hubs in Singapore to avoid their tax. The biggest tax avoiders in the country were the people saying, 'We shouldn't have to pay a carbon price, we shouldn't have to pay a mining tax.'   They were setting up their hub in Singapore, sending billions offshore and paying multimillions to their chief executives who were laughing all the way to the bank as they laughed at the Liberal government that was prepared to give them even more tax relief than they deserved. Now who is going to pay the price of global warming? Who is going to pay for the damage to the infrastructure around Australia from extreme weather events? It is the community, who have to pay through the tax take. Now what we have is a government that is moving to shift the tax burden once again away from the Gina Rineharts of this world and away from the Rios and the BHPs, and onto the lowest income earners in the country. 


As my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson said a moment ago, these are really dishonest activities of a government. If the government was honest when they came into power and moved to abolish the carbon price, they should have, at the same time, said to the Australian people: 'Look, we were taking billions of dollars from the big polluters, and we were recycling it through to you, the people. Now that we have decided not to charge those companies those billions of dollars, we are going to take the tax breaks that you had away from you. We are going to reduce the tax-free threshold back down to $6,000, and you will all start paying the tax again.' But they did not. What they said was, 'We will forgo the revenue from the carbon price, and we will maintain those compensation measures'. Anyone with half a brain could see that that left a mega hole in the budget—$18 billion over the forward estimates. It is an $18 billion hole that Prime Minister Abbott decided he wanted. He wanted a big tax hole, and he wanted to add to that tax hole by abolishing the mining tax, which the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, at the time identified as worth around another $6 billion. 


It was an amazing effort by a Prime Minister to say: 'Rather than see the tax on the richest corporations and the biggest polluters in the country, we want to impose it on ordinary people. We want to do that.' That is exactly what the government did. In order to disguise that, they went out last year saying: 'We'll keep the compensation from the carbon price but, hey, you have to pay a Medicare co-payment, we are going to deregulate universities and charge students more, we are going to reduce pensions, and we are going to attack the poorest in this country in order to recoup the hole that we made when we decided to let the big polluters and the big miners off the hook.' That is the disaster that we are now inheriting here in Australia. 


What is very interesting is the title of this bill. It shows that—to the extent to which we have a government talk about failure of grown-up government—we now have what can only be described as student politics. We have a government that is introducing a bill called Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014. The reason that they have done that is, again, the cynicism of politics. In the agreement on the carbon price that the Greens signed with the Gillard government, this tax-free threshold increase was locked in to go up from $18,200 to $19,400. Once the ink was dry, what the Gillard government then did—sneakily, in my view—was defer that increase to $19,400. That is why the government have decided to call it Labor's budget savings measures. 


Interestingly, last year, when this very same proposition was put to the Senate at this time, Labor stood up in here and said that they would not stand for the tax-free threshold being wound back, or for the projected increase not going ahead. They would not stand for it last year, and this year they are standing for it. Why? Because 12 months has gone past, because they know that politics moves so fast that the community will not have put two and two together, and they will not have realised that what Labor are now doing is exactly the opposite of what they did last year. There is just no consistent philosophical view from either side of government—except, you can guarantee with the Liberals and the Abbott government that every time the word 'tax' is mentioned it means mega tax relief for the wealthiest and the richest in the country. You can guarantee that, when it comes to Labor Party on the issue, there is no consistent philosophical view. It is wherever is pragmatic at the day that they will do. That is why last year they voted against this proposition, and it is why this year they are going to support the government in voting for this proposition. 


I can tell you that, where the Greens are concerned, there is a consistent philosophical view which says very clearly that we should be raising money by taxing the 'bads', and we should be reducing the impact on low-income earners and on those people who are suffering the most in our community wherever we can. That is precisely what we need to be doing. This is not only in terms of the carbon price compensation; with the mining tax we see the government taking away the low-income superannuation investment of $500 a year to people earning less than $37,000. Of course, that is ultimately to go in the deal that the government made with Clive Palmer, Senator Lambie, Senator Lazarus and Senator Wang last year. They all voted to take away the low-income superannuation contribution in the mining tax. 


The mining tax abolition cost the Australian community $6.5 billion over the forward estimates. The miners are laughing all the way to bank, and low-income people are suffering from it. With their superannuation, the increase in super from nine per cent to 12 per cent was delayed out to 2025. We are already seeing that—every which way you look at it—the people in Australia who are the ones who have suffered the most are the ones who continue to suffer the most. The richest tax avoiders get away with it, and they get away with it time and time again. What should we be doing? What we should be doing is recognising that—as the International Energy Agency has done this week, and as every other country is now doing as it faces up to the challenge of global warming—we have to absolutely and rapidly change this economy to a low carbon/zero carbon economy. This is why the Greens have said clearly that we need net carbon zero by 2040, that we need to be out to an 80 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 and that we need to bring that down to 50 per cent at least by 2025 


Now, if we are going to do that—as the International Energy Agency says—we have to increase energy efficiency in industry, buildings, and transport; we have to reduce the use of the least efficient coal-fired power plants, and ban their construction; we have to increase investments in renewable energy technology; we have to phase out fossil fuel subsidies; and we have to reduce methane emissions in oil and gas production—and yet, every which way the Australian tax system is considered, we have a situation where this government has moved to destroy those initiatives which would bring down greenhouse gas emissions. That is the task that we should be addressing.


We should also be addressing the other overwhelming trend—that is, wealth accumulation by the very smallest group of people of Australia, and the increasing stress on the remainder of the population. Mr Acting Deputy President, I can tell you that there are an awful lot of people out there who are now sitting back but who did not realise at the time that the reason they had the tax-free threshold was because of the carbon price, and because of the fact that the big polluters were paying so that ordinary people could have a tax break. That was surely a very good idea. At the same time, we had the government out there at the time telling people that the cost of living would fall because the carbon price was going—that everybody would be $500 better off. Well, I am yet to find anyone who is $500 better off because the carbon price has gone. And that is because the main driver of electricity prices was not the carbon price, nor is it the Renewable Energy Target; the main driver of electricity price hikes is the network system. And is anyone interested in fixing that? Not in the government, that is for sure, and not in Labor either. There are very clear measures you could take in the National Electricity Market to address this, but neither Liberal nor Labor are interested in doing so—because the network system is a back-pocket tax. Talk about axing the tax! If you were serious about axing the tax, you would take on the electricity networks and the National Electricity Market in Australia.


The cost of living has not come down. Emissions are now going up. People are more anxious than ever about extreme weather events. The insurance industry is absolutely worried now about how they are going to cover the costs of insurance. And who is going to pay, Mr Acting Deputy President? If this government has its way, it will not be the big miners, it will not be the BHPs and the Rios, and it will not be the Gina Rineharts of this world who will pay, in order to deal with not only mitigation but also adaptation—it is not they who are going to contribute to reducing income and wealth inequality in this country; in fact, they want to drive wages and conditions even lower than they already are. It will be ordinary people who will pay.


So I stand again to say: if we want genuine tax reform in this country, this tax white paper had better address what it is that tax is meant to do. Where is it going to come from, and what is the rationale for why it would come from that sector of the community? And how is it going to be distributed in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the costs of global warming, and to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor? That is what we need to be doing with our tax system. I really am appalled: we had a situation where people in here were standing up and dancing when the carbon price was repealed, and now we have a situation where those very same people are going out and taking away the capacity for low-income earners to get an additional tax break—in order to facilitate the wealthiest people in this country becoming wealthier; that is, the big miners in particular. Those same people—and it was every one of the people in the Liberal Party, every one of the Nationals; everyone who was in the Palmer United Party at the time; all of the Independents—were all sitting there abolishing the carbon price. And now, in the face of a huge gap in the budget—deliberately created by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister— they are saying to low-income earners across Australia: 'we are not going to honour the increase in the tax-free threshold; we would much rather see the pockets of corporate Australia get fatter at the expense of ordinary people'.


That is why the Greens are going to stand here and oppose this legislation. We are going to stick with our commitment to Australians—that is, we are going to say that the big polluters should pay their way. We did not support an $18 billion hole in the budget over the forward estimates. We are going to remind Australians that they have not got the windfall gain that they thought they were going to get—because the Prime Minister misled them every step of the way on the impact of the cost of pollution. And now the Australian people are inheriting the cost of pollution. The extreme weather events are going to cost Australians with their lives as well as their livelihoods—while those people who have benefited from the abolition of the mining tax and the carbon price laugh; while they insulate themselves from the cost of pollution as they watch an overwhelming majority of people suffer.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-06-17,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (10:42):  I rise to briefly contribute to and oppose this proposed legislation before the Senate, the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014. The technical description of the bill's purpose is:


The purpose of the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 (the Bill) is to amend the Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates Amendments) Act 2011 and the Clean Energy (Tax Laws Amendments) Act 2011 so that both Acts have their future operative provisions repealed. Both Acts have provisions already in operation and these would not be repealed.


However, the simple explanation is this: if this bill passes, we will be taking money away from low-income earners—the Australian battlers—and I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, they are already battling. I am not going to be a part of that—no way. I am very disappointed with Labor; I cannot believe Labor is being a part of this. With everything that they stand for—the battler, the blue-collar worker—I just cannot believe that they are supporting this legislation. There are better ways to raise revenue and to address this issue of budget repair.


I have put forward a proposal for tax reform calling for the establishment of an FTT—a financial transactions tax. We could pass an FTT instead of agreeing to this legislation. We could actually do that. I launched a plan on how the Australian government could raise an extra $1.4 billion per annum—and that is a minimum—of revenue, and link it to aged Australians' and veterans' pensions by introducing a financial transactions tax. I am disappointed that neither the government nor the opposition have taken the time to properly consider and debate my plan—or speak to me—to protect and boost our pensions through a targeted financial transactions tax, which would only affect about half-a-dozen high-frequency share-trading companies in Australia. High-frequency share traders account for 30 per cent of financial trades in Australia and, in America, similar high-frequency share traders account for 70 per cent of the financial markets. Before 2007 they did not exist.


 I am happy to talk with either side of politics about pensions but, first, they have to tell me why they will not introduce a financial transactions tax that would work. It would work and would raise a decent amount of revenue. It would look after our pensioners and our veterans.


The financial experts from the Australia Institute say that France and Italy have introduced FTTs to fund their budget measures. Once again, we are not leading by example. We do not want to get on the front foot and show how a country can lead when it comes to FTTs! The rest of the European Union will follow the same course of action early next year. But we are still sitting here. Neither side will talk to me about an FTT. Does that not tell you something? Why can't we do the same?


I am very concerned that ASIC itself has failed to identify the number and the names of the high-frequency share-trading companies operating in Australia. How embarrassing that ASIC cannot even name these companies. It may be lying to me, which is even more disturbing. It makes up 30 per cent of our trade market. ASIC officials could not properly answer my questions and yet I am informed that high-frequency traders often take advantage of everyday investors, including self-funded retirees, and mum and dad investors. But neither side of politics gives a stuff about that. I can see you are hanging your heads and I would, too. You are skimming $3 billion of profits from those mum and dad investors every year. It is a pretty poor performance.


ASIC's Greg Medcraft and Cathie Armour said that they have a team of rocket scientists whose job it is to be on top of market intelligence, yet they cannot tell me who the high-frequency traders are. Fair go! How are ASIC supposed to ensure high-frequency traders are not front-running or scamming the market, as Greg Medcraft said was ASIC's priority, if they do not even know who they are dealing with? There are mum and dad investors out there who are investing their hard-earned cash and who are at risk of being taken advantage of—and they are being taken advantage of; there is no doubt about that and no argument there—because ASIC have clearly not been able to properly manage this money-making scheme for people who speculate on our share market with high-speed supercomputers and advanced computer programs. That is why we need a financial transactions tax. Not only will it put high-frequency traders on the same playing field as mum and dad investors and regulate them so they cannot affect market prices; it will also raise a minimum of $1.4 billion. I say that again: that is just a minimum. High-frequency traders are a handful of big companies which use technology to get an inside advantage. A financial transactions tax will create another pool of revenue without burdening Australians, struggling to make ends meet.


After what has been going on this morning, it is clear that both major parties have not recognised that there are many battlers out there. So I do wish you luck in the next election, because you are going to need it. I can now see the ads; I am looking forward to running them myself.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2015-06-17,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (10:48):  I thank all senators who have contributed to the debate on the Labor 2013-14 Budget Savings (Measures No. 1) Bill 2014, which repeals the second round of carbon tax related personal income tax cuts that were due to start on 1 July 2015.


We have to remember that this bill will legislate the budget improvements that the former government announced and banked in their last budget but never legislated. The beneficial impact from this bill on the budget bottom line will be around $2.8 billion over the current forward estimates period. This measure has already been put to the Senate twice and, so far, of course the Senate has voted it down on both occasions. However, the government welcomes the change of heart by the Labor opposition. The government welcomes the fact that on reflection Labor has decided to back its own budget improvements measure after voting against it twice.


The 1 July 2015 round of personal income tax cuts were originally introduced to provide additional assistance to households, following an expected increase in the carbon tax, from a fixed price of $25.40 in this financial year to $29 next financial year. However, in its final budget, the 2013-14 budget, the former Labor government revised their carbon price estimates for next financial year, down to around $12, and on that basis they said that there was no longer a need for this second round of income tax cuts until such time as the carbon tax got back up to $25.40 a tonne. Of course, we know that, as a result of the policies of the government, supported by the parliament, the carbon tax is now at zero—not $12, not $25.40, not $29 a tonne—no longer pushing up the cost of electricity, no longer pushing up the cost of doing business and no longer pushing up the cost of living for families. And that is why, given that we are in a much stronger position now than we were under the previous government when they made a decision that this particular tax cut was no longer appropriate, it is appropriate that we press ahead with this measure, particularly given the state of the budgets that we inherited from the previous Labor government. Not only did the previous Labor government spend about $200 billion more in their first five budgets than they raised in revenue but they left behind $123 billion in forward projected deficits in their last budget. And of course we know that Labor left behind a budget trajectory and a debt growth trajectory, taking Australia to government gross debt of $667 billion by 2023-24 and rising beyond that period. Under the trajectory that we were on as a result of the policy decisions of the previous government, there were deficits as far as the eye could see and there was debt growth as far as the eye could see. We have been able to reduce that spending-growth trajectory quite significantly as a result of the decisions that were made in our first and second budgets. It is good to see that, one by one and step by step, all of the various measures initiated by the government to improve the budget bottom line are being dealt with by the parliament and by the Senate.


It is good to see that we are now able to deal with one of the outstanding measures to improve the budget bottom line from the 2013-14 budget. On occasion I am asked how we are going with implementing budget measures from the 2014-15 and 2015-16 budgets, and I always point out to people that we are still working to do Labor's job for them. We are still working to implement budget measures way back from 2013 that Labor initiated and banked in their last budget. They banked the beneficial effect on the budget bottom line in their last budget, but never legislated. We are still working to do their work for them, with Labor, until today, opposing their own budget improvement measure.


I conclude by thanking all senators who have contributed to this debate. This is one of the measures from Labor's last budget that we said, while in opposition, we would support in government. We are sticking to that commitment we made in the lead-up to the last election. We are pleased that the opposition has come on board in supporting their own budget measure as well. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2015-06-17,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (12:45):  I rise today to speak once again about the Abbott government's blatant disregard for older Australians and the fact that there is no apparent plan to deal with dementia, which is now the second leading cause of death in Australia. The test for the Prime Minister's second federal budget was to plan for the future, but a coherent long-term vision for Australia's ageing population is nowhere to be seen. Tony Abbott is a notorious faux fixer whose poor record in dementia care funding and planning continues to be reiterated. The wool has not been pulled over our eyes, and those living with dementia, their families, friends and carers realise that the Abbott government and his ministers have nothing positive to offer them. All we are seeing are nasty surprises in store for the most vulnerable Australians. 


The lack of leadership and vision demonstrated by the minister responsible, the Assistant Minister for Social Services, Senator Mitch Fifield, during budget estimates was astounding. Senator Fifield likes to talk about his support for dementia, but his actions do not follow suit, and the insults to those with dementia just keep coming. Last year he left the sector shocked and reeling when he abandoned those with severe behaviours living in residential care by abolishing the dementia and severe behaviours supplement. Then he introduced his experimental, untested severe behaviour response teams, better known as 'flying squads', which are still grounded, with no flight path. He was asking tenderers for the flying squads to come up with a model for how they might work. This year he has overseen a nasty $20 million cut to dementia initiatives, hidden in the fine print of the budget. And now the senator plans to abandon over 25,000 Australians living with younger onset dementia, some only in their 30s and 40s, by discontinuing funding for the life-changing program they rely on, the Younger Onset Dementia Key Worker Program. 


 There are currently 630 people in Tasmania living with younger dementia who face ongoing issues that also affect their families. The only choice that these people may well have in the future is to go into residential care. The Younger Onset Dementia Key Worker program is discontinued and will be rolled into the NDIS in July 2016. This government forgets there is a human face behind this discontinued program. I can tell you from experience that residential care is not the answer for younger onset dementia. My own family has been touched by this. When my brother-in-law was 38, he was diagnosed after a number of years of not being able to identify what it was that he was suffering from. At 38 years of age, he found that he had early onset dementia. That was devastating for his young family. So I am speaking from firsthand experience. As I said, over 630 people in my home state of Tasmania are currently living with early onset dementia, and their families and communities lose out.


It would be a failure of the system for residential aged care to be the only answer. In most cases it is completely inappropriate for the needs of people with younger onset dementia. The government needs to work harder to find responsive and specialised solutions. It is clear that the Abbott government has abandoned vulnerable Australians living with dementia. The string of heartless cuts sends an unmistakable message to every person in Australia—to never trust this government again.


It is very disappointing and disheartening to see the Abbott government continually take an axe to the heavy lifting previously done by Labor to support our aged population. The Abbott government are out of touch with the most vulnerable Australians, because fairness is not something intrinsically imbedded in their values. They do not value older people. I have said this before and will say it again: I just do not understand why the Abbott government do not care about older people.


Older and vulnerable Australians do not need further cuts and uncertainty when it comes to their care, especially at a time when the aged-care system is undergoing significant changes. The Abbott government have not been able to demonstrate that it can be trusted to manage reform or to carry through the changes set down by the previous Labor government, because they have taken their eye off the ball. From the first day on which they took up the government benches, they have not been across the issues. The minister responsible has never been across the detail and he keeps dropping the ball. If the Abbott government continue on this path, Australia will lose its reputation of being a world leader in dementia awareness and risk reduction. 


This leads me to yet another nasty surprise for people living with dementia, as Tony Abbott discards the world's first dementia risk reduction program, Your Brain Matters. This is a program which saw Australia declared a world leader and pioneer in creating awareness and in public risk reduction programs. Tony Abbott is the reason Australia's aged-care sector is not world-class. 


Dementia is a deeply personal issue, and those living with dementia and their families deserve an adequately funded and strategic approach that responds to the complexity of dementia care. There are already more than 342,800 Australians living with dementia, a figure which, as we all know, is expected to triple by 2050. It really is not that far away. I am not sure that Mr Abbott and his ministers understand that, as our population ages, dementia will increase. It concerns me that many older people living with dementia are going to miss out on care they desperately need. Dementia is not going away, Mr Abbott, and we are all still waiting to see how you plan to make aged and dementia care easier to access, fairer and more sustainable into the future. We are all still waiting for dementia to be put at the forefront of the government's thinking and to start treating it as a national health priority—because it is a national health priority and an international health priority.


The public mood towards ageing is shifting, and the government must keep pace, listen up and learn. The government is ignoring the opportunities that ageing presents. Labor did the heavy lifting with the Living Longer Living Better campaign, which surrounds the notion that ageing should not be something that separates you from you community and society. It seems that the government has underestimated the level of leadership required to oversee the roll out of a significant reform such as Living Longer Living Better. Older Australians need certainty and the aged-care services sector needs stability. We would all like to know what the government is doing to make this happen.


What does it say about this government when it keeps cutting support from our most vulnerable in our communities? Labor understands that older Australians and those living with dementia deserve certainty; they most certainly do not deserve to be treated as a burden. Dementia is one of the biggest challenges for this country and of this century. It will also be one of greatest opportunities of the century. Labor will always stand up for fairness and the most vulnerable Australians. Only Labor will remain committed to listening, learning and working with the aged-care sector to grasp the opportunities and face the issues that arise. We owe it to those who built this great country to provide them with the aged-care facilities and the security they deserve as they age, and particularly those with dementia. Early onset dementia is devastating for younger people, and not only for them as individuals but for their families and for our community. 


We need to recognise these challenges; we need to have a minister and a government that has the vision, the plan and the drive to give this the priority we know it deserves. The evident failure of Tony Abbott when he became Prime Minister was that he did not designate a minister for ageing. That was the beginning of the end for him to demonstrate in any capacity at all to the Australian community that he put ageing where it should be—and that is as the No. 1 priority—(Time expired)

 (South Australia) (14:42):  My question is to the Minister for Finance. The 2015-16 budget shows an eight per cent increase in childcare spending, or a 40 per cent increase over four years, or, in dollar terms, from $6.5 billion to over $11 billion. The reason families need child care is that both parents are forced to go out to work because of high housing costs. Then there is the $3 billion a year the Commonwealth spends on housing assistance. We all know the cost of building a basic house has not risen, in real terms, in 20 years. But the cost of land has skyrocketed. In essence, the government is spending over $14 billion a year to offset rising land costs. This is treating the symptoms, not the illness. Does the government accept this?

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (14:42):  I thank Senator Day for that question and I also acknowledge his genuine interest in housing affordability for Australian families. In terms of the numbers he mentioned in relation to government expenditure on child care, Senator Day is broadly right. We expect to spend about $7.3 billion on government support for access to child care, in 2015-16. That is expected to rise to about $11 billion over the forward estimates. That is assuming, of course, that the Senate supports some of the spending reductions required out of the budget in order to pay for the additional investment into child care, because this government is committed to improving affordable access to child care and making access to child care simpler and more flexible, because we understand that is an important part of a strategy to help families get into work, stay in work and be in work. It is an important part of our strategy to strengthen growth and create more jobs.


When it comes to housing affordability more broadly, affordability is a function of both price and capacity to pay. Price is a function of supply and demand. In markets where you have demand exceeding supply, prices will go up. In markets where you have supply exceeding demand, prices will go down.


Senator Day is quite right. The housing affordability issue in Australia is principally an issue of land supply not meeting demand in the market. The principal lever to address that is at the state level, and the federal government is working, through the Treasurer, with state and territory governments to try and address that. I do not agree with Senator Day that housing building costs have not increased in real terms in Australia by international standards.

 (Western Australia—Minister for Finance) (14:45):  As I indicated in response to the primary question, the Treasurer is working with state and territory governments in relation to housing affordability policy issues. We do understand, of course, that the most sustainable way of improving housing affordability is by making sure that supply increases to a level where it can meet demand.


Australia has a growing population. We have, in particular, a growing population in some of the larger population centres, and obviously there are cycles in the property market. Right now, in Sydney and in Melbourne, demand significantly exceeds supply. There is of course a response in the market as a result. If you look at the national accounts for the first quarter of 2015, you will see that there is a lift in investment in dwelling construction, and that is clearly a response to that upward pressure on prices. But we do need to do more. We do need to ensure that the states actually do better in releasing land so that there can be a more appropriate response. (Time expired)

Senator CORMANN

They could decide not to sit on the land that they currently hold and have already developed in order to try and maximise profits. They could just release more land into the marketplace. If the state government in South Australia and state governments in other parts of Australia decided to do that, it would have a material beneficial effect on housing affordability.


Beyond that, we do need to have a mature conversation in Australia about why it is that in Australia it is significantly more expensive to build a house than it is in the United States, for example. Why is it significantly more expensive to build a house in Australia than in the United States?

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:04):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) and Senators Collins and O’Neill today relating to proposed amendments to citizenship laws and to recent media reports concerning people smugglers.


What an act it was by the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate. Unfortunately, it does not look like the senator can hold a candle to his leader, Senator Abetz. In his short time as acting leader, he has already alienated the crossbench and he has taken a frighteningly cavalier attitude towards Senate estimates by being more interested in the poem My Country than in his responsibilities to it, and more interested in his collection of classic Australian bush poems rather than in the budget situation. I think he was very aptly described the other day by my colleague on this side of the chamber Senator Cameron, who described him as the equivalent of Mulga Bill on his bicycle riding into the ditch, and that is where this government is taking Australia—into dangerous territory where we will suffer injury. 


The arrogance of the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate was absolutely on show again today, with the crossbench voting against the government, voting with the Labor Party and the Greens to institute two new inquiries to see what is actually going on, because this minister is determined to hide and to cover up from the Australian people every one of the dirty deals that characterise their actions with regard to international relations. The senator is facing divisive issues close to home, with his own cabinet colleagues selling him out to the media. There are at least some voices on the other side that will speak, it seems, to tell just a little of the truth to the Australian people, who this man is seeking to mislead. 


The senator refused to answer questions today about why he has excluded his own colleagues from receiving information from the Solicitor-General. Such hubris, such arrogance—that is the characteristic of this man that dominates every response in question time. Why? We have to ask. Does it show a lack of trust in his own colleagues? It would seem so. Perhaps it is an even greater problem for Senator Brandis that he is so on the outer now that his gaffe-after-gaffe prone activities have his colleagues not wanting to have anything to do with him. How much longer can the senator expect to continue on in this way?


I will go to the questions that were asked by Senator Collins first. The misrepresentation of the words of the noted silk, Mr Bret Walker SC, are very important, but they were merely brushed aside as irrelevant by the arrogant Attorney-General in his responses today. Mr Walker actually stated: 


My report does not provide a justification for what they intend to do—


'They' being the government—


It is not what I said nor what I think now and anyone who claims otherwise is wrong.


That is Mr Walker saying that the Attorney-General is wrong; and, indeed, Mr Walker is correct. Mr Walker casts doubt on the capacity of the government even to do the due diligence of checking reports carefully:


I doubt many of those citing my report have read beyond the one paragraph they refer to. That does not bode well for mature consideration or lawmaking.


What we saw on show here today was not mature consideration, and it was not a fair effort by any stretch of the imagination in answering the questions that were put to the Attorney-General today.


Senator Wong asked questions about why the foreign minister of the country was excluded from receiving advice from the Solicitor-General on the constitutionality of the proposal to strip citizenship from Australian nationals. Things are so dysfunctional, so bad, in the government ranks that they are hiding information from one another, let alone hiding it from the Australian public. I turn now to the questions that I asked about reports published in Australian papers today: Indonesian police reports, saying that people smugglers were actually paid by Australian officials to turn back the boats—recorded interviews, photographs of cash, reports about vessels crashing on reefs. These are facts that are on the public record in Australian newspapers. Instead of answering those questions, we have a government that says: 'The media reports are promoting discord.' They are promoting a question for the government—a question and a request that they tell the truth. We are relying on this government to finally come forward and actually speak the truth for a change.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-06-17,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:09):  The contrast between the government and the opposition in the Senate was evident for everybody to see today. When you saw the level of questions and the level of excellent responses by ministers to questions, the difference was absolutely amazing. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate asked questions that took less than one minute to respond to, because, as a former minister, Senator Wong herself knows that those questions that are raised in cabinet will not be the subject of commentary across the Senate chamber. Adding further insult to herself, Senator Wong then went on and quoted from Minister Turnbull, only to find the excellent Attorney-General turn that around against her and he, of course, concurred with Mr Turnbull's comments about the rule of law. That did not take very long—did it?—before we got to the questions asked by Senator O'Neill. The Attorney-General, of course, had no hesitation in drawing Senator O'Neill's attention to the words of her own leader, Mr Shorten when he went on to say—



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator BACK:
  I did not interfere when you were speaking, Senator O'Neill. Mr Deputy President, I did not interrupt when Senator O'Neill was speaking, but it is interesting that Mr Shorten made the statement that governments do not comment on security matters. Who was the authoritative—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator BACK:
  Who was the authoritative source that Senator O'Neill was quoting?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Back, you might resume your seat. The Senate needs to come to order.




Senator BACK:
  I was being distracted by those opposite, Mr Deputy President. The authoritative source that Senator O'Neill was quoting from was none other than the captain of the people smugglers himself. What a wonderful reputation!



Senator O'Neill interjecting—



Senator Lines interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator BACK:
  What a wonderful source that person would be to be quoted by a senator from the Labor opposition.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senators should cease interjecting.




Senator BACK:
  As everybody in this place knows, we are talking about the six years when we know about a person who drowned at sea every second day. There were many more—




Senator O'Neill:
  Tell the truth!




Senator Lines:
  The truth will come out!




Senator BACK:
  Tell the truth? Those are the body counts! Those are the body counts, Mr Deputy President. But when you go to speak to those naval officers, as we had the opportunity to do—I asked them: 'Was 1200 the real number?' They said: 'They are the ones we know about, Senator Back.' I had Senator McEwen with me on that occasion when we travelled up to Darwin for that inquiry. 


As the Attorney-General has told us, US $500 million was poured into the pockets of people smugglers as a result of the failure of the last government. There were 50,000 illegal arrivals, who were put on more than 800 leaking vessels, as the result of the encouragement given to them by your government. Then, of course, we come to the commentary by Senator Collins on the Attorney-General with regard to Mr Bret Walker. I have had the opportunity to read some of the final report of Mr Bret Walker, and probably the most accurate thing that Senator O'Neill quoted was that Mr Walker seems to have changed his mind; it is his opinion now.




Senator O'Neill:
  That is not what I said.




Senator BACK:
  Mr Deputy President, here are some of the comments that Mr Walker made in his final report. First of all, Mr Walker—




Senator O'Neill:
  That is not what I said.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator BACK:
  If you listened, rather than tried to speak, you might learn.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Back, just resume your seat. I have been constantly calling the Senate to order, and it is time that the interjections ceased completely.




Senator BACK:
  The points I wish to make with regard to Mr Walker's comments in his final report are these. First of all, he said that dual citizenship is not a human right; he referred to the action going on in Britain, where a similar discretion is given to the Secretary of State—a minister of the government. Of course, Senator Brandis made no commentary at all, either yesterday or today. He made no commentary at all on what Mr Bret Walker said. For the benefit again of Senator Collins, he merely read out verbatim from Mr Walker's report. Now Mr Walker might come back and want to retract—to change it, to amend it or whatever—but to attack the Attorney-General on something that Mr Walker himself had said in his report is a bit rich.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2015-06-17,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales) (15:15):  I was actually hoping I could cede my time to Senator Back to keep him going, but unfortunately I am not sure I can! To take the heat out of the issue a little bit, I want to talk about some of the substance of what we are actually here to discuss—taking note of the answers from Senator Brandis to the questions that were asked of him. I think the real concern here is that fundamentally it comes down to how we as a Senate want to tackle this question of transparency and information. What are the opportunities and what role should this Senate be playing? I think it is unfortunate that some of the opportunities to answer the true questions that are being asked and which were asked today for Senator Brandis to respond to are being missed. The issue of transparency and information and getting to the bottom of what has happened—




Senator Bernardi:
  Did you get paid money to be on the ABC program?




Senator Conroy:
  Maybe he'll get a Walkley!




Senator Bernardi:
  A Walkley? Or a Logie!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Dastyari, take your seat. We might let the other senators exhaust their comments and then we will resume. When the Senate comes to order, I will give you the call.




Senator DASTYARI:
  I have fans everywhere, and there are fans in this chamber. That is fine. It does not bother me. I will be doing autographs later in the evening!


On the issue of transparency—and I think this is really important—legitimate concerns are being raised regarding what has happened on the high seas and what has happened with the purported amounts of cash. They are, at this point in time, simply allegations. No-one from this side is coming forward and saying that they are necessarily matters of fact. We are saying that these are serious allegations. They are important allegations. They are allegations of a significant nature. They have been made. It is in the interests of us in the Senate and in the interests of the parliament for us to be able to have an open, frank and transparent debate within the boundaries of what is and is not in the national interest, taking into consideration the national security implications.


I think it is unfortunate that the Attorney-General, when asked these questions today, chose to try to turn that which was a legitimate debate into something that it was not. Let's be clear: nobody wants or should want to see people die at sea. Nobody wants to see people smuggling. We as a Senate, a parliament and a nation want to have a proper debate about the best way to bring these kinds of practices to an end. There is a legitimate concern that, if paying people smugglers is a technique that is being used, that should not be the path forward. Yet, unfortunately, when we tried to go down that path of questioning, when we tried to go down a legitimate line of inquiry with legitimate questions about how much money has been given, we ended up having obfuscation, with the Attorney-General doing everything he could to avoid answering the real question.


Unfortunately we saw that happen as well when we were talking about the issue of national security and dual citizenship. Again, let's have the debate. There are people in this chamber and in this parliament who believe that there may be a case in the right circumstances for the stripping of dual citizenship. There may not be a case for that. We want to make sure. We have to look at the specifics and have that debate. I think it is unfortunate that we are trying to do this in the vacuum of actual legislation. If legislation had been presented and put forward, it would be a lot easier for us to have these debates.


But, again, when we try to ask some legitimate questions that have been raised by someone as senior as Bret Walker SC, what do we get? We get stonewalling. We get the debate being shifted. So far, in what have been very difficult debates, I think it has been a positive development for this parliament that there has been, to an extent, so much bipartisanship on these kinds of issues. But that cannot exist when the information is not there. You cannot have a bipartisan approach in a vacuum. Unfortunately, we have not seen this legislation and, when we ask legitimate questions of the Attorney-General, he tries to enact a bit of theatre and play some games but he does not answer them.

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2015-06-17,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (15:20):  I, too, would like to take note of the answers given by Senator Brandis to questions from Senators Wong, Collins and O'Neill. The answer given to especially Senator O'Neill's question comes down to what we are doing on border security. It is interesting that we take the word of a people smuggler, someone who appears on television wearing a balaclava. I think this comes down to the different approach taken between our parties. It is the coalition who have strengthened the borders and have strengthened border security in this country. It is the coalition who have stopped the boats. It is the coalition who have put a steel border up—




Senator Lines:
  Paid the boats.




Senator McGRATH:
  I am happy to take interjections. We sat here quietly on this side and listened to the other side. I sat here very quietly—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McGrath, just resume your seat for a moment. I do not think anyone can claim that this motion to take note of answers given today has been without interjections from both sides. I have called the Senate to order on a number of occasions, and I would ask the Senate to remain in order for the remainder of Senator McGrath's contribution.




Senator McGRATH:
  I should put on record that I did interject. I certainly smiled and laughed at some of the interjections, so I am guilty, as charged, of that. It is very important to look at the consistency in some of the responses that have been given by the different leaders. Labor last night again refused to rule out what it has called on the government to rule out. On 7.30 last night, it was reported that the ABC had asked Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, if he could rule out the possibility that payments had been made to people smugglers by the former government during the Rudd-Gillard years. A Labor spokesperson said:


It's unlawful … to divulge security or intelligence information.


The Abbott coalition government has implemented, lawfully, a suite of proven policies that have stopped the boats. We have done what governments before us have done but applied the measures with vigour and resolve. We have broken the people smugglers' business model. This is what it comes down to. The person who is quoted in today's paper and who appeared on Sky News today is a people smuggler. It is someone who makes their money out of the misery of other human beings. I do not think we should be taking their word in terms of telling the truth.


It is also significant that the deputy opposition leader yesterday refused to commit her party to maintaining the tough border policies that ended the years of dysfunction and failure of the Rudd-Gillard governments. The question that probably should be put is: where does Labor and Mr Shorten stand on turn-backs? Our record stands for itself. The most decent—the most moral—thing you can do is stop the boats and stop the deaths at sea. Even on Sky TV this morning, the member for Fraser, Andrew Leigh, when asked if the Labor Party paid people smugglers, said that it would be inappropriate for him to comment on operational matters. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, also refused to comment on the same question when asked in a press conference earlier today.


This government will not detail operational activities under Operation Sovereign Borders. What matters is that, under our policy, the boats are stopping. Illegal maritime migration is being stemmed and so are the deaths at sea. My colleague Senator Back from Western Australia made mention of the 1,200 people—the known 1,200 people—who perished at sea under the former Labor-Green government. Those were 1,200 people who we could have saved if our policies had been in operation. In 2008, we had seven boats; in 2013, 302 boats arrived. Since we were elected, in 2014 and 2015, only one boat has arrived. We have put up borders of steel; whereas the Labor Party, sadly, through their failed policies, had, effectively, borders of lace. They put together a border of their nannas' doilies to create a border to stop people smugglers—and it did not work. (Time expired)

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (15:26):  I rise to take note of answers from Senator Brandis to questions from Senators Wong, Collins and O'Neill. I would like to put on the record that my grandmother was a staunch feminist and she would not have had a doily in her house to put anywhere.



Senator Fierravanti-Wells interjecting—




Senator LINES:
  Again, we see this broad generalisation, these sweeping statements from the government to anything that is serious.



Senator Sterle interjecting—




Senator LINES:
  Today, when we tried to ask very serious questions about citizenship, about cabinet leaks—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Lines, just resume your seat. The Senate needs to come to order. I want Senator Lines to be given the same respect that I insisted be given to Senator McGrath—and that is to be heard in silence.




Senator LINES:
  What those opposite do not like to hear is the truth. There are very serious questions being asked in Australia right now by voting Australians and by the media about what really transpired on the high seas. The government can say all it likes. They may have stopped the boats. They have certainly turned boats around and they have made boats disappear. But what they do not appreciate, because they are really a government of the 1960s, is that the media has moved on. We have a 24/7 media now; we have Twitter; we have Facebook; we have all sorts of investigations going on—and you cannot hide these things. This morning, whether they liked it or not, evidence came out that the Abbott government paid captains of leaky boats to turn them around and go back to Indonesia. We will hear more and more about that. Just like their cabinet leak, that leak is now out, and more and more journalists will go after the truth.


We heard Senator Brandis use the term 'braying' in here. Well, I heard braying from Senator Brandis today. That is what we heard in this place today. The government can berate and they can ridicule and they can yell like Senator Back chose to do, but the truth will come out—and it is slowly coming out. They can refuse to answer questions; one week they will give a comment and the next week they will not. But the truth about what is happening on our high seas—despite the government trying to brand everything as an on-water matter or trying to brand everything as something that is national security—will eventually come out. We will not resile from asking the hard questions in this place. They can refuse to give answers, or they can give ridiculous, insulting 10-second answers like we heard today from Senator Brandis. But we will continue to ask them—and the truth will come out. What an embarrassing start to the day it was to have two inquiries simply because they refused to tell the truth, simply because they will not come clean in this place, simply because somehow they think they can avoid scrutiny. Well, they cannot.


On the issue of citizenship, we have heard all sorts of rumours. We know, for example, there is a real problem in the government, not just between the backbenchers and the government but between cabinet ministers. There is a real issue on the issue of citizenship. As usual, the Abbott government has jumped out there and tried to bully people and somehow lead by berating and belittling people, while others in the cabinet have said, 'Hang on, enough's enough.' So now they have a leak in their cabinet. Despite them now not wanting to talk to us about what they might be proposing in the area of citizenship, they pretend they are still consulting. That will not wash either.


Now an eminent QC has made comments in the media, and what do we see? We just see cherry-picking by Senator Brandis. Although Bret Walker himself said he has been misquoted, did that stop the flurry of Senator Brandis insulting him? No. Senator Brandis might like to read fiction and poetry at Senate estimates, but, if the man who wrote the report said, 'I didn't say that,' the fiction given in answers by Senator Brandis to questions today will not wash. The government needs to learn that you might be able to hoodwink some people some of the time but that that does not last. Bret Walker today clearly said—I heard him myself this morning on the radio—that he has been misquoted. Yet here today the man who said bigots are good somehow tried to suggest, 'No, no. Bret Walker got that wrong; this is what he said.' Cherry-picking will not wash. I am sure Bret Walker will continue to defend himself, as he should, and we in this place will continue the hard questions. (Time expired)

The speeches read as follows—



AIRPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2015


On 15 April 2014 the Australian Government announced that the site for Western Sydney's new airport will be Badgerys Creek. This delivers on a Government promise when in Opposition to make a decision on Sydney's future airport needs during its first term in office. 


It demonstrates the Government's commitment to the Western Sydney region. A new airport will be a major boost for the local economy and create thousands of jobs during construction and a pipeline of jobs once an airport becomes operational. These benefits are being seen already with the start of construction of road upgrades to support the proposed new airport. 


The Government continues to deliver on this commitment with the progression of formal consultations with Sydney Airport Group on developing the proposed airport and the commencement of a new environmental impact assessment for the Badgerys Creek site. 


A new airport for Western Sydney will create infrastructure for the 21st century and generate jobs and economic growth in Western Sydney.


To ensure these outcomes can be realised as soon as possible the Airports Amendment Bill 2015 amends the Airports Act 1996 to provide for the creation of an airport plan for the proposed Western Sydney Airport. The Airports Act provides the framework to manage and operate Australia's federally leased airports. 


The airport plan will authorise the initial development, and specify the Australian Government's requirements for the airport. 


It will do this by taking processes ordinarily relating to master plans and major development plans currently in the Airports Act and combining them into a single streamlined process applicable to a greenfield airport development. 


In doing so, the Bill recognises the importance of the environmental assessment process currently underway for the airport, and confers an approval function on the Environment Minister in relation to environmental matters. 


The usual process in Major Development Plans is for a referral to be made to the Environment Minister for the project to be assessed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 if required, and for the Environment Minister to provide advice to the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, who is the final decision maker on the plan.


Badgerys Creek is a greenfield development, and preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement is underway, and will be finalised under the EPBC Act. This Bill will require the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development to incorporate in the plan any environmental conditions imposed by the Minister for the Environment following completion of the EIS.


The community will have the opportunity to comment on both the environmental impact statement and airport plan as consultation on each will occur at the same time.


Once the airport plan is in place, no further planning or development approvals will be required prior to initial construction commencing. It will enable detailed design and construction planning to commence as soon as possible after contract signature.


This is a practical, common sense measure that recognises the unique circumstances of a greenfield airport development.


The Bill also includes measures that would help the Government pivot to ready alternatives if Sydney Airport Group turns down an offer to develop and operate the proposed airport. 


Under the 2002 sale agreement for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, the owners of Sydney Airport have a right of first refusal to develop and operate a second major airport within 100 kilometres of Sydney's centre. 


Once the consultation period is complete, the Government will come to a decision on the need for and nature of a second Sydney airport in Western Sydney. This is a contractual step required before the Government can make an offer. 


This offer must be made to Sydney Airport Group first. If it declines to accept, the offer can be made to third parties, or the Commonwealth can undertake the project itself. 


However, the Airports Act currently effectively prevents the Commonwealth from taking either of these actions in the event Sydney Airport Group declines to accept the offer. 


Section 18 of the Airports Act requires that the airport-lessee companies for Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, and any airport site declared to be Sydney West Airport, as it is referred to in the Airports Act, must be subsidiaries of the same company. This is a legacy provision from the Airports Act as originally passed in 1996. 


While the Government is contractually obliged to engage commercially with the Sydney Airport Group, and is not opposed to a common ownership situation, it needs to be legislatively possible for the two airports to be under different ownership in the event Sydney Airport Group turns down an offer to develop and operate the airport. 


The Airports Amendment Bill removes the requirement of common ownership, providing the Commonwealth with the commercial flexibility to deal with third parties or to develop the airport itself if required. 


The Bill also removes the airport cross-ownership restrictions currently placed on Sydney West Airport. These restrictions prevent cross-ownership of more than 15% between Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth airports and a new airport at Badgerys Creek. The amendment will help maximise the success of any market offering in the event Sydney Airport Group choose not to exercise an option to develop and operate the airport. 


This amendment is about giving the Government the commercial flexibility it requires to get the best outcome for the people of Western Sydney and the Australian economy more broadly.


Separately, the Bill contains some mechanical provisions to facilitate declaration of the airport site and other prepatory work. 


The Airports Amendment Bill 2015 will help ensure the economic and social benefits of an airport for Western Sydney can be realised as soon as possible. 


Customs Amendment (Australian Trusted Trader Programme) Bill 2015


SECOND READING SPEECH


The Customs Amendment (Australian Trusted Trader Programme) Bill 2015 will amend the Customs Act 1901 to establish the Australian Trusted Trader Programme, set up the framework for the programme and enable Trusted Traders to benefit from streamlined customs procedures.


The programme has been co-designed with industry stakeholders, partner agencies and international counterparts both at multilateral and bilateral levels. 


The programme provides an opportunity to reduce the regulation of our international traders and enhance supply chain security. Consistent with the World Customs Organization SAFE Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade, the Australian Trusted Trader Programme will introduce a differentiated trust-based regulatory framework at the border for those entities that meet or exceed international supply chain security and trade compliance standards. 


Entities meeting these standards will be assessed as low-risk and benefit from reduced regulatory burden and streamlined customs procedures. This will alleviate a significant trade burden and enhance the competitiveness of Australian international businesses.


This approach, which is commonly known as the Authorized Economic Operator model, has been adopted by all of Australia's major trading partners over the last ten years. It is also consistent with the Government's deregulation agenda and contributes to the Economic Action Strategy and the Prime Minister's Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda. 


The approach is also a key component of the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade Facilitation and an integral part of the Government's commitment to foster legitimate trade as outlined in the Government's G20 Australia 2014 - Comprehensive Growth Strategy. 


The programme is a trade facilitation initiative based on internationally recognised supply chain security and trade compliance principles that contribute to a holistic compliance framework. 


It is an important element of the compliance continuum that will provide a better understanding of the entities moving goods across our borders. This strategy will work to 'shrink the haystack' by removing accredited entities from traditional transaction based border risk assessment. This reform is important for managing the increasing volume of trade growth and ensuring that resources can be diverted away from highly compliant traders to focus on risk and non-compliance.  


The pilot phase of the programme is intended to commence on 1 July 2015 for a period of 12 months. The pilot phase will include a limited number of participants to test and refine processes and the design. The amendments to the customs act included in this bill will support the operation of the pilot phase. 


Firstly, the bill will amend the customs act to enable the Comptroller-General of Customs to establish the programme in accordance with the framework set out in the bill. Participation in the programme is voluntary and will allow entities such as importers, exporters, customs brokers, freight forwarders and transport companies to nominate themselves to participate in the programme.


Secondly, the bill will amend the customs act to set up the framework for the programme. There are three key powers under the framework. 


The first is the power of the Comptroller-General of Customs to enter into a trusted trader agreement. Entering into a trusted trader agreement will confer an interim trusted trader status on the entity. An entity with interim trusted trader status may receive certain administrative benefits which will be prescribed in the rules. These kinds of benefits will provide a more streamlined experience to the Trusted Trader when interacting with the Department. 


The second is the power of the Comptroller-General of Customs to vary a trusted trader agreement following physical inspection and audit to confer an ongoing trusted trader status. An entity with an ongoing trusted trader status may receive additional benefits, including benefits that streamline procedures in relation to the reporting, movement and clearance of goods.  


The third power is the power of the Comptroller-General of Customs to vary, suspend or terminate a trusted trader agreement unilaterally if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the entity has not complied with, or is not complying with conditions prescribed by the rules or terms or conditions specified in the agreement. The first operational response to non-compliance with conditions prescribed by the rules or terms or conditions specified in the agreement will, in general, be engagement, education and training. This approach is consistent with the partnership ethos of the programme. However, the nature of non-compliance may be such that it is necessary to vary, suspend or terminate a trusted trader agreement. 


The bill amends the customs act to provide for the external merits review of decisions made by the Comptroller-General of Customs in relation to these three powers. This will be in addition to an administrative internal review mechanism.


The bill will also amend the customs act to allow the Comptroller-General of Customs to maintain a register, known as the Register of Trusted Trader Agreements. The Register will demonstrate to the public that an entity has an agreement with the Comptroller-General of Customs, and has demonstrated a satisfactory level of supply chain security and trade compliance standards in their international supply chain activities. This information may be necessary for other entities in the international supply chain to make an informed decision when they are choosing business partners and want to link with other trusted traders to ensure an end to end secure international supply chain. 


Finally, the bill will amend the customs act to enable the Comptroller-General of Customs, by legislative instrument, to make rules in relation to the operation of the programme. Consistent with the co-design approach, consultation on the rules will be undertaken before the rules are made. 


In summary, the reform delivered through this bill will support the government's priority of ensuring Australia's ongoing success as an open economy. This bill will enable the Australian Border Force and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to create stronger borders by 'shrinking the haystack'. 


The commencement of the programme will enhance Australia's capacity at the border to manage the exponential growth in trade volume by diverting resources away from highly compliant traders to focus on risk and non-compliance.

The speeches read as follows—



EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL) BILL 2015


The Excise Tariff Amendment (Ethanol and Biodiesel) Bill 2015 implements the Government's 2014-15 Budget measures to reform the taxation treatment of biodiesel and fuel ethanol. As part of that implementation the Energy Grants and Other Legislation Amendment (Ethanol and Biodiesel) Bill 2015 abolishes the Cleaner Fuels Grant Scheme.


In last year's Budget, the Government announced changes to the taxation of biodiesel and fuel ethanol to better balance the need to support these important Australian industries while keeping the budget position on track.


Currently domestically produced biodiesel and fuel ethanol and imported biodiesel are subject to the same rate of excise as petrol and diesel. However, these fuel producers and importers are able to access a grant for the full amount of duty paid. 


The Cleaner Fuel Grants Scheme refunds excise and excise equivalent customs duty paid on both imported and domestically produced biodiesel. 


A similar scheme, the Ethanol Production Grants Scheme, which refunds excise paid on fuel ethanol to domestic producers, will cease on 30 June 2015.


Instead of these grant schemes, the excise payable on domestic production of biodiesel and fuel ethanol will be reduced to zero and will then gradually increase to a reduced rate. The new excise rate for biodiesel will reach 50 per cent of the full rate of excise that applies to petrol and diesel; and the new rate for fuel ethanol will reach approximately 33 per cent of that rate.


Imported biodiesel and fuel ethanol will be subject to the full fuel duty rate. 


The Government is mindful of the important role that domestic fuel ethanol and biodiesel producers play in the economy and the importance of encouraging diversity in Australia's fuel mix. 


Biodiesel and fuel ethanol producers contribute to the Australian economy through their fuel production processes; and having a range of alternative fuels has a positive effect on Australia's energy security.


The Government's role in facilitating the success of Australian industries has to be balanced against the Government's debt and the cost to the future prosperity of Australians of fiscal policies that do not maintain a sustainable trajectory back to surplus. 


For this reason the Government has decided to move domestically produced fuel ethanol and biodiesel into the excise system and apply excise with reference to energy content. This approach is consistent with the Government's approach to other alternative fuels and will ensure that fuels are taxed fairly and transparently.


The approach in these bills recognises both that biodiesel is a close substitute for conventional diesel and that fuel ethanol has lower energy content than petrol or diesel.


This treatment in respect of domestically produced biodiesel and fuel ethanol is consistent with Australia's long standing Government policy to tax alternative fuels at half the energy equivalent rate. This policy recognises not only the potential benefits of these alternative fuels, but also the desirability of tax neutrality across alternative fuels. This puts in the hands of Australians the choice of fuel, rather than it being dictated by its tax treatment. 


The Government is committed to working constructively with the Opposition and other Members and Senators to pass these reforms through the Parliament. 


The Government is setting Australia on a realistic return to surplus. We will make the decisions that are needed to repair the budget and maintain the integrity of the tax system. 


These decisions form the basis of an economy that will be well placed to ensure the future prosperity of Australia and Australians. 


The Government's progress back to surplus has made significant progress. As part of the commitment to repair the budget, the Government is prepared to make the right decisions to ensure that the return to surplus occurs as soon as possible. The 2015-16 Budget maintains a steady and credible trajectory towards surplus, despite a $52 billion write down in tax receipts and the iron ore price almost halving since the 2014 15 Budget.


The savings provided by these measures are part of the Government's broader plan to return Australia to surplus. 


Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


 


ENERGY GRANTS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL) BILL 2015


The Energy Grants and Other Legislation Amendment (Ethanol and Diesel) Bill 2015 is one of a number of bills in this package that implements measures to change the taxation treatment of fuel ethanol and biodiesel.


The measures remove existing grant schemes and instead provide that the domestic production of biodiesel and fuel ethanol will be subject to a reduced but gradually increasing rate of excise.


Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.

"Muir, Sen Ricky",AMEP,2015-06-17,"



Senator MUIR
 (Victoria) (17:32):  I will backtrack just a little from where I was in my speech where I pointed out that the inclusion of woody biomass into the renewable energy target is not a new suggestion. I pointed out that as a matter of fact for 10 years it was included in the RET and, despite outright lies from the Greens and now Labor—or certain factions of it—and extreme environmentalists, it did not lead to one extra tree being harvested; it only led to one RET being handed out.


I have received many emails and phone calls from constituents who are gravely concerned about the so-called destructions of our native forests and, rightfully so: it is not their fault that they have been misled. However, their concerns are about issues that are not related to the inclusion of woody biomass at all.


The inclusion of woody biomass is to include by-products of current harvesting operations as an eligible source of energy in the RET. We are not on about harvesting or logging any extra forest; we are on about utilising biomass that is left over.


We are speaking about a by-product that will rot and break down releasing carbon or methane into the atmosphere as it currently does or get pushed into the windrows and burnt. We are speaking of utilising a by-product of current harvesting projects; we are not speaking of cutting down a single extra tree, not one—just like it was when woody biomass was included in the RET for 10 years before the Labor party made an agreement with the Greens. This was a decision that the Labor party made, to the best of my knowledge, without even consulting the forestry division of the CFMEU.


Perhaps now is a good time for me to remind the Labor party that, before I got involved in politics, I was a paid-up union member and what one would call a traditional Labor voter. Now would be a very good time to remind you of who your traditional voters are. By trying to appease the Green votes, all you are doing is getting a nod of approval from people who are going to vote green anyway.


I would like to point out correspondence that I have received from the CFMEU where around 30 delegates from within the timber industry have pleaded for the support of their jobs, saying:


The ALP's proposed continued discrimination of electricity derived from waste, product or bi-product derived from biomass from native forests as an eligible source under the RET is extremely disappointing and unfair. The proposal is also without any justification as it is clear from the regulations that only wood waste from sustainably managed forests is permitted and that electricity generation must not be the driver for the harvesting operations—


that means that we cannot harvest forest just to generate electricity.


In support of our jobs, we would appreciate it if you could use your influence to ensure the defeat of the ALP amendment to the bill.


I would also like to make a point that a misleading meme on social media is not a fact and, as a matter of fact, can create a lot of unnecessary unrest for those who actually believe what the meme might say but also for those who are employed in an industry who think that their jobs are going to be axed.


I have a photo here that I am happy to table—if the chamber is happy for me to do so—which shows the extent of what is utilised in the timber industry and, in this instance ASH—Australian Sustainable Hardwoods—Australia's largest hardwood timber mill, a mill with which I am extremely familiar as I worked there for a number of years. The picture helps highlights the protection that the high-value test contributes to ensuring that wood waste would not be a driver in harvesting operations.


It clearly shows an offcut which is 50 millimetres by 38 millimetres by about 30 centimetres in length. This is then joined by a finger joiner—again, I have worked in this industry and this mill; I have seen it with my own eyes; I know—with other similar lengths and turned into high-value products such as floor joists, window components, door components, stair stringers and more. These products are then sold to manufacturers at set lengths minimising their waste. So the manufacturers are able to buy product which is essentially made to size out of waste which has not been burnt for electricity.


What waste is left over is then turned into chips and sold to Australian Paper, Maryvale.


By ensuring the procurement of Australian paper we will then ensure that the high-value test would still apply on waste. By not procuring Australian paper we run the risk of seeing Australian manufactured paper and the industry that is supported by it cease, leaving us to rely on products that are imported from countries that do not have our chains of custody from forests that may not be sustainably managed. If we do not utilise the by-product of our timber industry and let our timber industry go down the drain, we are still going to be buying products from somewhere else, where forests are not managed as well as we manage our forests here.


Some of the sawdust from Australian sustainable hardwood is used to create heat to operate their kilns to dry the timber. If they were not using that sawdust—which is dry, so it burns very clean—it saves them about $4 million every year in gas bills. So, not only will we be having waste products from milling going to waste and breaking down but also the mill would have a $4 million gas bill. We would have a product breaking down and releasing emissions and also using emissions to dry the product in the first place instead of utilising what was already there. In the timber industry in Victoria—and I mention Victoria because it is my state—it will be 21,000 jobs. That is a lot of people whose jobs will be affected if we do not respect what industry we have. 


Another point I would like to make before finishing is that it is suggested that woody biomass comes from AFCS-certified native forests. That is all good and fine except that there is not one single native forest that is actually under AFCS certification. So, for us to move an amendment like that would essentially mean nothing.


In conclusion, I think it is important that we do get the renewable energy target through, as I said at the very start. We need bipartisan support. We did see that in the lower house, and I would like to see the target go through this house, unamended, as is—or at least, if there are any amendments, with support from both sides.


I seek leave to table a document.


Leave granted.

Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (17:39):  I believe in climate change and I believe that if the world does not act to change our ways we will continue to expedite our progress of evolution to extinction. To quote David Suzuki:


If we want to address global warming, along with the other environmental problems associated with our continued rush to burn our precious fossil fuels as quickly as possible, we must learn to use our resources more wisely, kick our addiction, and quickly start turning to sources of energy that have fewer negative impacts.


David is just one of many internationally revered and renowned environmental champions committed to raising awareness of climate change and the need for the world to act before it is too late. And these global champions are not alone. Countries across the world are actively putting programs in place to increase adoption of renewable energy. The role of the federal government is to manage our country in the most responsible, ethical and diligent way possible. In doing this, the people of Australia expect the federal government to demonstrate leadership that is incorruptible, fair, forward thinking and, importantly, in the best interests of all for today and our future tomorrow. Sadly, we have witnessed poor leadership from the Abbott government in relation to many issues, including our country's commitment to and management of renewable energy. Evidence, scientific research and general understanding tells us that climate change is real and that the burning of fossil fuel is a major contributor to this. We know that the only way forward is to transition from burning fossil fuel to using cleaner, greener energy. In fact, the G7 has just announced its commitment to completely eliminate the use of fossil fuel by the year 2100.


Australia currently has a renewable energy target of 41,000 gigawatts. The RET is a critical tool in providing the infrastructure and target necessary to facilitate and enable the uptake of renewable energy across this country. Australia's RET is in step with the rest of the world. As I have already said, countries across world are adopting clear, progressive and well-defined renewable energy targets. They are doing this to encourage, facilitate and support investment in and the adoption of renewable energy. Since the Abbott government has come to power they have done nothing but criticise and demonise the renewable energy target and the renewable energy sector. In fact, the Abbott government's reluctance to commit to the RET of 41,000 has eroded confidence in the sector, which has in turn caused a significant and sharp downturn in investment in the renewable energy sector. I can only assume that political donations being made by rich multinational mining companies to the pockets of the coalition are affecting the federal government's decision making and policy decisions around renewable energy. Is this the type of leadership we need in this country? I say no.


Thankfully, some states and territories across Australia are doing the right thing in relation to renewable energy. The government of Queensland has committed to a renewable energy target of 50 per cent by 2030. The ACT government has put in place a renewable energy target of 90 per cent by 2020. The South Australian government has put in place a renewable energy target of 33 per cent by 2020. Despite this, the federal government has not only demonstrated poor leadership on renewable energy but has now jumped into bed with the Labor Party and agreed to reduce Australia's renewable energy target from 41,000 gigawatts to 33,000 gigawatts.


I cannot and will not be part of this dirty deal that reduces Australia's renewable energy target and our country's commitment to the renewable energy sector. If the Abbott government and the opposition are successful in reducing Australia's renewable energy target, Australia will become the first country in the world to reduce a RET. I cannot and will not be part of this despicable act. For the sake of my children and all Australians and our country's future and role as an international citizen in progressing the best interests of the world I want to do whatever I can to stop this dirty deal from taking place.


That is why I have developed several amendments to this bill to maintain the RET at 41,000 gigawatts and to commit 8,000 gigawatts of the 41,000 to large-scale solar. Australia is one of the biggest adopters of solar power across the world. We need to do more in this country to support the solar power industry, to support solar power users and to reduce the costs associated with renewable energy. Maintaining our commitment to the RET and the renewable energy sector will achieve this by encouraging investment and innovation.


We also need to develop a national feed-in tariff rate for all users of rooftop solar. This will provide the people of Australia with certainty and consistency in relation to the benefits arising from solar power technology. I believe I have the support of all Australians in my desire to stop a reduction in the RET and to encourage investment in the renewable energy sector. Our future is too important. I should add that the Abbott government is also seeking to include the burning of native forest wood in the RET. I have serious concerns regarding this and, as a result, I will also be putting forward amendments to address these concerns in this bill.


In summary, I do not want Australia to become the first country in the world to reduce a RET and I do not want unfettered cutting down of native forest timber to be included in the RET. I am standing up for all Australians and I hope the Senate will support me by voting for my amendments. If the Abbott government had taken a responsible approach to the management of the RET from day one, shown strong leadership and pulled up its sleeves to assist and support our country to reach the 41,000 target by 2020, we would not be in the mess we are in today. Sadly, the Abbott government's deplorable approach to renewable energy has sent our country backwards, hurting investment, our international reputation, local jobs and local businesses. We now have much to do to restore confidence in the renewable energy sector and to put our country back on the right path to cleaner, greener, more responsible renewable energy. Supporting my amendments will assist in this process.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-06-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (17:47):  I thank all senators who have contributed to this debate on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. There has been a range of contributions, and I acknowledge that nearly every contributor has expressed their principled support in some way, shape or form for the ongoing development of the renewable energy industries in Australia and the importance of renewable energy as part of our energy make-up and mix. Different senators have brought different perspectives as to how that is best achieved, but I am pleased that it has been broadly a range of constructive contributions, notwithstanding some of the finer points of difference that different senators may have.


In relation to this legislation, it is important to understand that we are standing by the attainment and policy of a 20 per cent target for renewable energy by 2020. But what is happening under the current legislative framework is that we are tracking towards 26 per cent or more, which would result in Australians being required to pay for excessive generating capacity that is not needed in terms of our energy sector. This bill seeks to achieve balanced reform. It will provide certainty to industry, encourage further investment in renewable energy and better reflect market conditions. It will also help Australia to reach its emissions targets and protect jobs and consumer interests. On best available expectations, it will lead to around 23 per cent of Australia's electricity being sourced from renewable energy by 2020, still significantly more than the originally intended 20 per cent from when the current legislative settings were put in place.


This will be done in significant part by reducing the annual large-scale renewable energy target, such that it will reach 33,000 gigawatt hours in 2020, as against the current setting of 41,000 gigawatt hours. It will be maintained at 33,000 gigawatt hours from 2021 to 2030. This will help to encourage further investment in renewable energy by providing market stability and confidence, achieving a better balance between supply and demand. It means that the many renewable energy projects that are ready to roll will be able to proceed with certainty around the target, which I expect and am pleased to note appears to enjoy bipartisan support. It will better reflect market conditions.


The reality is that Australia has an oversupply of generation. Electricity demand is falling. The modelling and expectations on which the target had been set have proven to be fundamentally flawed. So the lower target means that additional capacity will be added in a far more responsible way that better reflects demand, as was the original intent of the legislation to achieve around 20 per cent, to meet the target of 20 per cent, and we believe it will still comfortably exceed that target.


It will reduce emissions in the electricity sector in a more cost effective way. The sector contributes about one-third of Australia's emissions. The lower target will still contribute to emissions abatement in the sector, but without supporting or requiring investment in renewable capacity and in electricity infrastructure that Australia simply does not need or have demand for at this time. That means we keep electricity prices down for consumers. The lower target means that Australians will not be paying for additional, unnecessary capacity.


Thereby, of course, it complements this government's actions in abolishing the carbon tax and reducing the electricity pressures felt by Australian consumers and Australian businesses, which have impacted cost-of-living pressures and the nation's overall competitiveness. But it will still support jobs in the renewable energy sector. With an achievable target that will attract more certain investment for renewable energy projects, there can be confidence around sustainable growth in the industry and therefore more jobs associated with the industry. It will continue the transition for Australia towards greater reliance upon renewable energy, with around 23½ per cent estimated to be attained by 2020—a far, far higher share for renewables than the originally intended 20 per cent target.


The bill will also help to ensure that Australian industry and business is protected where they are exposed to competition from offshore and particularly exposed to high energy prices. It will increase assistance for all emissions-intensive trade exposed activities to a 100 per cent exemption. This means that the electricity used by businesses carrying out these activities will be fully exempt from any RET liability. This will reduce the pressure faced by businesses carrying out emissions-intensive trade exposed activities, helping to ensure that they remain competitive with their global competitors and therefore protecting their businesses and jobs in those employers' industries and sectors. The impact of this change on other electricity users will be more than offset, though, by the reduction in the direct costs of the RET resulting from the lower Large-scale Renewable Energy Target.


Consistent with our election commitment, the legislation will also reinstate native forest wood waste as an eligible source of renewable energy under the RET. We will do this by basing eligibility on the same conditions that were successfully utilised and previously in place from 2001 through 2011. The use of native forest wood for the primary purpose of generating renewable electricity has never been and never will be eligible to create certificates under the scheme. Let me be very clear again: the use of native forest wood for the purpose of generating renewable electricity has never been and will never be eligible to create certificates under the scheme. Eligibility was and will continue to be the subject of several conditions, including that it must be harvested primarily for a purpose other than energy production. There is absolutely no evidence that this will lead to unsustainable logging or will have a negative impact on Australia's biodiversity. Indeed, of course, there is ample evidence to the contrary based on the operation of the scheme under these same conditions for a decade from 2001 to 2011. The use of native forest wood waste for electricity generation is more beneficial to the environment than just burning the waste alone or simply allowing it to decompose. Its inclusion as an eligible energy source will be another contribution towards meeting the target and will ensure that it is put to good use.


The bill will also remove the requirement for two-yearly reviews of the RET, providing the policy certainty that is crucial to attracting investment, protecting jobs and encouraging economic growth. One of our government's priorities is to protect consumers and households but also businesses from any extra costs related to the RET. It is also important for us to make sure that the new target of 33,000 gigawatt hours is achievable. For these reasons the Clean Energy Regulator will prepare an annual statement on the progress of the RET scheme towards meeting the new targets and the impact that it is having on household electricity bills.


A number of specific issues relating to the legislation were raised through the contributions of senators, particularly around matters of wood waste and the nature of the target. I am sure these will be canvassed at some length in the committee stage, so I do not intend to go through them in any further detail than I have already done at this stage. It is the government's conviction that this legislation provides the best possible way to support renewable energy in Australia without unnecessarily increasingly electricity bills for households or businesses and without increasing cost-of-living pressures for Australians and without making Australian industry and business less competitive than the rest of the world. It ensures that we will not be subsidising, and, more importantly, that consumers and businesses will not be subsidising, unnecessary electricity capacity and simply forcing that extra capacity into an already oversupplied electricity market.


It implements necessary reform, it makes sure that the RET scheme is once more effective, market-friendly, economically responsible and beneficial not only for the environment but for consumers as well. Perhaps most importantly, it ensures that we retain the commitment to a 20 per cent renewable energy target, that that commitment will be delivered and exceeded and that the original intent of the legislation is met. These amendments simply ensure that it is met in a more responsible way that takes account of and better reflects the changing circumstances that we have seen over recent years and the flaws in the modelling that occurred at the time of the initial legislation passing.


I commend the legislation to the Senate and look forward to the continued constructive contribution of senators during the committee stage.

It is highly unusual for us to not have inquiries into bills, particularly controversial bills like this one, which changes the face of our clean energy future. I am urging the chamber: whatever your position is on this bill—and we know that—unfortunately—both of the big parties are agreeing to cut the clean energy target—it is just abominable that you would do so without actually sending this bill to an inquiry. There is a litany of unanswered questions about the implications of this bill, not least about the native forest burning that has been included in the face of all evidence. The community deserves the right to have a say. That is the normal process. I am incredulous that we have already moved twice for an inquiry and have received no support. We are giving folk one last chance tonight. We are not trying to delay the passage of this bill. We understand that you guys want to slash the renewable energy target and we do not; we know we have lost that fight.

   Add:




Wood waste



(6) Despite anything in regulations made under subsection (3), wood waste does not include waste, or a product or by‑product, that is, or is derived from, biomass from a native forest.


Labor's amendments remove the provisions in this bill that seek to reinsert native wood waste into the Renewable Energy Scheme and amend the act to prevent any future regulation being made by the government to reinsert native wood waste into the scheme. This attempt to reinsert native wood waste into the Renewable Energy Scheme is nothing more and nothing less than a cynical red herring. It is not an issue that was raised with our shadow minister during negotiations. We all know that those negotiations went for some 12 months or more and yet it was never raised during all of those negotiations. It was a critical issue for industry, but it was certainly never, ever raised.


Native wood waste is neither clean nor renewable in the modern-day sense of the term with respect to the Renewable Energy Scheme. Boosters of this provision like to pretend that they are talking here about small amounts of waste, small amounts of refuse that are left, say, on the forest floor after some harvesting. But what we clearly know is that the definition of 'native wood waste' would involve the whole of any tree that is harvested but not ultimately saw lopped. So the industry definition of 'waste' is not waste in the sense of the residue—that is, the leaves, branches and stumps—left after logging on the forest floor. The definition of 'waste' or 'residues' that is built into the regulation allows for whole logs to be burnt for power production. Wood waste, for instance, from plantation logging is already an eligible source in the current renewable energy act. But including wood waste from native forests would allow native Tasmanian trees, for instance, to be logged and burnt for power production because waste can be defined as any log that is harvested but not ultimately saw lopped or that has no higher commercial purpose. So in this way a pulp log, for paper production, is of lower value than a sawlog for sawn timber, so the pulp log is considered waste, even when pulp logs comprise 90 per cent of the timber extracted from a forest.


So Labor is not willing to see the Renewable Energy Scheme used to provide an alternative to the hard work of debating serious questions around the comprehensive inclusive and long-term solutions for our traditional logging industries. So it is for those reasons and for the reason that the reinsertion of native wood waste into the scheme was never raised during the some 12 months of negotiations with the opposition that I move the amendments that are before the Senate.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:21):  Chairman, I am not sure that there was a question to the minister in that, but I do have a question—




Senator Singh:
  I have moved amendments.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Okay. I will then ask you the question.




Senator Singh:
  Just by way of clarification for Senator Macdonald, I have just moved amendments.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  That being the case, perhaps I should not have jumped in before the minister. As I have the call, I just want to draw the senator's attention to a wonderful speech made this morning by Senator Lambie on this very subject. Senator Lambie, as a Tasmanian senator, understands what this is all about. I was delighted that Senator Lambie has shown herself to be the only non-government senator from Tasmania who understands just what a destructive force the Greens political party has been in the whole debate and in the Tasmanian economy as well.


Senator Singh, as I recall, was actually a minister in the Tasmanian government and was supported by the Greens political party. Knowing the way the Greens political party operates, there would have been some deal on preferences to ensure that the Labor government stayed in power—the Labor government of which I understand Senator Singh was a member and, indeed, a minister.


It is terribly important that the issue is fully understood, and whilst I appreciate that the Labor Party is supporting the bill as proposed, I am disappointed that they have tried to turn back the clock on this issue of the sustainable use of wood waste: the ability to use wood waste, which would otherwise rot, as a means of creating renewable energy. I guess I should leave it to the minister to indicate the government's view on the amendment, but it would seem to me, from my experience in these areas, that this is not an amendment that is in the best interests a) of Tasmania, b) of the timber industry or c) of the whole renewable energy debate across Australia.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-06-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (18:25):  The government opposes these amendments by the opposition. The proposed amendments would mean that native forest wood waste is not reinstated as an eligible source of renewable energy under the RET.


Our concern is that this provision from the opposition, which would mean that the reinstatement of biomass from native forest wood waste as an eligible source of renewable energy was removed, is counter to many things that many in the opposition have said previously, and, more importantly for us, is counter to the policy we took to the last election and to the commitments we have given in this regard. The opposition also seeks to add a provision to the legislation that prevents the eligibility of biomass from native forest waste as a source of renewable energy.


As I said in my closing remarks, the use of native forest for the primary purpose of generating renewable electricity has never been and never will be eligible to create certificates under the scheme. Let us again make it crystal clear for anybody following this debate and for anybody concerned about the future of native forest—as I expect many people with an interest in this debate will be—that the use of native forest for the primary purpose of generating renewable electricity has never been and never will be eligible to create certificates under the renewable energy target scheme. Under the proposal we have before us tonight, eligibility was and will continue to be subject to several conditions, including that it must be harvested primarily for a purpose other than energy production. We are clearly talking here about waste, as Senator Macdonald made clear before, as Senator Lambie made clear during the debate, and as many other senators have made clear. We are talking about wood waste products, not about it being harvested for the purpose of renewable energy.


One of the objectives of the RET is to support additional renewable energy generation that is ecologically sustainable. Our government is seeking, consistent with the policy we took to the last election, to reinstate native forest wood waste as an eligible source of renewable energy, because there is no evidence that its eligibility leads to unsustainable logging or has a negative impact on Australia's biodiversity. But there is evidence that by allowing this you would ensure that such waste does not rot, is not otherwise burnt, and does not otherwise end up causing emissions when it could instead have been used in a productive way to generate electricity. The safeguards that were previously in place for a decade, from 2001 through to 2011, were, and still are, sufficient assurance that native biomass will be harvested in a sustainable way and that the regulations are underpinned by ecologically sustainable forest management principles that provide a means for balancing the economic, social and environmental outcomes from publicly-owned forests.


We want to put back in place the pre-November 2011 regulations that established eligibility for native forest wood waste as a renewable energy source. As was the case under those regulations, which operated for that decade from 2001 to 201, the regulations will require that the eligibility is subject to a number of conditions. Let me detail those for the Senate. The biomass must arise from a harvesting activity where the primary purpose is not energy production. Further, the biomass must either be a by-product or waste product of a harvesting operation approved under relevant planning and approval processes and that meets the high-value test or be a by-product of a harvesting operation carried out in accordance with ecologically sustainable forest management principles. The biomass must meet ecologically sustainable forest management principles in a regional forest agreement or, if no such agreement is in place, meet equivalent principles to the satisfaction of the minister of the day.


The Clean Energy Regulator, who, I think, as an entity is broadly well regarded across the chamber in a number of ways, will be tasked with undertaking a rigorous assessment of the applications by power stations for accreditation to use native forest wood waste. In determining the eligibility of native forest wood waste as a renewable energy source, the regulator would verify that, if the forest management framework under which the harvesting operation is conducted is a regional forest agreement, the harvesting has been carried out in accordance with the ecologically sustainable management principles in that regional forest agreement; or, if the harvesting operation is not conducted under an RFA, that the harvesting is carried out in accordance with ecologically sustainable forest management principles equivalent to those of a regional forest agreement, to the satisfaction of the minister. The power stations must provide a statement of the ecologically sustainable forest management principles related to the wood waste. 


The regulator would also test that the use of wood waste for energy production is not the primary purpose of the harvesting operation. The regulator would be verifying that the existence of the sawmill and its operating licence is appropriate; that, where applicable, the high-value test is satisfied; and that there is an auditable trail of documentation in place, from the source of the wood waste to the power station.


The regulator would also undertake sample checks of the registration numbers of wood waste trucks and the weighbridge documents for the supply of wood waste to ensure that all is above board and satisfies the requirements in the supply of that wood waste. The regulator also has the power to conduct spot audits of power stations that use wood waste for energy production. 


Once the power station is accredited, having jumped through all of those hoops, having met the tests that have been applied, it can then create large-scale generation certificates. If the LGCs are being created using wood waste, several data validation checks are completed as part of a generation data assessment process. These include a requirement for the power station to retain an auditable trail of documents that demonstrate compliance with the eligibility requirements—such as identifying very clearly the type of wood waste, whether it is biomass, sawmill residue or a by-product of a manufacturing process; the origin of the wood waste; and the amount of wood waste delivered to the power station—including the details I spoke of before pertaining to truck registration numbers, weighbridge documents and the like.


I want to make it clear to all that these are robust safeguards. These are safeguards that, it was demonstrated over a decade, do not have any negative impact on the operation and use of native forests. They are safeguards that allow for the use of product that would otherwise go to waste—product that would potentially otherwise be burnt, to no end, or left to rot, to no end. Instead, we are providing the opportunity for that product not to be burnt for no purpose, not to be left to rot for no purpose, but to be utilised in a sustainable way for the generation of electricity within the operation of the renewable energy target.


This matter has been debated in the chamber many times over the years. The Australian Greens have always sought to make an issue out of it because of course there are no circumstances in which the Australian Greens support any form of native forest logging. Frankly, there do not seem to be any circumstances in which the Greens are inclined to support any form of logging activity or any forestry activity at all. There are probably few circumstances in which they are interested in supporting any economic activity at all. So we have seen this debate run before as a proxy for debates about how native forests are managed, and that is all it is. It is a smokescreen. It is a proxy. It is the Greens, as they have done historically, suggesting as part of some type of dubious activity that the use of this waste is somehow encouraging greater use or logging of native forests. That is not the case. We have very strict management regimes in place around how native forests are used. The regional forest agreements provide a sound framework for that. And, as I have emphasised, all of the regulations to date—all of the previous regulations and those proposed for the future—make it crystal clear that the waste can only be utilised as waste for energy purposes and that the primary purpose of any harvesting must not be energy production.


The Labor Party used to agree with us on this topic. For many years, they defended the inclusion of native forest wood waste as one of the eligible activities. For many years, they stood by and defended that. It was only during those unfortunate three years—unfortunate for the nation and unfortunate, frankly, for the Labor Party—that they were in a coalition government with the Australian Greens that they relented. This is one of the issues during that three-year period that the Labor Party stepped back from and let the Greens have their way on. Sadly, the Labor Party have not worked out that that did not work for them; that that was a disastrous period not only for the country but also for the Australian Labor Party; and that they would be well advised to go back to their old policy, the one they had before they got into bed with the Australian Greens, that supported sound and sensible management of native forest wood waste.


Let me highlight some of the arguments the Labor Party used to make in this regard, before their agreement with the Greens. Back in 2009, Senator Penny Wong—who, at that stage, I think was Minister for Climate Change and Water—said:


I would make the point that this native forest biomass has been an eligible source under the current MRET since 2001.


Senator Wong was quite correct. It had been and continued to be for another couple of years. She was defending it at the time. Senator Wong went on to say:


There are additional eligibility criteria in relation to the use of native forest biomass, including restrictions on the areas where the native forest wood waste can come from in order for it to be used in generation that is eligible to create RECs.


At that stage, back in 2009, Senator Wong was very clear there was an eligible source and the additional eligibility criteria, and the additional tests that were applied, were appropriate. Of course, what we are trying to reinstate are the criteria and the tests that applied when Senator Wong was endorsing it in 2009.


In 2010 Senator Wong was continuing at that stage to defend this very legitimate activity and this very legitimate definition. At that stage, she did call out the Australian Greens for what this debate actually was. She said: 'I always find it interesting that you feel the need to do that, Senator Brown.' Of course, it was Senator Bob Brown at the time. Bob Brown had said: 'Penny Wong is a prodigious supporter of the destruction of native forests.' Senator Wong rightly said: 'That was an extraordinary inflammation of the debate without any factual basis.' And that is quite right. It is, of course, an example of the fact that, at that time, the Australian Greens, as they had consistently, and continue to do so, used this as a proxy war over native forest management altogether.


The tragedy is that the Labor Party did not stand by the position that Penny Wong took consistently and, indeed, that is still the position of the Tasmanian Labor Party. Senator Singh, who has moved these amendments, should really be listening to Mr Bryan Green, the Tasmanian Labor leader. He wrote to the shadow environment minister Mark Butler to strongly put forward the case for a compromise on the inclusion of biomass in the RET. Mr Green is right, Penny Wong was right, our government and party today are right, the Labor Party are, sadly, wrong on this. Sadly, they are standing by a position they adopted when they were in bed with the Greens. They would be wise to withdraw these amendments. They would be wise to support the government in having native forest wood waste included as an eligible source with all of the protections that we are putting forward.

Senator WATERS
 (Queensland—Co-Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:40):  We support this amendment. Indeed, we have amendments that are drafted slightly differently but achieve the same outcome. Native forest burning is not a renewable energy source. It is terrible for biodiversity and it will throw a lifeline to the native forest logging industry just as the woodchips industry dries up. Interestingly, our amendment is drafted in a slightly different way, of course, such that it requires one less vote to pass. I think the Labor Party full well know that the way they have drafted their amendment means it is destined to fail.

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory) (18:41):  I just want to seek some further clarification from the minister, particularly looking at a number of the aspects of how this would work in practice to ensure we do not see some of the things that the Greens are claiming—some of the ideas that there would be, somehow, wholesale extra logging or destruction of forests as a result of this inclusion. Also, when it comes to the regulation to ensure that this is not abused, I am interested in how that would be regulated. What would be the arrangements when it comes to an auditable trail of documentation from the source of the wood waste to the power station? If you could give some clarity on that, Minister.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (18:42):  Thank you, Senator Seselja, for your question. I should note, as I was remiss in not doing so during my contribution in closing the second reading speech, that there were some very sound contributions in relation to the overall debate around this legislation but particularly the issue around biomass and native forest wood waste from not just some on our side who spoke, like Senator Macdonald, but notably some of the members of the crossbench as well. At the risk of missing those whose contributions I did not hear, I particularly want to single out Senator Lambie and Senator Muir, who both outlined very compelling arguments as to why this type of native forest wood waste should be included. Of course, they both bring particular backgrounds, experience and knowledge to this—Senator Lambie has a particular interest as a Tasmanian senator and Senator Muir has a background in working in associated industries and has a good understanding of the sector. I think it is important to highlight that and to highlight that they, along with the government and along, I think, with most of the crossbenchers, accept the validity of the arguments that I have been putting forward.


Senator Seselja, in answer to your question, particularly about the strength of the regulations that we are putting forward, as I had emphasised those regulations are consistent with what operated between 2001-2011. They are clearly adopting the same type of approach and the same types of tests that were proven to work through that time and for which no arguments have been made—that I have heard—demonstrating any abuse of those regulations or demonstrating that they were not satisfactory in relation to the protections they provided to native forests and the assurance they gave in that, where native forest waste was burned or used for electricity generation purposes, it was because it was genuinely waste. It was genuinely a secondary by-product, a waste product, of otherwise used native forest products that were harvested for purposes other than electricity generation.


I was highlighting some of the previous positions of the Labor Party, Senator Seselja. Having put in my own words what the protections are, given that we are utilising the same type of protections, it is important that we acknowledge the explanation that previous Labor minister, Senator Wong, gave when she was Minister for Climate Change and Water, defending the same thing, outlining exactly how the protections worked in her eyes at that time. In a debate on 19 August 2009 in this place, Senator Wong pointed out:


We did go to the election with a commitment to retain existing eligibility. I would make the point that this native forest biomass has been an eligible source under the current MRET since 2001. 


I say to Senator Seselja and other senators and those listening that we went to the last election committing to reinstate it, because we never believed it should have been removed. We believe it was only removed as part of the awful deals that were undertaken between the Labor Party and the Australian Greens during those fateful three years of the largely Gillard government. 


Importantly, Senator Wong went on to explain what the regulations meant. I think it is very valuable for the Senate and for senators to understand what the regulations meant then, in Senator Wong's words, because they mean exactly the same thing today in terms of their operation and what they will mean when reinstated as a result of the government's legislation. To quote Senator Wong:


The existing regulations underpinning this prescribe that, to be eligible under the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target, native forest wood waste must either come from an area where an RFA, a regional forest agreement, is in place or, if it is from outside an RFA area, it must be produced from harvesting carried out in accordance with ecologically sustainable forest management principles that the minister is satisfied are consistent with those required by an RFA, which I understand is referred to as an RFA-equivalent area.


Senator Seselja, that is of course exactly what we are proposing. As I told the Senate before, as a test for this, we are proposing that, if the forest management framework under which the harvesting operation is conducted is a regional forest agreement, the harvesting must have been carried out in accordance with the ecologically sustainable management principles in that agreement. Further, if the harvesting operation is not conducted under an RFA, the harvesting must have been carried out in accordance with ecologically sustainable forest management principles equivalent to those of an RFA, to the satisfaction of the minister. We are reinstating exactly the same conditions that Senator Wong explained in the 2009 debate as we reinstate the eligibility for native forest wood waste. Let me go on with what Senator Wong said on19 August 2009,  in responding to questions that had been put to her by Senator Milne. Senator Wong said:


The regulations also prescribe a primary purpose test—that is, the wood waste must be primarily harvested for a purpose other than biomass for energy production. The wood waste must also be either a by-product or a waste product of a harvesting operation for which a high-value process is the primary purpose of the harvesting—known as a ‘high-value test’—or a by-product of a harvesting operation that is carried out in accordance with ecologically sustainable forest management principles. The wood waste is taken to be from a high-value process only if the total financial value of the products of the high-value process is higher than the financial value of other products in the harvesting operation. The regulations define a high-value process as ‘the production of sawlogs, veneer, poles, piles, girders, wood for carpentry or craft uses or oil products.’ Woodchips are not specified as a high-value process, so waste from operations where woodchips are the primary purpose is not eligible. Sawmill residue produced by the processing of native forest timber is eligible without reference to the high-value test.


Chair, Senator Seselja and other senators, it is important to understand that, at the time, Senator Wong was explaining the tests that had applied at that stage for eight years and that continued in operation for another two years. We are simply seeking to reinstate those types of arrangements. We are applying the same sorts of tests.




Senator Colbeck:
  Exactly the same tests.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  Exactly the same tests, indeed, as Senator Colbeck rightly acknowledges. I have already highlighted the direct correlation between the test Senator Wong was talking about in relation to the consistency with a regional forest agreement and the ecologically sustainable principles that applied there; or, if there is no RFA, an equivalent test. But equally the same direct correlation applies in relation to the primary purpose test that is put in place. Senator Wong spoke of the primary purpose test, saying that the wood waste must be primarily harvested for a purpose other than biomass for energy production. Indeed, what I told the Senate just before in relation to this is that the biomass must arise from a harvesting activity where the primary purpose is not energy production. It is very clear. Further, Senator Wong highlighted the high-value test and went into some of the detail of the definitions that apply to that high-value test. As I have highlighted in this debate, the biomass must be either a by-product or a waste product of a harvesting operation, approved under relevant planning and approval processes, and must meet a high-value test. As Senator Colbeck rightly interjected before, we are seeking to put in place the same regulations, the same tests, the same standards that worked so effectively for so long before the unholy Labor-Greens alliance, the previous government, stripped them out. 


As I highlighted before, it is not just the former Labor Party—the Labor Party of 2009 or 2010, or really any time prior to them doing this deal with the Greens in 2011—that they are inconsistent with today and that the amendments which we are debating are inconsistent with. They are also inconsistent with the Tasmanian Labor Party of today. Mr Bryan Green, the Tasmanian Labor leader, on 8 May this year—just one month ago—said:


I have written to Shadow Environment Minister Mark Butler to strongly put forward the case for a compromise on the inclusion of biomass in the RET. 


We are not talking about large-scale power stations in the middle of the forest burning trees to create electricity.


He of course is dead right: we are talking about a product that will be harvested anyway and it is harvested for other purposes, but the waste, the offcuts, the by-product does not end up going to waste. 


We are putting in place an incentive, an opportunity, for those waste products to be used in an ecologically responsible way, to make the most out of those waste products—so that they are not left rotting on the floor, so they are not thrown into a fire for no purpose, but so that they are actually used to generate electricity and so they are put to some good use. The timber will primarily have already been utilised for a range of the purposes such as: the creation of high-value products like sawlogs, like veneer, like poles, like piles, like girders, like timber for carpentry or craft use—high value purposes that this wood would have been harvested for and must have been harvested for, if any of those offcuts or that waste is to be used as part of the renewable energy target criteria.


I think it should be clear to all in the chamber not only that we have strong safeguards in place—because we do, incredibly strong safeguards—and that we have the evidence to support the safeguards—because we do and those safeguards operated effectively in a decade spanning from 2001 to 2011—but also that the Labor Party is once again being completely inconsistent in the way in which it is applying their policies. Tasmanian Labor is arguing for the coalition government's position; Tasmanian Labor is in lockstep, it seems, with the Tasmanian Liberals, like Senator Colbeck, rather than Tasmanian Labor senators, like Senator Singh. Of course, Labor seems to want to continue its unfortunate relationship with the Greens, and that is what Labor is doing with its amendments. It also continues to ignore the cries of some from the Labor Party were arguing that it should be maintained—even in 2011 and even when the Labor Party was getting into bed with the Greens and removing the eligibility provisions that had operated with safeguards in place for a decade.


I look to Dick Adams, who at that stage at least was recognising the value of bioenergy sourced from the native forest biomass. He was part of the House of Representatives inquiry that recommended that under any version of the RET or similar scheme, bioenergy sourced from native forest biomass should continue to qualify as renewable energy where it is true waste product and does not become a driver for the harvesting of native forest. Sadly for the Labor Party, it did not listen to that sort of advice; sadly for the Labor Party, it did the deals with the Australian Greens; and, sadly for the Labor Party, that meant that it went into the last federal election and only managed to win one of the five seats in Tasmania. Labor paid a price for turning its back on sensible forestry policy and on sensible policy relating to renewable energy—policies that were demonstrated to work and to have the effective safeguards in place. If it had any sense today, the Labor Party would be withdrawing this amendment and would be supporting the government's proposal to re-include the eligibility criteria for forest wood waste and to make sure that we have an effective regime in place, as our government intends to have.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2015-06-17,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania) (18:57):  I have heard a lot of drivel in a decade in the Senate, and often it is just drivel to fill in time, and that is precisely what is going on here tonight. Anyone listening to this debate needs to understand that what the government has now set up is a filibuster. We had Senator Seselja a little while ago vote against an inquiry into this bill to spell out the provisions of the bill and now he seeks to have the minister explain something that has already been explained. I will tell you why: out in the back rooms, the crossbenchers are trying to stitch up an even worse deal with the government. The government now has its tail up because it has got the Labor Party to cave in to 33,000 gigawatt hours and to cave in on forest logging, because the Labor Party did not make it a condition of accepting this to get rid of the native forest logging component. Now we have the anti-wind, anti-science, anti-the future, pro-logging on the crossbenches out there negotiating with the government to see what other disasters they can incorporate into the RET. That is exactly what is going on now.


I call it 'drivel' for this reason: nobody who has actually stood up and spoken on this can have been out into a coupe in Tasmania's native forest. If they had, they would know that 90 per cent of what comes off that coupe has gone to the woodchippers in the past. Talk about logs for high value purpose! Not on your life! The only reason they go ahead with the logging is the money they got from the woodchippers. That is what made it economically viable for Gunns to make a fortune over all those years and then ultimately go broke when the bottom dropped out of the native forest market. There is no market for the logging of native forests and say this is an attempt to create a market—to make logging native forests viable. Why is that? When the loggers themselves recognised there was no future in native forest logging, they approached the conservation movement to try to work out how they could get out of native forests. They did then get out of native forests with a deal where the Commonwealth spent hundreds of millions of dollars, paying them to get out of native forests 


Exit packagers for the loggers were paid to get them out of native forests.


Then in came Prime Minister Abbott. He said he would overturn that previous agreement on the forest in Tasmania. He said he would get the loggers back to work. Only he did not know enough about it to know that they were never going to get back to work because there is no market for native forest woodchips—and so now the government are trying to create one. They stand here and say, 'This will be logged in accordance with regional forest agreements.' Exactly. That is what has gone on for the last 10 years.


RFAs are exempt from the EPBC Act. There are no provisions to protect habitats and threatened species. We are seeing logging on Bruny Island, as I stand here today, killing the habitat of the swift parrot, a threatened species. I wrote to the minister and asked, 'What are you doing about that?' I got a letter back from the Threatened Species Commissioner who has just been set up saying, 'Nothing. We are not doing anything about it and we will not be doing anything about it. It is not our jurisdiction.'


Right across Australia, regional forest agreements have overseen disastrous native forest operations removing habitats for our threatened and critically endangered species. Forestry Tasmania are such a basket case. Even today in the legislative council Sue Smith down there was saying it should be sold off and disbanded. That is absolutely where it has got to because they are in debt up to their necks. They have had to transfer $30 million from the electricity network in Tasmania to prop them up. They even had to get a letter of comfort from the Tasmanian government or they would have been trading insolvent.


Now we have a government running around trying to put some value into native forest logging by giving out credit certificates for renewable energy. But it is not renewable energy. It can never be renewable to log native forest and put them into a forest furnace to burn for electricity. That is never going to work. What is more, it is going to lead to a massive consumer campaign against any retailer that tries to sell this electricity, as it did a decade ago when we last campaigned against this—and we will again. They were then known as burnt koala certificates. They will now be not only burnt koala but burnt swift parrot and burnt everything else certificates because that is exactly what is going on here.


I hate to think what is being stitched up out in the back room as we stand here and speak. No doubt it will be an attempt to undermine wind technology. This deal of 33,000 gigawatt hours was designed to try to save wind. These people hate wind, so they will be out there trying to stitch up some deal that restricts wind. The Clean Energy Council has facilitated it. Labor have gone down, down and down to 33,000 when Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, stood with me in Barton at a public meeting saying, 'Labor is not for turning.' The government is wearing everyone down, except the Greens. I can say that standing proudly. And Senator Lazarus stood with us on the second reading vote. We are the only ones in this place who stood up and said, 'We like 41,000 gigawatt hours.' There was no rationale whatsoever for wheedling this down to where they have got it to except that the government did not like the fact that there is too much electricity in the system. They needed to take out 9,000 megawatt hours. They could have done that by shutting down coal fired power stations, but they did not want to because their objective was to prop up coal fired power and destroy renewable energy. If they can get destroyed forests into it, that is exactly what they will do.


We heard the minister over there telling us about how marvellous these logging operations are and how sustainable they are. There was an open letter to the Senate today from 40 scientists across Australia. What they obviously do not understand is that this is an anti-science government. This is an anti-science crossbench. They do not want to have the science put in their faces because they are not interested in science. That is exactly the case. These 40 scientists have written today saying the acceptance of a perverse definition of wood waste in renewables is being questioned by them. They are alarmed that once the door opens on burning Australia's native forests in tower furnaces it could see our forest heritage drawn into supplying an export demand to satisfy the expanding number of biomass burners overseas. Peter Gell, professor of environmental science at Federation University, said, 'The wood fuel market has potential to impact even more destructively on our forests, ecosystems, wildlife and water catchments than has the export woodchip industry. If it can be burnt, it will not be safe. The ironbark forests and woodlands, the forest types that the chippers rejected, would all be targets for the resource mix if the RET bill passes parliament as it stands.' That is from Australia's leading scientists writing to this Senate. Yet we have a situation where people are sitting here thinking that this would be a good idea.


It is hard to believe that in this country we have got to the point where we are rejecting the latest science, where we still have a situation where the logging industry is exempted from the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and where we have this perverse idea that we will give a financial incentive to give viability to native forest logging when it clearly has no viability. Native forests would not be harvested anyway, as Senator Birmingham tried to suggest, because Forestry Tasmania are in debt up to their necks. They are putting back into it a financial incentive to destroy native forests. It is absolutely despicable. As the scientists said, it is a falsehood to claim this type of electricity production as renewable. 'You cannot renew or replace the burnt carbon stored in a 100- to 600-year-old forest in the turnaround time needed to address climate change,' said Professor Gell. If all Australian native forest logged production in 2009 had instead been burned for electricity it would have substituted as little as 2.8 per cent of our coal based power generation. We risk unleashing an industry with a potential appetite to decimate our native forests and all the services they provide to gain very limited emission benefits. This is very poor environmental policy and poorer energy policy. That is the fact of the matter. When I go back to what they have said about the export demand to satisfy the expanding number of biomass burners overseas, I know that this is a horror show.


There are also the free trade agreements the government have stitched up. Let's talk about South Korea. We have also signed up to one with China today. In those free trade agreements—you wait—there will be agreements to send shiploads of whole logs and pellets to South Korea to burn in forest furnaces. It will not be long before we are doing the same with Japan. This is where the world is going. Tragically, there are countries like Australia prepared to raze the last of their forests and sell them to other countries to burn—not to use even in the production of paper, as they suggested previously. The poor quality woodchips that went from here did not even make it into the paper mix; they went straight into the furnaces to run the place to generate the electricity. This is what they did in the Stone Age! That is where you want to take us back to—and it is completely wrong.


The renewable energy target should be increased. The rest of the world recognises, as we go into Paris at the end of the year, that we need to get out of fossil fuel energy production as fast as possible. The energy race of this century has already been won by the renewables. The jobs, the technology, the brains base—everything—depends on moving fast into the low-carbon economy, not frustrating it and locking us in to more dig it up, cut it down, ship it away, and now burn it as well. This is utterly appalling policy!


It is really sickening, Minister, to hear you regurgitate all of the lines that the loggers have used for years about sustainability and regional forest agreements and ecologically-sound logging. Go out onto the coupes! Go out and see the mess that they have left! Look at the stats on the number of species now on the threatened and critically endangered lists! Do not stand here and tell the Senate that native forest logging in Australia has been anything other than extremely destructive at the industrial scale that it has operated on. Go and have a look out at those forests where the Bentley blockade was, for example. Here you have more threatened species being able to be cleared for expanded coalmines. How obscene is that! Offsets that enabled those primary forests to be cleared for coalmines. This is a disgrace!


We are so much of a pariah at a global level. Step out of this country for five minutes and hear the conversation that is being had around the world. This is such an opportunity cost to this nation. Every other country is getting ahead of us in terms of technology, in terms of jobs. Our brains base is going to leave this country. Young people are going to take their skills overseas because they want to be part of the solution; they do not want to stay here and be locked into the problem. I would ask every senator to read this open letter from 40 leading scientists. Think about biodiversity. Think about the climate. Think about the value of forests—and do not support this absolutely backward step. 


You just have to look at the Prime Minister's words. He said that the reason the RET is 33,000 gigawatt hours is not that he wants to give certainty to the renewable energy industry. No! It is 33,000 gigawatt hours because he could not get it any lower. That is as low as he could go in this Senate. But he will go lower if he can. In terms of whether it means more wind turbines, what did the Prime Minister say? He can't stand them. There are too many of them. He does not want to see any more of them. But he spoke to the loggers at their dinner and said he thinks they are marvellous; they do a great job. That is exactly where this is going! This is not about certainty. This is about the far Right in Australian politics getting what they can out of the Labor Party, getting what they can out of the crossbench and dragging it lower and lower and lower. They will put it in their back pockets and they will go lower still. They do not compromise. They have no intention of providing certainty.


It has been the biggest con job with the Clean Energy Council thinking this gives anyone certainty. It does not. The only certainty it gives is that the Liberals will pocket what they can get now and will go after the rest later. None of this is safe under this government, because it does not believe in renewable energy. You, the government, do not believe in renewable energy. You do not believe in reining in fossil fuels. You do believe in expanding coalmines, opening up the Galilee Basin, more coal seam gas and logging as many native forests as you can put the trucks and the bulldozers through. That is exactly what is going on. It is a disgrace in Australia at this time in our history. When people look back, they will see you as Neanderthals—and they are right to do so.

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2015-06-17,"



Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture) (19:12):  It is very good to be able to follow Senator Milne, who has again demonstrated, as the Greens are so good at doing, that the Greens will say absolutely anything at any point in time to suit their case. The lies that have been told by the Greens political party over so many years about the forest industry were continued here tonight. What Senator Milne does not tell you is that she wants to see the end of the entire native forest industry in this country. She wants to undermine financially the entire forest industry in this country. The complete hypocrisy of the Greens political party in this space is absolutely breathtaking.


Senator Milne talked about the destruction of the native forest industry. She talked about the denuded landscapes from the native forest industry. What she does not tell you is that thousands of hectares of harvested native forests, some of it harvested as little as four years ago, have been nominated by green groups to be listed as wilderness in Australia's World Heritage area. Senator Milne completely excludes that. If these areas are so badly destroyed, as Senator Milne would like those who are listening to believe—another act of complete deceit, I might say—how do those thousands of hectares then qualify as wilderness to be listed by the World Heritage Committee as part of Australia's World Heritage estate?


What Senator Milne also does not tell you is that the Greens, as part of the Tasmanian forest agreement process, lined up and took Australian taxpayers' money to conduct regeneration burns in those areas that had been harvested by the forest industry.



An honourable senator:  What are you talking about?




Senator COLBECK:
  The green groups in Australia took this money. They took this money supported by the Australian Greens. They took this taxpayers' money to conduct regeneration burns. Of course, anytime there was a puff of smoke on the horizon in Tasmania from a Forestry Tasmania conducted regeneration burn, the Greens and the green groups would hit the telephones and complain about smoke pollution and the terrible effect on the environment—and yet the green groups, supported by the Australian Greens, are participating in exactly that process right now.




Senator Milne:
  Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. The Australian Greens did not support any of the things that Senator Colbeck suggests. He may refer to other groups that are not the Australian Greens—that is his right—



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  What is the point of order?




Senator Milne:
  but it is not the Australian Greens. We did not support that.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:  There is no point of order.




Senator COLBECK:
  Who did these green groups contract to conduct those regeneration burns? The green groups contracted Forestry Tasmania, whom Senator Milne just a moment ago was condemning for conducting regeneration burns. Why did they do that? Because only Forestry Tasmania had the expertise to conduct those regeneration burns. Senator Milne comes in here condemning Forestry Tasmania and condemning forest harvesting, and yet those very areas that were harvested under the regional forest agreements have now been included, supported by the Greens, in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage estate. If the forest industry were so destructive, as Senator Milne says—if those 100- to 600-year-old forests were so destroyed by the forest industry—how do those forests qualify as wilderness under the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage area?


The deceit of the Greens and the green groups is just breathtaking, and the hypocrisy of the Greens in this process is likewise breathtaking. They will say one thing one minute to suit their case and they will say another thing another minute to suit their case. That was demonstrated, as I said in my contribution to the second reading debate on this bill, by Senator Bob Brown. When he was campaigning against renewable hydro electricity in Tasmania, he was proposing coal fired power stations in Tasmania—but, of course, the wheel has turned and it is no longer convenient for the Greens to acknowledge that that even occurred. They want to deny it and they want to forget about it, but the historical record is there. The Greens will say anything at any point in time to support their case.


Yet the science is quite clear. Compilations of global science are quite clear. In fact, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change support utilisation of biomass, on a sustainable forest management basis, for the generation of energy. They say that in their IPCC report of 2007. The Food and Agriculture Organization supports it. The World Wildlife Fund actually supports it. It has been supporting it right through Europe and has a target for generation of energy by the utilisation of biomass in Europe. There is a target.


It is a pity that Senator Lazarus has left the chamber, because I understand that he is prepared to support this measure only on the basis of Forest Stewardship Council certification of the forests that the biomass comes from. Senator Lazarus has fallen into a green-Wilderness Society trap. Had he accepted certification of forests rather than just going for one of the options on the market, he might have had an option, but, of course, he went for FSC. The green groups try to use a veto power by virtue of their place on the FSC board. They have been trying that for years, but they are in real trouble because I suspect that in not too long a time you will start to see Australian native forests certified under the FSC standard—and what you will probably see then is the Greens and the green groups turning on the FSC. Senator Lazarus has, unfortunately, fallen for a green trap


But what really annoys me is that the Greens have come in here with their forest tripe. Who would have thought that the Greens would turn out to be the climate science deniers? Even the IPCC supports the utilisation of biomass in native forest residues, but, of course, that is inconvenient for the Greens, so they are prepared to deny that part of the IPCC report. They are happy to belt up the government with the rest of the IPCC report, but they actually turned out to be the climate science deniers because they are not prepared to accept that bit that they do not like. They want to pick and choose. They want to be able to say, 'We reject that bit of science because it's inconvenient,' and yet the global science in this space clearly supports the utilisation of biomass for generating energy.

"Muir, Sen Ricky",AMEP,2015-06-17,"



Senator MUIR
 (Victoria) (17:32):  I will backtrack just a little from where I was in my speech where I pointed out that the inclusion of woody biomass into the renewable energy target is not a new suggestion. I pointed out that as a matter of fact for 10 years it was included in the RET and, despite outright lies from the Greens and now Labor—or certain factions of it—and extreme environmentalists, it did not lead to one extra tree being harvested; it only led to one RET being handed out.


I have received many emails and phone calls from constituents who are gravely concerned about the so-called destructions of our native forests and, rightfully so: it is not their fault that they have been misled. However, their concerns are about issues that are not related to the inclusion of woody biomass at all.


The inclusion of woody biomass is to include by-products of current harvesting operations as an eligible source of energy in the RET. We are not on about harvesting or logging any extra forest; we are on about utilising biomass that is left over.


We are speaking about a by-product that will rot and break down releasing carbon or methane into the atmosphere as it currently does or get pushed into the windrows and burnt. We are speaking of utilising a by-product of current harvesting projects; we are not speaking of cutting down a single extra tree, not one—just like it was when woody biomass was included in the RET for 10 years before the Labor party made an agreement with the Greens. This was a decision that the Labor party made, to the best of my knowledge, without even consulting the forestry division of the CFMEU.


Perhaps now is a good time for me to remind the Labor party that, before I got involved in politics, I was a paid-up union member and what one would call a traditional Labor voter. Now would be a very good time to remind you of who your traditional voters are. By trying to appease the Green votes, all you are doing is getting a nod of approval from people who are going to vote green anyway.


I would like to point out correspondence that I have received from the CFMEU where around 30 delegates from within the timber industry have pleaded for the support of their jobs, saying:


The ALP's proposed continued discrimination of electricity derived from waste, product or bi-product derived from biomass from native forests as an eligible source under the RET is extremely disappointing and unfair. The proposal is also without any justification as it is clear from the regulations that only wood waste from sustainably managed forests is permitted and that electricity generation must not be the driver for the harvesting operations—


that means that we cannot harvest forest just to generate electricity.


In support of our jobs, we would appreciate it if you could use your influence to ensure the defeat of the ALP amendment to the bill.


I would also like to make a point that a misleading meme on social media is not a fact and, as a matter of fact, can create a lot of unnecessary unrest for those who actually believe what the meme might say but also for those who are employed in an industry who think that their jobs are going to be axed.


I have a photo here that I am happy to table—if the chamber is happy for me to do so—which shows the extent of what is utilised in the timber industry and, in this instance ASH—Australian Sustainable Hardwoods—Australia's largest hardwood timber mill, a mill with which I am extremely familiar as I worked there for a number of years. The picture helps highlights the protection that the high-value test contributes to ensuring that wood waste would not be a driver in harvesting operations.


It clearly shows an offcut which is 50 millimetres by 38 millimetres by about 30 centimetres in length. This is then joined by a finger joiner—again, I have worked in this industry and this mill; I have seen it with my own eyes; I know—with other similar lengths and turned into high-value products such as floor joists, window components, door components, stair stringers and more. These products are then sold to manufacturers at set lengths minimising their waste. So the manufacturers are able to buy product which is essentially made to size out of waste which has not been burnt for electricity.


What waste is left over is then turned into chips and sold to Australian Paper, Maryvale.


By ensuring the procurement of Australian paper we will then ensure that the high-value test would still apply on waste. By not procuring Australian paper we run the risk of seeing Australian manufactured paper and the industry that is supported by it cease, leaving us to rely on products that are imported from countries that do not have our chains of custody from forests that may not be sustainably managed. If we do not utilise the by-product of our timber industry and let our timber industry go down the drain, we are still going to be buying products from somewhere else, where forests are not managed as well as we manage our forests here.


Some of the sawdust from Australian sustainable hardwood is used to create heat to operate their kilns to dry the timber. If they were not using that sawdust—which is dry, so it burns very clean—it saves them about $4 million every year in gas bills. So, not only will we be having waste products from milling going to waste and breaking down but also the mill would have a $4 million gas bill. We would have a product breaking down and releasing emissions and also using emissions to dry the product in the first place instead of utilising what was already there. In the timber industry in Victoria—and I mention Victoria because it is my state—it will be 21,000 jobs. That is a lot of people whose jobs will be affected if we do not respect what industry we have. 


Another point I would like to make before finishing is that it is suggested that woody biomass comes from AFCS-certified native forests. That is all good and fine except that there is not one single native forest that is actually under AFCS certification. So, for us to move an amendment like that would essentially mean nothing.


In conclusion, I think it is important that we do get the renewable energy target through, as I said at the very start. We need bipartisan support. We did see that in the lower house, and I would like to see the target go through this house, unamended, as is—or at least, if there are any amendments, with support from both sides.


I seek leave to table a document.


Leave granted.

Senator LAZARUS
 (Queensland) (17:39):  I believe in climate change and I believe that if the world does not act to change our ways we will continue to expedite our progress of evolution to extinction. To quote David Suzuki:


If we want to address global warming, along with the other environmental problems associated with our continued rush to burn our precious fossil fuels as quickly as possible, we must learn to use our resources more wisely, kick our addiction, and quickly start turning to sources of energy that have fewer negative impacts.


David is just one of many internationally revered and renowned environmental champions committed to raising awareness of climate change and the need for the world to act before it is too late. And these global champions are not alone. Countries across the world are actively putting programs in place to increase adoption of renewable energy. The role of the federal government is to manage our country in the most responsible, ethical and diligent way possible. In doing this, the people of Australia expect the federal government to demonstrate leadership that is incorruptible, fair, forward thinking and, importantly, in the best interests of all for today and our future tomorrow. Sadly, we have witnessed poor leadership from the Abbott government in relation to many issues, including our country's commitment to and management of renewable energy. Evidence, scientific research and general understanding tells us that climate change is real and that the burning of fossil fuel is a major contributor to this. We know that the only way forward is to transition from burning fossil fuel to using cleaner, greener energy. In fact, the G7 has just announced its commitment to completely eliminate the use of fossil fuel by the year 2100.


Australia currently has a renewable energy target of 41,000 gigawatts. The RET is a critical tool in providing the infrastructure and target necessary to facilitate and enable the uptake of renewable energy across this country. Australia's RET is in step with the rest of the world. As I have already said, countries across world are adopting clear, progressive and well-defined renewable energy targets. They are doing this to encourage, facilitate and support investment in and the adoption of renewable energy. Since the Abbott government has come to power they have done nothing but criticise and demonise the renewable energy target and the renewable energy sector. In fact, the Abbott government's reluctance to commit to the RET of 41,000 has eroded confidence in the sector, which has in turn caused a significant and sharp downturn in investment in the renewable energy sector. I can only assume that political donations being made by rich multinational mining companies to the pockets of the coalition are affecting the federal government's decision making and policy decisions around renewable energy. Is this the type of leadership we need in this country? I say no.


Thankfully, some states and territories across Australia are doing the right thing in relation to renewable energy. The government of Queensland has committed to a renewable energy target of 50 per cent by 2030. The ACT government has put in place a renewable energy target of 90 per cent by 2020. The South Australian government has put in place a renewable energy target of 33 per cent by 2020. Despite this, the federal government has not only demonstrated poor leadership on renewable energy but has now jumped into bed with the Labor Party and agreed to reduce Australia's renewable energy target from 41,000 gigawatts to 33,000 gigawatts.


I cannot and will not be part of this dirty deal that reduces Australia's renewable energy target and our country's commitment to the renewable energy sector. If the Abbott government and the opposition are successful in reducing Australia's renewable energy target, Australia will become the first country in the world to reduce a RET. I cannot and will not be part of this despicable act. For the sake of my children and all Australians and our country's future and role as an international citizen in progressing the best interests of the world I want to do whatever I can to stop this dirty deal from taking place.


That is why I have developed several amendments to this bill to maintain the RET at 41,000 gigawatts and to commit 8,000 gigawatts of the 41,000 to large-scale solar. Australia is one of the biggest adopters of solar power across the world. We need to do more in this country to support the solar power industry, to support solar power users and to reduce the costs associated with renewable energy. Maintaining our commitment to the RET and the renewable energy sector will achieve this by encouraging investment and innovation.


We also need to develop a national feed-in tariff rate for all users of rooftop solar. This will provide the people of Australia with certainty and consistency in relation to the benefits arising from solar power technology. I believe I have the support of all Australians in my desire to stop a reduction in the RET and to encourage investment in the renewable energy sector. Our future is too important. I should add that the Abbott government is also seeking to include the burning of native forest wood in the RET. I have serious concerns regarding this and, as a result, I will also be putting forward amendments to address these concerns in this bill.


In summary, I do not want Australia to become the first country in the world to reduce a RET and I do not want unfettered cutting down of native forest timber to be included in the RET. I am standing up for all Australians and I hope the Senate will support me by voting for my amendments. If the Abbott government had taken a responsible approach to the management of the RET from day one, shown strong leadership and pulled up its sleeves to assist and support our country to reach the 41,000 target by 2020, we would not be in the mess we are in today. Sadly, the Abbott government's deplorable approach to renewable energy has sent our country backwards, hurting investment, our international reputation, local jobs and local businesses. We now have much to do to restore confidence in the renewable energy sector and to put our country back on the right path to cleaner, greener, more responsible renewable energy. Supporting my amendments will assist in this process.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2015-06-17,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Assistant Minister for Education and Training) (17:47):  I thank all senators who have contributed to this debate on the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill 2015. There has been a range of contributions, and I acknowledge that nearly every contributor has expressed their principled support in some way, shape or form for the ongoing development of the renewable energy industries in Australia and the importance of renewable energy as part of our energy make-up and mix. Different senators have brought different perspectives as to how that is best achieved, but I am pleased that it has been broadly a range of constructive contributions, notwithstanding some of the finer points of difference that different senators may have.


In relation to this legislation, it is important to understand that we are standing by the attainment and policy of a 20 per cent target for renewable energy by 2020. But what is happening under the current legislative framework is that we are tracking towards 26 per cent or more, which would result in Australians being required to pay for excessive generating capacity that is not needed in terms of our energy sector. This bill seeks to achieve balanced reform. It will provide certainty to industry, encourage further investment in renewable energy and better reflect market conditions. It will also help Australia to reach its emissions targets and protect jobs and consumer interests. On best available expectations, it will lead to around 23 per cent of Australia's electricity being sourced from renewable energy by 2020, still significantly more than the originally intended 20 per cent from when the current legislative settings were put in place.


This will be done in significant part by reducing the annual large-scale renewable energy target, such that it will reach 33,000 gigawatt hours in 2020, as against the current setting of 41,000 gigawatt hours. It will be maintained at 33,000 gigawatt hours from 2021 to 2030. This will help to encourage further investment in renewable energy by providing market stability and confidence, achieving a better balance between supply and demand. It means that the many renewable energy projects that are ready to roll will be able to proceed with certainty around the target, which I expect and am pleased to note appears to enjoy bipartisan support. It will better reflect market conditions.


The reality is that Australia has an oversupply of generation. Electricity demand is falling. The modelling and expectations on which the target had been set have proven to be fundamentally flawed. So the lower target means that additional capacity will be added in a far more responsible way that better reflects demand, as was the original intent of the legislation to achieve around 20 per cent, to meet the target of 20 per cent, and we believe it will still comfortably exceed that target.


It will reduce emissions in the electricity sector in a more cost effective way. The sector contributes about one-third of Australia's emissions. The lower target will still contribute to emissions abatement in the sector, but without supporting or requiring investment in renewable capacity and in electricity infrastructure that Australia simply does not need or have demand for at this time. That means we keep electricity prices down for consumers. The lower target means that Australians will not be paying for additional, unnecessary capacity.


Thereby, of course, it complements this government's actions in abolishing the carbon tax and reducing the electricity pressures felt by Australian consumers and Australian businesses, which have impacted cost-of-living pressures and the nation's overall competitiveness. But it will still support jobs in the renewable energy sector. With an achievable target that will attract more certain investment for renewable energy projects, there can be confidence around sustainable growth in the industry and therefore more jobs associated with the industry. It will continue the transition for Australia towards greater reliance upon renewable energy, with around 23½ per cent estimated to be attained by 2020—a far, far higher share for renewables than the originally intended 20 per cent target.


The bill will also help to ensure that Australian industry and business is protected where they are exposed to competition from offshore and particularly exposed to high energy prices. It will increase assistance for all emissions-intensive trade exposed activities to a 100 per cent exemption. This means that the electricity used by businesses carrying out these activities will be fully exempt from any RET liability. This will reduce the pressure faced by businesses carrying out emissions-intensive trade exposed activities, helping to ensure that they remain competitive with their global competitors and therefore protecting their businesses and jobs in those employers' industries and sectors. The impact of this change on other electricity users will be more than offset, though, by the reduction in the direct costs of the RET resulting from the lower Large-scale Renewable Energy Target.


Consistent with our election commitment, the legislation will also reinstate native forest wood waste as an eligible source of renewable energy under the RET. We will do this by basing eligibility on the same conditions that were successfully utilised and previously in place from 2001 through 2011. The use of native forest wood for the primary purpose of generating renewable electricity has never been and never will be eligible to create certificates under the scheme. Let me be very clear again: the use of native forest wood for the purpose of generating renewable electricity has never been and will never be eligible to create certificates under the scheme. Eligibility was and will continue to be the subject of several conditions, including that it must be harvested primarily for a purpose other than energy production. There is absolutely no evidence that this will lead to unsustainable logging or will have a negative impact on Australia's biodiversity. Indeed, of course, there is ample evidence to the contrary based on the operation of the scheme under these same conditions for a decade from 2001 to 2011. The use of native forest wood waste for electricity generation is more beneficial to the environment than just burning the waste alone or simply allowing it to decompose. Its inclusion as an eligible energy source will be another contribution towards meeting the target and will ensure that it is put to good use.


The bill will also remove the requirement for two-yearly reviews of the RET, providing the policy certainty that is crucial to attracting investment, protecting jobs and encouraging economic growth. One of our government's priorities is to protect consumers and households but also businesses from any extra costs related to the RET. It is also important for us to make sure that the new target of 33,000 gigawatt hours is achievable. For these reasons the Clean Energy Regulator will prepare an annual statement on the progress of the RET scheme towards meeting the new targets and the impact that it is having on household electricity bills.


A number of specific issues relating to the legislation were raised through the contributions of senators, particularly around matters of wood waste and the nature of the target. I am sure these will be canvassed at some length in the committee stage, so I do not intend to go through them in any further detail than I have already done at this stage. It is the government's conviction that this legislation provides the best possible way to support renewable energy in Australia without unnecessarily increasingly electricity bills for households or businesses and without increasing cost-of-living pressures for Australians and without making Australian industry and business less competitive than the rest of the world. It ensures that we will not be subsidising, and, more importantly, that consumers and businesses will not be subsidising, unnecessary electricity capacity and simply forcing that extra capacity into an already oversupplied electricity market.


It implements necessary reform, it makes sure that the RET scheme is once more effective, market-friendly, economically responsible and beneficial not only for the environment but for consumers as well. Perhaps most importantly, it ensures that we retain the commitment to a 20 per cent renewable energy target, that that commitment will be delivered and exceeded and that the original intent of the legislation is met. These amendments simply ensure that it is met in a more responsible way that takes account of and better reflects the changing circumstances that we have seen over recent years and the flaws in the modelling that occurred at the time of the initial legislation passing.


I commend the legislation to the Senate and look forward to the continued constructive contribution of senators during the committee stage.

"Ruston, Sen Anne",LP,2015-06-17,"



Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (19:20):  Tonight I would like to talk about something that I think is extremely important and that a lot of Australians think is extremely important, and that is the labels on our food products. For decades, Australian's have been told how important food labelling is for the economy, for workers and especially for the farmers to help people buy Australian. The reason that it is so important that we buy Australian is that it plainly makes sense. It is a simple message that everybody understands, and it also appeals to us because we want to do the right thing by our great country and the food producers here. It also appeals to us because we know how good our products are, especially our food. Our farmers are undoubtedly the best in the world and the food that they produce is the best in the world, and Australia is famous for it. Our country has one of the greatest global reputations for quality, for high standards and for integrity in our food products. One of the most important things in this country—and we should never underestimate it—is the fact that our food is safe.


Australians want to buy Australian food for all of these reasons, but for many, many years Australians have been, oh, so terribly frustrated by our food labelling system. I do not think that, so far, we have come up with a system that really tells us what we want to know about our food. As we buy, I think there is definitely a greater level of interest in the quality and the products that go into our food. But, also, I think there is a greater interest in knowing where our food has come from.


I think we have every right to know and many reasons to know what we are eating and drinking and where it comes from. That means we have every right, and many reasons, to implement a system that provides clear, simple, unambiguous information about Australian and non-Australian content in our food products. This is why the Australian government has had a positive response from Australian consumers to proposed new labelling changes that were released for public consultation last week. Since the consultation process was released, I have had an extraordinary number of constituents contact me, not only to let us know how pleased they are that we have eventually started to move forward with country-of-origin food labelling, but also because they really want to have their say about what this labelling is going to look like. They want to have their say about what they want to see on food products and how they want to be informed about what they are about to put in their mouths and the mouths of their families and their children.


I understand that there has been more that 8,500 completed surveys already since it has gone up, and the consultation only began last week. It is a great start, but 8,500 is not very many, when you consider how many people there are in Australia. I am certainly one who is going to be advocating very strongly for all Australians who are interested to have their say, so that we can once and for all get food labelling right in this country. I urge anybody who thinks that this issue is important to participate in the process and to contact their federal member, to contact the department or to go online and take part in the survey, which will inform the decision this government makes into the future about what the labelling will look like that will inform the Australian public about the food and drink they are about to consume.


The reality is that, whilst we have had a lot of talk in this space, it has been a long time coming to get to the stage where we are able to have our say about food labelling, and it will be a very long time before we have another opportunity. So I think this is very important, and it is incumbent on Australians who are keen to participate in this process to ensure they have their say.


There is another issue that is really worth mentioning—and this is a much discussed subject, and I cannot imagine how many inquiries have been held into the various food labelling activities of the various products, whether they be broad food labelling or whether they be specific to a commodity group. The cold hard reality is that if this were an issue that was simple to solve, I am sure it would have been solved by now. It is a very complicated issue, but over the last 12 months as this particular inquiry has been going along and we have now come up with some final recommendations that have gone to consultation, we are at the stage where we can go to consumers and ask them to approve it or to give us an idea of exactly what they want in this space.


The other issue is that, while there is a strong expectation that consumers want clear and simple labelling so that they can understand what products are in their food and where those particular food products come from, we have to balance this against the cost to food manufacturers of providing this information on their labels. The last thing we need to do in this country is to burden our businesses with unnecessary regulation, but we also need to make sure that we meet our international trade obligations. We have to be mindful that in providing the additional information for which consumers have been begging for such a long time, we have a three-way balance going on here.


I think Australians, by and by, are prepared to spend a little more on Australian food, but we must make sure that the extra money that they are prepared to spend on Australian food ends up in the pockets of the farmers and the food producers and is not just a cost impost that is passed on to us because the manufacturers have to spend more to comply with the food labelling requirements. In regard to the benefit of any additional cost that may be generated from being able to identify that the product comes from Australia, as I said, I think Australian consumers would be quite happy to aspire to eat Australian food and drink Australian beverages, simply because they know it will be safe, it will be high quality, and it will go towards supporting their fellow constituents: the farmers and food producers of this country.


The complexity of this issue is reflected in the composition of the working group established by the government to develop this new system. It has included representatives across a wide range of industries: industry, agriculture, trade, small business and the health portfolios. I would like to put on the record my congratulations to Ministers MacFarlane, Joyce, Robb, Billson and Nash for their extraordinary collaborative efforts to get this particular proposal to the stage that it is at today.


I believe that informed consumer choice is fundamentally important in a free market system, and the free market is the most efficient mechanism we have ever had to determine the value of goods, services and labour in this country and in fact in any country. Accurate, unambiguous country-of-origin labelling is going to help Australians demonstrate the value that they place on our safe, clean, green, high-quality food; how much they value helping the economy; how much they value helping our farmers; and how much they value helping the hundreds of thousands of Australian workers employed in the food and beverage industry and in the associated manufacturing industries.


We are proposing to implement the new system at a time when Australia has, I was quite surprised to learn, a $1.8 billion trade deficit in the food and beverage, grocery and fresh produce sector. Believe it or not, that is a 20 per cent improvement on the previous year, thanks to some solid export growth that seems to have been generated since we came into government, probably on the back of the fabulous free-trade arrangements that have been negotiated by this government since coming into government, in September 2013.


According to the Australian Food and Grocery Council's 2014 State of the industry report, in 2013-14 Australian grocery sector imports were valued at $14.9 billion, while our exports were valued at only $4.1 billion, which is an extremely disturbing statistic when you consider how fabulous the Australian food producers are. We are still a net exporter of food, but that is on the back of the fact that we have such huge grain exports, livestock exports and chilled meat exports. If you take those big ticket, unprocessed items out of our food exports, you end up with a situation where we have a trade deficit in this space, which I think is a very sad indictment. 


These figures also demonstrate how exposed we are to the food manufacturing standards and ethics of other countries—standards and ethics which do not always meet the expectations of Australian consumers. Recent food safety incidents have provided a catalyst for this important reform, but let us not let these distract us from the fundamental reasons for undertaking it—Australians want to know where their food comes from. Again, for everyone who would like to participate in this public consultation process and complete the country-of-origin food labelling survey, I urge you to do so.
