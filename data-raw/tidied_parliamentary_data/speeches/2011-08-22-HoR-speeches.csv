Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (10:10):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the listing of AQAP and the re-listing of six terrorist organisations. This report reviews the initial listing of the terrorist organisation known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the relisting of six previously listed terrorist organisations. 


Due to the dissolution of the 42nd Parliament and the 2010 federal election, advice to the committee from the Attorney-General's Department of the new listing and the relistings was unavoidably delayed and the committee was therefore unable to review these organisations and report to the parliament within the disallowance period. However, the committee resolved to review the new listing of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the relisting of six other terrorist organisations and report to parliament, albeit outside the disallowance period.


Having completed its review, I can advise that the committee would not have recommended disallowance of the regulations for any of these seven organisations had the committee been able to complete its review within the disallowance period.


As with previous committee reports on listings and relistings and terrorist organisations, this report identifies issues relating to the current nature and reach of each of the organisations, with particular emphasis in the case of the six relistings on developments since the committee last reviewed these organisations. Information was drawn from the statement of reasons provided by the Attorney-General's Department and, when required, as on this occasion, from a private hearing with the Attorney-General's Department and ASIO.


As mentioned above, this is the first listing of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, known as AQAP. The committee took evidence that AQAP has been involved in a number of terrorist attacks in the Arabian Peninsula, both within and outside Yemen. The committee noted that in February this year the ABC's Foreign Correspondenttelevision program reported that Yemen is 'Al Qaeda's new frontier, and a launching pad for Jihadi inspired terrorism' and that the leader of AQAP, Anwar Al-Awlaki, is drawing recruits from many nations around the world, including Australia. 


The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence has recently confirmed the activities of AQAP and its links to Australia as described in Foreign Correspondent. Terrorist attacks which AQAP have recently claimed responsibility for include one on 7 January this year, when 12 soldiers were killed when AQAP militants attacked three military vehicles in the city of Lawdar in Yemen. On 29 October last year, two improvised explosive devices were sent from Yemen using international courier companies and were intercepted in the United Kingdom and in the United Arab Emirates. The devices were disguised as packages and were addressed to synagogues in Chicago. AQAP claim responsibility for sending these devices. In claiming responsibility for the attempted IED attacks mentioned above, AQAP further claimed to have been responsible for the downing of a UPS cargo plane in Dubai in early September 2010 in which two crew members were killed. On 23 July 2010, AQAP militants ambushed a military patrol in the Shabwah province in Yemen, killing six soldiers.


The committee found that AQAP is engaged in activities that satisfy section 102.1 of the Criminal Code. The committee would have not recommended disallowance of the regulations to list AQAP. This is the fourth relisting of al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah, al-Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, Jamiat ul-Ansar and the Abu Sayyaf Group, and it is a third relisting of al-Qaeda in Iraq. In each case, the committee was satisfied that each of these groups continues to engage in terrorist activities which could be a threat to Australia or Australian interests here or overseas.


I should note that in reviewing the evidence in support of the listings the committee draws largely on the statement of reasons which is prepared by ASIO in conjunction with the Attorney-General's office. However, completion of the statement of reasons would normally be at least one or two months prior to the committee writing its report, so in order to take into consideration the very latest information about each group the committee often refers to information on Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre website to support the evidence provided in the statement of reasons, and therefore information may be contained in this report which is more up to date than that which is contained in ASIO's statement of reasons. To sum up, I reiterate that if the committee had been able to report within the disallowance period it would not have recommended disallowance of the regulations in relation to any of the seven terrorist organisations mentioned above.


I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all of the committee members, particularly the deputy chair, for their work in reviewing these terrorist organisations. Lastly, I would like to thank the secretariat. I commend this report to the House.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (10:15):  I take the opportunity of endorsing the comments of the chair. It was unusual, because of the nature of the dissolution of the parliament and the reconstitution of the new parliament and the committee membership, that this matter was not able to be considered within the time frame to enable disallowance of the proscription of the terrorist organisations named in the report. But it is clear that these are the most seminal terrorist organisations that might be considered for listing and it is important, I think, to focus on the fact that we are dealing with the generic names al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah, which have been the most significant terrorist organisations with potential links that can impact on Australians and have in fact taken the lives of numbers of Australians. So it was important, given the nature of the listing process, that the committee examine the evidence and it is important that the Australian public recognise from the evidence that has been adduced that these organisations still continue to pose significant threats to Australians, not necessarily in Australia but they can undertake actions and have undertaken actions which lead to the loss of Australian lives.


So what we have before us is a review of the initial listing of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the relisting of al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah, al-Qaeda in the lands of the Islamic Maghreb, Jamaat Ansar and Abu Sayyaf group and al-Qaeda in Iraq. I certainly believe very strongly, on the basis of the evidence that was adduced to the committee but also on an enormous amount of publicly available information, that we should continue. Mention was made of Jane's. If you read the report you will find that material is there and one ought to be very conscious of it. When I looked at the material in relation to the new organisation that is being proscribed, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the committee's view is that this organisation is one that should be proscribed. We were not minded to see it disallowed even if the time frame permitted of it. 


Outlined in the report is the engagement of this organisation in terrorism, but I think it is important to look at the linkages with Australia mentioned on page 13 of the report. In paragraph 2.16 of the statement of reasons it does say that in February 2011 it was claimed in ABC's Foreign Correspondent television program that Yemen is al-Qaeda's new frontier and a launching pad for jihad inspired terrorism and that the leader of AQAP is drawing recruits from many nations around the world, including Australia. If you look at the report of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, at a private hearing we have ASIO asserting that this organisation released four editions of its quarterly English magazine Inspire aimed at radicalising and mobilising Muslim youth in the West and Australia has been mentioned twice in the second edition, once as a suitable country for attacks. So I think it is important to recognise that these organisations, al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah, still pose threats to Australia. This is outlined in the report in detail. For those who have doubts and think that the situation has moved on and we should perhaps be easing off, this report should be compelling reading for all.


I endorse the comments of the chair in relation to the committee and can I add in relation to the named staff in the report Robert Little, who is here in the gallery, how much we appreciate the work that he and his colleagues have done. I might say this report is very important in bipartisan terms.




The SPEAKER:
  I think it is important that I did not cut off the member for Berowra for Mr Little's sake a few moments ago. The time allotted for the discussion has concluded.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-08-22,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (11:04):  The Greens are committed to getting a better deal for customers, including small business, from Australia's banking sector. That is why we have been pushing hard for a strong commitment from this parliament for banking reform. 


A sustainable banking and financial sector means ensuring a proper balance between effective banking and financial services for consumers and business, and fair rates of return to both the banks and the taxpayers. Up until now the balance has been wrong. Despite the global financial problems, Australia's banking sector is robust and the big four banks have been making record, excessive profits. We have one of the highest concentrations of bank ownership in the developed world, and Australian consumers are paying a premium as a result. 


Improved bank competition is a key means of getting that balance right, as is proper regulation and tax regimes for the banking sector. That is why the Greens have moved to abolish $2 ATM fees; that is why we have proposed improved tax arrangements to properly reflect the taxpayers' effective subsidy of stability in the banking sector; that is why we have moved to protect smaller institutions from being swallowed up by the big four; and it is why we pushed hard to abolish mortgage exit fees over a number of years—a policy the government has since adopted. It is also why we have campaigned for account portability, the centrepiece of the bill that I will introduce today, because only when we rein in the banks' desire and ability to unreasonably boost profits at the expense of customers will we get the balance right.


If we saw the big four banks exposed to real competition from the rest of the banking sector we would see fees and charges go down, returns on deposits improved and better services delivered. But the focus needs to be on consumers. Banking is, in today's society, an essential service: one cannot but have a bank account. One's wages or one's allowances, if one is receiving transfer payments, get paid into electronic bank accounts. That is an enormous pool of money that is there available for the banks, and the banks should not be able to use what is in effect a licence to print money as a way of unreasonably and unfairly gouging consumers by charging excessive fees. That is why getting rid of exit fees is so important and why other barriers, such as refunding lenders' mortgage insurance, have to be addressed.


The report of the Fraser review, Banking services: cost-effective switching arrangements, released by the government yesterday, supports our view that we need reform to enable improved account portability and lender mortgage insurance arrangements. I welcome the government's support for these reforms and I indicate that the Greens are open to a discussion on how to progress them. As a starting point, this bill will address these aspects of competition and will also provide encouragement to customers to look around for a better deal before rolling over long-term deposits. Ultimately, we would like to see Australia shift to full account portability, with an account number that customers can take with them from bank to bank in the same way that mobile numbers can move. This must be the ultimate reform goal in this area, and we believe the Treasurer and the government should commit to making this a reality. The Greens will continue to advocate for a portable account number. However, we accept, as does the Fraser review, that such a goal is hard to achieve in the short term. In the meantime, there is no reason why a lesser but significant form of account portability cannot be put in place, and that is what my bill will do.


This bill will make four important improvements to the banking sector designed to get a better deal for consumers. Firstly, it will allow consumers to switch bank accounts more easily. It does this by amending the Banking Act to require banks to offer switching services for new customers. Upon signing with a new bank, consumers will be entitled to advise that bank to switch over all direct debits and credits from existing transaction accounts in their old bank, or banks, for 13 months. The bill will oblige the old banks to provide all the information necessary for the new bank to enable the switch. These provisions will allow switching between bank accounts to occur cleanly and without the hassle that is currently the case. The onus will be on the new bank to do what is currently the burden of consumers, thus removing what has traditionally been one of the greatest barriers to account switching and improving competition in the sector as a result.


Anecdotally, it has certainly been my experience with the small businesses that I have spoken to in my electorate that it is small businesses who suffer the most when customers change over. Often consumers or customers will forget to reroute their direct debits, and a small business that does not necessarily have the capability to follow up will find that a direct debit they have previously enjoyed has been switched off, usually through oversight by the customer rather than through deliberate action.


Secondly, this bill will provide consumers with more transparent information regarding their term deposits. It does this by amending the Banking Act to require a customer's bank to give written notice of the interest rate and the term that will apply if the money in the term deposit is automatically reinvested at the end of the current term. It also requires the bank to outline all special term interest rates and other special offers available from the bank at that time. This is an important principle of transparency which will prompt consumers into checking that they are indeed getting best value for money.


Thirdly, this bill will provide consumers with more transparent information about their rights under credit contracts. It does this by amending the National Credit Code to require any credit contract to expressly advise the debtor of any unjust transactions and unconscionable interest in other charges, as well as their rights in relation to those charges and the contract. This is another important principle of transparency which will empower consumers to enter into loans having their rights clearly spelled out.


Finally, this bill requires lenders mortgage insurance contracts to be terminated when the mortgage itself is terminated, and for a fair proportion of any rebates paid to be returned to the debtor upon termination. It does this by amending the National Credit Code to require the mortgage lender to return an actuarially fair proportion of the lenders mortgage insurance to the debtor and, in turn, to recover that amount from the provider of the lenders mortgage insurance. Lenders mortgage insurance can be a substantial and little understood burden for consumers and as such is often a secondary consideration to the terms of the mortgage itself when consumers decide whether or not to terminate or switch their mortgages. The provisions of this bill will allow consumers to have returned to them a fair proportion of lenders mortgage insurance, which will again have the upshot of removing barriers to switching and considerably removing competition in the mortgage market.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr BANDT:
  Despite the interjections that are coming from the opposition, I am pleased to say that these four initiatives offering a better deal for consumers have already been given indicative support by government and opposition MPs alike. The Senate Economics References Committee, in the opposition's majority report, conducted an extensive inquiry into competition within the Australian banking sector in 2010-11 and presented its report presented in May of this year. The four initiatives contained in this bill are entirely consistent with the recommendation of those four coalition senators, two Labor senators and Senator Xenophon. I now look forward to their colleagues in this House not only embracing the concepts recommended by their party colleagues in the other place but also having the will to implement them quickly and fully in legislation in the interests of getting a better deal for their constituents.


We have made some progress in the two years since the Greens first proposed to remove mortgage exit fees and scrap $2 ATM fees. The government has agreed to the exit fee ban and established a review of what can be done with ATM fees. We await the results of that review and hope and expect that it includes the removal of fees for on-screen balance inquiries as well. The Fraser review has now reported and makes a strong case for the bill I have put before the House today. I am hopeful that the government's acceptance of the Fraser review recommendations and this bill can form the basis of a discussion between the Greens, the government and others in this parliament on putting in place these important reforms. We will also continue to push for a commitment from this government to move to a system of portable account numbers in the medium term.


Unfortunately, it seems the government is not ready to do what is needed for lenders mortgage insurance. More information in this area is not enough, so we will be pursuing the measures outlined in this bill. Again, we are yet to hear where the government stands on term deposits and ensuring that customers are able to get the best deal when rolling over deposits at the end of the term. There is still much work to be done when it comes to banking reform. We are committed to reining in the excessive profits of the big banks, improving competition and getting a better deal for customers and small businesses. That is what this bill does and it is what we continue to work for. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (11:31):  This Carbon Tax Plebiscite Bill 2011 is important legislation because it will, if passed, restore integrity to our democracy. It will, if passed, ensure that this fundamental principle is recognised and acted upon: that governments should have a mandate for the big changes that they seek to make. The problem which this bill seeks to address is the fact that this government, the Gillard government, has no mandate whatsoever for the biggest legislative change that it now seeks to make—namely, the introduction of a carbon tax. Not only does it not have a mandate for the carbon tax, but it has a mandate specifically not to introduce a carbon tax. This bill which I now speak to in the House is designed to give the government a chance to get back the political integrity that it forfeited by promising before the election not to introduce a carbon tax but doing precisely the opposite afterwards.


Much time of this parliament has been taken up this year with discussion of the carbon tax. The carbon tax has dominated public debate this year. The carbon tax is by far the biggest single issue in our public life right now, and yet the carbon tax does not have the kind of democratic mandate which any government seeking to make such a change should have for a change of this magnitude. Never let us forget that six days before the last election the Prime Minister said:


There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.


This was not a statement which just slipped out. It was not just something that she blurted out unthinkingly in response to a question that she had not anticipated. This statement of the Prime Minister was a deeply calculated response to the statements that I had been making consistently throughout the campaign that 'as sure as night follows day, if this government is re-elected there will be a carbon tax'.


To the best of my knowledge, checking the transcripts, I made that observation on at least 15 separate occasions. I was not the only one who was saying that if the government was re-elected there would be a carbon tax. Many of my frontbench colleagues were making exactly the same point. So in order to defuse this issue the Prime Minister deliberately, with foreknowledge, with absolute cold-blooded purpose, went out and said six days before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' And she did not just say that. She said just before the election—it was on the front page of the Australian the day before the election—'I rule out a carbon tax.' And it was not just the Prime Minister deliberately saying that she ruled out a carbon tax and that there would not be a carbon tax 'under the government I lead'. The Treasurer also, on at least two occasions, said that claims that there would be a carbon tax if the government were re-elected were 'hysterical exaggerations'.


But it is not just the specific statements of the Prime Minister; it is not just the specific statements of the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister; it is everything else that the Prime Minister said about a carbon tax and an emissions trading scheme in the lead-up to the last election. Let us not forget this was a serious problem for the government. In the wake of the collapse of the Copenhagen conference, the government's previous policy to have an emissions trading scheme—the policy championed by the previous Prime Minister to address what he said repeatedly was not just a big issue but was nothing less than the 'greatest moral challenge of our time'—had become increasingly untenable and implausible. What happened was that the former Prime Minister was advised by the current Prime Minister and the current Deputy Prime Minister to drop it.


So back in April last year the government dropped their commitment to an emissions trading scheme and said that there would be no emissions trading scheme until the rest of the world had put something similar in place. That was the position in April. During the election campaign, to get this matter completely off the agenda, at the end of the first week of the campaign the Prime Minister made a major speech where she said that the whole question of climate change would be given over not to the parliament but to a citizens assembly and that no change whatsoever would be pursued by the government until, in the words of the Prime Minister, a 'deep and lasting consensus' had been achieved. So not only did she deny that there would be a carbon tax, and not only did the Treasurer deny that there would be a carbon tax, but everything the Prime Minister said during the election campaign was designed to convey that nothing at all would happen until a 'deep and lasting consensus' had been achieved—a consensus that, she said, would be impossible if the coalition stayed with the position that we had at the election campaign and, I hasten to add, have today.


It is an absolute principle of democracy that governments should not and must not say one thing before an election and do the opposite afterwards. Nothing could be more calculated to bring our democracy into disrepute and alienate the citizenry of Australia from their government than if governments were to establish by precedent that they could say one thing before an election and do the opposite afterwards.


The Prime Minister has sometimes alluded to the example of her distinguished predecessor, the former Prime Minister John Howard, in the course of this carbon tax debate. She said that John Howard had supported a GST and that he had then said, prior to the 1986 election, that there would not be a GST and that he had, in the course of the subsequent term of parliament, changed his mind and said there would be a GST. But the fundamental difference between the current Prime Minister and the former Prime Minister is that the former Prime Minister did not run away from the Australian people; he took his change of heart to the Australian people. He changed his mind in the 1996-1998 term of parliament and took his changed position to the public in the 1998 election. That is the course of conduct that the current Prime Minister should take.


If she really believes that the carbon tax is as necessary as she claims it to be and that the arguments in favour of a carbon tax are as compelling as she says they are, she should not run away from the Australian people; she should revel in the opportunity to take this matter to the Australian people. In fact, the Prime Minister whom the current Prime Minister most resembles in all of this is not former Prime Minister John Howard but former Prime Minister Paul Keating, who before the 1993 election said that tax cuts were 'l-a-w law'; but the 'l-a-w law' turned out to be an l-i-e lie. We all know the political fate of former Prime Minister Keating—a political fate sealed by that deceptive conduct at the 1993 election.


You might even say that, by putting forward this private member's bill for a plebiscite on a carbon tax, I am giving the Prime Minister an opportunity to redeem herself by making an honest politician of herself; that I am giving the Prime Minister an opportunity to overcome the democratic deficit and the honesty deficit which she currently displays. I am proposing in this bill that we can have a vote on the carbon tax without an election and without, necessarily, a change of government. I am making it easier with this bill to actually have this matter put to the people. By proposing a plebiscite I am allowing this matter to go to the public for a vote, as it should, without the prospect—indeed, under current circumstances, the probability—of an election producing a change of government. I am giving the government and other members of this parliament an opportunity to restore faith with fewer adverse consequences for themselves than would otherwise be the case.


I make it absolutely crystal clear that, should this bill pass the parliament and should there be a plebiscite on the issue of a carbon tax before the end of November, I will of course accept the result—as I hope the Prime Minister would accept the result should this bill pass. Whatever differences of opinion we might have in this chamber, in the end this is a democratic parliament—this is a democratic country—and every single member of this parliament has to accept the processes of our democracy. The result of a plebiscite may not change the argument one way or another about the merits or otherwise of a carbon tax, but I tell you this: it would certainly settle the politics of this issue once and for all, and that is what we need in the face of a divisive and damaging debate which is entirely the government's fault, because, if they had not made a commitment one way before the election while doing the opposite after the election, they would not be in their current predicament.


I draw the House's attention to a couple of features of the bill. The bill says:


The question to be submitted to electors in accordance with section 5 is ""Do you support the Government's plan to introduce a price on carbon to deal with climate change?""


It is about as neutral question as I could possibly come up with. The actual formulation of that question was arrived at after consultation with independent members of this parliament, because I want to give independent members of this House and of the other chamber every opportunity to say yes to this bill; I do not want anyone to think that this plebiscite is some kind of stitch up, and, I think, no fair-minded observer could say that a question couched in those terms was anything other than a fair question. The other point I make about the legislation is that the plebiscite will in all other respects be conducted in the same way as a referendum would be conducted: with the usual provision for compulsory voting. It is a fair question, to let the people determine an essential point. This argument—should we or should we not have a carbon tax?—is so important that the public must have their say. It is important that the public should have their say before the government proceeds with legislation, not afterwards. That is what this bill is designed to achieve.


I say to decent, honest members of the government—and there is at least one of them sitting opposite now on the backbenches: there must be times when you are troubled in your souls on this whole question. How can decent, honest members of a government not feel embarrassed and ashamed of the fact that their Prime Minister said one thing before the election and is doing the complete opposite afterwards? She spoke for all of them; she was not just expressing a private view, you know. She was the leader of the Labor Party and the Prime Minister at the time, so she spoke for the member for Hunter, she spoke for the member for Werriwa and she spoke for the member for Brand. She spoke for them when she said there would be no—



An honourable member:  He's the member for Fowler.



An honourable member:  It was Werriwa then.




Mr ABBOTT:
  The member for Fowler—it is hard to keep up with the changes on the other side of the chamber!


But the Prime Minister spoke for all of these members when she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' They are all complicit in this deception, and this bill gives them a chance to come clean, to make a break with this deception and to redeem themselves with the electorate. So I urge them—as I urged the Independent members of this parliament—to consider this legislation.


I know the Independent members of this parliament do not want an election. They want to preserve their position in this parliament. My bill offers them a chance to keep faith with the electorate without prejudicing their position as balance-of-power Independents. I urge them if they do not want to change the government then to please, at the very least, let the people have a say on this matter by supporting my bill.


Ladies and gentlemen, this is a fraught time in our nation's history. We know, because Paul Howse has told us, that there is a crisis in manufacturing. We have heard of the job losses from Qantas and from OneSteel. We learned today that BlueScope, our biggest steelmaker, is ceasing exporting steel because of the difficulties that manufacturing industry now faces. This country will not be an exporter of steel because of the difficulties that manufacturing industry faces.


I know that the carbon tax is not the only difficulty that manufacturing industry faces; I know that the carbon tax has not been an instrumental factor in the decision of BlueScope announced today. But let us not forget how the carbon tax is hovering over all the decisions that manufacturers are making right now. Let us not forget that companies like BlueScope have to make decisions now for the next 40 years, and the assistance package announced as part of the carbon tax lasts for but four years. Let us not forget the statement that the chairman of BlueScope made when the carbon tax was first announced back in February, that compensation for the steel industry would be like putting a bandaid on a bullet wound. Let us not forget these statements. Let us not forget the tremor of fear, anxiety and uncertainty now running through manufacturing industry generally and manufacturing workers right around our country, and let us make a bad situation better by not proceeding with this carbon tax. This is the worst possible time to proceed with what is a bad tax, based on a lie. This bill of mine is a way of ensuring that the public have their chance to have their say.


I have often said, and members of this House will no doubt hear me say it again, there should be no new tax collection without an election. But this bill is an opportunity for members opposite to meet me halfway. It is an opportunity for members opposite and members on the crossbench to meet the Australian public halfway, to put this to a vote without necessarily changing the government and to put this to a vote without all of the trauma of an election. I think this is a good faith attempt by a democratic opposition to allow the government to do the right thing by the Australian people. That is why I commend this bill to the House, and I table the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.


Leave granted for second reading debate to resume at a later hour this day.

That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Sturt from moving forthwith the following motion:


That the Member for Dobell:


(1) attend this Chamber without delay to make a personal explanation for a period not exceeding 15 minutes with respect to the following alleged misrepresentations made in the press. That during the period he was national secretary of the Health Services Union the following occurred:


(a) on 8 April 2005, a call was placed from his union-funded mobile telephone to a number listed as belonging to Sydney Outcalls and on 9 April 2005, a credit card voucher in the amount of $2,475 was issued against the HSU credit card in his name, bearing his signature and referencing his NSW driver's licence number;


(b) on 16 August 2007, a call was placed from his union-funded mobile telephone to a number listed as belonging to Sydney Outcalls and on 16 August 2007, a credit card voucher in the amount of $385 was issued against the HSU credit card in his name, bearing his signature and referencing his NSW driver's licence number;


(c) at diverse times between 2002 and 24 November 2007, he made cash withdrawals from automatic teller machines against his HSU credit card, without producing receipts acquitting or justifying such advances, in an amount totalling some $101,000;


(d) at diverse times between 2002 and 24 November 2007, credit card vouchers in the amount of $15,011 were issued against his HSU credit card in his name for restaurant bills, liquor, accommodation, electronics and a signed poster of motorcycle champion Mick Doohan;


(e) at diverse times between January 2003 and October 2007, credit card vouchers in the amount of $13,809 were issued against his HSU Diners Club card in his name for 19 separate airline tickets for someone other than himself; and


(f) before the 2007 Federal Election, credit card vouchers were issued against his HSU Master Card in his name in relation to the 2007 Federal Election in Dobell in the amount of $18,733 for radio advertising, $7,253 for postage and $13,648 for printing none of which were disclosed to the Australian Electoral Commission as is required under the electoral disclosure law; 


(2) provide the factual basis for his statements on 1 August 2011 in the press, but not in this House, that the allegations above are a misrepresentation because while he had authorised payment by the HSU of these credit card transactions:


(a) he was not responsible for booking and making payment for services in question;


(b) the credit card had been used without his knowledge;


(c) his signature on the vouchers had been forged;


(d) that another person had accepted responsibility for payments to escort services; and


(e) that that other person had personally repaid $15,000 against that liability; and


(3) explain to this House why he did not register the payment of a substantial gift to him by the NSW Branch of the Australian Labor Party paid in May 2011, variously reported as being either $40,000, $90,000 or $150,000 towards the costs incurred in commencing and subsequently abandoning private defamation proceedings against Fairfax Media Ltd in the register of members' interests until at least 77 days after his receipt of those funds.


The member for Dobell needs to assure the House of these matters in a personal explanation or otherwise the Prime Minister's confidence in him is baseless and her protestations of his innocence sound hollow. The Prime Minister and the member for Dobell are essentially in lockstep today. The Prime Minister herself should demand that the member for Dobell attend the House and make a personal explanation dealing with each of these so-called misrepresentations. A personal explanation is the correct mechanism in this House for a member to dispel doubts about whether claims made about him or her are a misrepresentation. The fact that he has not done so suggests that he is not being—

 (Page) (12:32):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's report entitled Report 4/2011: referrals made May to June 2011.


In accordance with standing order 39(f), the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms SAFFIN:
  by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fourth report of 2011, addressing referrals made May to June 2011. This report deals with four inquiries with a total estimated cost of $117.6 million. In each case, the committee recommends the House of Representatives agree to the works proceeding. The report includes additional recommendations to the Department of Defence for preparing future proposals for the committee's consideration and a recommendation to develop protocols for dealing with contaminated sites on Defence properties. The new works include a fit-out of new leased premises for the Human Services portfolio in Canberra, a fit-out of new leased premises for the Australian Taxation Office in Brisbane, contamination remediation works at RAAF Base Williams at Point Cook in Victoria and a specific nutritional capability project for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation at Scottsdale in Tasmania.


Let me first deal with the fit-out of the new leased premises for the Human Services portfolio. The works are needed to accommodate a large portion of the portfolio's staff currently housed in different locations around Canberra. The majority of these leases are due to expire over the next three years. This proposal will reduce the number of leases and consolidate locations in line with the corporate office accommodation strategy. The committee was informed during the inquiry that the department undertook an initial procurement process for the works between 2007 and 2010 which was unsuccessful. The department had to undertake further negotiations with the first and second ranked tenderers before achieving a suitable proposal. The committee was concerned about this process, and notes in its report that all agencies should ensure their tender processes are robust and sufficiently informed by market conditions to avoid failure. Notwithstanding these concerns, the committee is satisfied that the project has merit and should proceed.


Moving to the second fit-out of Commonwealth leased premises, the committee considered a proposed fit-out of new premises for the Australian Taxation Office in the heart of Brisbane. This proposal will consolidate two premises currently housing ATO staff into a single building, achieve greater operational efficiencies, improve the standard of accommodation for staff and meet compulsory Commonwealth standards on its environmental impacts. The committee is satisfied that this project has merit and will achieve its outcomes of meeting Commonwealth property management guidelines, increase the department's ability to adapt to changing accommodation requirements in the future and achieve more collaborative work practices.


Chapter 4 of the report deals with proposed contamination remediation works at a former fire training area at RAAF Base Williams at Point Cook in Victoria. The committee inspected this site on 26 July 2011, witnessing firsthand the need for the works. The site was used in the 1980s for firefighting training. As a result, the soil now contains approximately 950,000 litres of toxic liquid waste called dense non-aqueous phase liquid. This liquid contains over 120 chemicals. While the toxic liquid is not yet in contact with nearby Port Phillip Bay, groundwater has moved through the soil on the site, dissolving chemicals which are now discharging into the bay. The physical barrier between the toxic substance and the bay is reducing due to coastal erosion, increasing the pressing need for contamination remediation works on the site. Whilst the committee observed that Defence continues to monitor the site and undertake rigorous testing, it is patently clear that remediation works are urgently needed to prevent future damage. As outlined in this report, the committee notes there are a number of other Defence sites around Australia that will require contamination remediation works in the near future. The committee recommends in its report that Defence ensure that all remediation works are of the highest standard and that contamination is removed entirely from each site. Defence must actively engage with and inform local land users, authorities and community groups, and demonstrate that each site poses no risk to human health or the environment. I move to the final proposal considered by the committee. This is the specific nutritional capability project for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation at Scottsdale in Tasmania. The project aims to address the shortcomings of the current facility. A cell culture laboratory will be established to enable DSTO to investigate the impact of nutrition on health and performance outcomes using modern techniques. It will present opportunities in the field of nutrigenomics and improve research and development into nutrition to meet the specific needs of the Australian Defence Force.


The committee inspected the current facility, which limits DSTO's ability to meet ADF directives and taskings in relation to nutrition and food science capabilities. The project is anticipated to cost $18.7 million. In reaching this proposal, DSTO considered a number of options which were brought to the committee's attention. Defence had also considered relocating the site to elsewhere in Australia; however, they did not address this option in their submissions to the committee.


Whilst the committee is satisfied that Defence considered all options available for the project proposal, the committee recommends that each and every option considered by Defence be discussed at length in their submissions for the committee's consideration in the future. I know the locals were very pleased that it is staying exactly where it is—but that is a separate issue.


I would like to thank members and senators for their work in these inquiries. In particular, I would like to thank and welcome Senator Alex Gallacher and Senator Anne Urquhart, who joined the committee since the tabling of our last report. I commend the report to the House.

"Hawke, Alex, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr HAWKE
 (Mitchell) (12:57):  I welcome the chance to resume my remarks in relation to the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2011. At the time of the interruption of my last remarks I was speaking about the impact upon smaller colleges and enterprises in Australia today and the sometimes unintended consequences of government regulation where there is an inconsistent policy approach.


Since I have had the opportunity to do so I have been reading further papers from the Council of Private Higher Education Incorporated, which has put together a worthwhile paper in relation to this area. I would like to quote from their paper in relation to what the role of government is in the private education sector. The council says, 'The international education sector does not expect a direct subsidy of the type variously afforded industries such as manufacturing; but nor does it expect excessive charges, even under the mantra of full cost recovery. Above all, it does not expect unhelpful and unnecessary policy settings, inconsistency between different arms of government and sudden, politically-driven policy changes without full industry consultation.'


Amen to that. At the moment, of course, we do have inconsistent approaches between state and federal governments for this sector. We do have excessive regulation and, indeed, this government is moving us towards full cost recovery for the industry. Some people might ask, 'What's wrong with that?' Indeed in many cases I am a supporter of full cost recovery, and the fee restructuring that is going on here is not all bad. However, the inconsistency in policy approach from this government, including the handling of visas and the regulatory framework that has surrounded the treatment of international students, has meant a diminishing of this vital industry for Australia. Once again, I would endorse the role that this industry plays; it was our third biggest export industry a few years ago and totalled $17 billion in income for our country. It allows Australia to provide a great source of regional foreign policy in educating students from all across Asia. Most of those students, of course, return to the countries they come from, well educated by our country and looking forward to seeking high roles in their countries, with a high view of this country and the education services that we provide: a great outcome for all concerned. So I do think that government does have a role to provide a much more balanced regulatory framework—as the council calls for—one that is not inconsistent, one that does provide certainty for the industry and with proper industry consultation. I think that, if the government had consulted further on this legislation, it could be improved. I think that it is reasonable to say that colleges with fewer than 30 international students could benefit from a cap on the fees that are being charged. That is not something that would cost government a lot. With proper consultation I think that small and very small colleges, those struggling to survive and those that are working their way up to become large colleges, could have their fees capped. I do not think that that is unreasonable. With minimum consultation, the government could have ascertained that that would be a good idea and approach and that we could improve the quality of this legislation. I want to say again that the government often fails to consult adequately with industry sectors and I do think that that has led to the inherent weaknesses in the legislation that we see put before us in this parliament.


We know that if a college has less than five per cent of international enrolments this will unfairly penalise them financially. With fewer than 30 international students, or less than five per cent of enrolments, there is a very low risk here of any kind of trouble for the government and what with full cost recovery and the nature of the return for the government it certainly seems to be a strange policy setting. It probably has more to do with the nature of the government debt burden we have at the moment than anything else.


Of course this legislation comes out of the Stronger, simpler, smarter ESOS: supporting international students review conducted by the Hon. Bruce Baird. It had many recommendations, some of which the government has adopted, some which it has not. That review had a certain point of view. I think that some of its recommendations were worth while; I think that others unfairly burden this industry. It is heavily regulated. There are providers in this sector that have continued to hold the accreditation required by state and federal governments over many, many years without incident. They have been proven to be effective providers of education at tertiary level and for other courses and therefore they do not need the same level of regulatory burden or increased regulatory burden that we might be looking to target institutions that do not have such a good record or that do have problems. That is where government does have a role to play, but we have to find ways to target our legislation at the problem we are seeking to address and not to burden unnecessarily the entire sector with increasing regulatory burdens and costs without any due return.


I just want to make that point before finishing my remarks. Here in this place we have some great providers of overseas education. Indeed, we ought to be encouraging this industry to continue to do the job that it has done so well over the last decade. Certainly, this sector is suffering, not exclusively but in part, due to government action. This kind of regulation, while it may look inherently good on the surface, will not help in general with the policy settings that the government has put in place in this sector. We should seek legislation and regulatory reform that recognises those worthwhile institutions that have been accredited for a long time and that are providing a service in this space and not causing any trouble, and remove burdens as well as increase the amount of legislation or amendments that we are passing in this place. We should also seek to make the job of independent providers easier in Australia.

Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide—Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (13:03):  I would like to take this opportunity to thank those members who have spoken on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2011 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Registration Charges Consequentials) Bill 2011. As we have made clear, the Australian government is deeply committed to ensuring that those international students who choose to study in Australia receive high-quality education and training. At the same time, the government maintains the same level of commitment to also ensuring that the international education services industry remains a robust and sustainable one. (Quorum formed)


The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2011 and Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Registration Charges Consequentials) Bill 2011 build on recent changes to the ESOS Act through the reregistration of all providers and ensures a rigorous gateway to the industry in terms of ongoing registration and compliance activity. All international education providers are required to register on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students. Through the restructure and rebasing of the annual registration charge, the Commonwealth will be able to deliver a more direct and effective registration and supervisory regime for the international education industry.


The tiers of the restructure charge, which are outlined in this bill, reflect the different levels of regulatory risk presented by various categories of providers across the industry—something the government sees as appropriate. For example, new providers considered to be higher risk in the first three years of their operation will pay additional amounts in those initial years of operation. Providers who have had regulatory action taken against them will also pay additional amounts. Further, there is scope through regulation to allow certain providers such as public universities, technical and further education providers, and public schools to be exempted from certain elements in the new ARC such as the annual per course component. This rebasing and restructuring of the ARC is a significant milestone for the international education services industry.


The government is moving away from a charging arrangement that treats all categories of providers—all businesses in this industry—as having the same characteristics. Instead, the new ARC will reflect the different characteristics of the main subsectors across the industry, as these are reflected in the costs of registration and compliance activity. These amendments represent the first component of the government's second-phase response to the recommendations of the Baird review, which was released on 9 March 2010. In releasing the final report, the Prime Minister in her then role as Minister for Education noted that the government supports the recommendations made by the review relating to lifting the bar on entry to the international education industry. These bills take up the challenge of this recommendation by introducing an entry-to-market charge on providers seeking their first registration in the industry. This will also ensure that this group of providers is able to receive the requisite attention in their initial period of registration.


While the restructured ARC introduces more components than the existing arrangements, this bill will realise a fairer and more equitable distribution of the imposition of these charges across the industry. This will mean many providers across the industry will experience an overall reduction in the total amount of the ARC they pay, while the introduction of a risk based element in accordance with the recommendations of the Baird review will mean that some providers pay slightly more based on that risk assessment. In turn, those providers that present more regulatory risk will receive more regulatory attention.


The restructured and rebased ARC will help ensure a strong and vibrant industry where high-quality providers are able to flourish and those that present a higher regulatory effort are given the appropriate regulatory attention. This first component of the government's second-phase response to the recommendations of the Baird review will make a significant difference in ensuring the integrity and sustainability of the international education services industry in Australia. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (13:45):  Saturday, 20 August was the first National Bookshop Day conducted in Australia. I was very pleased to participate at Robinsons Bookshop in Victoria, the oldest continuing independent bookseller in Victoria. The booksellers and bookshop community have had to come together because, rather than having a Minister for Small Business, we seem to have a 'minister against small business'. Senator Sherry predicted the demise of bookshops. At a time when all in the retail sector are doing it tough, the last thing they needed was a knife in the back from the Gillard government minister. 


So the bookshop community thought it would not just stand back and bemoan the underperformance of the small business minister; it would get out there on the front foot to share with people that independent bookshops and booksellers do more than simply sell books. They are a great place to foster a love of reading, ensuring books are embedded in our culture. This could not be more true than for Robinsons Bookshop in Frankston in the community of Dunkley that I represent. It is right in the heart of Frankston. It is a fantastic place with a coffee shop at the back. There are dedicated staff sharing, as they did with me, their knowledge and expertise on good book purchases for loved ones, families and personal consumption. I was happy to buy another in the series of Slinky Malinki, a great children's book series.


As in so many policy areas, this government is not about abating emissions or sequestering carbon; it is about abating optimism and sequestering confidence. We need a change of government to support the retailers. (Time expired)

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  on indulgence—Last Thursday night three of the ABC's finest staff members died in a helicopter crash. I think members of the House would have received that news on Friday morning with a great sense of despair. The three were Gary Ticehurst, John Bean and Paul Lockyer. It was for the ABC one of its darkest days. All three died doing what they did so well, going out and getting the story. Between them these three men shared a century of experience.


Gary Ticehurst was one of the nation's finest helicopter pilots with 38 years in his flying career, including 25 years as the ABC's chief helicopter pilot, and was famous for his coverage of 27 Sydney to Hobart yacht races. He displayed remarkable courage helping to rescue 20 crew members in that disastrous Sydney to Hobart yacht race in 1998, and many of us would remember that well.


John Bean was an exceptional, multi-award-winning cameraman. Reporters always wanted to work with him. Queensland based, he knew every corner of that state and I had the opportunity with Premier Bligh on Friday to reflect on some of the things she had seen him doing in Queensland. He worked on some of the ABC's most popular programs including the 7.30 Report, Catalyst, The New Inventors and Gardening Australia. Camera work is at the very heart of television, and images that tell the story often better than the words were his passion.


Paul Lockyer was one of the ABC's longest serving reporters—42 years. He spent years as a foreign correspondent in the killing fields of Cambodia, in the US under Reagan and in Manila under Marcos. He was responsible for Logie award-winning coverage of the Sydney Olympics but was best known in recent years for his sympathetic portrait of inland Australia, especially the Murray-Darling Basin and Lake Eyre, and coverage of the floods in Queensland this year. He was the first into Grantham the morning after the floods, bringing those reports which enabled the nation to understand what had happened there.


Last week I spoke of journalism and media as an honourable profession. The lives of these three gifted men prove that proposition beyond a shadow of doubt. Men and women of the media so often risk their lives to bring the story home in war and conflict, travelling to inhospitable places and making personal sacrifices which include danger, discomfort and austerity. Gary, John and Paul took these risks and told their stories. They were true professionals and true gentleman of the Australian media. Leigh Sales said that you could not name three people in the ABC news more loved and admired. ABC managing director, Mark Scott, said that they were news gatherers at the peak of their craft. Our deepest condolences go to their families, to the wider ABC family and to all of their colleagues and friends. These three remarkable men will be greatly missed and our media landscape will not be the same without them.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:04):  I rise to support the fine words of the Prime Minister in commemoration of this remarkable trio. It is noteworthy that the three of them died in a remote corner of South Australia because what they had been trying to do was to bring the spirit of the bush into the hearts of our cities, a very worthy project. They will live forever in the hearts of their friends and families. On behalf of the coalition I offer our deepest condolences to all who knew them.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (14:04):  I also join in paying tribute to this team of three of the ABC's finest people who have made a remarkable contribution to news over the years in different ways. Gary Ticehurst was a pioneer in helicopter news coverage and he was also widely respected within the aviation community. John Bean was an outstanding cameraman and was able to convey to people some of the real depth of the issues through the pictures he took. He spent some time with me on what is known as the wombat trail during the last federal election campaign with the Leader of the Third Party and I can attest to the fact that he is also good company to be with.


I would particularly like to recognise Paul Lockyer. I thought Paul had done all of the great things that journalists do, the big stories: big events such as the Olympic games, Foreign Correspondent and the big programs but, particularly in his latter years, he spent a lot of time telling the regional stories and spending time in regional communities. He was able to bridge the gap between country and city with warmth and conviction in the way he was able to tell the stories. For instance, during the flooding in Queensland there were hundreds of journalists and hundreds of stories, but I think the ones that touched us most were Paul Lockyer's coverage of what happened in Grantham. It was not just the gravity of the event. The way in which that story grabbed all of our hearts and minds was due to the way in which he was able to bring some of the humanity of that catastrophic event into the living rooms of Australians. He certainly was a great journalist, but I want to particularly acknowledge today the contribution that he made to regional Australia as someone who was prepared to get out into the country areas and tell the stories in a way that we all understood. His coverage of the drought also, I think, helped people very much to understand the personal tragedies associated with events like this. This team died doing something they loved in the remotest part of Australia, and perhaps the place where they would most have wanted to be. We certainly acknowledge their contribution to journalism, but today, especially, I also want to acknowledge their contribution to regional Australia.




The SPEAKER:
  To enable members at this stage to associate themselves with the remarks of the three leaders, and as a mark of respect, I invite members to rise in their places.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:09):  On the Leader of the Opposition's question, like so many questions before, first and foremost, I think we should be very, very clear that the announcement by BlueScope today, which would be received as very, very difficult news for the workforce of BlueScope, with 1,000 jobs to go, 800 in the Illawarra and 200 in Hastings, that that very tough news for those families is not related to the government's policy of putting a price on carbon. I refer the House to the statement that BlueScope Steel made to the Australian Stock Exchange where it said:


The economic conditions for export steel-making from Australia appear unlikely to become favourable in the foreseeable future, and our continued exposure to this marker is clearly unsustainable. Our decision is a direct response to the economic factors affecting our business and is not related to the Federal Government's proposed carbon tax.




Mr Abbott:
  Mr Speaker, on a point of order, I asked why she is making a bad situation worse, and she should be directly—



Honourable members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his place. I am now forced to invite the Leader of the Opposition to rise on his point of order and put it again. I could not hear because of the pre-emptive interruptions.




Mr Abbott:
  Thank you, Mr Speaker. On direct relevance, I was simply pointing out that I asked the Prime Minister why she is making a bad situation worse.




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker, on the point of order, respectfully and in accordance with the standing orders, I would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition has now had his supplementary question. 



Honourable members interjecting—  




The SPEAKER:
  Order! There is no point of order. Again, not wishing to mark people's homework, in the repeated fashion the Leader of the Opposition actually put to me a point of order in proper order, even though I cannot agree with him because he did not give his preamble which widens the scope for the answer. I think that if everybody just listened to one another, it would assist. The Prime Minister has the call.




Ms GILLARD:
  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I go to some trouble to make that point about BlueScope Steel because, as I understand it, some of these things are already being misrepresented and I believe that it is quite wrong to misrepresent to around 1,000 working people and their families the reason that their jobs are under threat. I want to be absolutely clear before this parliament, and I think that every member of this parliament has got an obligation to be absolutely clear with individuals in the community, that this is not a decision related to the government's plans to put a price on carbon.


On the government's plan to put a price on carbon, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that both the government and the opposition are committed to a minus-five per cent reduction in carbon pollution by 2020. The question therefore presents that if you are going to reduce carbon pollution by five per cent by 2020, do you start soon and do it in the easiest possible way or do you start late with dramatic dislocation to the economy? Well, I am for starting soon. The Leader of the Opposition is for starting late, with dramatic dislocation. I do not believe that the Leader of the Opposition's plan would be good for Australian industries and businesses because of that dramatic dislocation.


Number 2, the question that presents is: do you do it in the most efficient and cheapest possible way, or do you do it in the most costly and cumbersome way? I am for doing it in the cheapest possible way. The Leader of the Opposition is for doing it in the most costly and cumbersome way. And of course in assessing that putting a price on carbon is the cheapest possible way to do it, we have relied on the advice of economists. I know that that is discounted by members opposite, but I would refer them, for example, if they are looking for sources of economic advice, to the words of the IMF where they have said:


We support the proposed introduction of a carbon price as part of a transition to a permits trading system to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.


They went on to say in a facts sheet:


Broad based taxes on greenhouse gas emissions are the most natural policy instrument as they exploit all possible behavioural responses for reducing emissions throughout the economy …


The shared minus five per cent target: we want to do it in the most efficient way. We want to do it in the way that is therefore best for Australian industries, businesses and employment. It is the Leader of the Opposition that is committed to a scheme of dislocation and job losses.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:25):  I thank the member for Throsby for his question. I know that he and the member for Cunningham will be working with their local community as it deals with the blow that they have had today. This is very difficult news for the people of the Illawarra. It is also very difficult news for people in Hastings. We understand the patchwork of pressures that are on our economy and we have been discussing with the Australian community for a considerable period of time now the fact that our nation is in the grips of an economic transition.


We are seeing a global transition of economic weight from west to east. That is good for Australia, because it means that we are here in the part of the world that is growing and will continue to grow strongly and where the history of this century will be written. We understand too that our economy is going through a transition which comes from record terms of trade and strong demand for our resources. That means that our Australian dollar has been and will continue to be high. That puts pressure on export oriented industries like manufacturing, like tourism and like international education. We also understand that we need to see our economy transition to a clean energy future, and the most efficient way of doing that is to put a price on carbon.


Understanding those patchwork pressures on our economy, we have seen today's announcement from BlueScope. We understand that this requires the government to respond in a series of ways. We are responding directly and nationally with BlueScope through our Steel Transformation Plan. We intend to respond to the needs of the regions involved with a plan to directly invest in economic diversification and jobs—$30 million will be available, $20 million from the federal government, $5 million from the government of New South Wales and $5 million from BlueScope itself. We are also making available $10 million in direct services and support for working people. We will also be investing in jobs in Hastings. We want to make sure that the working people who are caught up in this decision get their full entitlements, and we welcome the fact that BlueScope has said they will be paid their full entitlements. They will get the assistance that they need in skilling, training and support to get a new job. The regions affected will also get support for economic diversification.


I believe that Australia will continue to be a nation that manufactures products that the world will want to buy. As a government, we have been strongly engaged in manufacturing. Whether through the new car plan, through our powering ideas agenda or through the work we have done on procurement and supplier advocates, we have been strongly engaged in manufacturing. I believe that we will continue to be a nation that makes things and has the benefit of high value added jobs and high wage jobs. Of course, that will mean that we will need to work with the manufacturing industry and those parts of the country that are particularly reliant on manufacturing. We will be working directly with the members for Throsby and Cunningham as we work our way through these job losses at BlueScope and the consequences for the individuals and for the community.

I remind her that in the last three years 105,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost, we face the worst manufacturing employment figures since records were first kept in the 1960s and manufacturing activity has contracted for more than two years under this government. Given plummeting confidence in manufacturing in Australia, is now really the time to be introducing an economy-wide, job-destroying, confidence-crushing carbon tax?

",HoR,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Carbon Pricing</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,19,1,question
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:30):  I certainly believe now is the time to be working with manufacturing to secure its future. I certainly believe that means that the government does need to continue to roll out its programs and plans like the new car plan and I certainly believe that that requires us to work with manufacturing as we transition to a clean energy economy. In the carbon pricing package that we have announced there are allocations of around a billion dollars to work with manufacturing because we want to see them make that transition to a clean energy future. 


Now is not the time to be cutting back the programs that support manufacturing, as the Leader of the Opposition has committed to do. Now is certainly not the time to be doing that. Now is not the time to go about cutting carbon pollution in the most costly, least efficient way possible. The Leader of the Opposition's plans for a $1,300 per family slug and no industry assistance as industries transition would be dreadful for manufacturing. Of course, if he were ever elected as Prime Minister, before he got there he would be taking a direct slug of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars out of the support that we provide to manufacturing. That is the plan in writing and circulated in the community of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister. It is a dreadful thing to do to manufacturing, given the pressures on it at the present time.

Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:36):  I thank the member for Cunningham for that very important question, and I know she will be working very hard with locals who have been affected by this decision which has been announced today, because this House does understand, I believe, just how significant an announcement this is and what a blow it is to affected workers, their families and their communities. There is no question that this government is committed to a very strong manufacturing sector for our country, and a critical part of a strong manufacturing sector is, of course, a strong steel industry. The steel industry faces a number of challenges: rising input prices, excess global supply, weak domestic demand and, of course, a higher dollar. A higher dollar certainly delivers cheaper prices to many consumers, but it also means that more of our manufacturers are under pressure. Sadly, we are seeing the consequences of that today.


So the thoughts of everybody, at least on this side of the House, are with all of those workers that are affected today. That is why we will contribute $20 million to a new investment fund to support growth and new jobs in the region. BlueScope and the New South Wales government are also providing $5 million each, totalling $30 million, and we are providing a further $10 million to provide redundant workers with immediate access to intensive support, training and relocation services.


The government will also allow BlueScope to draw down up to $100 million in advance payments from the $300 million Steel Transformation Plan. This just underscores how important this plan is, and for the life of me I simply cannot understand why those opposite are opposing the Steel Transformation Plan. It is just as irresponsible as their plan to rip out $500 million in support for the automobile industry. They simply have no sense of the challenges facing manufacturing industry in this country.


BlueScope has provided a number of important assurances. The Port Kembla blast furnace and the metal-coating line at Western Port will be able to be reactivated if conditions improve—that is the commitment that has been given—and redundant workers will be paid their full legal entitlements. BlueScope will continue as a significant employer in the region over the life of the Steel Transformation Plan and, importantly, remains committed to steel production in Australia.


So on this side of the House we understand that, if we want to continue to have a strong manufacturing industry into the future, we do need a long-term reform plan. That is why the government is cutting company tax to 29 per cent, with a head start for small business, and using the revenue from the MRRT—once again, that very significant reform is opposed by those on the other side of the House. It is why we are putting in place major tax concessions for small business—the $6,500 instant asset write-off. Nothing could be more important to the cash flow of a small business than a $6,500 instant asset write-off, which is opposed by those of the other side of the House, for 2.7 million small businesses in our country, many of which are not in the fast lane of the mining boom. It is also why we are committed to a $3 billion skills and training package. What we are on about is putting in place the long-term reforms to strengthen and broaden our economy and to make sure the opportunities of the mining boom are spread right around our economy. We have a plan for the future; sadly, those opposite do not. They have only a plan for picking fault, scoring points and talking down our economy. That is the only plan they have. (Time expired)

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (15:37):  When I was interrupted, I was outlining some of the concerns that we on this side of the House still have with the proposed national curriculum. In the first instance I was referring to our concern about the lack of an overall framework, which governs the national curriculum, and the lack of clear direction, which underpins it. I was then moving on to talk about the fact that the curriculum has a very heavy emphasis on Asian and Indigenous culture but does not give a similar weight to our British heritage or our Judeo-Christian traditions. I advise the House that they should read the IPA's monograph on the national curriculum. It is called The national curriculum—a critique. It noted that Western culture and civilisation are:




… v
irtually absent from the national curriculum as it is currently conceived.



I think that is an area which needs to be re-examined, relooked at and incorporated into the national curriculum in terms of our overall British and Western heritage and our Judeo-Christian heritage, which we inherited, as well as Asian and Indigenous culture.


Some of the other concerns that we have raised are over the lack of appropriate resources which will be attached to the implementation of the national curriculum. There many other issues which Christopher Pyne, the shadow minister for education, has raised.


We are moving two amendments to enhance the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill. The first is to ensure that schools are provided with appropriate support to implement the national curriculum. One of our criticisms has been that there has not been that support in the form of professional development training for teachers to implement the curriculum.


The second is to ensure that there is a clear representation of the non-government school sector with respect to decision-making processes for future time lines of the national curriculum. Again, one of the problems I was referring to beforehand was that the non-government school sector was out of sync with the government school sector. I think part of that has come about due to the fact that the non-government school sector has not been at the decision-making table. These amendments would ensure that they are always at the decision-making table on issues which affect their schools. Given that they make up a third of all school students in the country, it seems to be a very sensible thing to do.


Let me conclude by saying that, like many things the government has touched, the national curriculum has involved delays, bungles and underdelivery against the government's rhetoric. This national curriculum was supposed to be finished and implemented by January 2011. Of course it has not been and now probably will not be implemented until 2013 or 2014. It was supposed to be a smooth process but it has not been anything of the sort. In fact, every single stakeholder group has in some respect complained about the drafts that have been presented and asked for significant changes.


Finally, it was supposed to have been delivered already according to the Prime Minister's own words of July 2010 when she said:




This nation
'
s talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.



She has not delivered it. It is nowhere near being delivered. It will be several years late from when she claimed she delivered it, but I suggest she takes that time and gets the national curriculum right because it will have a significant impact across all schools in our community. It needs to be properly thought through and properly considered and the government needs to get the content right. As I have mentioned before in this House, we ideally should have bipartisan support, at least in relation to the broad framework of the national curriculum, so that schools in the future can have confidence that it will not be chopped and changed but, rather, there will be a consistent framework governing the curriculum going forward.

"Cheeseman, Darren, MP",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (15:42):  Today I take the opportunity to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill, which deals with the national curriculum in Australian schools. I think it is extremely important that we have a consistent and uniform curriculum across all schools in this nation.


Australian education has changed enormously over the decades. I particularly want to draw to the House's attention the fact that families are more transient than ever before. Long gone are the days when kids would remain in the same school to receive their education. The reality is that families these days have to move from town to town or state to state, and it is important that those children are not disadvantaged as a consequence of the work pattern that their parents have to undertake. That is why it is important that we have a standard uniform curriculum that provides young people with the opportunity to move from school to school, state to state and to be able to pick up almost where they left off at their previous school.


It is also important that that curriculum remains modern and contemporary for the needs of our nation and the needs of those families and students. Long gone are the days when we studied history, particularly in the context of colonialisation and British history. We have a much more diverse history than that, and our curriculum needs to recognise that. It needs to build on that and reflect the great tradition and diversity we have in Australia. It also needs to instil in students creative thinking and an understanding of ethical behaviour. Personal and social consequences and intercultural understanding are an important part and are important Australian values, and our curriculum needs to very clearly recognise that and instil in our young people the necessary skills to be able to respond to what is now a very multicultural society. The details of these bills are important and I would like to take some time to go through them. The regulation will prescribe as the national curriculum any new version of the Australian Curriculum authorised by the Council of Australian Governments Standing Council for School Education and Early Childhood. The amendment will provide a more certain legal framework for the non-government sector in which to implement the national curriculum and provide greater administrative efficiency for prescribing the phased introduction of the curriculum.


Australia has a world-class curriculum that recognises the 21st century. We have a world-class curriculum in the development of skills and knowledge in all of the important areas—English, mathematics, science and history, with development in geography, languages and arts well underway to be implemented at a later time. For the first time, students all over Australia will be studying the same curriculum in the four key areas. As I mentioned earlier, families move around much more than they have historically. State boundaries have become a problem for students and families, particularly when it comes to slotting kids into new schools in different areas. They find that subjects that they have already learnt are now being taught and that they miss out on other subjects through the course of their studies. It is important that we provide uniformity in our curriculum so that young students are not disadvantaged in that regard.


It is also important that we recognise that we have two forms of school education in Australia: one provided by the states and territories and the other provided by independent providers. As students move between government schools, students also move between private and independent schools and government schools and vice versa. Again, it is important that we recognise that fact and have uniformity of education wherever possible, particularly in the key fundamental areas of education such as English, languages, science, mathematics, the arts and the like. That is extremely important.


I would like to report that I have 70-odd schools that service my electorate. It is a diverse bunch of schools teaching a very diverse bunch of students. My electorate covers some 7,000 square kilometres and many of my students have to travel some distance to access education. All of those families require quality education for their children. I would also like to point out that not only have we in the government been busy with respect to establishing decent curriculum standards across this nation but also we have invested substantially in the infrastructure that is required to help support modern education, whether through the provision of language labs in secondary schools or libraries and multipurpose classrooms and the like in primary schools—again, providing flexible learning spaces that give students every opportunity to access that curriculum in a modern way.


I would like to take this opportunity to point to a number of primary schools particularly in my electorate that, whilst they have received special funds under the Building the Education Revolution program, are in desperate need of a boost to help support a modern curriculum. (Quorum formed)




Mr CHEESEMAN:
  Obviously the tactics committee and the Liberal Party has been flat out this afternoon. Before the quorum was called, I was talking about a number of primary schools in my electorate that require a substantial amount of funding to help them rebuild themselves. I draw the attention of the House to Portarlington Primary School and Birregurra Primary School, both of which have a substantial number of buildings which have been there a very long time and should be bulldozed and replaced with new, modern facilities to provide modern infrastructure so that the curriculum can be—




Mr Fletcher:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: understanding standing order 76, I put it to you that what the member is speaking about is not relevant to the matter before us—that is, the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011, not a listing of BER grants in his electorate, which is what we are hearing.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  I counsel the honourable member for Corangamite to observe the standing orders; however I do draw to the attention of the honourable member for Bradfield the long title of the bill, which is 'a bill for an act to amend the law relating to education and for related purposes'. The addition of the words 'and for related purposes' does tend to widen somewhat the ambit of the discussion. The member for Corangamite has the call.




Mr CHEESEMAN:
  Those are very wise words, Mr Deputy Speaker. To deliver curriculum in schools in a modern way, you need modern facilities, and the BER program provided modern facilities for schools. Having said that, there are some schools that still require further assistance with the building of infrastructure so that they can deliver a modern, flexible curriculum that responds to national need, and Portarlington Primary School and Birregurra Primary School are two examples of schools that are old and need investment. Whilst those school communities have very much appreciated the BER investment in those schools, it is incumbent upon the state government to come to the table and help support those school communities in their time of need.


Within my electorate I have many communities that are rapidly growing. The people in those communities come from diverse backgrounds, and they appreciate and recognise the importance of having strong education for their kids. This government has done more to reform education in all sectors than any other government has done since Federation. Our side, the Labor Party, is very proud of that. We recognise that the best way to give a student a decent life is to give them a decent education, and the cornerstone of that is having a strong curriculum that is flexible and creative and enables our students to grow in a way that we all can be extremely proud of.


I am very pleased that a number of schools have come together and made a very strong application for a trades training centre. Indeed, they have picked up a grant to build a new trades training facility that will look after the Coolac, Apollo Bay and Lavers Hill communities. If we want to have a curriculum that delivers strongly for students in our electorates we need to make sure that we provide the facilities that are appropriate to the curriculum, and trades training will provide opportunities to young people. We also need to make sure that we have in our schools appropriate access to computers, because for anyone— (Time expired)

WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (15:57):  I rise to speak to the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. The Schools Assistance Act 2008 currently provides for the funding arrangements for non-government schools to be continued upon implementation of the national curriculum by 31 January 2012. With the legislation as it now stands, if the curriculum is not implemented by the stated date the Australian government could require reimbursement of these funds. The amendment proposed in the bill repeals the implementation date of 31 January 2012 and replaces it with a standing regulation that takes into account the staged development and implementation of the national curriculum. Also, the proposed amendment provides that the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood and Youth Affairs will determine new timelines.


When the initial legislation on the national curriculum was drafted in 2008, it was anticipated that the national curriculum would be finalised and ready to be rolled out by the beginning of 2011. However, the government underestimated the complexities of the task at hand, and the national curriculum is far from finalised. Like most programs developed by this Labor government, the development of the national curriculum has been poorly managed. The coalition is supportive of the principle of an Australian curriculum; however, the final version has not been approved and most jurisdictions will not begin its implementation until 2013. The legislation before us therefore needs amendment. It should be noted that the coalition attempted to make the necessary amendments in March this year; but at that point the minister seemed unaware that there would be a problem.


In 2008, education ministers adopted the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians. The declaration affirmed:




As a nation Australia values the central role of education in building a democratic, equitable and just society—a society that is prosperous, cohesive and culturally diverse, and that values Australia
'
s Indigenous cultures as a key part of the nation
'
s history, present and future.



It further affirmed:




Schools play a vital role in promoting the intellectual, physical, social, emotional, moral, spiritual and aesthetic development and wellbeing of young Australians, and in ensuring the nation
'
s ongoing economic prosperity and social cohesion.



These are the guiding principles that have informed the development of the national curriculum, and, as guiding principles, they are admirable in their intent. However the requirement to amend this legislation highlights delays in the rollout of the curriculum and concerns associated with its development that have not been addressed. The fact that this parliament needs to consider this bill is evidence that the Labor government has not delivered on its commitment. In April 2008, the Labor Prime Minister promised 'A national curriculum publicly available and which can start to be delivered in all jurisdictions from January 2011'. One year ago during the election campaign the Labor Prime Minister said: 'This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' The documents are still far from ready and there continue to be significant concerns with the process.


The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority is continuing to develop the national curriculum. The initial consultation on the K to year 10 documents for English, maths, science and history occurred between March and May of last year. Comments were incorporated and further consultation with expert educators was undertaken. The Labor government is planning to present a final draft to education ministers in October of this year for approval at the ministerial council. A similar process is being followed for the senior curriculum and its development is continuing.


However, as mentioned, there have been a number of issues associated with the development of the national curriculum. The first of these is that there was inadequate representation of the non-government sector on the relevant subcommittee reporting to the ministerial council. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2010, 71 per cent of schools in Australia were public schools, with the remaining 29 per cent Catholic or independent schools. In the same year, the total number of students in Australian schools increased by 26,071 with 63 per cent of that figure comprising private school students. Since 2000, the number of students in private schools has increased by 21 per cent, whereas the number of students in public schools has increased only by one per cent. Given these figures, is it not unreasonable to expect that a sector that is currently servicing a third of our children and is growing should have a voice on the subcommittee?


Parents are voting with their feet and exercising their right to choose where and how their children are educated. In the coalition we support the right of parents to choose which school their children attend. We believe the independent sector should be maintained as a viable choice for as many parents as possible. We also recognise that every child that is in the private system is a child that is not placing a burden on taxpayer funded public education. Freedom of choice is a key Liberal value and is one that many members of my community have exercised when choosing schools for their children. In this context, we believe that the independent school sector should also have a strong voice on the subcommittee reporting to the ministerial council and the sector should also have a say in the decisions regarding implementation time frames.


The nature of the curriculum documents themselves has also been questioned. The Labor government's curriculum documents lack clarity of direction and an overarching framework. We are concerned that there is too much ideology driving the content of the curriculum. For example, there is a predominant focus in Indigenous and Asian culture without similar weight being given to British heritage or our Judeo-Christian traditions. This raises serious concerns about the balance and the content that is going to be taught in our schools.


In addition, there are concerns that the national curriculum is overcrowded, meaning that many schools will be left without the flexibility to deliver programs that correspond with their particular philosophy—for example, in the area of the arts. There is also an excessive focus on content rather than the development of essential critical and creative thinking skills in students. Furthermore, the documents appear not to have enough flexibility to cater for children who require additional support or those who are particularly talented. Issues have been raised regarding, for example, the science curriculum documents which are purported to be so difficult that students may actually be discouraged from studying the sciences. This would be a terrible outcome.


The other concern with the national curriculum, separate from the documents themselves, lies in how it is to be implemented. Teachers have expressed serious concerns with regard to the support they receive as the curriculum is rolled out. The Federal President of the Australian Education Union said recently 'We're seriously worried by the absence of any funding to support the implementation'. The unions should be concerned. This government's track record at delivering programs is absolutely abysmal—think pink batts, think school halls. The national curriculum is far too important to go the same way as these failed programs. A rollout without the necessary training and support for our teachers who will have to deliver the content is a recipe for the disasters that have become the hallmark of this Labor government.


In order to go some way towards dealing with a couple of these issues, we urge members opposite to support the amendments the coalition is moving. The first of these will underscore the importance of ensuring that schools and teachers receive the support and professional training they require in order to effectively implement the curriculum. The second amendment will ensure that the independent school sector receives representation and is consulted on the time lines associated with the implementation of the curriculum. The coalition supports the legislative amendment proposed by this bill in recognition that implementation of the national curriculum is going to take much longer than originally anticipated and is yet another failed Labor promise. A three-year implementation for phase 1 of the Australian curriculum commencing this year with implementation by 2013 is likely. However, a time frame for phase 1 of the senior secondary curriculum is yet to be agreed. Furthermore, updates to the curriculum will be required from time to time. The amendment is designed to provide a mechanism whereby the staged introduction and any amendments can be accommodated. However, there are worrying deficiencies in the process. There is no non-government sector representation on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee, which reports to the ministerial council, and there is no plan to support teachers and schools in the implementation of the curriculum. They are areas of significant concern. The coalition's amendments address these issues.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (16:06):  In December 2010, the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs endorsed the foundation to year 10 Australian curriculum in the initial four learning areas of English, mathematics, science and history. Ministers agreed that from 2011 states and territories will commence staged implementation of the agreed Australian curriculum, with substantial implementation to be completed by the end of 2013.


It is time for change and to re-evaluate how education is provided and how it can best be delivered. Over time the need for a national curriculum has become clear. In the past people did not move as much and often one completed one's education in the same town or region. Now people are much more footloose and have to move more from state to state to find work. Having a national curriculum allows children to be able to be assessed against their peers, because they will not have the disadvantage of trying to get used to different systems.


I would like to use this opportunity to talk about education generally and how we should look further at change. We need more flexibility in where one undertakes schooling. Recently we had a situation in Tasmania where many of our country schools had come under threat of closure because of budget cuts. Suddenly there was a list of 20 schools that were earmarked for closure without any consultation with their communities or their families. (Quorum formed) It may have passed without comment in the past, but the way it was thrust onto these communities had them up in arms. Twenty school communities went out and manned barricades. They used modern tools such as Facebook for communications, and they had families from the schools together raising funds and awareness. In 18 days they achieved a ministerial backdown. The decision makers were surprised and shocked at the reaction. But the state government, although chastened, put out a message that it was not over yet. A teacher friend of mine, Ivan Webb, offered this analysis of the situation:


… 20 Tasmanian school communities are already better prepared for what is to come. These communities still have Facebook and a whole new set of knowledge, skills, experiences, networks and relationships and a clearer sense of their own identities. They have transformed their initial sense of being at the edge of chaos into something that could be very useful to all concerned—


and which needs to be sustained and developed. He went on:


Managed well, there is a close potential link between innovation and being at the edge of chaos, but it does require a change of mindset.


I cannot think of anything that the policy decision makers—government and government departments—have to enable them to match what the school communities have done in 18 days.


Admittedly the nature of the schemes has changed, particularly since the arrival of the internet and systems that are now networks, often to larger anonymous agents. Systems, including school systems, can no longer be treated as production lines with an overlay of organisational trees that describe the relative status, power and authority of those involved. Closing a school is not something that can be done on the basis of numbers; it is a complex and uncertain task with broad ramifications. Parents and communities place a very high value on the current wellbeing and long-term success of their children. When it comes to success and wellbeing, parents and communities are confident about their local schools. Their confidence in the minister, government and the department has been severely undermined.


School closures failed this time for two reasons: they were based on a very narrow discourse and they were set up as win-lose and would have resulted in a net loss. The losses to the students, their families and community would have been far greater than the modest financial gains to the government. The next step is for the lessons to be learned. This means taking advantage of the current situation to learn as much as possible and develop a new sustainable dialogue around all schools—what they are for and how to manage their futures. The important conversation we need to have is not just between some schools and the government. The fundamental fight is about how we as a state understand, talk about, utilise and value our schools and their futures: what they are, what they do and how they make things possible. And this involves all schools, communities, governments and departments. The conversation really counts, and it needs to be ongoing, not just happening when there is an urgent need for the government to reduce spending. The conversation should include the full range of direct and indirect costs, benefits, values, relationships and possibilities associated with schools. These are best captured as stories of real people in real contexts, as schools have demonstrated. This is what schools have all been gathering to share in recent weeks, and it has worked well for them.


Schools should look after their stories well. There will come a time when they will be needed again—not only for the sake of the school but also to help the decision makers make better decisions next time. Hopefully the proposed reference group will be wise enough to tap into this goldmine before it dissipates. Governments worldwide are reducing spending, and this will continue.


To be successful, the conversation needs to be open, rich and interactive—not constrained by a narrow set of terms of reference with a particular outcome in mind. It needs to lead to innovation and overall win-win outcomes, which may or may not result in some actual closures. The schools have demonstrated that this can be done. Facebook has played a key role. There are tools for enabling even more focused and productive outcomes. It is now time for ministers, governments and departments to catch up. I think we should be aware of this in the federal sphere too. There was some criticism of this government providing funds under the Building the Education Revolution—yet schools in my electorate were able to renew their education spaces for the first time in some 50 or more years.


The renewals included new technology as well as buildings. This means students are able to use interactive whiteboards as a learning tool, which not only puts a bit of fun into their learning but also means they can be in touch with other children around the state, the country and even the world to undertake learning programs as well as maths games and games with numbers.


By unwittingly providing the tools to galvanise their communities against school closures, they have also prepared their schools to go out into the community and help be part of the local economy, the driving force behind future directions. Isn't that what education is all about—preparing our children to help Tasmania thrive and develop new jobs and new directions and to build a viable future for themselves?



With the latest in digital technology, computers, laptops and videophones, children can communicate with the rest of world very easily. They do not have to move further than their classroom to catch up with the latest trends at the next big school or an equivalent school in, say, Ireland or any other country in the world. It is all there at their fingertips. Smaller schools allow greater participation in this style of reality learning. And students do not have to miss out on sporting or other extracurricular activities either— (Time expired)

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011</title>,BILLS,25,1,speech
"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (16:22):  I rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. The bill will amend the act to repeal the current implementation date of 31 January 2012 and substitute a new provision enabling a standing regulation to prescribe a national curriculum and associated implementation time frames. This means that, subject to the passage of this bill, there will no longer be a deadline or due date in legislation from when the national curriculum is required to commence. Instead, to allow for future additions and revisions to the nation curriculum, the government is proposing that any version will need approval by the Council of Australian Governments' Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood, formerly known as the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs. The implementation time frames will be prescribed as those agreed by the standing council. 


This bill before us today is clear evidence that the Labor Party have failed to deliver on their commitment to a nation curriculum. If they had delivered on the national curriculum I would not need to stand here today before the parliament to talk to this bill. The explanatory memorandum of the bill states:


At the time of the Act's drafting in 2008, an implementation deadline of 31 January 2012 was anticipated for the development and rollout of the national curriculum across the school sector. Given the phased approach to developing the national curriculum, the extent of consultations undertaken in its development, and the need for flexibility in implementation, a legislative amendment is necessary to better accommodate this phased curriculum development and implementation process.


The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, originally said in 2008, when she was the Minister for Education, that the curriculum would take three years to develop and be ready to implement by January 2011. The Prime Minister also claimed, before the last federal election, that one of her biggest achievements was delivering a national curriculum. She made statements prior to the federal election such as: 'This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' The truth is that after nearly four years of Labor the curriculum documents for the first stage of a national curriculum, years K to 10, in the areas of English, maths, science and history still remain in draft and have not been given final approval by each of the states and territories.


Due to the well-documented bungling of a national curriculum the final version has not been approved by the ministerial council to date and most states will not even begin implementation until 2013 or 2014, so the original legislation needed changing. I also helpfully pointed out to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth earlier this year, when a one-year extension for the current funding arrangements for non-government schools was being considered by this parliament, that he would need to remove the requirement for non-government schools across Australia to implement the curriculum by January 2012. Much to my surprise he appeared to have missed that the 31 January deadline might have been a problem, or perhaps he was, as usual, asleep at the wheel. In an attempt to assist the minister for school education, the coalition sought to fix this for him and remove the 2012 start date, but he did not, inexplicably, support the coalition's amendment. 


Obviously the coalition recognises that this needs changing. Schools cannot implement a curriculum that is simply not ready or is still in draft. For this reason we will not oppose the bill. Instead, the government has had to introduce a entire new bill to fix the curriculum oversight rather than simply addressing it earlier in the year by eating humble pie and supporting the coalition's amendment. We find ourselves debating this bill because the Labor government, one of the worst in our nation's history, is incapable of delivering anything on time or on budget.


Schools need funding certainty, and for this reason we will not oppose the bill. Nevertheless, this bill has provided a further opportunity for considering how the government might be able to improve on existing arrangements related to the curriculum process.


The coalition supports a national curriculum in principle. Our concerns are not with the concept but, rather, the direction the curriculum is heading under Labor. I can assure you, Deputy Speaker Slipper, that these concerns are shared across the entire education sector. The Australian Curriculum Coalition recently wrote to me, the minister for school education and all state and territory education ministers outlining a number of concerns about the government's progress, or lack of progress. The government cannot possibly stand here today and suggest that the curriculum is going well. Please do not make us laugh with the claim that it is on schedule.


The Australian Curriculum Coalition comprises 10 peak bodies from both the government and non-government sectors. It includes the Australian Association for Research in Education, the Australian College of Educators, the Australian Council for Educational Leaders, the Australian Curriculum Studies Association, the Australian Education Union, Lutheran Education Australia, the Australian Special Education Principals Association, the Australian Professional Teachers Association, the Australian Secondary Principals Association and the Independent Education Union of Australia—not a group that you would normally see gathering together to oppose a government measure. The statement opened by saying:


The Australian Curriculum Coalition (ACC) believes that it is imperative at this midpoint in the development of the Australian Curriculum that thoughtful and considered deliberation be given to implementation of critical elements of the proposed curriculum.


It has become evident to members of the ACC that underpinning principles of the national curriculum have not been given adequate regard or sufficient resources committed to their development and that federal, state and territory governments are on the verge of endorsing a curriculum that does not meet the objective of the Australian government of: delivering a world class education system to ensure Australians are armed with the knowledge and skills to meet the demands of the 21st Century.


The letter then goes on in detail to describe each of the activities that the ministerial council promised to address last year, when the draft curriculum was being considered.


Final approval was not given to the national curriculum, as was originally planned by the government last year, due to a number of deficiencies with it. But do not just take my word for it. I will read an extract of the council's communique from December last year to make my point here, because I have noticed that the minister for school education in recent interviews on this subject has been very misleading. The council wrote:


Ministers agreed to a number of steps towards achieving the next stage of substantial implementation of the Australian curriculum by 2013. These will include:


establishing a national common approach to the achievement standards across all States and Territories, and trialling and validating that approach


states and territories developing additional material to support effective implementation of the curriculum to accommodate their different curriculum development, approval and implementation requirements


further refining and adjusting the curriculum content as a result of validating achievement standards and structured feedback from teachers


finalising a clear overarching framework that assures the place and integrity of all learning areas within the context of the overall school curriculum and different State and Territory structures


developing the curriculum content and achievement standards as required to meet the needs of special needs students


engaging with the teaching profession in the implementation of these processes to ensure comprehensive preparation for substantial implementation by 2013.


So far from the curriculum being historically endorsed, as the minister for education would try to lead you to believe, what actually happened last year was that all ministers agreed that a whole lot more work needs to be done before the curriculum can even think of being approved.


Have any of these issues been addressed nearly nine months later? Apparently not, according to the Australian Curriculum Coalition, and it will come as a shock to members of the House to discover that nine months later virtually nothing has been achieved. The Australian Curriculum Coalition made the observation:


Disappointingly neither time, resources nor political will has seen these matters seriously addressed.


They called on the federal, state and territory education ministers to immediately commit to the priority work needed to develop a genuinely 21st century curriculum by addressing the matters of concern raised by the sector and fulfil the intent on the resolution of that important MCEECDYA meeting last year. They noted:




Without this resolve, Australia is in danger of producing and adopting a national curriculum that is little more than a 
'
content revamp
'
 of mid-twentieth century curricula.



There is, however, an example of at least one minister who has acted since the Australian Curriculum Coalition's scathing letter and does have the resolve to see these issues addressed. Just last week the Hon. Adrian Piccoli, the Minister for Education in New South Wales, announced the New South Wales state government's decision to delay the introduction of the new Australian curriculum by at least a year until 2014. He acted upon the expert advice provided by the New South Wales Board of Studies that the curriculum is not yet of a high enough standard to be introduced into New South Wales. He has also suggested that federal resources for teacher professional development are needed before the curriculum can be adequately rolled out in New South Wales.


His decision has been met with widespread support from education stakeholders in New South Wales, including the NSW Teachers Federation—not know to be a friend of the coalition—and non-government school sector bodies in that state. Even the NSW Teachers Federation President, Bob Lipscombe, who has had much to say about the perceived inadequacies of the coalition over the years, has said:


The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented in NSW. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state. There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation. Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.


The Federal President of the Australian Education Union, Angelo Gavrielatos, while charming, is not known to be a supporter of the coalition's policies in education. Even he said:


We still have a series of concerns with respect to the development of the national curriculum … we're also seriously worried by the absence of any funding to support the implementation.


So the coalition and the Australian Education Union are on a unity ticket opposing the implementation of a national curriculum that is neither ready for nor married with the required resources to ensure that it can be introduced successfully. The Independent Education Union President, Chris Watt, said:


We've been saying for a long time that getting the content right is important and it looks like we might be getting towards an end point, although teachers still have not seen the final documents …


It appears the only person who does not have any concern about the national curriculum process is the hapless Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth.


If a national curriculum is to serve the learning needs of our children, the implementation process must not be hurried in the manner of the minister for school education's Home Insulation Program, or the Prime Minister's bungled schools hall program. This is just too important to get wrong. I would have thought the member for Kingston would have thought that it was time for the minister for school education to get a policy right rather than to get it in. The minister for school education was so determined to implement his pink batts program that he was prepared to do so without the necessary protections being in place for householders to ensure that they did not face burning ceilings or even the tragic deaths that eventuated out of the implementation of the minister for school's disastrous pink batts program. That program will live in infamy as one of the most unsuccessful programs in the history of this place since Federation, and yet again the minister for school education is doing the same thing with the national curriculum.


Experts agree that the content will overwhelm teachers with no funding or support for the necessary training for the rollout to succeed. And doesn't that sound familiar? They are the criticisms that the national electrical organisations made back when the minister for school education was the minister responsible for the pink batts program. They warned the minister that there was not sufficient implementation funding and that there was not sufficient training and of course we saw the tragic results that the minister for schools presided over. While he did not lose his scalp over his disastrous performance as a minister, it certainly contributed to the axing of the former Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, on that infamous day last year.


For these reasons, and because we want to try to help the government in spite of its hopeless approach, the coalition will move two amendments. The first relates to the importance of ensuring that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the Australian curriculum. That amendment states:


(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 8 to 11), omit all the words from and including ""require"" to the end of subsection 22(1), substitute:


(a) require the relevant authority for the school or system to ensure that the school, or each school in the system, implements the national curriculum prescribed by the regulations in accordance with the regulations; and


 (b) provide such funding as is necessary to ensure that each teacher in the school or system has received professional development in the implementation of the national curriculum in accordance with a nationally consistent professional development program.


Currently there is no nationally agreed or consistent approach across jurisdictions to ensure that all schools are receiving the support in the area of teacher professional learning to be able to implement the Australian Curriculum. This point was made by the Independent Schools Council of Australia's submission to the inquiry into this bill. They said:


ISCA would like to highlight the importance of ensuring that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the Australian Curriculum. Currently there is no agreed or consistent approach across or within jurisdictions to ensure that all schools are receiving the support required to implement the Australian Curriculum, particularly in the area of teacher professional learning.


Again, Deputy Speaker D'Ath, you do not need to take my word for it that this issue is only relevant to non-government schools. Unions representing teachers in government schools in Queensland and South Australia, from where the member for Kingston comes—and, in fact, from where the member for Brisbane comes—have now added their voices to the concerns of New South Wales that the necessary training and support required to implement the curriculum are not in place. Perhaps the member for Kingston, having observed the redistributed boundaries for South Australia, now believes that she is so untouchable in her seat of Kingston that she no longer has to listen to government school teachers or government school principals or the parents of children in government schools.



Ms Rishworth interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  Maybe she, like the Prime Minister, has adopted the Marie Antoinette approach to politics—which is to say, 'Let them eat cake!'—when they cannot ensure that their teachers have the adequate training and professional development. Perhaps she has adopted the approach of wondering why these people are unable to—




Ms Gambaro:
  I rise on a point of order. Madam Acting Deputy Speaker D'Ath, I draw your attention to the noise across the chamber and I ask that you bring the member for Kingston to order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Thank you, Member for Brisbane. There has been some interjection from both sides. I ask that both sides of the chamber remind themselves that the member for Sturt has the right to be heard in silence.




Mr PYNE:
  I very much appreciate the support and protection of the member for Brisbane. The member for Kingston is becoming ever more brutish as her margin increases and she believes that she does not need to pay any attention to the voters in her electorate of Kingston.


Last week it was reported that Education Union members in South Australia have asked the state government for a 12-month delay until 2014. I have been advocating for a long time that there needs to be a clear national plan for teacher professional development and specific resources allocated by the government for this. The government's National Partnership for Teacher Quality, which provides funding for teacher support, is not explicit that funding is set aside for the purpose of supporting teachers with respect to the national curriculum.


The coalition's second amendment seeks to include clear representation of the non-government school sector with respect to decision-making processes for future time lines for the national curriculum. That would read:


(2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 11), after subsection 22(1), insert:


(1A) The national curriculum must not be prescribed unless the non-government school sector has had input into its development through membership and/or observer status on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee.


[national curriculum—non-government school sector Input]


I have written to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth previously asking that he give consideration to representation on the standing council or on its advisory officials committee, the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee. I believe that having representation at this level would be beneficial to add an extra layer of consultation on a range of issues affecting the sector and this representation would be a valuable source of strategic advice for any government in the future. This would provide a formal mechanism by which the non-government schools sector could be adequately and appropriately consulted in the lead-up to decisions regarding implementation time frames for the national curriculum.


You will note that in its submission to the House standing committee inquiry into this bill, the National Catholic Education Commission's submission notes:


…that a significant number—one in three—students in Australia attend non-government schools, and that neither national non-government school peak body has any representation on the Ministerial Council of Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs, the body that governs the work of ACARA and thus the work on the Australian Curriculum.


Having improved representation on the standing council's senior officials committee would add a safeguard that non-government schools would be adequately and appropriately consulted in the lead-up to decisions regarding implementation time frames.


It seems unthinkable to me that with the number of parents who have chosen to send their children to non-government schools—namely, one in three—they are not represented on the appropriate bodies that make the decisions in relation to education in Australia. The member for Bass comes from the state where there has recently been a crisis of confidence in the education minister. The Greens leader tried to close dozens of schools until I made a trip through Tasmania highlighting the issue and drawing attention to the failures of the state education minister. He then, within days of my leaving Tasmania, reversed his position. I am glad to see that it is still possible to put political pressure on any kind of government to ensure that they reverse a bad decision. I am glad that the minister there, Nick McKim, listened to the concerns I highlighted during my trip through Tasmania by holding public rallies and backed down from a very bad decision. I went to the member for Bass's electorate in Launceston and spoke to non-government schools there. You would think it was an important enough issue for him to lobby the minister for school education in relation to the representation of non-government schools on a national body such as this.


I do realise that 'improved representation' could also mean something as straightforward as receiving agenda papers and draft minutes from either the standing council or the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee. Nevertheless, my amendment, if adopted, would enable improved representation of non-government sector authorities on this body. If I were minister for school education, I would certainly take up the opportunity and be grateful to have representation by the non-government sector at this level. These two modest amendments would go a long way in alleviating some of the reoccurring concerns about the curriculum process and have been endorsed by non-government sector authorities, both the NCEC and the ISCA. The government need to act to address the concerns being raised over the curriculum processes. They need to act now and take action to prevent further delays to the curriculum.


Defence families across Australia are frustrated that there is still no national consistency of curriculum between the states after four years of Labor. And I know the member for Fadden has a particular interest in the defence families in his electorate and, as a former of the defence services, he knows full well the pressures that defence families are already under because of the strenuous lifestyle that they lead and the pressures and stresses under which they are placed. As the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth has pointed out there are 80,000 students that cross state borders through the period of a year. These students are depending on the minister for schools to start addressing some of the practical issues that are leading to the delay of a national curriculum in schools.


I also read the House standing committee's report on the inquiry into this bill. I noted the committee's comment that this bill is uncontroversial. While I agree with this statement in part, in that non-government schools cannot possibly be expected to implement a curriculum in a mere six months time, the events that have led to this are most certainly not uncontroversial. Unless the minister for school education starts taking some serious remedial action to save the national curriculum, many people in the sector are beginning to doubt whether it is ever going to eventuate.


I hope the crossbenchers take some time to deliberate on the coalition's suggestions for improvement and consult with the non-government sectors, who have indicated to me that they support these simple and modest improvements. I have written to the crossbenchers on two occasions outlining my amendments and seeking their support. I would remind the crossbenchers that my previous amendment on the earlier bill, which did not receive majority support, would have removed the deadline from the legislation, alleviating the need for this new change.


My amendments today are necessary as well and I hope they will receive support. I would remind the crossbenchers that, if I had been listened to previously by the government and by the crossbenchers, we would not be here listening to my speech today. Some members of the chamber might regard that as a silver lining. However, unfortunately, because of the ineptness of the minister for school education, we are here and I am needing to once again point out the inadequacies of a very weak minister, a minister who is like a pane of glass at cabinet meetings—you could look straight through him and nobody would even know he was there. Education is far too important to be in the hands of a minister who is a pane of glass and who has no influence at all on the decision-making process.


I would also point out that even though in July he was putting out press releases attacking me as the shadow minister and claiming that the Computers in Schools program was on track for delivery this year—even though we had pointed out that the government would deliver 45 per cent of the program in six months, having delivered 55 per cent in three years—the decision had already been made by the government in June that they would not be able to meet the deadline. But nobody told the minister for school education. In June the government had already decided—as shown in leaked documents that were in the Australian Financial Review last Thursday—that they would not meet the deadline for Computers in Schools this year and yet a month later the poor, old minister for school education was putting out a press release saying that it was on track and on schedule.


The problem is that nobody tells him what is going on. That was his defence when he was the minister for pink batts program. He always used to have excuses—the tram got a flat tyre or 'The dog ate my homework'. The reality is that he is not up to being the minister for school education, and it is far too important. There are 3.6 million students in schools across Australia. They are relying on the minister for school education to get it right. God help them!

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:49):  I am very pleased to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 and to associate myself with the comments made by the member for Sturt. I am pleased to support the amendments to the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill. They are a very important step in rectifying the failings that we have seen in the proposed implementation time line of the national curriculum over the last three years, and I wholeheartedly support these amendments.


I believe in a system of education that is outcomes focused and a system that enables students to achieve their full potential as functioning members of our society. In the electorate of Brisbane we have over 40 schools and we are fortunate to have a plethora of choice in government, Catholic and independent education options for our children. For many years the non-government education providers, from All Hallows—my old school—to Gregory Terrace, St Margaret's, St James, St Rita's, Clayfield College and Brisbane boys and girls grammar schools, have provided a quality education and quality service to the children of the Brisbane electorate. I am very grateful for their contribution to this great state of Queensland through their combined years of dedicated service to the community. It was good to spend some time with the school community at St Finbarrs at the Marist hall yesterday for their annual fundraiser, which saw some 500 parents, supporters and sponsors attend. It was a great event.


I have been watching the national curriculum with great interest, because every time I visit a school usually a teacher will pull me aside and wring their hands with horror and ask me what is going on. It can be as simple a question as to what is happening with the citizenship program that a number of schools participate in—and many of us see schools come to Canberra to visit us. They are quite horrified by what they are seeing in the curriculum. They ask me if the citizenship program will stay in the primary school sector, as they hear rumours going around that it will be moved to the high school level. They really do not know what is going on and they are very confused and frustrated. They have been watching this process with great frustration. That is why we are all looking with very keen interest at the national curriculum debate and why these particular amendments are very, very important, particularly for non-government schools in the Brisbane electorate and other parts of Australia. These non-government schools serve as an important avenue to provide choice and flexibility for parents on how their children are educated. If we are to accept a nationally prescribed curriculum, it is centrally important that the sector is allowed clear representation, particularly in decision-making processes for the future of the national curriculum. The curriculum is for everyone; the curriculum is for government and non-government schools. In the seat of Brisbane alone, the non-government sector and the other sectors have many hundreds of years of combined experience in teaching, learning and adjusting the way in which they instruct Australian children.


It is wrong of the government to think that they can design a national curriculum for the millions of Australian schoolchildren in a mere three years without the representation of non-government schools. This sector really deserves an opportunity to make a direct contribution to the national debate. I was a member of the previous Howard government, which had many proud educational reforms which led to the development of the national curriculum. It has been clear, however, that since 2007 the Rudd and Gillard governments have failed to listen to the key stakeholders, the stakeholders who are involved every single day in the important education of our children. A Labor government would happily take any opportunity to undermine the viability of non-government and independent school sectors in Australia, and it is just not acceptable.


However, with regard to the national curriculum, they must not ignore this important voice in the sector. The current curriculum itself stands as an ideologically-driven document that ignores the inescapable contribution of Australia's British heritage and Judeo-Christian traditions. It is important to recognise the contribution of Aboriginal history and our engagement with Asia as integral to the multicultural success of Australia's development. However, with reference to the religious institutions that I have mentioned today and their important history in religious instruction, we must also place a greater importance than we currently see regarding the influence of Judeo-Christian values in Australia, both directly and indirectly. As I mentioned earlier, choice and flexibility is absolutely important; however, they are lacking in the current curriculum.


During my time as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence—and I notice we have the shadow minister sitting at the table today—a number of defence families, particularly of the Defence Families Association, constantly highlighted to me the inadequacy of the system that saw schoolchildren unable to continue a uniform education across state boundaries and, as the member for Sturt mentioned earlier, there are some 80,000 students that cross state boundaries every year, whether they are children of defence families or doing so through interstate relocations of their families. Labor has managed to create an overly prescriptive and overloaded mess, rather than providing a clear national program that serves as a framework for the success of Australia's next generations. It burdens our schools with mandatory hours in the areas of English, mathematics, science and history. I understand the importance of these four areas, as they are absolutely fundamental in life, but the curriculum does not strike a proper balance and does not recognise the diversity of students or the diversity of interest. This lack of balance reduces the amount of time allowed to teach other areas of interest, thereby reducing the ability of schools to differentiate themselves and to provide that really important choice and flexibility in the eyes of the parents.


The current government has failed to listen to key stakeholders, including the NSW Teachers Federation President, Bob Lipscombe, who has made it quite clear that there are significant concerns in the community with regard to support that will be provided to teachers when the curriculum is finally implemented. The coalition has been listening and has listened to three stakeholders, the Independent Schools Council of Australia, the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Education Union, which have endorsed the coalition's amendments. Schools across different state jurisdictions will not be able to adapt to the new curriculum overnight, and while I understand members on the opposite side of the House have had difficulty in recent years—particularly in rolling out any programs, including national programs—it is nevertheless difficult to understand how the government has not been able to recognise the support required to implement the national curriculum in our schools.


In order to have an efficient but timely implementation that is of benefit to all students in Australia, the government must dedicate resources to provide professional development for teachers in both government and non-government schools. We need a high-quality core curriculum for all schools which is relevant, realistic, achievable and measurable, and where competency in numeracy and literacy are basic requirements. That is why I support the amendments proposed by the member for Sturt.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (16:58):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. As we know, education is the greatest opportunity for people of all ages. However, fundamentally, it provides the basic groundwork for a productive, challenging but happy future for our young people. One of the major changes to school education is the move towards a national curriculum. We on our side reflect the concerns of stakeholders at the direction that the curriculum is heading in under the Labor government, a government that is noted for its serial incompetence in delivering policies and projects in a well managed, cost-effective and efficient process.


In education alone, we have seen repeated mismanagement, be it Computers in Schools or the wasted millions of taxpayers' funds in the BER program. Then there was the discrimination we saw with youth allowance and the uncertainty around school chaplaincy. This legislation gives us even more reason to be concerned. For instance, the Prime Minister originally said back in 2008 that the curriculum would take three years to develop and would therefore be ready to implement by January 2011. Well, that has come and gone. In 2010, the Prime Minister claimed:




… the nation has been talking about having a National Curriculum for … 30 years …



and claimed she had delivered it. But the national curriculum has not been delivered. For example, the bill before the House states that non-government schools are required to implement the national curriculum by 31 January 2012—certainly a long way from the Prime Minister's claim that she delivered a national curriculum in 2010. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister has made an art form of saying one thing and doing another.


One of the most serious issues with this legislation is the failure of the government to consult and respond to key stakeholders, though you would have thought that would have been integral to managing a national curriculum—for example, the Australian Curriculum Coalition, an organisation that represents teachers, principals, school leaders, academics and education researchers. This group believes that Australian schools, their teachers and their students deserve the highest quality national curriculum, and that is what they are asking for from this government. That is a very noble and worthy intent, and I support them in that. Matters raised by the ACC mostly remain unresolved, and the ACC believes there is a lot of work that still needs to be done in relation to a national, common approach to achievement standards. There is the additional material that is needed by states and territories to support effective implementation of the curriculum to accommodate different curriculum development approval and implementation requirements; the need for a clear overarching framework; the development of curriculum content and achievement standards as required to meet the needs of special-needs students; and engagement with teachers in the implementation process.


These are basic, core requirements that the ACC has asked of the government in rolling out a national curriculum. It is this group that knows how it needs to work on the ground—how it has to work with administrators, teachers and students in the actual schools. This is just another demonstration of how the Labor government is bungling yet another program. This final version of the national curriculum has not engaged key stakeholders—and, according to its current form, most states are not estimated to begin implementation until 2013-14.


The coalition are moving two further sensible amendments, noting that Labor ignored our amendments to the previous bill back in March. I should also highlight the endorsement of these amendments by the Independent Schools Council of Australia, the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Education Union—important bodies in any discussion about education in this nation. The first amendment moved by the coalition will ensure that schools are equipped with the support and assistance they required to implement the national curriculum. This is a sensible amendment and something that is badly needed by the schools. This amendment arose from the coalition's concerns about the current lack of a nationally agreed or consistent approach across jurisdictions to ensure that all schools are receiving support in the area of teacher professional learning to enable them to implement the Australian curriculum. The second amendment we will be moving seeks to include a clear representation of the non-government school sector with regard to the decision-making process for future time lines of the national curriculum.


The coalition have a number of specific concerns with this legislation, including the insufficient representation of the non-government school sector on the relevant subcommittee reporting to the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs. We also have concerns that the curriculum is overcrowded and does not provide enough scope to recognise the diversity of students, including gifted and talented students. There are a wide range of students out there, with varying levels of need, and we need a curriculum that encompasses those needs. Our concerns extend to the manner in which the national curriculum documents are being produced and the content of these documents, not to mention the lack of stakeholder consultation and the lack of clarity around whether the material is meant to be mandatory or is designed to be a code around which jurisdictions and schools may add a local flavour. I would question whether those who will be producing this material, those in the printing and content sector, have even been consulted.


The coalition support a national curriculum in principle, but we do have major concerns about the direction in which the current curriculum is heading under the Labor government. The bill is evidence of the Labor government's routine of rushing policy through before thinking about the details and the practicalities—how it will be delivered, how it will work on the ground. None of those issues have been addressed in this legislation. As I said, there is a pattern of not being able to deliver these policies on the ground, where they matter.


As I said earlier, I believe that school education is of the utmost importance as it provides the grounds for a great future for our young people, but it does not appear that the Labor government is focused on delivering that through this legislation. I have previously raised in this House a number of the inequities the government created with youth allowance. We have seen a whole raft of different proposals by this government in relation to a range of education legislation, and it certainly has not delivered. I am hoping the inquiry by Professor Kwong Lee Dow will deliver some equity for students who were defined as living in inner regional areas. There are 10 sitting days left in which to table the report in each house of parliament. Given that sittings have resumed, I urge the minister to table the report immediately, to give students in inner regional areas who have been left in limbo some indication of what their future may hold.


This is all part of the education package that this government is failing to deliver in a way that is practical and sensible and that delivers on the ground, where it needs to, particularly in rural and regional Australia. We are determined to ensure that students in these areas are given the financial support they need and deserve, in the same way that we are determined to ensure that, through a national curriculum, students, teachers and all those who are engaged in the delivery of the curriculum have the resources they need. That is why we are making these particular amendments to this bill. They need and deserve the level of support that we are recommending through our amendments. In conclusion, I believe that people in Australia should have access to lifetime learning regardless of where they live. I support the amendments by the member for Sturt, but there are a number of concerns. I look around my electorate and see that any number of schools are affected by the national curriculum. Every school will be affected by it. I walk into their classrooms, I walk into their environments and each one of them has special needs in a different sense because they cater for a different cross-section of students. Some of them might have anything from 10 to 15 different languages spoken in their school and they have particular needs to deliver a national curriculum for students in that environment. But the teachers also have needs, and there is the need for resources. That is the basis for the amendments that we are proposing for this bill. I support the amendments by the member for Sturt and the coalition as very sensible. I encourage the government to take up these amendments. It is important that, in rolling out a national curriculum, all of the supports that are necessary to enable this to work in the schools where it is intended actually have the effect that is intended.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (17:09):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011, a bill which amends the Schools Assistance Act. The substance of this bill is quite straightforward: it amends the requirement, which presently exists under law, that non-government schools must implement the national curriculum by 2012.


Why is such an amendment necessary? Sadly, it is because we have once again seen from this government a demonstration that there is a vast gulf between its lofty ideals and frequently stated ambitions and what it actually manages to implement by stated deadlines. Let's be clear: this bill is not about whether the national curriculum is a good idea in principle. The coalition supports a national curriculum in principle. We do not have concerns with the broad concept but we have significant concerns with the direction in which the national curriculum is heading under the Gillard Labor government, and amongst our concerns are the consequences of the national curriculum—and the way it is being amended—for the independent schools sector.


In the brief time available to me, I want to make three key points. Firstly, the national curriculum process is a mess. The date, which is supposed to be met, keeps failing to be met, and overall the government is having great difficulty in achieving its targets. The second point I want to make is that the process which is being carried on and, indeed, the legislative framework are incidentally quite revealing of the underlying hostility of the Labor Party to the independent school sector. The third point is that the amendments which we have proposed seek to redress the balance and give independent schools a fair go and fair representation in the national curriculum process.


Let me turn to the first proposition which I wish to advance, which is that the national curriculum process is in a mess. It is, you may think, a surprising proposition that a process being managed by a national government should be disorganised and failing to meet the stated time lines. Sadly, as with so many other aspects of the Rudd-Gillard government's poor track record of administration and implementation, when it comes to the national curriculum, we are seeing the very same level of poor performance, poor implementation and a yawning gulf between what is promised, what is claimed and what is actually delivered.


Let me join my coalition colleagues in once again reminding the chamber of the commitment of the claim made on 15 April 2008 by the then minister for education—before she achieved her glittering and sudden ascent—when she said:




A national curriculum publicly available and which can start to be delivered in all jurisdictions from January 2011—



which, if you are following the calendar closely, you would note is in fact some seven months in the past as we speak.


As Prime Minister, the member for Lalor had this to say:




This nation
'
s talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.



Let me again join with my coalition colleagues in making the point: it has not yet been delivered. It is a statement of aspiration. The performance does not match the rhetoric, and we see this so often from this government. Who could forget the tearful farewell from the former Prime Minister listing a series of accomplishments, which so many times fell short of the claims that he made? Or I could note the recent claim by the Prime Minister in another field, telecommunications, where she is now claiming to have delivered the structural separation of Telstra. Let me assure the Prime Minister: Telstra is not structurally separated; it remains a dominant and vertically integrated company. In field after field of which, tragically, the national curriculum is one, we see this yawning gulf between the stated aspirations of this government and the sad track record of underachievement.


The current legislation, the act as it presently stands, the Schools Assistance Act, provides that non-government schools were to implement the national curriculum by January 31 2012. Against this target, it is timely to ask: what progress has been achieved to date? Phase 1, the draft kindergarten to year 10 curriculum for English, maths, science and history has been drafted by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority and a final draft will be presented to education ministers in October this year. Phase 2, covering the learning areas of languages, geography and the arts, is still under development; and a phase 3 will be required to cover the remaining learning areas identified in the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians. The curriculum for senior secondary years is one where work is only just beginning. It is quite likely that the development of a national curriculum for these years will require a very significant period.


The clear reality is that the national curriculum is nowhere near ready for implementation by 31 January 2012. What did the New South Wales Teachers Federation President, Bob Lipscombe, have to say about this? He said:




The Australian curriculum
'
s not ready to be implemented in New South Wales. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don
'
t do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state.



I might add that that is a sentiment which I have had put to me by teachers in both non-government and government schools in my electorate of Bradfield, including, for example, senior maths teachers at Normanhurst Boys High School, amongst many others.


As the House was advised earlier today, in an attempt to assist the government in dealing with this looming administrative problem, the shadow minister for education, apprenticeships and training proposed an amendment in March this year, but at that time the government minister seemed unaware of the problem and failed to support the coalition's amendment.



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr FLETCHER:
  It has been put to me that this is a minister who does not have a tremendous track record of implementation himself, as the owners of a number of houses which now lie in smouldering ruins could ruefully testify. So it is perhaps no great surprise that the notion of preparing and being ready to implement a program by the stated date of 31 January 2012 was not something that the minister and member for Kingsford Smith, for the moment, was able to do. I am shocked at the implication that a familiarity with project management and even Gantt charts were possibly not within his previous experience as a leading Australian pop music star, but that is another matter.


Let me turn to the next proposition I want to put to the House, which is that this process and this legislation reveal the underlying hostility of the Labor Party to the independent school sector. The financial impact of this bill, stated in the explanatory memorandum, makes this point very clear. It highlights that the amount of funding provided to non-government schools under the Schools Assistance Act is $8.1 billion for 2012-13, $8.8 billion for the next year and $9.5 billion for the third year. These are substantial figures and the Labor government is clearly proposing to apply a very blunt instrument whereby, if non-government schools are not able to meet the prescribed time frames, their funding is at risk.


Let me be absolutely clear: the coalition are very strong supporters of both independent schools and government schools. In my own electorate of Bradfield, we are privileged to have an outstanding group of independent schools, an outstanding group of Catholic schools and an outstanding group of government schools. I am enormously and repeatedly impressed by the work and commitment of the teachers, parents and other stakeholders in these fine institutions. I make this point: on this side of the House we recognise the synergy in education policy between having a strong independent school sector and having a strong government school sector, because we recognise, as some seem not to, that independent schools take pressure off the government school system.


We also, therefore, are very concerned that the Labor government has not made adequate provision for non-government schools to have their say regarding the national curriculum on matters such as implementation and timing, because non-government schools have not been provided with any representation on the appropriate government bodies. There is no specific non-government school representation on the standing council, nor is there any such representation on the committee of its advisory officials, the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee.


As the National Catholic Education Committee noted in its submission to the House Standing Committee on Education and Employment:




NCEC notes that a significant number—one in three—students in Australia attend nongovernment schools, and that neither national nongovernment school peak body has any representation on MCEECDYA—



the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs—




the body that governs the work of ACARA—



the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority—




and thus the work on the Australian Curriculum.



The Independent Schools Council of Australia represents a sector with 1,090 schools and around 550,000 students, accounting for almost 16 per cent of Australian school enrolments. Its executive director, Mr Bill Daniels, said in that body's submission to the House standing committee:




The non-government school sector, including at the state and territory level, should be extensively consulted on all aspects of the implementation of the Australian Curriculum including implementation timeframes.



The third point I want to make is that the amendments which the coalition have put before the House seek to give independent schools a fair voice in the national curriculum process. That is why we have moved our amendments. We note that the claims which have been made by the Labor government concerning the breadth and depth of the consultation process to date in fact tend to use that as an excuse for the fact that the national curriculum process is running late. The explanatory memorandum to the bill has this to say:




At the time of the Act
'
s drafting in 2008, an implementation deadline of 31 January 2012 was anticipated for the development and rollout of the national curriculum across the school sector. Given the phased approach to developing the national curriculum, the extent of consultations undertaken in its development …



Et cetera, et cetera—you can see the excuses forming here. But we make the point that a consultation process must adequately take account of the views of all stakeholders, and the governance processes must adequately make representation for all stakeholders. We also note that non-government school sector representatives told the House Standing Committee on Education and Employment's inquiry into the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 that they believe that the issue of appropriate representation on the Senior Officials Committee is becoming ever more significant given the expanding and developing role of the committee. Therefore, if adopted, the coalition's amendment would provide the government with an option to provide non-government school sector authorities with observer status on the Senior Officials Committee, either instead of or in addition to membership, and this could in practical terms allow non-government school sector authorities to receive agenda and briefing papers for both the ministerial standing council and the Senior Officials Committee in advance as well as draft minutes in retrospect.


Some may say that this is a modest amendment; we do not agree. We think it is an important improvement to the process which would give adequate representation to the interests of the independent school sector in what is a very important reform process which applies to every school across Australia—government schools, Catholic schools and independent schools. I have argued today that the process has not achieved administrative excellence; instead it would undoubtedly be said of the government, if it were being given a report card by one of the many excellent teachers in any one of the many excellent schools around Australia, 'must try harder—has good intentions but does not always finish his or her work', because that is the position that the government is in at the moment with the national curriculum.


It is a matter for regret that the poor administration of the national curriculum by this government makes the bill necessary. On this side of the House we have made it clear that we support the substance of the bill, but we certainly do not support not giving independent schools an appropriate voice in the curriculum process.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (17:24):  I rise to support the amendments moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, the Shadow Minister for Education, Apprenticeships and Training, the member for Sturt. In doing so I follow a very high-quality contribution from the member for Bradfield, who is keeping up the usual standard of his contributions in this place. He spoke thoughtfully about some very important concerns—the standard of education in our country and the direction that it is taking and the way the government is plans to implement the national curriculum through the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011—that are close to the hearts of many of us in this place. The member for Bradfield summed up our concerns very well in his contribution, so I do not intend to go through them in the same detail as he did. They were also placed on the record very well by the shadow minister earlier today. But I do want to touch on a couple of the issues raised and how they relate to my electorate of Mayo.


Many of us in this place understand the importance of a high-quality education. The Liberal Party has pursued policies which are about achieving standards in education for some time now. We take the view that government should try to encourage the education sector, whether it be the government sector, the Catholic sector or the independent sector, to produce students with the highest possible education standards so that they can meet the demands of industry for jobs and go off to university, if it suits them, and get a higher level of education so that they have an opportunity to create their own prosperity and improve their standard of living and the national well-being at the same time.


Obviously, standards in schools are very important in what a national curriculum sets out, and I am supporter of a standardised approach across the country so that there is some consistency. I think, though, that we have to be very careful that we do not take away from a competitive approach across the different streams and get to the point where people are being dictated to about what they can and cannot teach in their schools—there needs to be some flexibility in government's approach to the matter. The argument that the voices of non-government schools in this debate need to be heard more loudly is a very important part of the second amendment that the member for Sturt is pursuing, because there is a concern amongst parents' groups at non-government schools in my electorate that there is a pursuit by some of a political agenda through education.




Mr Lyons:
  There is.




Mr BRIGGS:
  The member for Bass over there seems to be having some entertainment at his own expense. There is a concern that, during the early stages of its drafting, the standard national curriculum has been turned into a way to indoctrinate kids in certain philosophies rather than used to give them an opportunity to get the broader education that we on this side of the House believe will ensure that they are best prepared for future opportunities within our society.


The amendment that the member for Sturt proposes will be an important step in ensuring not only that the process is kept on track—because, as the member for Bradfield observed, the minister in charge of this process has not been labelled particularly confident in his career thus far as a minister, and keeping him under watch in the implementation of the curriculum is quite an important thing to do—but also that what comes out of the drafting of the curriculum is of good quality. That is very important to those of us in this room who are going through the education journey with our own children. Parents take a great deal of interest in how their children are being taught and what they are being taught, so parents are actively engaged in and raise issues about the quality of education and the restrictions that some would like to place on it.


We know that there are members of the Labor-Green coalition government who are against the independent sector. They do not believe that the independent sector should be funded to the extent that it is, and by stealth they would like to have both the Catholic independent sectors defunded to a significant degree. There are also concerns about where the national curriculum is going, and we should be very conscious of that, because independent schools and Catholic schools provide choice for parents who want to have a values based education as well as an educational standard for their children. I know there are some in this chamber who have benefited greatly from that independent stream in their upbringing. They might have been misguided in some of the ways they went about their education and future careers from that opportunity, but they still benefited enormously from the opportunities the independent stream gave. In that respect I think people will recognise that the independent and Catholic sectors do provide those choices for parents that they should be able to provide. There are some concerns about using this national curriculum to constrain the direction that some schools would like to take in their teaching.


The amendments that the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education, has proposed are good amendments, and I am sure they are amendments that the government will support because they bring a couple of issues to bear which have not been thought out by the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. I know there will be some concern on the government side that the minister in charge has probably missed a couple of these points on the way through.


The first amendment as drafted gives additional support to the rollout of the national curriculum. It is an issue which has been raised extensively by members of the opposition, and the shadow minister has articulated a need for that change quite well. I think this is an amendment that makes much sense. We have had all sorts of claim of credit for the national curriculum being rolled out successfully: so far we have had the Prime Minister say during the election campaign:


This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.


Of course, so far we have not seen it delivered. As the member for Bradfield outlined it will not meet the 31 January 2012 deadline, so there need to be some changes made to the time lines that the government has set for itself. It is another failed delivery of a promise that it has built up. Ultimately, more than anything else, the detail of this national curriculum needs to be right; it needs to ensure it has heard all the voices and that it is not written in a prescriptive manner that is about pursuing a politically ideological agenda. It needs to be about ensuring that children come out with the best standard of education that they possibly can.


As I said earlier, the Liberal Party has for some time had a strong commitment to standards in education. Back in the 2004 election campaign we famously had the simple, plain English report card that Brendan Nelson, who was the minister for education at that point, pursued quite heavily. It was good policy and it was good politics because parents wanted information about how their children were performing and they wanted it in a simple fashion. They wanted to be told how their children were achieving and how their children were going at school in a way the parents understood so that they were part of the education journey with their children. It is ultimately a very important aspect of education that the parents are engaged and are part of the education journey along with the school.


Again, this gets back to a concern that some have that the curriculum being pursued is to be very specific and focused on a political perspective rather than on a broader education. In that respect, I note that the IPA, the Institute of Public Affairs, has raised some concerns about the direction of some of the early drafting of the curriculum regarding a very heavy focus on Indigenous and Asian culture, without similar weight being given to our British heritage, our Western values or our Judeo-Christian traditions, which are so important to the fabric of our society and the fundamentals of where we have come from and where we will continue to go. This is an important aspect which has been forgotten. In their contribution the IPA has raised some very important points, which should be considered as a reason for increasing the size of the committee to have that non-government voice as part of this consideration in the first place. So there is a broader consideration that the voices of the 30 or 40 per cent of parents who choose to go through the non-government Catholic education sector are heard in these deliberations.


Ultimately, we want a national standard across the education field. We want to ensure that the differences in the standards of education between states are reduced as much as possible. But I do not think we want to standardise completely the opportunities for schools to exercise their ability to teach, and to achieve the standards they wish to achieve, in their own special way and through their own special contribution. In that respect we support the objects of the bill, but we think there are a couple of points where we can improve it. We hope that the government will see the wisdom in following our two proposed amendments. They are good amendments which will improve this bill and ensure that this minister, who we know so far has not had a glittering career of delivering policy, does not do the same to our education system as he did to pink batts.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-08-22,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:35):  The coalition supports the national curriculum in principle. It is a good idea. It is necessary. Many people in my Riverina electorate have told me how confusing and frustrating it is when they move from or to another state and there is inconsistency with what is being taught and at what year level. This is particularly prevalent for children of transient workers such as those who work in some agricultural pursuits, who follow the picking seasons, and also those in military families who frequently move from base to base. As a tri-service defence city, Wagga Wagga has many people who fall into the latter category. For them, a national curriculum would be welcome.


The coalition's concerns regarding the national curriculum are not with the concept but rather its direction under Labor. When the Prime Minister was Minister for Education in 2008 she said a national curriculum would take three years to develop and be ready to implement by January 2011. Under the current legislation, non-government schools are required to put the national curriculum into place by 31 January 2012. As with anything Labor touches, the whole thing has been mucked up. Just like the rapscallion schoolboy who tells the teacher a dog ate his homework, the current Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth also gets an F for failing to deliver on Labor's commitment. The final version of the national curriculum is yet to be approved, and most states will not introduce it until 2013 or 2014. The original legislation therefore needed adjusting. The coalition sought to make the necessary amendments back in March, but the minister was apparently unaware that this presented a problem and did not support our amendment. Schools cannot put in place a curriculum which is not ready—not anywhere near ready. This bill is proof positive that Labor has not delivered on its commitment. During last year's election campaign the Prime Minister claimed, obviously falsely, that the national curriculum was finished. She made statements such as:


This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.


When, Prime Minister?


The coalition's amendments have now been endorsed by the Independent Schools Council of Australia, the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Education Union. The coalition noted advice from non-government school sector authorities to the House inquiry into the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 that the issue of appropriate representation on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee is becoming increasingly important given the emerging task of the committee. This is especially so relating to the national curriculum. If adopted, the coalition's amendment would provide the government with an opportunity to provide non-government sector authorities with 'observer status' on the AEEYSOC instead of or in addition to membership. This could permit, for instance, non-government sector authorities to receive agenda and briefing papers for both the standing council and AEEYSOC in advance, as well as draft minutes in retrospect. We hope the government will adopt this necessary and reasonable amendment to enable non-government sector authorities to make much more informed and better targeted contributions to the national debate. Further, it would ensure that they would be appropriately consulted regarding time lines for introduction of the national curriculum. This is wholly appropriate. This amendment is significant given that the number of parents who have chosen to send their children to non-government schools are not represented on the appropriate bodies which make the decisions in relation to education in this nation. This is unfair and needs to be altered. The coalition amendment also provides for a broad, appropriate teacher development strategy for the national curriculum. Although this bill relates only to non-government schools, we also advocate that professional development to teachers should be available across the whole schools sector.


The draft K-10 curriculum for the subject areas of English, mathematics, science and history has been prepared by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, and Labor intends to present a final draft to education ministers this October for approval at ministerial council. The coalition is deeply concerned about some of the ideological undertones which are pervading the curriculum. The coalition is deeply concerned about the overly prescriptive nature of the draft document. Experts in education agree the content will swamp teachers, with no funding or backup for the required training for the rollout to succeed. These fears are shared by key stakeholder groups, including teacher representatives and professional associations.


As a result, the coalition has moved two vital amendments. Firstly, schools will need to be provided with the appropriate level of assistance and support to introduce an Australian curriculum. Secondly, we seek to include clear representation of the non-government school sector in the decision-making processes for future time lines of a national curriculum. Presently there is no national or consistent approach to making sure all schools are getting the support they so desperately need in teacher professional learning to be able to implement an Australian curriculum. Having adequate representation adds a safeguard that non-government schools would be properly consulted in the lead-up to decisions regarding implementation time lines. These two modest amendments will certainly help smooth this challenging reform process and bring some level of fairness to the debate.


For the Prime Minister to say that she has already delivered a national curriculum is a case of her getting ahead of herself—way ahead of herself. New South Wales Teachers Federation President Bob Lipscombe said only recently, on 10 August: 


""The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented in NSW. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state … There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.


""Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.""


Now we know that the decision to delay the new curriculum has irked the education minister. He accused New South Wales of 'letting students down' and walking away from its commitment. 'There is no justifiable reason for this 11th-hour backdown,' the minister said.


At the heart of this issue is the cost of getting teachers ready for the new curriculum. The New South Wales Minister for Education, Adrian Piccoli, said it would cost about $80 million over four years to implement the curriculum and to provide professional development of teachers. If Mr Piccoli said New South Wales is unwilling to run with the national curriculum agenda because federal Labor has not done due diligence on funding and support then that would be correct. The New South Wales education minister is the member for Murrumbidgee, much of which is in the federal seat of Riverina. He was a competent shadow education, skills and youth affairs spokesman from 28 December 2008 right through the dying days—excuse me—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
):  Who's dying? Sorry.




Mr Lyons:
  Who's dying?




Mr McCORMACK:
  The state Labor government—that's who was dying! He held that position right through the dying days of the inept state Labor government and held a poor party to account for its mismanagement. He is doing a fine job as minister, and I commend him for that and for his genuine care and concern for the education of today's children—surely our greatest resource.


The state government said on 9 August it would postpone implementation of the national curriculum for 12 months because of the federal Labor government's failure to provide teacher development funding and questions about its quality. That quality is gravely concerning. One hopes a national curriculum is not used as a vehicle for Labor to push its propaganda. Disturbingly, according to a 13 March report in the Daily Telegraph:


PRIMARY school children are being terrified by lessons claiming climate change will bring ""death, injury and destruction"" to the world unless they take action. 


On the eve of Prime Minister Julia Gillard's carbon tax package announcement, psychologists and scientists said the lessons were alarmist, created unneeded anxiety among school children and endangered their mental health.


Climate change as a ""Doomsday scenario"" is being taught in classrooms across Australia. Resource material produced by the Gillard government for primary school teachers and students states climate change will cause ""devastating disasters"".


…   …   …


Australian National University's Centre for the Public Awareness of Science director Dr Sue Stocklmayer said climate change had been portrayed as ""Doomsday scenarios with no way out"".


Dr Stocklmayer said she was not a climate-change sceptic but worried that ""too much time was spent presenting scary scenarios, especially to young people"".


""(Children) feel incredibly despondent and helpless in the face of all this negative information,"" she said. ""To put all of this before our children … is one of the most appalling things we can do …




Mr Lyons:
  Like listening to the Liberal Party.




Mr McCORMACK:
  I will take the member's interjection, but what I say even includes Tasmania. The article continues:


Child psychologist Kimberley O'Brien also said the language of climate change should be ""toned down"".


Of course, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth refuses to stop the teaching of Labor's climate science, despite moves in Britain for the subject to be withdrawn. But, then, this government also refused to stop the wasteful spending on school halls when it was plainly obvious to all and sundry it was a fiasco, a taxpayer rip-off in the order of a disgraceful $6 billion. At least the coalition's Investing in Our Schools program injected real and meaningful money into grateful schools—



Mr Lyons interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  including in Tasmania. Funding is an important issue as far as education is concerned. Recently, the Director of Schools in the Catholic Education Office, Wagga Wagga, Mr Alan Bowyer, was moved to respond in a media statement to concerns that funding would be cut and media reports that funding would be cut by this Labor-Greens alliance. The statement reads:


In responding to enquiries from a number of media representatives, Mr Bowyer declared, ""We believe that a fair, equitable and certain funding scheme for all schools is vital for the continued growth and expansion of quality learning and teaching for all Australian students and teachers"".


That is something I am sure all people in this place would agree with. It continues:


""Our belief is that education is a basic entitlement and all students, whether they attend a Catholic, an independent or a state school, have the right to be funded by government at a level that provides a balanced, rigorous and properly resourced education"", Mr Bowyer said. ""No parent should be financially penalised as a result of choosing to send their children to Catholic schools in accordance with their religious beliefs and commitment to the Church"".


I say: hear, hear!


Mr Bowyer stated that figures taken from the National Report on Schooling in Australia (2008) clearly indicate that Catholic schools and non-government schools in general, are under-funded when compared with state schools. ""While a student in a state school, on average, in 2007-08 received $12,639 in funding from state and federal governments for the year, the figure for a Catholic school student was only $7,685. Productivity Commission figures in 2009 show that the amount for public school students was a little less – $11,874 per student while the amount per child in the independent sector remained steady"", he said.


""School funding is a complex issue. State governments are the primary source of recurrent funding for schools and provide approximately 93% of public school costs but only about 17% of non-government schools costs. The Federal government provides top up assistance of approximately 7% to public schools and about 53% to non-government schools resulting in the need for non-government schools to charge school fees to address the gap. Catholic systemic schools endeavour to keep school fees as low as possible to ensure Catholic education is affordable for families, but school fees as such, only partly contribute to the funding gap between what is received from government sources and the true costs of schooling …


Mr Bowyer went on to reveal that 704,000 (20%) students attend Catholic schools across Australia, and stated that these schools employ 78,000 staff. He said that in 2010 in NSW, 66 per cent of students attended public schools, 22 per cent of students went to Catholic schools and 12 per cent attended independent schools.


""It should be remembered that many Catholic schools, which dominate the non-government school sector in terms of enrolments, serve disadvantaged communities made up of migrant and working-class families and those living in remote and rural Australia"", Mr Bowyer said. ""In some areas, the Catholic school is the only school serving the local community"".


Mr Bowyer welcomed the opportunity that organisations had to make submissions to the Gonski Review and said he was reassured by the Prime Minister's promise that, ""this is not about taking money away from schools"" and that ""no school will lose a dollar of funding, in the sense that their school budget per student will not reduce in dollar terms"".


I certainly do hope that the Prime Minister lives up to those words; I certainly do hope that Labor does not listen to the Greens and cut or freeze Catholic school funding, because it is all about choice, and in Australia we should have that choice. If a parent wants to send their child to a Catholic school they should be able to do so, with the knowledge that that schoolchild will be funded properly and sufficiently so that they receive a good and fair education. There should be fair and equitable funding right across the school education system.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2011-08-22,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (17:50):  In rising to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill, I am reminded of the purpose behind our education system. Regardless of how we build the system and how we operate the system, the desired outcome remains the same—to help future generations to learn. Following the member for Riverina's comments, I want to endorse some of the remarks he made at the end of his contribution with regard to Catholic and private schools. I have always been of the belief that taxpayer funds are for the children, for the students, and it really should not matter which school they attend.


Every bill that comes before this parliament should, in some way, enhance education and learning outcomes for future generations—and I am talking about all students here. I believe the coalition's amendments to this bill will do that. But we cannot expect our children to learn if the system's builders and operators demonstrate a fundamental inability to learn, if they are unable to learn the easiest lessons of all—and that is learning from one's own mistakes. Such a flaw would undermine the system. It would undermine the outcomes. It would deliver for future generations a standard lower than they deserve.


What we have in the bill before us is a warning that the current government is simply not capable of learning from its own mistakes. It is not for the want of opportunity. They have created more than their fair share of learning opportunities—or mistakes. Amongst an extensive back catalogue of these learning opportunities, we find familiar themes. There are common threads. These threads suggest that, if only a small number of lessons could be learnt by the government, a large number of future stuff-ups could be avoided.


The troubling thing is this. We can see the problems coming. We can see that the national curriculum and how it is going to be implemented have not been properly thought through. We know what happens as a result, because we have seen it happen one too many times during this current government. It is troubling because we can see it coming but the government cannot. It is like being a passenger in a car doing 200 kilometres an hour who can see the approaching cliff when the driver is too busy looking in the vanity mirror.


It is troubling because we can see yet another knee-jerk reaction in the pipeline. We can see a government going off half-cocked because they are so desperate to make it look as if they have actually done something. They are so desperate, in fact, that they do not even wait until the job is half done before claiming that it is finished. With this Schools Assistance Amendment Bill in mind I might remind the House that the Prime Minister said on 2 July last year: 


This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it. 


That was more than a year ago. There has still been nothing delivered, and that is why we are here debating this bill almost 14 months later, and implementation is still a speck on the future horizon. 


In addition to its concerns about delayed delivery the coalition also has serious concerns about exactly what is being delivered and how it is going to be delivered. That is why we have moved important amendments—amendments that we hope can stop this runaway car before it reaches the cliff.


We need the government not only to allow input from the appropriate sources but to listen to that input—to take in advice and admit to themselves that people and organisations outside the Labor Party and the Greens, people working in the education system and with the education system, might actually know what they are talking about. Because what this government thinks it is going to deliver as a national curriculum is nothing to skite about; it is something that should be cause for deep embarrassment.


The coalition believes that a delay in implementation is necessary. That is why we have sought previously to pass a similar bill. A delay in implementation of the national curriculum is necessary because it could be a very, very long time before this government could get the national curriculum right. The implementation of this national curriculum has all the loose threads—all the warning signs, all the hallmarks—of the multitude of miserable failures this government should have learned from. This government should have learned that what happens when you make promises you are not capable of delivering is something like the failed computers in schools program. There is a strong parallel between the Prime Minister claiming a year ago that she had delivered a national curriculum and the promise that computers would be delivered to every high school student by the end of 2011. In June this year, only 55 per cent of the computers had been rolled out, and that has taken three years to do. 



Mr McCormack interjecting—




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  That leaves the government another six months to roll out the remaining 45 per cent which, the member for Riverina reminds me, is missing. But that was never going to happen. Even the education department knew that was not going to happen. The only problem is, they never told the minister for education that it was not going to happen, because a month later the minister was still telling us the program was on track and on schedule.


The government has a proven track record of inability to deliver. But here they are, bragging about having delivered a national curriculum that is still miles away from completion. The government should have learned that what happens when you do not fully think things through is that you end up with a debacle like the overpriced school halls that picked the pockets of Australian taxpayers and ripped off state government schools. Did anyone ever sit down and think about how these school halls would be delivered, who would build them, how they would build them, how they would price them and how fair value would be measured? The result was a disastrous waste of money—money that should have created much greater benefit for our education system.


But here they are, skiting about having delivered a national curriculum when there is still no real plan as to how it is going to be delivered. The government should have learned that what happens when you do not consider the implications of a shoddy implementation plan is a pink batts scheme. If you create an environment where people are not properly trained for what they are supposed to do, not given clear guidelines on how to perform their task and not given the support they need to do their job, you have to expect a degree of failure. That should be a lesson learned from the pink batts program. But here we are, putting together a national curriculum content that will leave teachers ill-equipped for implementation. They will be overwhelmed with the size and scope of the task. There is inadequate provision for training and support and there is a distinct lack of clear guidelines to follow.


The government should have learned that what happens when you are led down the garden path by a minority interest is that you lose sight of the big picture. You end up pandering to a single entity with a minority view point. You end up pushing pokies legislation that is hated by millions of people just to garner the support of a single person. But here we are, creating content that is so ideologically skewed that it pushes every cultural context except reality.


The national curriculum in its current format goes to great lengths to add weight to minority views, Indigenous culture and Asian culture without equal weight for the dominant British heritage and Judaeo-Christian traditions on which this country was founded. I am not opposed to including such content in the curriculum. Indigenous culture is a very important component of modern Australian culture. Our country's geographical ties to Asia also need to be recognised, but these influences must be viewed, as they are in the real world, through the framework of our overwhelmingly British heritage and dominant Judaeo-Christian traditions. These are the foundations of Australian society. They are the foundations of the world our children live in. They are the foundations that have built our language—the language that our teachers will be using to educate our children. To ignore these foundations would be no less a failure than to completely ignore Indigenous and Asian culture.


These concerns about the content of the national curriculum are concerns held not just by the coalition; they are views shared by key stakeholders. Dr Kevin Donnelly, the director of the Melbourne based Education Standards Institute, said that he too could see this coming. He said:


I can see that my fears about the new curriculum were well founded.


He described the content as:


… a heady mixture of politically correct perspectives: sustainable, indigenous, feminist, class, postmodern and cultural relativist. 


He shares the view that it is only through the context of our Western heritage that we can understand our legal system, our political system, our language, our literature and our education. We have to question why someone would sit down and develop a national curriculum that goes to great lengths to ignore the terms BC and AD to indicate years simply because BC stands for 'Before Christ'. We must not mention the C-word. No, they thought it would be better to use the term BCE: 'Before common era'. That is rewriting history at its best.


Not content with rewriting history, this government is supporting a national curriculum that gives a fantastic outline of the Labor Party but conveniently neglects to balance the outlines of the Liberal and National parties. That is serious. That is in the national curriculum. Perhaps if the people on the ground were given the opportunity for input and the government took the time to put its ego in a box long enough to listen to what the people were saying it would avoid such embarrassment. 


The government should have learnt. They still are not listening to what people are saying about the carbon tax and it just makes people angrier—and we saw it today. It makes people more determined to force an election by any means possible. They need to avoid that personality flaw here and allow for more voices into the national curriculum formulation. In the time afforded by the extension of this deadline, the government should accept their own shortcomings and actively seek advice from those who really do know better. Including a representative from the non-government schools on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee would be a very good start, because so much of the future depends on our education system.


The lives of generations to come will be hugely shaped by the education that we provide now for our young people. It is of great concern to me that such an important part of our society is now in the hands of this government, Labor and the Greens, who clearly demonstrate that they are most incapable of learning themselves. I really do hope that this curriculum is delayed so that we can have some balance and we can get it right, because if we do not get this right it will not be the government that suffers but the children—that is, until we reach the ballot box.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:02):  Mr Deputy Speaker, it is always a pleasure to see you in the chair and I hope you are well today.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
):  Thank you.




Mr TEHAN:
  In speaking on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 this evening, I will start by reading a quote out because sadly it sums up where we are at with this legislation. It comes from the President of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, Bob Lipscombe:


The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented in New South Wales. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state …


There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.


Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.


Mr Lipscombe said that on the ABC news on 10 August 2011. He spoke not only for New South Wales but also for the states and territories of the Commonwealth because sadly, as we stand here this evening debating the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011, we see that the national curriculum is not ready to be implemented.


The coalition supports a national curriculum in principle. We are not concerned with the idea. We are sadly concerned, though, once again with how it is being implemented by the Gillard government. This dates back to 2008 when Julia Gillard, our current Prime Minister, said it would take three years to develop and implement. That was in 2008—three years ago—and it would be ready to go by January 2011. If I am not mistaken, it is now August 2011 and here we are debating this bill.


It is ironic that the coalition sought to amend the legislation when it was initially put so that we could look at a start date of 2013 or 2014 and the government would not allow our amendment, yet here we are having to look at either a 2013 or a 2014 start date. It shows that, once again, this government is lacking when it comes to implementation. Although it has been quoted by pretty much every speaker that has been before me on our side, it is worth reminding the House what the Prime Minister said during the election campaign: 'This nation's talked about a national curriculum for 30 years. I've delivered it.' Sadly, she has not and it is going to take some time yet.


If it is to be delivered in a way that is meaningful and does the right thing by schools in this country, it is going to need some change. That is why, in a very positive and bipartisan way, the coalition is putting forward two amendments to help improve the government's legislation, to show the government the way. It is often said—I must say wrongly—that we are negative in the approach that we take. Here we are being extremely positive. We are offering two sensible amendments to show the government the error of its ways and asking it to take them on board to improve the legislation that it is putting forward. It will be very interesting to see what the government does with this positive approach that we are putting forward. The two amendments we are putting forward make a lot of sense. The first relates to the importance of ensuring that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the Australian Curriculum. You would have thought that you would take that sort of assistance for granted—that schools would be granted support to implement. I would have thought that that is as logical as day following night. Sadly, it does not seem to be the case with this government. We are putting forward an amendment which would see that happen. We would see teachers getting the support that they need to implement the curriculum. Teachers would have the confidence to say: 'We are going to be teaching a national curriculum in maths, in English or in science. We know exactly what that curriculum is about. We know exactly how students need to be taught. Therefore, we have confidence going into the classroom and making sure all students across Australia get the teaching that they need to develop and go on and be wonderful individuals.' That is a very positive contribution to this debate and to this legislation, and I hope that it will be one that the government will take on board.


Our second amendment seeks to include clear representation of the non-government school sector with respect to decision-making processes for future time lines of the national curriculum. I would just like to point out to the government and to the education minister in particular—and the one that went before him—that there are actually two types of education that we have in this country. There is a very good government sector and there is a very good non-government sector. We do not just have one sector. Therefore, if we are to get balance in the way the national curriculum time lines are to be set, about what the character of those guidelines should be, about what should be in the curricula, it would only be wise and fair that both the non-government and government sectors can play a part in doing that. If a national curriculum is to serve the learning needs of our children then we should ensure that it does it for those children who are learning in the non-government sector as much as we do it for those students learning in the government sector. 


These are two what you would call positive, modest amendments—ones which will go a long way to alleviating the recurring concerns about the curriculum process. When you look at the detail that has been in the curriculum, or the overarching framework which has been set out, there have been concerns. Our two amendments will address them. The government should do the right thing and take them on board.


I would like to point out two particular flaws that the curriculum has in it. I think most of the speakers on our side who have been before me have touched on these, because I think they are fairly important. Sadly, Labor's curriculum is driven on ideological grounds. For example, in the history component, the Labor Party and union movement is included but there is no mention of the Liberal or National parties or the parties on the conservative side of politics that went before them. Imagine if we were developing the national curriculum and we put forward that it would only address the history of the United Australia Party, the National Party, and the Country Party that came before it, and the Liberal Party. Could you imagine the outrage if we left the union movement and the Labor Party out? The other side would be just ballistic in their rage if we did that. Yet they have the gall to do it here. It just beggars belief that they could do such a thing.


The worst thing about it is it highlights what they are about here. It is not about a national curriculum which is about teaching our students across the country maths, science and English in a uniform way; sadly, there is a deeper desire here, and that is to drive the ideology through our students. I would hope that Labor would be able to look at this and say: 'This is not the right way to teach the young people of this country. We need to provide balance.' They should put themselves in our shoes from a moment and say: 'Yes, look, if the reverse was done, we would have problems with that. We need to address this.' And I hope that they will.


The second point that I would like to make about this national curriculum as it has been developed so far by this government is that it is overcrowded. There is an excessive amount of content to be covered in courses, which means less flexibility for schools. I would have thought in the 21st century we should have been looking to put more flexibility into our schools, not less, by giving our teachers the freedoms to be able to operate within their classrooms by giving them an outline of what needs to be addressed but not detailing every last sentence. If you are trying to drive an ideological agenda maybe, because you would say: 'You have to talk about the Labor Party and the union movement. You have to talk about those things. Of course, don't worry about the other side.' It is overly prescriptive. We need to pull back from that. We have to allow teachers and our principals to be able to go about doing the things that they do best. They need the flexibility to be able to do it. I hope we will get a pullback from that overly prescriptive approach, because our students across the country will benefit from it, our teachers will benefit from it, our principals will benefit from it, and our whole education system will benefit from it. If we continue to be too prescriptive the national curriculum will not do the job it is meant to do.


I would like to draw my speech tonight to a conclusion. So it is nicely rounded, I would like to go back to where I started, which is the quote from Bob Lipscombe, because I think that quote, although it is on behalf of the New South Wales education sector, reflects what the concerns are across the country as a whole:


The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented … We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards …


There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.


Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.


The Prime Minister is on the record as saying: 'This nation's talked about a national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' She has not delivered it.


We have to make sure that her embarrassment of not having done that does not mean that we rush our implementation now. Our kids' futures are at hand. A lot of us here have students who are going through the schooling process at the moment. We want this to be done correctly. The coalition, in a very positive manner, have put forward two amendments—two positive approaches—to try to fix the mess that the implementation of this bill is likely to create. I hope the education minister will take those two amendments on board. I hope the Prime Minister will see the positive approach on which they have been put forward and see that this is being done to improve the educational outcomes of our children and to make sure that our schools, our teachers and our principals have the right guidelines going ahead. The coalition support the idea of a national curriculum. What we do not support is the way this government is going about it.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:17):  I rise tonight to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011; a bill that seeks to address a rather unfortunate oversight by the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, and one twice raised in this place by the shadow minister for education, but only now sought to be fixed by the minister. The oversight referred to is the implementation date of the national curriculum—currently set for commencement in just five months time for non-government schools. This sounds like a noble goal, but it is terribly hard to implement a curriculum that is yet to be finalised.


The shadow minister first raised the concern about the implementation deadline for non-government schools in November last year, and earlier this year repeated calls for a simple amendment to be legislated to remove this unreachable deadline. The reforms for a national curriculum—initially promised to be implemented by January 2012—have drifted and been left incomplete by a government well known for its inability to implement programs on time or on budget have start dates now pushing out to 2013 or 2014 and a legislative deadline rapidly approaching. This bill should have been unnecessary. But for the pigheadedness of those opposite in not understanding the problems in their own legislation, the problems this bill seeks to address would have previously been addressed.


Nonetheless, the fact that the national curriculum is yet to be finalised did not, of course, prevent the current Prime Minister from proclaiming on 2 July last year: 'This nation's talked about a national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' One might have assumed that if a national curriculum had indeed been 'delivered' then an eraser would not have been needed to rub out the error riddled legislation the Prime Minister put forward back in 2008 when she was the education minister standing behind the former Prime Minister.


Ironically, the Prime Minister claimed to have 'delivered' the national curriculum, despite falling far short of doing so by the January 2012 deadline—as we see by the need for this amendment. The Prime Minister claimed to have 'delivered' the curriculum she has not delivered, just as she promised to the Australian people she would not deliver a carbon tax and is now doing so. No wonder, today, we find a 'convoy of no confidence' on our doorstep that has travelled to Canberra from across the nation to send a clear message to this incompetent government: the Australian people want an election now.


Let us be clear: this government is rushing through a national curriculum not for any good educational reasons but simply for a political reason to enable the Prime Minister to live up to her claim that she has delivered it. Simply, the Prime Minister is prepared to compromise children's education for a simple political purpose. What a disgrace!


Although the coalition broadly supports the intent of having a national curriculum, naturally, particularly under this government, we are deeply concerned about the looming implementation stage. This is especially of concern with a new minister who, as minister for the environment, rushed through an incompetent and poorly thought out program which will go down in our nation's folklore—a program that managed to burn down some 190 homes. We certainly do not want that performance repeated on our nation's schools or on a national curriculum simply because it has to be rushed through.


I would like to air a few broad points relating to the implementation of a national curriculum—or, if you would like, the important narrative and required elements behind the move to a national curriculum. Firstly, we must not allow a race to the bottom. In my home state of New South Wales, we already have a robust curriculum, developed over decades. The last thing we want to do in New South Wales is go backwards with our children's education. I have spoken to a great many teachers in my local area that are keeping a keen eye on the development of the national curriculum, yet they remain cautious about the dangers the implementation of the national curriculum may have and how it may have the potential to water down the high standards already in place in New South Wales. For the national curriculum to produce the results that the country has asked of it, it must look to the future and not backwards into the past. There must be an assessment of the needs of our country, and we must look to where it will be in years to come and present our children with a system that will meet their needs in the future and not lock them into the ways of the past. We will gain nothing and lose much if the national curriculum fails to provide for the future. This is why it cannot and must not be rushed. It is also worth noting that across New South Wales and the rest of Australia many schools who are doubtful of the quality of the national curriculum are considering alternatives for their students, such as the benchmarking International Baccalaureate program. In the past, the New South Wales Higher School Certificate has been recognised across the globe as being a first-class finishing qualification, and the move to a standardised curriculum could see this standing ruined in the eyes of the world.


The second crucial point to recognise is the important role that all sectors in the education system play in developing our children as well-rounded young adults. The national curriculum, if not established in the correct manner, with all the relevant checks and balances satisfied, could endanger the tireless work of the many great teachers of New South Wales. These teachers, who are responsible for teaching the future of our great nation, should not be sold short and forced to teach to exams. Instead, they should be allowed and encouraged to uphold the high standards that are currently evident in New South Wales. Time and time again, we have seen the failure of Labor ideology, the ideology of a deluded belief in centralised control of decisions by a small group of elite, when our history has shown, time and time again, that the best decisions are always made by people working at the coalface. We therefore should not implement a system that would tie the hands of our world-class educators and possibly cause a drop in our educational standards.


Non-government schools are a crucial pillar of our education system in Australia. Without these educational institutions, some of which are over a century old, our education system would not be able to meet the demands of our population. In fact, if government funding to these schools were to be cut, the resulting burden on the state system would mean the collapse of our world-class education system. Over the past decade, class sizes in secondary schools have increased, and in some cases there are now 45 students to one teacher. Without non-government schools, this number could very easily increase still further, reducing the quality of education for all. Within my electorate of Hughes, there are many schools, government and non-government, all which are great schools filled with dedicated teachers who are teaching the next generation of Australians. I have been out and about, visiting local schools, and these visits have reinforced the importance of our work in this key area. We simply cannot get these reforms wrong through rushing them through. We must not let any of these teachers or students down by pushing them into a framework that is not ready and is not able to deliver them the results that they deserve for their hard work.


While the coalition will not oppose this bill, due to the obvious need for the parliament to act on what the coalition has been saying since November last year, it is not possible to implement a curriculum that is yet to be finalised. The coalition will seek to make two important amendments to enhance the progress of the reform, to deliver reform that works and that does not let our kids and their dedicated teachers down. I call on all members opposite to look deep inside themselves and to consider these amendments carefully. Do any of you really want to carry the burden of knowing that you had a choice to improve this bill and this program and chose not to for political expediency? There is a deep black hole in the current national curriculum proposal, and that is a complete lack of assistance in implementing the reforms. Currently, there is no nationally agreed or consistent approach across all jurisdictions to ensure that schools are receiving support in the area of professional development to enable teachers to implement a new national curriculum. Our amendment will rectify this to ensure a smooth transition into practice. We must offer our education professionals the training and support that they will need to implement this big change in Australia's educational system. We must not lock out teachers who work for non-government schools and, as a result, cause their students to suffer, hurting Australia's future in the process.


Our second amendment seeks to include representation from the non-government school sector in the decision-making process for future time lines of the national curriculum, providing the non-government sector with a seat at the table which they have not had to this point. This is likely a key reason why the government has thus far appeared unaware of the implementation time frame problem sought to be rectified by this bill. The government's failure to provide the non-government school sector with a seat at the table in the implementation of a national curriculum is a stark reminder of the bad old days of Mark Latham's infamous hit list, heartily supported by many members opposite during those dark days. By locking the non-government sector out of the decision-making process, we will lose the expertise and wisdom of some of the country's best and greatest educators, who want nothing more than the best education for our students. Instead of knocking down our system to the lowest common denominator, we should be seeking to raise our schools up, and to do this we should be asking for input from all educational institutions, not just those run by government.


The coalition's proposed amendments are crucial to ensuring a smooth and successful implementation of the national curriculum, and while the performance of the government in this area has been weak at best, particularly in failing to recognise and act with the coalition to address the government's failures in the implementation of the national curriculum and subsequent legislative issues such as those we are having to address with this bill, I feel it is important to review what stakeholders are saying about these important coalition amendments. The President of the NSW Teachers Federation has spoken of concern about the lack of support for the implementation of the curriculum, which the coalition amendments would address. On 10 August this year he said:


There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.


Certainly, the coalition agree the government is failing to support our teachers to implement the national curriculum. We encourage those opposite to support our amendment on this key issue.


The President of the Australian Education Union also shares this position, having said previously:


… we're also seriously worried by the absence of any funding to support the implementation.


And, as previous speakers have canvassed, the Independent Education Union has described our amendment to provide a seat at the table for the non-government school sector as 'an important step forward' and an amendment 'that should be supported by all parliamentarians'. The amendments to be moved by the coalition are good and sensible. I encourage those opposite to support these reasonable moves to improve the implementation of the national curriculum.


In conclusion, there has been a lot of discussion regarding the overly prescriptive, biased and ideological content of the national curriculum, but I will not go into that in detail. However, as a previous speaker stated, I do understand the Labor Party and the union movement are included in this new national curriculum, whereas the Liberal Party have been left out. As a previous speaker noted, could we imagine if the reverse applied? We would not hear the end of the screams. I do not have any particular problem if the Labor Party and the union movement are included in the national curriculum—that is the way this current government is going. I simply suggest that these subjects belong in the ancient history curriculum.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (18:31):  I rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. This bill seeks to repeal the 31 January date for the implementation of the national curriculum in non-government schools as outlined in the Schools Assistance Act. I congratulate the member for Hughes and the member for Wannon, who spoke before me, for their very good contributions to this debate. However, I want to take up a couple of points made by the member for Hughes. He did go on a little too much about the strength of education in New South Wales. Everyone knows that Queensland has the best education system and the best curriculum! It is arguments like those that are divisive and are half the reason we have the problems we have. When it comes to the education of our children we must step aside and, from an educator's perspective, try to get a great result.


I represent schools in Townsville, Australia's garrison city. Children come from every corner of Australia. We see kids graduate from schools in Townsville with a great collection of school uniforms and unfinished subjects across the board. We see confusion between the states and between curricula, and about what grade they will stay in or go to, especially when they transfer between states and sometimes even intrastate. Clearly a unified approach would be great. The only way we can get this done is with a united approach.


It is clear that this time frame is far too rushed. Changing the deadline is vital in ensuring that independent schools are adequately prepared for the introduction of this curriculum, the first version of which has not even been approved yet, despite protestations and assertions to the contrary even last year and despite it being less than six months until the date of its expected implementation. I reiterate the statement by Prime Minister Julia Gillard in July last year:


This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.


That is pretty much like health reform. They talk about delivery before anything has even been parcelled up. That is probably the greatest statement since Prime Minister Chamberlain said, 'Peace in our time,' after having talks with Adolf Hitler. It is a bit too much to believe when it comes to these things. They just do not deliver. Has the Prime Minister of the country ever delivered anything so prematurely? We will wait and see because we have health reform and all sorts of reform that we are going to deliver that she has already said has been signed off.


It is over a year later and we still do not have a final copy of the curriculum that is ready to be used anywhere any time soon. This bill is the government's way of conceding that they have failed to deliver. They have failed to deliver the national curriculum they have been boasting about in the time line they have committed to. It is an abject failure. It should weigh heavily on the minister's mind.


The coalition has had the foresight to amend the act. Even in March this year the government failed to see the problem coming and are now scrambling to make the changes that we should have agreed to five months ago. As the member for Hughes said, this bill is completely and utterly unnecessary, but we support this bill as a necessary measure to ensure that non-government schools are given adequate time for the curriculum rollout. I acknowledge though that the government's blunders at every turn with the Australian curriculum have made this necessary.


The issues I have with the national curriculum are not related to the concept. Like many members of the coalition, I think it is important that the curriculum taught in schools is the same in Queensland as it is in every other state. My problem is the way in which this government are so lockstep, with square peg and square hole, that so many of their policies are continually mishandled. As the member for Wannon and the member for Hughes, who spoke before me, said, there should be a framework around which school principals and individual schools can work. What a school can do in Mt Isa, Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory or Townsville is different to what a school can do in the heart of Melbourne or the heart of Sydney. There are differences and there should be a framework around which they can work to achieve the same results and get the same outcomes but give the local environment, the local identity and the local teachers and educators a chance to show why they spent four years or more at university to become teachers.


This national curriculum is heavy on details but the support for it is light. Even experts across the country have acknowledged that the content will be overwhelming for many teachers. Funding to support its implementation has been completely absent. This money is essential to provide teachers with the training and professional development needs to give children a good education from a new curriculum. Too often we see that the teachers' time has been taken off. We have more and more student-free days and more and more time out for teachers for resource time when they are not in the classroom. Teachers are like nurses: they want to be in the classroom. They want to be with their class. Too often we are pulling these people away from what they want to do—what they are trained to do—to make them fill out paperwork.


The coalition has put forward two amendments, both of which I fully support, to address some of the national curriculum's shortcomings. The first of these aims to address the lack of support for schools in implementing the new curriculum. As I have said, the government has taken no measures to ensure that schools across the country are given the assistance they need to make the national curriculum a success. This amendment seeks to address this problem. The second of the coalition's amendments relates to the standing council responsible for the national curriculum time line. Neither this council nor its advisory officials committee, the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee, have representatives specifically to represent the views of the non-government schools sector. That surely must set alarm bells ringing for everyone in this country. That this part of the education system does not have a dedicated voice in the decision-making process for the Australian curriculum is a serious limitation, and addressing this absence will ensure that adequate consultation of non-government schools can and should take place.


Non-government schools are an integral part of Townsville's community and education sector. They are every bit as important as state schools and Catholic schools. Playing a vital part in offering parents choice and alternatives and with more than one-third of Townsville's schools being non-government, it is crucial that a group that accounts for such a big proportion of our education system be listened to when decisions regarding the implementation of the new curriculum are being and will be made.


I would also like to take this opportunity to raise my concerns regarding the government's NAPLAN tests. I have had concerns in relation to NAPLAN and the way it has been rolled out since day one. I have discussed in the past in this parliament the issues I have with NAPLAN. The program has been running for four years, and it seems as though the NAPLAN agenda has completely consumed the teaching agenda. In some schools children are being taught in preschool to prepare for the year 3 NAPLAN test. In between, music, art and sport have been dropped by the wayside as people prepare for nothing else because there is so much pressure applied to the results of the NAPLAN. I was speaking to a principal at a local state school just a couple of weeks ago. He told me that he knew right now that his grade 3s next year will not do well. They know, but there is nothing they can do. They will not get the resources, so they will fail the year and their funding will be cut. Their access to these things will be cut.


Students are taught to be proficient in the areas that NAPLAN will cover as teachers in schools do whatever they can to cater to the My School website, not to deliver a rounded education to students. I also add that there should be more aide time to go with the teacher. If you can get more aide time in primary schools and early childhood especially you will have a better result in years 9, 10, 11 and 12, because the problems of children not being taught the basics will be addressed by having a teacher there all the time.


The victims in all this are the areas that are so vital to a curriculum but not covered by the NAPLAN. Sport, music and art, as I have said, have all fallen by the wayside as schools have been forced to focus instead on improving their NAPLAN scores and concentrate on nothing else. Without a wide-ranging curriculum covering all areas, not only are the opportunities of these missing fields being taken away from kids; they will be less engaged in the teaching. A national curriculum is an important chance for Australia, and the government has already created far too many problems in trying to develop this change. We must get it right and we must take the time to get it right, and to get it right we need the right people sitting at the table to give their points of view—and they must be listened to.


In supporting this bill I would like to add one final point. From pink batts to Building the Education Revolution, this government has created countless problems by trying to rush through problems in legislation. We just cannot afford that sort of behaviour. We cannot afford to add the Australian curriculum to that list. It cannot be done and it should not be done. Thank you.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:42):  The Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 before us today amends the original bill in order to repeal the date by which a non-systemic or approved school system must implement the Australian national curriculum. Whilst the coalition will not oppose this bill, I must say that I am frustrated—frustrated that once again in this House we are debating yet another amendment because once again the government could not get it right. Those opposite regularly stand before us, berating the coalition for what they say is opposition for opposition's sake, accusing us of only ever saying no. But how hypocritical are these claims when, back in March, when the government amended the legislation to change the implementation date for other schools, they simply said no to the coalition's amendment to address this discrepancy. They dismissed our positive and practical proposal out of hand. Why did they oppose our amendment? Only they know. However, if the government had listened at the time, we would not be here now, debating an amendment to this legislation yet again. This all could have been concluded back in March. But we should not be surprised; listening seems to be something this Gillard government regularly fails to do.


The coalition supports the principle of a national curriculum. However, I take offence that Prime Minister Gillard has claimed that she has already delivered it. In July last year the Prime Minister stated:


This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.


If the Prime Minister had indeed delivered a national curriculum back in 2008, when she claimed to, we would not be standing here, having this debate today, three years later. The national curriculum was due to be implemented from January of this year. It was not. It is still not ready, and stakeholders have serious concerns with both the content and the fact that no funding has been proposed to support schools and teachers through this massive change to our education system. Yet from what the Prime Minister said last year, as far as she is concerned a national curriculum was delivered last year.


In principle I support a national curriculum. Like the International Baccalaureate does at an international level a national curriculum would provide an equal education standard around Australia, avoiding much angst when families need to move interstate. In our transient society, it is important that students are comfortable within their learning environment, and a national curriculum helps to give them confidence. A national curriculum provides students with broader opportunities, both domestically and internationally, as their achievements are more quantifiable.


But when will this Gillard government admit that making an announcement does not equal reform? Making an announcement does not equal delivery. Real reform comes with competent delivery, smooth implementation, and open and transparent consultation with stakeholders. When you look at this government's track record of schemes such as Fuelwatch, home insulation, and Building the Education Revolution, I have grave concerns as to how the national curriculum will be rolled out.


This concern is compounded as there does not seem to be any funding or support for the necessary training required for a national curriculum to succeed. It is imperative that teachers, in both the government and the non-government sector, receive adequate support throughout this process. That is why the coalition is moving an amendment to ensure that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the national curriculum. I do not think anyone on either side of this House would deny the importance of our teachers. Teachers are an integral part of our society, shaping the youngest in our society into lifelong learners. I also do not think that anyone in this House would deny that teachers are already undertaking a massive job with enormous responsibility often without the support they deserve and need. With the introduction of a national curriculum, their workload will increase—there is no doubt about that. An entire overhaul of the teaching curriculum will take time to learn how to teach and deliver, and would greatly benefit from teacher training and development. This is common sense, and has been endorsed by the Independent Education Union yet the government has not taken moves to ensure this occurs for non-government schools.


Perhaps the government does not understand the concerns of these stakeholders. Again, we face an issue about a lack of consultation. I have spoken on a number of bills before parliament this year which have had a major impact on the direction of industry, the economy and the Australian people. Yet with many of these bills, there has been a very limited consultation period in which stakeholders could voice their concern, raise issues and make suggestions. It seems that this may be happening again, as the concerns expressed by experts in education, teacher representative groups, and professional associations share the coalition's concern about the lack of funding. However it does not seem that their voices are being heard. Non-government schools do not have specific representation on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee. This means that non-government schools have little opportunity to share their experience and thoughts on the implementation of a national curriculum, despite being greatly affected.


The coalition is today moving an amendment to rectify that. The government is introducing a national curriculum across the board to both government and non-government schools. This means that students and teachers in both forms of schooling will be affected, so it is very important that representatives from both are heard. Around half of all students will attend a non-government school at some point during their education, and non-government schools bring further ideas and considerations to the table. Non-government school representation is an important step forward, and I hope it is one that the government will take on board and action.


I have 19 non-government schools in my electorate which educate a significant number of students. These students will experience the national curriculum just like those at the 26 government schools in my electorate—as will their teachers and school staff. They also need support and representation as the coalition provides for in our two amendments to this bill. Even more importantly these students, teachers, administrators and parents should not be overlooked again by this government just as they were overlooked in March with the original amendments to the implementation timeline.


I trust that this government will take a good look at its failures to date and go forward with the national curriculum in a much more positive way, not bungling its implementation as it has with so many other programs. The coalition amendments to be moved would be a good start. I trust that this Gillard government does not ignore them out of spite as seemingly happened back in March when the government missed an opportunity to rectify the blown out implementation time line for all schools. Let us not see such an important change to Australian education mismanaged again.


Debate adjourned.

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (15:37):  When I was interrupted, I was outlining some of the concerns that we on this side of the House still have with the proposed national curriculum. In the first instance I was referring to our concern about the lack of an overall framework, which governs the national curriculum, and the lack of clear direction, which underpins it. I was then moving on to talk about the fact that the curriculum has a very heavy emphasis on Asian and Indigenous culture but does not give a similar weight to our British heritage or our Judeo-Christian traditions. I advise the House that they should read the IPA's monograph on the national curriculum. It is called The national curriculum—a critique. It noted that Western culture and civilisation are:




… v
irtually absent from the national curriculum as it is currently conceived.



I think that is an area which needs to be re-examined, relooked at and incorporated into the national curriculum in terms of our overall British and Western heritage and our Judeo-Christian heritage, which we inherited, as well as Asian and Indigenous culture.


Some of the other concerns that we have raised are over the lack of appropriate resources which will be attached to the implementation of the national curriculum. There many other issues which Christopher Pyne, the shadow minister for education, has raised.


We are moving two amendments to enhance the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill. The first is to ensure that schools are provided with appropriate support to implement the national curriculum. One of our criticisms has been that there has not been that support in the form of professional development training for teachers to implement the curriculum.


The second is to ensure that there is a clear representation of the non-government school sector with respect to decision-making processes for future time lines of the national curriculum. Again, one of the problems I was referring to beforehand was that the non-government school sector was out of sync with the government school sector. I think part of that has come about due to the fact that the non-government school sector has not been at the decision-making table. These amendments would ensure that they are always at the decision-making table on issues which affect their schools. Given that they make up a third of all school students in the country, it seems to be a very sensible thing to do.


Let me conclude by saying that, like many things the government has touched, the national curriculum has involved delays, bungles and underdelivery against the government's rhetoric. This national curriculum was supposed to be finished and implemented by January 2011. Of course it has not been and now probably will not be implemented until 2013 or 2014. It was supposed to be a smooth process but it has not been anything of the sort. In fact, every single stakeholder group has in some respect complained about the drafts that have been presented and asked for significant changes.


Finally, it was supposed to have been delivered already according to the Prime Minister's own words of July 2010 when she said:




This nation
'
s talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.



She has not delivered it. It is nowhere near being delivered. It will be several years late from when she claimed she delivered it, but I suggest she takes that time and gets the national curriculum right because it will have a significant impact across all schools in our community. It needs to be properly thought through and properly considered and the government needs to get the content right. As I have mentioned before in this House, we ideally should have bipartisan support, at least in relation to the broad framework of the national curriculum, so that schools in the future can have confidence that it will not be chopped and changed but, rather, there will be a consistent framework governing the curriculum going forward.

Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (15:42):  Today I take the opportunity to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill, which deals with the national curriculum in Australian schools. I think it is extremely important that we have a consistent and uniform curriculum across all schools in this nation.


Australian education has changed enormously over the decades. I particularly want to draw to the House's attention the fact that families are more transient than ever before. Long gone are the days when kids would remain in the same school to receive their education. The reality is that families these days have to move from town to town or state to state, and it is important that those children are not disadvantaged as a consequence of the work pattern that their parents have to undertake. That is why it is important that we have a standard uniform curriculum that provides young people with the opportunity to move from school to school, state to state and to be able to pick up almost where they left off at their previous school.


It is also important that that curriculum remains modern and contemporary for the needs of our nation and the needs of those families and students. Long gone are the days when we studied history, particularly in the context of colonialisation and British history. We have a much more diverse history than that, and our curriculum needs to recognise that. It needs to build on that and reflect the great tradition and diversity we have in Australia. It also needs to instil in students creative thinking and an understanding of ethical behaviour. Personal and social consequences and intercultural understanding are an important part and are important Australian values, and our curriculum needs to very clearly recognise that and instil in our young people the necessary skills to be able to respond to what is now a very multicultural society. The details of these bills are important and I would like to take some time to go through them. The regulation will prescribe as the national curriculum any new version of the Australian Curriculum authorised by the Council of Australian Governments Standing Council for School Education and Early Childhood. The amendment will provide a more certain legal framework for the non-government sector in which to implement the national curriculum and provide greater administrative efficiency for prescribing the phased introduction of the curriculum.


Australia has a world-class curriculum that recognises the 21st century. We have a world-class curriculum in the development of skills and knowledge in all of the important areas—English, mathematics, science and history, with development in geography, languages and arts well underway to be implemented at a later time. For the first time, students all over Australia will be studying the same curriculum in the four key areas. As I mentioned earlier, families move around much more than they have historically. State boundaries have become a problem for students and families, particularly when it comes to slotting kids into new schools in different areas. They find that subjects that they have already learnt are now being taught and that they miss out on other subjects through the course of their studies. It is important that we provide uniformity in our curriculum so that young students are not disadvantaged in that regard.


It is also important that we recognise that we have two forms of school education in Australia: one provided by the states and territories and the other provided by independent providers. As students move between government schools, students also move between private and independent schools and government schools and vice versa. Again, it is important that we recognise that fact and have uniformity of education wherever possible, particularly in the key fundamental areas of education such as English, languages, science, mathematics, the arts and the like. That is extremely important.


I would like to report that I have 70-odd schools that service my electorate. It is a diverse bunch of schools teaching a very diverse bunch of students. My electorate covers some 7,000 square kilometres and many of my students have to travel some distance to access education. All of those families require quality education for their children. I would also like to point out that not only have we in the government been busy with respect to establishing decent curriculum standards across this nation but also we have invested substantially in the infrastructure that is required to help support modern education, whether through the provision of language labs in secondary schools or libraries and multipurpose classrooms and the like in primary schools—again, providing flexible learning spaces that give students every opportunity to access that curriculum in a modern way.


I would like to take this opportunity to point to a number of primary schools particularly in my electorate that, whilst they have received special funds under the Building the Education Revolution program, are in desperate need of a boost to help support a modern curriculum. (Quorum formed)




Mr CHEESEMAN:
  Obviously the tactics committee and the Liberal Party has been flat out this afternoon. Before the quorum was called, I was talking about a number of primary schools in my electorate that require a substantial amount of funding to help them rebuild themselves. I draw the attention of the House to Portarlington Primary School and Birregurra Primary School, both of which have a substantial number of buildings which have been there a very long time and should be bulldozed and replaced with new, modern facilities to provide modern infrastructure so that the curriculum can be—




Mr Fletcher:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order: understanding standing order 76, I put it to you that what the member is speaking about is not relevant to the matter before us—that is, the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011, not a listing of BER grants in his electorate, which is what we are hearing.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  I counsel the honourable member for Corangamite to observe the standing orders; however I do draw to the attention of the honourable member for Bradfield the long title of the bill, which is 'a bill for an act to amend the law relating to education and for related purposes'. The addition of the words 'and for related purposes' does tend to widen somewhat the ambit of the discussion. The member for Corangamite has the call.




Mr CHEESEMAN:
  Those are very wise words, Mr Deputy Speaker. To deliver curriculum in schools in a modern way, you need modern facilities, and the BER program provided modern facilities for schools. Having said that, there are some schools that still require further assistance with the building of infrastructure so that they can deliver a modern, flexible curriculum that responds to national need, and Portarlington Primary School and Birregurra Primary School are two examples of schools that are old and need investment. Whilst those school communities have very much appreciated the BER investment in those schools, it is incumbent upon the state government to come to the table and help support those school communities in their time of need.


Within my electorate I have many communities that are rapidly growing. The people in those communities come from diverse backgrounds, and they appreciate and recognise the importance of having strong education for their kids. This government has done more to reform education in all sectors than any other government has done since Federation. Our side, the Labor Party, is very proud of that. We recognise that the best way to give a student a decent life is to give them a decent education, and the cornerstone of that is having a strong curriculum that is flexible and creative and enables our students to grow in a way that we all can be extremely proud of.


I am very pleased that a number of schools have come together and made a very strong application for a trades training centre. Indeed, they have picked up a grant to build a new trades training facility that will look after the Coolac, Apollo Bay and Lavers Hill communities. If we want to have a curriculum that delivers strongly for students in our electorates we need to make sure that we provide the facilities that are appropriate to the curriculum, and trades training will provide opportunities to young people. We also need to make sure that we have in our schools appropriate access to computers, because for anyone— (Time expired)

"Roy, Wyatt, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (15:57):  I rise to speak to the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. The Schools Assistance Act 2008 currently provides for the funding arrangements for non-government schools to be continued upon implementation of the national curriculum by 31 January 2012. With the legislation as it now stands, if the curriculum is not implemented by the stated date the Australian government could require reimbursement of these funds. The amendment proposed in the bill repeals the implementation date of 31 January 2012 and replaces it with a standing regulation that takes into account the staged development and implementation of the national curriculum. Also, the proposed amendment provides that the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood and Youth Affairs will determine new timelines.


When the initial legislation on the national curriculum was drafted in 2008, it was anticipated that the national curriculum would be finalised and ready to be rolled out by the beginning of 2011. However, the government underestimated the complexities of the task at hand, and the national curriculum is far from finalised. Like most programs developed by this Labor government, the development of the national curriculum has been poorly managed. The coalition is supportive of the principle of an Australian curriculum; however, the final version has not been approved and most jurisdictions will not begin its implementation until 2013. The legislation before us therefore needs amendment. It should be noted that the coalition attempted to make the necessary amendments in March this year; but at that point the minister seemed unaware that there would be a problem.


In 2008, education ministers adopted the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians. The declaration affirmed:




As a nation Australia values the central role of education in building a democratic, equitable and just society—a society that is prosperous, cohesive and culturally diverse, and that values Australia
'
s Indigenous cultures as a key part of the nation
'
s history, present and future.



It further affirmed:




Schools play a vital role in promoting the intellectual, physical, social, emotional, moral, spiritual and aesthetic development and wellbeing of young Australians, and in ensuring the nation
'
s ongoing economic prosperity and social cohesion.



These are the guiding principles that have informed the development of the national curriculum, and, as guiding principles, they are admirable in their intent. However the requirement to amend this legislation highlights delays in the rollout of the curriculum and concerns associated with its development that have not been addressed. The fact that this parliament needs to consider this bill is evidence that the Labor government has not delivered on its commitment. In April 2008, the Labor Prime Minister promised 'A national curriculum publicly available and which can start to be delivered in all jurisdictions from January 2011'. One year ago during the election campaign the Labor Prime Minister said: 'This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' The documents are still far from ready and there continue to be significant concerns with the process.


The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority is continuing to develop the national curriculum. The initial consultation on the K to year 10 documents for English, maths, science and history occurred between March and May of last year. Comments were incorporated and further consultation with expert educators was undertaken. The Labor government is planning to present a final draft to education ministers in October of this year for approval at the ministerial council. A similar process is being followed for the senior curriculum and its development is continuing.


However, as mentioned, there have been a number of issues associated with the development of the national curriculum. The first of these is that there was inadequate representation of the non-government sector on the relevant subcommittee reporting to the ministerial council. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2010, 71 per cent of schools in Australia were public schools, with the remaining 29 per cent Catholic or independent schools. In the same year, the total number of students in Australian schools increased by 26,071 with 63 per cent of that figure comprising private school students. Since 2000, the number of students in private schools has increased by 21 per cent, whereas the number of students in public schools has increased only by one per cent. Given these figures, is it not unreasonable to expect that a sector that is currently servicing a third of our children and is growing should have a voice on the subcommittee?


Parents are voting with their feet and exercising their right to choose where and how their children are educated. In the coalition we support the right of parents to choose which school their children attend. We believe the independent sector should be maintained as a viable choice for as many parents as possible. We also recognise that every child that is in the private system is a child that is not placing a burden on taxpayer funded public education. Freedom of choice is a key Liberal value and is one that many members of my community have exercised when choosing schools for their children. In this context, we believe that the independent school sector should also have a strong voice on the subcommittee reporting to the ministerial council and the sector should also have a say in the decisions regarding implementation time frames.


The nature of the curriculum documents themselves has also been questioned. The Labor government's curriculum documents lack clarity of direction and an overarching framework. We are concerned that there is too much ideology driving the content of the curriculum. For example, there is a predominant focus in Indigenous and Asian culture without similar weight being given to British heritage or our Judeo-Christian traditions. This raises serious concerns about the balance and the content that is going to be taught in our schools.


In addition, there are concerns that the national curriculum is overcrowded, meaning that many schools will be left without the flexibility to deliver programs that correspond with their particular philosophy—for example, in the area of the arts. There is also an excessive focus on content rather than the development of essential critical and creative thinking skills in students. Furthermore, the documents appear not to have enough flexibility to cater for children who require additional support or those who are particularly talented. Issues have been raised regarding, for example, the science curriculum documents which are purported to be so difficult that students may actually be discouraged from studying the sciences. This would be a terrible outcome.


The other concern with the national curriculum, separate from the documents themselves, lies in how it is to be implemented. Teachers have expressed serious concerns with regard to the support they receive as the curriculum is rolled out. The Federal President of the Australian Education Union said recently 'We're seriously worried by the absence of any funding to support the implementation'. The unions should be concerned. This government's track record at delivering programs is absolutely abysmal—think pink batts, think school halls. The national curriculum is far too important to go the same way as these failed programs. A rollout without the necessary training and support for our teachers who will have to deliver the content is a recipe for the disasters that have become the hallmark of this Labor government.


In order to go some way towards dealing with a couple of these issues, we urge members opposite to support the amendments the coalition is moving. The first of these will underscore the importance of ensuring that schools and teachers receive the support and professional training they require in order to effectively implement the curriculum. The second amendment will ensure that the independent school sector receives representation and is consulted on the time lines associated with the implementation of the curriculum. The coalition supports the legislative amendment proposed by this bill in recognition that implementation of the national curriculum is going to take much longer than originally anticipated and is yet another failed Labor promise. A three-year implementation for phase 1 of the Australian curriculum commencing this year with implementation by 2013 is likely. However, a time frame for phase 1 of the senior secondary curriculum is yet to be agreed. Furthermore, updates to the curriculum will be required from time to time. The amendment is designed to provide a mechanism whereby the staged introduction and any amendments can be accommodated. However, there are worrying deficiencies in the process. There is no non-government sector representation on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee, which reports to the ministerial council, and there is no plan to support teachers and schools in the implementation of the curriculum. They are areas of significant concern. The coalition's amendments address these issues.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (16:06):  In December 2010, the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs endorsed the foundation to year 10 Australian curriculum in the initial four learning areas of English, mathematics, science and history. Ministers agreed that from 2011 states and territories will commence staged implementation of the agreed Australian curriculum, with substantial implementation to be completed by the end of 2013.


It is time for change and to re-evaluate how education is provided and how it can best be delivered. Over time the need for a national curriculum has become clear. In the past people did not move as much and often one completed one's education in the same town or region. Now people are much more footloose and have to move more from state to state to find work. Having a national curriculum allows children to be able to be assessed against their peers, because they will not have the disadvantage of trying to get used to different systems.


I would like to use this opportunity to talk about education generally and how we should look further at change. We need more flexibility in where one undertakes schooling. Recently we had a situation in Tasmania where many of our country schools had come under threat of closure because of budget cuts. Suddenly there was a list of 20 schools that were earmarked for closure without any consultation with their communities or their families. (Quorum formed) It may have passed without comment in the past, but the way it was thrust onto these communities had them up in arms. Twenty school communities went out and manned barricades. They used modern tools such as Facebook for communications, and they had families from the schools together raising funds and awareness. In 18 days they achieved a ministerial backdown. The decision makers were surprised and shocked at the reaction. But the state government, although chastened, put out a message that it was not over yet. A teacher friend of mine, Ivan Webb, offered this analysis of the situation:


… 20 Tasmanian school communities are already better prepared for what is to come. These communities still have Facebook and a whole new set of knowledge, skills, experiences, networks and relationships and a clearer sense of their own identities. They have transformed their initial sense of being at the edge of chaos into something that could be very useful to all concerned—


and which needs to be sustained and developed. He went on:


Managed well, there is a close potential link between innovation and being at the edge of chaos, but it does require a change of mindset.


I cannot think of anything that the policy decision makers—government and government departments—have to enable them to match what the school communities have done in 18 days.


Admittedly the nature of the schemes has changed, particularly since the arrival of the internet and systems that are now networks, often to larger anonymous agents. Systems, including school systems, can no longer be treated as production lines with an overlay of organisational trees that describe the relative status, power and authority of those involved. Closing a school is not something that can be done on the basis of numbers; it is a complex and uncertain task with broad ramifications. Parents and communities place a very high value on the current wellbeing and long-term success of their children. When it comes to success and wellbeing, parents and communities are confident about their local schools. Their confidence in the minister, government and the department has been severely undermined.


School closures failed this time for two reasons: they were based on a very narrow discourse and they were set up as win-lose and would have resulted in a net loss. The losses to the students, their families and community would have been far greater than the modest financial gains to the government. The next step is for the lessons to be learned. This means taking advantage of the current situation to learn as much as possible and develop a new sustainable dialogue around all schools—what they are for and how to manage their futures. The important conversation we need to have is not just between some schools and the government. The fundamental fight is about how we as a state understand, talk about, utilise and value our schools and their futures: what they are, what they do and how they make things possible. And this involves all schools, communities, governments and departments. The conversation really counts, and it needs to be ongoing, not just happening when there is an urgent need for the government to reduce spending. The conversation should include the full range of direct and indirect costs, benefits, values, relationships and possibilities associated with schools. These are best captured as stories of real people in real contexts, as schools have demonstrated. This is what schools have all been gathering to share in recent weeks, and it has worked well for them.


Schools should look after their stories well. There will come a time when they will be needed again—not only for the sake of the school but also to help the decision makers make better decisions next time. Hopefully the proposed reference group will be wise enough to tap into this goldmine before it dissipates. Governments worldwide are reducing spending, and this will continue.


To be successful, the conversation needs to be open, rich and interactive—not constrained by a narrow set of terms of reference with a particular outcome in mind. It needs to lead to innovation and overall win-win outcomes, which may or may not result in some actual closures. The schools have demonstrated that this can be done. Facebook has played a key role. There are tools for enabling even more focused and productive outcomes. It is now time for ministers, governments and departments to catch up. I think we should be aware of this in the federal sphere too. There was some criticism of this government providing funds under the Building the Education Revolution—yet schools in my electorate were able to renew their education spaces for the first time in some 50 or more years.


The renewals included new technology as well as buildings. This means students are able to use interactive whiteboards as a learning tool, which not only puts a bit of fun into their learning but also means they can be in touch with other children around the state, the country and even the world to undertake learning programs as well as maths games and games with numbers.


By unwittingly providing the tools to galvanise their communities against school closures, they have also prepared their schools to go out into the community and help be part of the local economy, the driving force behind future directions. Isn't that what education is all about—preparing our children to help Tasmania thrive and develop new jobs and new directions and to build a viable future for themselves?



With the latest in digital technology, computers, laptops and videophones, children can communicate with the rest of world very easily. They do not have to move further than their classroom to catch up with the latest trends at the next big school or an equivalent school in, say, Ireland or any other country in the world. It is all there at their fingertips. Smaller schools allow greater participation in this style of reality learning. And students do not have to miss out on sporting or other extracurricular activities either— (Time expired)

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (16:22):  I rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. The bill will amend the act to repeal the current implementation date of 31 January 2012 and substitute a new provision enabling a standing regulation to prescribe a national curriculum and associated implementation time frames. This means that, subject to the passage of this bill, there will no longer be a deadline or due date in legislation from when the national curriculum is required to commence. Instead, to allow for future additions and revisions to the nation curriculum, the government is proposing that any version will need approval by the Council of Australian Governments' Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood, formerly known as the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs. The implementation time frames will be prescribed as those agreed by the standing council. 


This bill before us today is clear evidence that the Labor Party have failed to deliver on their commitment to a nation curriculum. If they had delivered on the national curriculum I would not need to stand here today before the parliament to talk to this bill. The explanatory memorandum of the bill states:


At the time of the Act's drafting in 2008, an implementation deadline of 31 January 2012 was anticipated for the development and rollout of the national curriculum across the school sector. Given the phased approach to developing the national curriculum, the extent of consultations undertaken in its development, and the need for flexibility in implementation, a legislative amendment is necessary to better accommodate this phased curriculum development and implementation process.


The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, originally said in 2008, when she was the Minister for Education, that the curriculum would take three years to develop and be ready to implement by January 2011. The Prime Minister also claimed, before the last federal election, that one of her biggest achievements was delivering a national curriculum. She made statements prior to the federal election such as: 'This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' The truth is that after nearly four years of Labor the curriculum documents for the first stage of a national curriculum, years K to 10, in the areas of English, maths, science and history still remain in draft and have not been given final approval by each of the states and territories.


Due to the well-documented bungling of a national curriculum the final version has not been approved by the ministerial council to date and most states will not even begin implementation until 2013 or 2014, so the original legislation needed changing. I also helpfully pointed out to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth earlier this year, when a one-year extension for the current funding arrangements for non-government schools was being considered by this parliament, that he would need to remove the requirement for non-government schools across Australia to implement the curriculum by January 2012. Much to my surprise he appeared to have missed that the 31 January deadline might have been a problem, or perhaps he was, as usual, asleep at the wheel. In an attempt to assist the minister for school education, the coalition sought to fix this for him and remove the 2012 start date, but he did not, inexplicably, support the coalition's amendment. 


Obviously the coalition recognises that this needs changing. Schools cannot implement a curriculum that is simply not ready or is still in draft. For this reason we will not oppose the bill. Instead, the government has had to introduce a entire new bill to fix the curriculum oversight rather than simply addressing it earlier in the year by eating humble pie and supporting the coalition's amendment. We find ourselves debating this bill because the Labor government, one of the worst in our nation's history, is incapable of delivering anything on time or on budget.


Schools need funding certainty, and for this reason we will not oppose the bill. Nevertheless, this bill has provided a further opportunity for considering how the government might be able to improve on existing arrangements related to the curriculum process.


The coalition supports a national curriculum in principle. Our concerns are not with the concept but, rather, the direction the curriculum is heading under Labor. I can assure you, Deputy Speaker Slipper, that these concerns are shared across the entire education sector. The Australian Curriculum Coalition recently wrote to me, the minister for school education and all state and territory education ministers outlining a number of concerns about the government's progress, or lack of progress. The government cannot possibly stand here today and suggest that the curriculum is going well. Please do not make us laugh with the claim that it is on schedule.


The Australian Curriculum Coalition comprises 10 peak bodies from both the government and non-government sectors. It includes the Australian Association for Research in Education, the Australian College of Educators, the Australian Council for Educational Leaders, the Australian Curriculum Studies Association, the Australian Education Union, Lutheran Education Australia, the Australian Special Education Principals Association, the Australian Professional Teachers Association, the Australian Secondary Principals Association and the Independent Education Union of Australia—not a group that you would normally see gathering together to oppose a government measure. The statement opened by saying:


The Australian Curriculum Coalition (ACC) believes that it is imperative at this midpoint in the development of the Australian Curriculum that thoughtful and considered deliberation be given to implementation of critical elements of the proposed curriculum.


It has become evident to members of the ACC that underpinning principles of the national curriculum have not been given adequate regard or sufficient resources committed to their development and that federal, state and territory governments are on the verge of endorsing a curriculum that does not meet the objective of the Australian government of: delivering a world class education system to ensure Australians are armed with the knowledge and skills to meet the demands of the 21st Century.


The letter then goes on in detail to describe each of the activities that the ministerial council promised to address last year, when the draft curriculum was being considered.


Final approval was not given to the national curriculum, as was originally planned by the government last year, due to a number of deficiencies with it. But do not just take my word for it. I will read an extract of the council's communique from December last year to make my point here, because I have noticed that the minister for school education in recent interviews on this subject has been very misleading. The council wrote:


Ministers agreed to a number of steps towards achieving the next stage of substantial implementation of the Australian curriculum by 2013. These will include:


establishing a national common approach to the achievement standards across all States and Territories, and trialling and validating that approach


states and territories developing additional material to support effective implementation of the curriculum to accommodate their different curriculum development, approval and implementation requirements


further refining and adjusting the curriculum content as a result of validating achievement standards and structured feedback from teachers


finalising a clear overarching framework that assures the place and integrity of all learning areas within the context of the overall school curriculum and different State and Territory structures


developing the curriculum content and achievement standards as required to meet the needs of special needs students


engaging with the teaching profession in the implementation of these processes to ensure comprehensive preparation for substantial implementation by 2013.


So far from the curriculum being historically endorsed, as the minister for education would try to lead you to believe, what actually happened last year was that all ministers agreed that a whole lot more work needs to be done before the curriculum can even think of being approved.


Have any of these issues been addressed nearly nine months later? Apparently not, according to the Australian Curriculum Coalition, and it will come as a shock to members of the House to discover that nine months later virtually nothing has been achieved. The Australian Curriculum Coalition made the observation:


Disappointingly neither time, resources nor political will has seen these matters seriously addressed.


They called on the federal, state and territory education ministers to immediately commit to the priority work needed to develop a genuinely 21st century curriculum by addressing the matters of concern raised by the sector and fulfil the intent on the resolution of that important MCEECDYA meeting last year. They noted:




Without this resolve, Australia is in danger of producing and adopting a national curriculum that is little more than a 
'
content revamp
'
 of mid-twentieth century curricula.



There is, however, an example of at least one minister who has acted since the Australian Curriculum Coalition's scathing letter and does have the resolve to see these issues addressed. Just last week the Hon. Adrian Piccoli, the Minister for Education in New South Wales, announced the New South Wales state government's decision to delay the introduction of the new Australian curriculum by at least a year until 2014. He acted upon the expert advice provided by the New South Wales Board of Studies that the curriculum is not yet of a high enough standard to be introduced into New South Wales. He has also suggested that federal resources for teacher professional development are needed before the curriculum can be adequately rolled out in New South Wales.


His decision has been met with widespread support from education stakeholders in New South Wales, including the NSW Teachers Federation—not know to be a friend of the coalition—and non-government school sector bodies in that state. Even the NSW Teachers Federation President, Bob Lipscombe, who has had much to say about the perceived inadequacies of the coalition over the years, has said:


The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented in NSW. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state. There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation. Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.


The Federal President of the Australian Education Union, Angelo Gavrielatos, while charming, is not known to be a supporter of the coalition's policies in education. Even he said:


We still have a series of concerns with respect to the development of the national curriculum … we're also seriously worried by the absence of any funding to support the implementation.


So the coalition and the Australian Education Union are on a unity ticket opposing the implementation of a national curriculum that is neither ready for nor married with the required resources to ensure that it can be introduced successfully. The Independent Education Union President, Chris Watt, said:


We've been saying for a long time that getting the content right is important and it looks like we might be getting towards an end point, although teachers still have not seen the final documents …


It appears the only person who does not have any concern about the national curriculum process is the hapless Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth.


If a national curriculum is to serve the learning needs of our children, the implementation process must not be hurried in the manner of the minister for school education's Home Insulation Program, or the Prime Minister's bungled schools hall program. This is just too important to get wrong. I would have thought the member for Kingston would have thought that it was time for the minister for school education to get a policy right rather than to get it in. The minister for school education was so determined to implement his pink batts program that he was prepared to do so without the necessary protections being in place for householders to ensure that they did not face burning ceilings or even the tragic deaths that eventuated out of the implementation of the minister for school's disastrous pink batts program. That program will live in infamy as one of the most unsuccessful programs in the history of this place since Federation, and yet again the minister for school education is doing the same thing with the national curriculum.


Experts agree that the content will overwhelm teachers with no funding or support for the necessary training for the rollout to succeed. And doesn't that sound familiar? They are the criticisms that the national electrical organisations made back when the minister for school education was the minister responsible for the pink batts program. They warned the minister that there was not sufficient implementation funding and that there was not sufficient training and of course we saw the tragic results that the minister for schools presided over. While he did not lose his scalp over his disastrous performance as a minister, it certainly contributed to the axing of the former Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, on that infamous day last year.


For these reasons, and because we want to try to help the government in spite of its hopeless approach, the coalition will move two amendments. The first relates to the importance of ensuring that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the Australian curriculum. That amendment states:


(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 8 to 11), omit all the words from and including ""require"" to the end of subsection 22(1), substitute:


(a) require the relevant authority for the school or system to ensure that the school, or each school in the system, implements the national curriculum prescribed by the regulations in accordance with the regulations; and


 (b) provide such funding as is necessary to ensure that each teacher in the school or system has received professional development in the implementation of the national curriculum in accordance with a nationally consistent professional development program.


Currently there is no nationally agreed or consistent approach across jurisdictions to ensure that all schools are receiving the support in the area of teacher professional learning to be able to implement the Australian Curriculum. This point was made by the Independent Schools Council of Australia's submission to the inquiry into this bill. They said:


ISCA would like to highlight the importance of ensuring that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the Australian Curriculum. Currently there is no agreed or consistent approach across or within jurisdictions to ensure that all schools are receiving the support required to implement the Australian Curriculum, particularly in the area of teacher professional learning.


Again, Deputy Speaker D'Ath, you do not need to take my word for it that this issue is only relevant to non-government schools. Unions representing teachers in government schools in Queensland and South Australia, from where the member for Kingston comes—and, in fact, from where the member for Brisbane comes—have now added their voices to the concerns of New South Wales that the necessary training and support required to implement the curriculum are not in place. Perhaps the member for Kingston, having observed the redistributed boundaries for South Australia, now believes that she is so untouchable in her seat of Kingston that she no longer has to listen to government school teachers or government school principals or the parents of children in government schools.



Ms Rishworth interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  Maybe she, like the Prime Minister, has adopted the Marie Antoinette approach to politics—which is to say, 'Let them eat cake!'—when they cannot ensure that their teachers have the adequate training and professional development. Perhaps she has adopted the approach of wondering why these people are unable to—




Ms Gambaro:
  I rise on a point of order. Madam Acting Deputy Speaker D'Ath, I draw your attention to the noise across the chamber and I ask that you bring the member for Kingston to order.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Thank you, Member for Brisbane. There has been some interjection from both sides. I ask that both sides of the chamber remind themselves that the member for Sturt has the right to be heard in silence.




Mr PYNE:
  I very much appreciate the support and protection of the member for Brisbane. The member for Kingston is becoming ever more brutish as her margin increases and she believes that she does not need to pay any attention to the voters in her electorate of Kingston.


Last week it was reported that Education Union members in South Australia have asked the state government for a 12-month delay until 2014. I have been advocating for a long time that there needs to be a clear national plan for teacher professional development and specific resources allocated by the government for this. The government's National Partnership for Teacher Quality, which provides funding for teacher support, is not explicit that funding is set aside for the purpose of supporting teachers with respect to the national curriculum.


The coalition's second amendment seeks to include clear representation of the non-government school sector with respect to decision-making processes for future time lines for the national curriculum. That would read:


(2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 11), after subsection 22(1), insert:


(1A) The national curriculum must not be prescribed unless the non-government school sector has had input into its development through membership and/or observer status on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee.


[national curriculum—non-government school sector Input]


I have written to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth previously asking that he give consideration to representation on the standing council or on its advisory officials committee, the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee. I believe that having representation at this level would be beneficial to add an extra layer of consultation on a range of issues affecting the sector and this representation would be a valuable source of strategic advice for any government in the future. This would provide a formal mechanism by which the non-government schools sector could be adequately and appropriately consulted in the lead-up to decisions regarding implementation time frames for the national curriculum.


You will note that in its submission to the House standing committee inquiry into this bill, the National Catholic Education Commission's submission notes:


…that a significant number—one in three—students in Australia attend non-government schools, and that neither national non-government school peak body has any representation on the Ministerial Council of Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs, the body that governs the work of ACARA and thus the work on the Australian Curriculum.


Having improved representation on the standing council's senior officials committee would add a safeguard that non-government schools would be adequately and appropriately consulted in the lead-up to decisions regarding implementation time frames.


It seems unthinkable to me that with the number of parents who have chosen to send their children to non-government schools—namely, one in three—they are not represented on the appropriate bodies that make the decisions in relation to education in Australia. The member for Bass comes from the state where there has recently been a crisis of confidence in the education minister. The Greens leader tried to close dozens of schools until I made a trip through Tasmania highlighting the issue and drawing attention to the failures of the state education minister. He then, within days of my leaving Tasmania, reversed his position. I am glad to see that it is still possible to put political pressure on any kind of government to ensure that they reverse a bad decision. I am glad that the minister there, Nick McKim, listened to the concerns I highlighted during my trip through Tasmania by holding public rallies and backed down from a very bad decision. I went to the member for Bass's electorate in Launceston and spoke to non-government schools there. You would think it was an important enough issue for him to lobby the minister for school education in relation to the representation of non-government schools on a national body such as this.


I do realise that 'improved representation' could also mean something as straightforward as receiving agenda papers and draft minutes from either the standing council or the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee. Nevertheless, my amendment, if adopted, would enable improved representation of non-government sector authorities on this body. If I were minister for school education, I would certainly take up the opportunity and be grateful to have representation by the non-government sector at this level. These two modest amendments would go a long way in alleviating some of the reoccurring concerns about the curriculum process and have been endorsed by non-government sector authorities, both the NCEC and the ISCA. The government need to act to address the concerns being raised over the curriculum processes. They need to act now and take action to prevent further delays to the curriculum.


Defence families across Australia are frustrated that there is still no national consistency of curriculum between the states after four years of Labor. And I know the member for Fadden has a particular interest in the defence families in his electorate and, as a former of the defence services, he knows full well the pressures that defence families are already under because of the strenuous lifestyle that they lead and the pressures and stresses under which they are placed. As the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth has pointed out there are 80,000 students that cross state borders through the period of a year. These students are depending on the minister for schools to start addressing some of the practical issues that are leading to the delay of a national curriculum in schools.


I also read the House standing committee's report on the inquiry into this bill. I noted the committee's comment that this bill is uncontroversial. While I agree with this statement in part, in that non-government schools cannot possibly be expected to implement a curriculum in a mere six months time, the events that have led to this are most certainly not uncontroversial. Unless the minister for school education starts taking some serious remedial action to save the national curriculum, many people in the sector are beginning to doubt whether it is ever going to eventuate.


I hope the crossbenchers take some time to deliberate on the coalition's suggestions for improvement and consult with the non-government sectors, who have indicated to me that they support these simple and modest improvements. I have written to the crossbenchers on two occasions outlining my amendments and seeking their support. I would remind the crossbenchers that my previous amendment on the earlier bill, which did not receive majority support, would have removed the deadline from the legislation, alleviating the need for this new change.


My amendments today are necessary as well and I hope they will receive support. I would remind the crossbenchers that, if I had been listened to previously by the government and by the crossbenchers, we would not be here listening to my speech today. Some members of the chamber might regard that as a silver lining. However, unfortunately, because of the ineptness of the minister for school education, we are here and I am needing to once again point out the inadequacies of a very weak minister, a minister who is like a pane of glass at cabinet meetings—you could look straight through him and nobody would even know he was there. Education is far too important to be in the hands of a minister who is a pane of glass and who has no influence at all on the decision-making process.


I would also point out that even though in July he was putting out press releases attacking me as the shadow minister and claiming that the Computers in Schools program was on track for delivery this year—even though we had pointed out that the government would deliver 45 per cent of the program in six months, having delivered 55 per cent in three years—the decision had already been made by the government in June that they would not be able to meet the deadline. But nobody told the minister for school education. In June the government had already decided—as shown in leaked documents that were in the Australian Financial Review last Thursday—that they would not meet the deadline for Computers in Schools this year and yet a month later the poor, old minister for school education was putting out a press release saying that it was on track and on schedule.


The problem is that nobody tells him what is going on. That was his defence when he was the minister for pink batts program. He always used to have excuses—the tram got a flat tyre or 'The dog ate my homework'. The reality is that he is not up to being the minister for school education, and it is far too important. There are 3.6 million students in schools across Australia. They are relying on the minister for school education to get it right. God help them!

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:49):  I am very pleased to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 and to associate myself with the comments made by the member for Sturt. I am pleased to support the amendments to the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill. They are a very important step in rectifying the failings that we have seen in the proposed implementation time line of the national curriculum over the last three years, and I wholeheartedly support these amendments.


I believe in a system of education that is outcomes focused and a system that enables students to achieve their full potential as functioning members of our society. In the electorate of Brisbane we have over 40 schools and we are fortunate to have a plethora of choice in government, Catholic and independent education options for our children. For many years the non-government education providers, from All Hallows—my old school—to Gregory Terrace, St Margaret's, St James, St Rita's, Clayfield College and Brisbane boys and girls grammar schools, have provided a quality education and quality service to the children of the Brisbane electorate. I am very grateful for their contribution to this great state of Queensland through their combined years of dedicated service to the community. It was good to spend some time with the school community at St Finbarrs at the Marist hall yesterday for their annual fundraiser, which saw some 500 parents, supporters and sponsors attend. It was a great event.


I have been watching the national curriculum with great interest, because every time I visit a school usually a teacher will pull me aside and wring their hands with horror and ask me what is going on. It can be as simple a question as to what is happening with the citizenship program that a number of schools participate in—and many of us see schools come to Canberra to visit us. They are quite horrified by what they are seeing in the curriculum. They ask me if the citizenship program will stay in the primary school sector, as they hear rumours going around that it will be moved to the high school level. They really do not know what is going on and they are very confused and frustrated. They have been watching this process with great frustration. That is why we are all looking with very keen interest at the national curriculum debate and why these particular amendments are very, very important, particularly for non-government schools in the Brisbane electorate and other parts of Australia. These non-government schools serve as an important avenue to provide choice and flexibility for parents on how their children are educated. If we are to accept a nationally prescribed curriculum, it is centrally important that the sector is allowed clear representation, particularly in decision-making processes for the future of the national curriculum. The curriculum is for everyone; the curriculum is for government and non-government schools. In the seat of Brisbane alone, the non-government sector and the other sectors have many hundreds of years of combined experience in teaching, learning and adjusting the way in which they instruct Australian children.


It is wrong of the government to think that they can design a national curriculum for the millions of Australian schoolchildren in a mere three years without the representation of non-government schools. This sector really deserves an opportunity to make a direct contribution to the national debate. I was a member of the previous Howard government, which had many proud educational reforms which led to the development of the national curriculum. It has been clear, however, that since 2007 the Rudd and Gillard governments have failed to listen to the key stakeholders, the stakeholders who are involved every single day in the important education of our children. A Labor government would happily take any opportunity to undermine the viability of non-government and independent school sectors in Australia, and it is just not acceptable.


However, with regard to the national curriculum, they must not ignore this important voice in the sector. The current curriculum itself stands as an ideologically-driven document that ignores the inescapable contribution of Australia's British heritage and Judeo-Christian traditions. It is important to recognise the contribution of Aboriginal history and our engagement with Asia as integral to the multicultural success of Australia's development. However, with reference to the religious institutions that I have mentioned today and their important history in religious instruction, we must also place a greater importance than we currently see regarding the influence of Judeo-Christian values in Australia, both directly and indirectly. As I mentioned earlier, choice and flexibility is absolutely important; however, they are lacking in the current curriculum.


During my time as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence—and I notice we have the shadow minister sitting at the table today—a number of defence families, particularly of the Defence Families Association, constantly highlighted to me the inadequacy of the system that saw schoolchildren unable to continue a uniform education across state boundaries and, as the member for Sturt mentioned earlier, there are some 80,000 students that cross state boundaries every year, whether they are children of defence families or doing so through interstate relocations of their families. Labor has managed to create an overly prescriptive and overloaded mess, rather than providing a clear national program that serves as a framework for the success of Australia's next generations. It burdens our schools with mandatory hours in the areas of English, mathematics, science and history. I understand the importance of these four areas, as they are absolutely fundamental in life, but the curriculum does not strike a proper balance and does not recognise the diversity of students or the diversity of interest. This lack of balance reduces the amount of time allowed to teach other areas of interest, thereby reducing the ability of schools to differentiate themselves and to provide that really important choice and flexibility in the eyes of the parents.


The current government has failed to listen to key stakeholders, including the NSW Teachers Federation President, Bob Lipscombe, who has made it quite clear that there are significant concerns in the community with regard to support that will be provided to teachers when the curriculum is finally implemented. The coalition has been listening and has listened to three stakeholders, the Independent Schools Council of Australia, the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Education Union, which have endorsed the coalition's amendments. Schools across different state jurisdictions will not be able to adapt to the new curriculum overnight, and while I understand members on the opposite side of the House have had difficulty in recent years—particularly in rolling out any programs, including national programs—it is nevertheless difficult to understand how the government has not been able to recognise the support required to implement the national curriculum in our schools.


In order to have an efficient but timely implementation that is of benefit to all students in Australia, the government must dedicate resources to provide professional development for teachers in both government and non-government schools. We need a high-quality core curriculum for all schools which is relevant, realistic, achievable and measurable, and where competency in numeracy and literacy are basic requirements. That is why I support the amendments proposed by the member for Sturt.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (16:58):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. As we know, education is the greatest opportunity for people of all ages. However, fundamentally, it provides the basic groundwork for a productive, challenging but happy future for our young people. One of the major changes to school education is the move towards a national curriculum. We on our side reflect the concerns of stakeholders at the direction that the curriculum is heading in under the Labor government, a government that is noted for its serial incompetence in delivering policies and projects in a well managed, cost-effective and efficient process.


In education alone, we have seen repeated mismanagement, be it Computers in Schools or the wasted millions of taxpayers' funds in the BER program. Then there was the discrimination we saw with youth allowance and the uncertainty around school chaplaincy. This legislation gives us even more reason to be concerned. For instance, the Prime Minister originally said back in 2008 that the curriculum would take three years to develop and would therefore be ready to implement by January 2011. Well, that has come and gone. In 2010, the Prime Minister claimed:




… the nation has been talking about having a National Curriculum for … 30 years …



and claimed she had delivered it. But the national curriculum has not been delivered. For example, the bill before the House states that non-government schools are required to implement the national curriculum by 31 January 2012—certainly a long way from the Prime Minister's claim that she delivered a national curriculum in 2010. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister has made an art form of saying one thing and doing another.


One of the most serious issues with this legislation is the failure of the government to consult and respond to key stakeholders, though you would have thought that would have been integral to managing a national curriculum—for example, the Australian Curriculum Coalition, an organisation that represents teachers, principals, school leaders, academics and education researchers. This group believes that Australian schools, their teachers and their students deserve the highest quality national curriculum, and that is what they are asking for from this government. That is a very noble and worthy intent, and I support them in that. Matters raised by the ACC mostly remain unresolved, and the ACC believes there is a lot of work that still needs to be done in relation to a national, common approach to achievement standards. There is the additional material that is needed by states and territories to support effective implementation of the curriculum to accommodate different curriculum development approval and implementation requirements; the need for a clear overarching framework; the development of curriculum content and achievement standards as required to meet the needs of special-needs students; and engagement with teachers in the implementation process.


These are basic, core requirements that the ACC has asked of the government in rolling out a national curriculum. It is this group that knows how it needs to work on the ground—how it has to work with administrators, teachers and students in the actual schools. This is just another demonstration of how the Labor government is bungling yet another program. This final version of the national curriculum has not engaged key stakeholders—and, according to its current form, most states are not estimated to begin implementation until 2013-14.


The coalition are moving two further sensible amendments, noting that Labor ignored our amendments to the previous bill back in March. I should also highlight the endorsement of these amendments by the Independent Schools Council of Australia, the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Education Union—important bodies in any discussion about education in this nation. The first amendment moved by the coalition will ensure that schools are equipped with the support and assistance they required to implement the national curriculum. This is a sensible amendment and something that is badly needed by the schools. This amendment arose from the coalition's concerns about the current lack of a nationally agreed or consistent approach across jurisdictions to ensure that all schools are receiving support in the area of teacher professional learning to enable them to implement the Australian curriculum. The second amendment we will be moving seeks to include a clear representation of the non-government school sector with regard to the decision-making process for future time lines of the national curriculum.


The coalition have a number of specific concerns with this legislation, including the insufficient representation of the non-government school sector on the relevant subcommittee reporting to the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs. We also have concerns that the curriculum is overcrowded and does not provide enough scope to recognise the diversity of students, including gifted and talented students. There are a wide range of students out there, with varying levels of need, and we need a curriculum that encompasses those needs. Our concerns extend to the manner in which the national curriculum documents are being produced and the content of these documents, not to mention the lack of stakeholder consultation and the lack of clarity around whether the material is meant to be mandatory or is designed to be a code around which jurisdictions and schools may add a local flavour. I would question whether those who will be producing this material, those in the printing and content sector, have even been consulted.


The coalition support a national curriculum in principle, but we do have major concerns about the direction in which the current curriculum is heading under the Labor government. The bill is evidence of the Labor government's routine of rushing policy through before thinking about the details and the practicalities—how it will be delivered, how it will work on the ground. None of those issues have been addressed in this legislation. As I said, there is a pattern of not being able to deliver these policies on the ground, where they matter.


As I said earlier, I believe that school education is of the utmost importance as it provides the grounds for a great future for our young people, but it does not appear that the Labor government is focused on delivering that through this legislation. I have previously raised in this House a number of the inequities the government created with youth allowance. We have seen a whole raft of different proposals by this government in relation to a range of education legislation, and it certainly has not delivered. I am hoping the inquiry by Professor Kwong Lee Dow will deliver some equity for students who were defined as living in inner regional areas. There are 10 sitting days left in which to table the report in each house of parliament. Given that sittings have resumed, I urge the minister to table the report immediately, to give students in inner regional areas who have been left in limbo some indication of what their future may hold.


This is all part of the education package that this government is failing to deliver in a way that is practical and sensible and that delivers on the ground, where it needs to, particularly in rural and regional Australia. We are determined to ensure that students in these areas are given the financial support they need and deserve, in the same way that we are determined to ensure that, through a national curriculum, students, teachers and all those who are engaged in the delivery of the curriculum have the resources they need. That is why we are making these particular amendments to this bill. They need and deserve the level of support that we are recommending through our amendments. In conclusion, I believe that people in Australia should have access to lifetime learning regardless of where they live. I support the amendments by the member for Sturt, but there are a number of concerns. I look around my electorate and see that any number of schools are affected by the national curriculum. Every school will be affected by it. I walk into their classrooms, I walk into their environments and each one of them has special needs in a different sense because they cater for a different cross-section of students. Some of them might have anything from 10 to 15 different languages spoken in their school and they have particular needs to deliver a national curriculum for students in that environment. But the teachers also have needs, and there is the need for resources. That is the basis for the amendments that we are proposing for this bill. I support the amendments by the member for Sturt and the coalition as very sensible. I encourage the government to take up these amendments. It is important that, in rolling out a national curriculum, all of the supports that are necessary to enable this to work in the schools where it is intended actually have the effect that is intended.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (17:09):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011, a bill which amends the Schools Assistance Act. The substance of this bill is quite straightforward: it amends the requirement, which presently exists under law, that non-government schools must implement the national curriculum by 2012.


Why is such an amendment necessary? Sadly, it is because we have once again seen from this government a demonstration that there is a vast gulf between its lofty ideals and frequently stated ambitions and what it actually manages to implement by stated deadlines. Let's be clear: this bill is not about whether the national curriculum is a good idea in principle. The coalition supports a national curriculum in principle. We do not have concerns with the broad concept but we have significant concerns with the direction in which the national curriculum is heading under the Gillard Labor government, and amongst our concerns are the consequences of the national curriculum—and the way it is being amended—for the independent schools sector.


In the brief time available to me, I want to make three key points. Firstly, the national curriculum process is a mess. The date, which is supposed to be met, keeps failing to be met, and overall the government is having great difficulty in achieving its targets. The second point I want to make is that the process which is being carried on and, indeed, the legislative framework are incidentally quite revealing of the underlying hostility of the Labor Party to the independent school sector. The third point is that the amendments which we have proposed seek to redress the balance and give independent schools a fair go and fair representation in the national curriculum process.


Let me turn to the first proposition which I wish to advance, which is that the national curriculum process is in a mess. It is, you may think, a surprising proposition that a process being managed by a national government should be disorganised and failing to meet the stated time lines. Sadly, as with so many other aspects of the Rudd-Gillard government's poor track record of administration and implementation, when it comes to the national curriculum, we are seeing the very same level of poor performance, poor implementation and a yawning gulf between what is promised, what is claimed and what is actually delivered.


Let me join my coalition colleagues in once again reminding the chamber of the commitment of the claim made on 15 April 2008 by the then minister for education—before she achieved her glittering and sudden ascent—when she said:




A national curriculum publicly available and which can start to be delivered in all jurisdictions from January 2011—



which, if you are following the calendar closely, you would note is in fact some seven months in the past as we speak.


As Prime Minister, the member for Lalor had this to say:




This nation
'
s talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.



Let me again join with my coalition colleagues in making the point: it has not yet been delivered. It is a statement of aspiration. The performance does not match the rhetoric, and we see this so often from this government. Who could forget the tearful farewell from the former Prime Minister listing a series of accomplishments, which so many times fell short of the claims that he made? Or I could note the recent claim by the Prime Minister in another field, telecommunications, where she is now claiming to have delivered the structural separation of Telstra. Let me assure the Prime Minister: Telstra is not structurally separated; it remains a dominant and vertically integrated company. In field after field of which, tragically, the national curriculum is one, we see this yawning gulf between the stated aspirations of this government and the sad track record of underachievement.


The current legislation, the act as it presently stands, the Schools Assistance Act, provides that non-government schools were to implement the national curriculum by January 31 2012. Against this target, it is timely to ask: what progress has been achieved to date? Phase 1, the draft kindergarten to year 10 curriculum for English, maths, science and history has been drafted by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority and a final draft will be presented to education ministers in October this year. Phase 2, covering the learning areas of languages, geography and the arts, is still under development; and a phase 3 will be required to cover the remaining learning areas identified in the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians. The curriculum for senior secondary years is one where work is only just beginning. It is quite likely that the development of a national curriculum for these years will require a very significant period.


The clear reality is that the national curriculum is nowhere near ready for implementation by 31 January 2012. What did the New South Wales Teachers Federation President, Bob Lipscombe, have to say about this? He said:




The Australian curriculum
'
s not ready to be implemented in New South Wales. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don
'
t do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state.



I might add that that is a sentiment which I have had put to me by teachers in both non-government and government schools in my electorate of Bradfield, including, for example, senior maths teachers at Normanhurst Boys High School, amongst many others.


As the House was advised earlier today, in an attempt to assist the government in dealing with this looming administrative problem, the shadow minister for education, apprenticeships and training proposed an amendment in March this year, but at that time the government minister seemed unaware of the problem and failed to support the coalition's amendment.



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr FLETCHER:
  It has been put to me that this is a minister who does not have a tremendous track record of implementation himself, as the owners of a number of houses which now lie in smouldering ruins could ruefully testify. So it is perhaps no great surprise that the notion of preparing and being ready to implement a program by the stated date of 31 January 2012 was not something that the minister and member for Kingsford Smith, for the moment, was able to do. I am shocked at the implication that a familiarity with project management and even Gantt charts were possibly not within his previous experience as a leading Australian pop music star, but that is another matter.


Let me turn to the next proposition I want to put to the House, which is that this process and this legislation reveal the underlying hostility of the Labor Party to the independent school sector. The financial impact of this bill, stated in the explanatory memorandum, makes this point very clear. It highlights that the amount of funding provided to non-government schools under the Schools Assistance Act is $8.1 billion for 2012-13, $8.8 billion for the next year and $9.5 billion for the third year. These are substantial figures and the Labor government is clearly proposing to apply a very blunt instrument whereby, if non-government schools are not able to meet the prescribed time frames, their funding is at risk.


Let me be absolutely clear: the coalition are very strong supporters of both independent schools and government schools. In my own electorate of Bradfield, we are privileged to have an outstanding group of independent schools, an outstanding group of Catholic schools and an outstanding group of government schools. I am enormously and repeatedly impressed by the work and commitment of the teachers, parents and other stakeholders in these fine institutions. I make this point: on this side of the House we recognise the synergy in education policy between having a strong independent school sector and having a strong government school sector, because we recognise, as some seem not to, that independent schools take pressure off the government school system.


We also, therefore, are very concerned that the Labor government has not made adequate provision for non-government schools to have their say regarding the national curriculum on matters such as implementation and timing, because non-government schools have not been provided with any representation on the appropriate government bodies. There is no specific non-government school representation on the standing council, nor is there any such representation on the committee of its advisory officials, the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee.


As the National Catholic Education Committee noted in its submission to the House Standing Committee on Education and Employment:




NCEC notes that a significant number—one in three—students in Australia attend nongovernment schools, and that neither national nongovernment school peak body has any representation on MCEECDYA—



the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs—




the body that governs the work of ACARA—



the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority—




and thus the work on the Australian Curriculum.



The Independent Schools Council of Australia represents a sector with 1,090 schools and around 550,000 students, accounting for almost 16 per cent of Australian school enrolments. Its executive director, Mr Bill Daniels, said in that body's submission to the House standing committee:




The non-government school sector, including at the state and territory level, should be extensively consulted on all aspects of the implementation of the Australian Curriculum including implementation timeframes.



The third point I want to make is that the amendments which the coalition have put before the House seek to give independent schools a fair voice in the national curriculum process. That is why we have moved our amendments. We note that the claims which have been made by the Labor government concerning the breadth and depth of the consultation process to date in fact tend to use that as an excuse for the fact that the national curriculum process is running late. The explanatory memorandum to the bill has this to say:




At the time of the Act
'
s drafting in 2008, an implementation deadline of 31 January 2012 was anticipated for the development and rollout of the national curriculum across the school sector. Given the phased approach to developing the national curriculum, the extent of consultations undertaken in its development …



Et cetera, et cetera—you can see the excuses forming here. But we make the point that a consultation process must adequately take account of the views of all stakeholders, and the governance processes must adequately make representation for all stakeholders. We also note that non-government school sector representatives told the House Standing Committee on Education and Employment's inquiry into the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 that they believe that the issue of appropriate representation on the Senior Officials Committee is becoming ever more significant given the expanding and developing role of the committee. Therefore, if adopted, the coalition's amendment would provide the government with an option to provide non-government school sector authorities with observer status on the Senior Officials Committee, either instead of or in addition to membership, and this could in practical terms allow non-government school sector authorities to receive agenda and briefing papers for both the ministerial standing council and the Senior Officials Committee in advance as well as draft minutes in retrospect.


Some may say that this is a modest amendment; we do not agree. We think it is an important improvement to the process which would give adequate representation to the interests of the independent school sector in what is a very important reform process which applies to every school across Australia—government schools, Catholic schools and independent schools. I have argued today that the process has not achieved administrative excellence; instead it would undoubtedly be said of the government, if it were being given a report card by one of the many excellent teachers in any one of the many excellent schools around Australia, 'must try harder—has good intentions but does not always finish his or her work', because that is the position that the government is in at the moment with the national curriculum.


It is a matter for regret that the poor administration of the national curriculum by this government makes the bill necessary. On this side of the House we have made it clear that we support the substance of the bill, but we certainly do not support not giving independent schools an appropriate voice in the curriculum process.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (17:24):  I rise to support the amendments moved by the Manager of Opposition Business, the Shadow Minister for Education, Apprenticeships and Training, the member for Sturt. In doing so I follow a very high-quality contribution from the member for Bradfield, who is keeping up the usual standard of his contributions in this place. He spoke thoughtfully about some very important concerns—the standard of education in our country and the direction that it is taking and the way the government is plans to implement the national curriculum through the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011—that are close to the hearts of many of us in this place. The member for Bradfield summed up our concerns very well in his contribution, so I do not intend to go through them in the same detail as he did. They were also placed on the record very well by the shadow minister earlier today. But I do want to touch on a couple of the issues raised and how they relate to my electorate of Mayo.


Many of us in this place understand the importance of a high-quality education. The Liberal Party has pursued policies which are about achieving standards in education for some time now. We take the view that government should try to encourage the education sector, whether it be the government sector, the Catholic sector or the independent sector, to produce students with the highest possible education standards so that they can meet the demands of industry for jobs and go off to university, if it suits them, and get a higher level of education so that they have an opportunity to create their own prosperity and improve their standard of living and the national well-being at the same time.


Obviously, standards in schools are very important in what a national curriculum sets out, and I am supporter of a standardised approach across the country so that there is some consistency. I think, though, that we have to be very careful that we do not take away from a competitive approach across the different streams and get to the point where people are being dictated to about what they can and cannot teach in their schools—there needs to be some flexibility in government's approach to the matter. The argument that the voices of non-government schools in this debate need to be heard more loudly is a very important part of the second amendment that the member for Sturt is pursuing, because there is a concern amongst parents' groups at non-government schools in my electorate that there is a pursuit by some of a political agenda through education.




Mr Lyons:
  There is.




Mr BRIGGS:
  The member for Bass over there seems to be having some entertainment at his own expense. There is a concern that, during the early stages of its drafting, the standard national curriculum has been turned into a way to indoctrinate kids in certain philosophies rather than used to give them an opportunity to get the broader education that we on this side of the House believe will ensure that they are best prepared for future opportunities within our society.


The amendment that the member for Sturt proposes will be an important step in ensuring not only that the process is kept on track—because, as the member for Bradfield observed, the minister in charge of this process has not been labelled particularly confident in his career thus far as a minister, and keeping him under watch in the implementation of the curriculum is quite an important thing to do—but also that what comes out of the drafting of the curriculum is of good quality. That is very important to those of us in this room who are going through the education journey with our own children. Parents take a great deal of interest in how their children are being taught and what they are being taught, so parents are actively engaged in and raise issues about the quality of education and the restrictions that some would like to place on it.


We know that there are members of the Labor-Green coalition government who are against the independent sector. They do not believe that the independent sector should be funded to the extent that it is, and by stealth they would like to have both the Catholic independent sectors defunded to a significant degree. There are also concerns about where the national curriculum is going, and we should be very conscious of that, because independent schools and Catholic schools provide choice for parents who want to have a values based education as well as an educational standard for their children. I know there are some in this chamber who have benefited greatly from that independent stream in their upbringing. They might have been misguided in some of the ways they went about their education and future careers from that opportunity, but they still benefited enormously from the opportunities the independent stream gave. In that respect I think people will recognise that the independent and Catholic sectors do provide those choices for parents that they should be able to provide. There are some concerns about using this national curriculum to constrain the direction that some schools would like to take in their teaching.


The amendments that the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education, has proposed are good amendments, and I am sure they are amendments that the government will support because they bring a couple of issues to bear which have not been thought out by the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. I know there will be some concern on the government side that the minister in charge has probably missed a couple of these points on the way through.


The first amendment as drafted gives additional support to the rollout of the national curriculum. It is an issue which has been raised extensively by members of the opposition, and the shadow minister has articulated a need for that change quite well. I think this is an amendment that makes much sense. We have had all sorts of claim of credit for the national curriculum being rolled out successfully: so far we have had the Prime Minister say during the election campaign:


This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.


Of course, so far we have not seen it delivered. As the member for Bradfield outlined it will not meet the 31 January 2012 deadline, so there need to be some changes made to the time lines that the government has set for itself. It is another failed delivery of a promise that it has built up. Ultimately, more than anything else, the detail of this national curriculum needs to be right; it needs to ensure it has heard all the voices and that it is not written in a prescriptive manner that is about pursuing a politically ideological agenda. It needs to be about ensuring that children come out with the best standard of education that they possibly can.


As I said earlier, the Liberal Party has for some time had a strong commitment to standards in education. Back in the 2004 election campaign we famously had the simple, plain English report card that Brendan Nelson, who was the minister for education at that point, pursued quite heavily. It was good policy and it was good politics because parents wanted information about how their children were performing and they wanted it in a simple fashion. They wanted to be told how their children were achieving and how their children were going at school in a way the parents understood so that they were part of the education journey with their children. It is ultimately a very important aspect of education that the parents are engaged and are part of the education journey along with the school.


Again, this gets back to a concern that some have that the curriculum being pursued is to be very specific and focused on a political perspective rather than on a broader education. In that respect, I note that the IPA, the Institute of Public Affairs, has raised some concerns about the direction of some of the early drafting of the curriculum regarding a very heavy focus on Indigenous and Asian culture, without similar weight being given to our British heritage, our Western values or our Judeo-Christian traditions, which are so important to the fabric of our society and the fundamentals of where we have come from and where we will continue to go. This is an important aspect which has been forgotten. In their contribution the IPA has raised some very important points, which should be considered as a reason for increasing the size of the committee to have that non-government voice as part of this consideration in the first place. So there is a broader consideration that the voices of the 30 or 40 per cent of parents who choose to go through the non-government Catholic education sector are heard in these deliberations.


Ultimately, we want a national standard across the education field. We want to ensure that the differences in the standards of education between states are reduced as much as possible. But I do not think we want to standardise completely the opportunities for schools to exercise their ability to teach, and to achieve the standards they wish to achieve, in their own special way and through their own special contribution. In that respect we support the objects of the bill, but we think there are a couple of points where we can improve it. We hope that the government will see the wisdom in following our two proposed amendments. They are good amendments which will improve this bill and ensure that this minister, who we know so far has not had a glittering career of delivering policy, does not do the same to our education system as he did to pink batts.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-08-22,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (17:35):  The coalition supports the national curriculum in principle. It is a good idea. It is necessary. Many people in my Riverina electorate have told me how confusing and frustrating it is when they move from or to another state and there is inconsistency with what is being taught and at what year level. This is particularly prevalent for children of transient workers such as those who work in some agricultural pursuits, who follow the picking seasons, and also those in military families who frequently move from base to base. As a tri-service defence city, Wagga Wagga has many people who fall into the latter category. For them, a national curriculum would be welcome.


The coalition's concerns regarding the national curriculum are not with the concept but rather its direction under Labor. When the Prime Minister was Minister for Education in 2008 she said a national curriculum would take three years to develop and be ready to implement by January 2011. Under the current legislation, non-government schools are required to put the national curriculum into place by 31 January 2012. As with anything Labor touches, the whole thing has been mucked up. Just like the rapscallion schoolboy who tells the teacher a dog ate his homework, the current Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth also gets an F for failing to deliver on Labor's commitment. The final version of the national curriculum is yet to be approved, and most states will not introduce it until 2013 or 2014. The original legislation therefore needed adjusting. The coalition sought to make the necessary amendments back in March, but the minister was apparently unaware that this presented a problem and did not support our amendment. Schools cannot put in place a curriculum which is not ready—not anywhere near ready. This bill is proof positive that Labor has not delivered on its commitment. During last year's election campaign the Prime Minister claimed, obviously falsely, that the national curriculum was finished. She made statements such as:


This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.


When, Prime Minister?


The coalition's amendments have now been endorsed by the Independent Schools Council of Australia, the National Catholic Education Commission and the Independent Education Union. The coalition noted advice from non-government school sector authorities to the House inquiry into the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 that the issue of appropriate representation on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee is becoming increasingly important given the emerging task of the committee. This is especially so relating to the national curriculum. If adopted, the coalition's amendment would provide the government with an opportunity to provide non-government sector authorities with 'observer status' on the AEEYSOC instead of or in addition to membership. This could permit, for instance, non-government sector authorities to receive agenda and briefing papers for both the standing council and AEEYSOC in advance, as well as draft minutes in retrospect. We hope the government will adopt this necessary and reasonable amendment to enable non-government sector authorities to make much more informed and better targeted contributions to the national debate. Further, it would ensure that they would be appropriately consulted regarding time lines for introduction of the national curriculum. This is wholly appropriate. This amendment is significant given that the number of parents who have chosen to send their children to non-government schools are not represented on the appropriate bodies which make the decisions in relation to education in this nation. This is unfair and needs to be altered. The coalition amendment also provides for a broad, appropriate teacher development strategy for the national curriculum. Although this bill relates only to non-government schools, we also advocate that professional development to teachers should be available across the whole schools sector.


The draft K-10 curriculum for the subject areas of English, mathematics, science and history has been prepared by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, and Labor intends to present a final draft to education ministers this October for approval at ministerial council. The coalition is deeply concerned about some of the ideological undertones which are pervading the curriculum. The coalition is deeply concerned about the overly prescriptive nature of the draft document. Experts in education agree the content will swamp teachers, with no funding or backup for the required training for the rollout to succeed. These fears are shared by key stakeholder groups, including teacher representatives and professional associations.


As a result, the coalition has moved two vital amendments. Firstly, schools will need to be provided with the appropriate level of assistance and support to introduce an Australian curriculum. Secondly, we seek to include clear representation of the non-government school sector in the decision-making processes for future time lines of a national curriculum. Presently there is no national or consistent approach to making sure all schools are getting the support they so desperately need in teacher professional learning to be able to implement an Australian curriculum. Having adequate representation adds a safeguard that non-government schools would be properly consulted in the lead-up to decisions regarding implementation time lines. These two modest amendments will certainly help smooth this challenging reform process and bring some level of fairness to the debate.


For the Prime Minister to say that she has already delivered a national curriculum is a case of her getting ahead of herself—way ahead of herself. New South Wales Teachers Federation President Bob Lipscombe said only recently, on 10 August: 


""The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented in NSW. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state … There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.


""Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.""


Now we know that the decision to delay the new curriculum has irked the education minister. He accused New South Wales of 'letting students down' and walking away from its commitment. 'There is no justifiable reason for this 11th-hour backdown,' the minister said.


At the heart of this issue is the cost of getting teachers ready for the new curriculum. The New South Wales Minister for Education, Adrian Piccoli, said it would cost about $80 million over four years to implement the curriculum and to provide professional development of teachers. If Mr Piccoli said New South Wales is unwilling to run with the national curriculum agenda because federal Labor has not done due diligence on funding and support then that would be correct. The New South Wales education minister is the member for Murrumbidgee, much of which is in the federal seat of Riverina. He was a competent shadow education, skills and youth affairs spokesman from 28 December 2008 right through the dying days—excuse me—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
):  Who's dying? Sorry.




Mr Lyons:
  Who's dying?




Mr McCORMACK:
  The state Labor government—that's who was dying! He held that position right through the dying days of the inept state Labor government and held a poor party to account for its mismanagement. He is doing a fine job as minister, and I commend him for that and for his genuine care and concern for the education of today's children—surely our greatest resource.


The state government said on 9 August it would postpone implementation of the national curriculum for 12 months because of the federal Labor government's failure to provide teacher development funding and questions about its quality. That quality is gravely concerning. One hopes a national curriculum is not used as a vehicle for Labor to push its propaganda. Disturbingly, according to a 13 March report in the Daily Telegraph:


PRIMARY school children are being terrified by lessons claiming climate change will bring ""death, injury and destruction"" to the world unless they take action. 


On the eve of Prime Minister Julia Gillard's carbon tax package announcement, psychologists and scientists said the lessons were alarmist, created unneeded anxiety among school children and endangered their mental health.


Climate change as a ""Doomsday scenario"" is being taught in classrooms across Australia. Resource material produced by the Gillard government for primary school teachers and students states climate change will cause ""devastating disasters"".


…   …   …


Australian National University's Centre for the Public Awareness of Science director Dr Sue Stocklmayer said climate change had been portrayed as ""Doomsday scenarios with no way out"".


Dr Stocklmayer said she was not a climate-change sceptic but worried that ""too much time was spent presenting scary scenarios, especially to young people"".


""(Children) feel incredibly despondent and helpless in the face of all this negative information,"" she said. ""To put all of this before our children … is one of the most appalling things we can do …




Mr Lyons:
  Like listening to the Liberal Party.




Mr McCORMACK:
  I will take the member's interjection, but what I say even includes Tasmania. The article continues:


Child psychologist Kimberley O'Brien also said the language of climate change should be ""toned down"".


Of course, the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth refuses to stop the teaching of Labor's climate science, despite moves in Britain for the subject to be withdrawn. But, then, this government also refused to stop the wasteful spending on school halls when it was plainly obvious to all and sundry it was a fiasco, a taxpayer rip-off in the order of a disgraceful $6 billion. At least the coalition's Investing in Our Schools program injected real and meaningful money into grateful schools—



Mr Lyons interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  including in Tasmania. Funding is an important issue as far as education is concerned. Recently, the Director of Schools in the Catholic Education Office, Wagga Wagga, Mr Alan Bowyer, was moved to respond in a media statement to concerns that funding would be cut and media reports that funding would be cut by this Labor-Greens alliance. The statement reads:


In responding to enquiries from a number of media representatives, Mr Bowyer declared, ""We believe that a fair, equitable and certain funding scheme for all schools is vital for the continued growth and expansion of quality learning and teaching for all Australian students and teachers"".


That is something I am sure all people in this place would agree with. It continues:


""Our belief is that education is a basic entitlement and all students, whether they attend a Catholic, an independent or a state school, have the right to be funded by government at a level that provides a balanced, rigorous and properly resourced education"", Mr Bowyer said. ""No parent should be financially penalised as a result of choosing to send their children to Catholic schools in accordance with their religious beliefs and commitment to the Church"".


I say: hear, hear!


Mr Bowyer stated that figures taken from the National Report on Schooling in Australia (2008) clearly indicate that Catholic schools and non-government schools in general, are under-funded when compared with state schools. ""While a student in a state school, on average, in 2007-08 received $12,639 in funding from state and federal governments for the year, the figure for a Catholic school student was only $7,685. Productivity Commission figures in 2009 show that the amount for public school students was a little less – $11,874 per student while the amount per child in the independent sector remained steady"", he said.


""School funding is a complex issue. State governments are the primary source of recurrent funding for schools and provide approximately 93% of public school costs but only about 17% of non-government schools costs. The Federal government provides top up assistance of approximately 7% to public schools and about 53% to non-government schools resulting in the need for non-government schools to charge school fees to address the gap. Catholic systemic schools endeavour to keep school fees as low as possible to ensure Catholic education is affordable for families, but school fees as such, only partly contribute to the funding gap between what is received from government sources and the true costs of schooling …


Mr Bowyer went on to reveal that 704,000 (20%) students attend Catholic schools across Australia, and stated that these schools employ 78,000 staff. He said that in 2010 in NSW, 66 per cent of students attended public schools, 22 per cent of students went to Catholic schools and 12 per cent attended independent schools.


""It should be remembered that many Catholic schools, which dominate the non-government school sector in terms of enrolments, serve disadvantaged communities made up of migrant and working-class families and those living in remote and rural Australia"", Mr Bowyer said. ""In some areas, the Catholic school is the only school serving the local community"".


Mr Bowyer welcomed the opportunity that organisations had to make submissions to the Gonski Review and said he was reassured by the Prime Minister's promise that, ""this is not about taking money away from schools"" and that ""no school will lose a dollar of funding, in the sense that their school budget per student will not reduce in dollar terms"".


I certainly do hope that the Prime Minister lives up to those words; I certainly do hope that Labor does not listen to the Greens and cut or freeze Catholic school funding, because it is all about choice, and in Australia we should have that choice. If a parent wants to send their child to a Catholic school they should be able to do so, with the knowledge that that schoolchild will be funded properly and sufficiently so that they receive a good and fair education. There should be fair and equitable funding right across the school education system.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2011-08-22,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (17:50):  In rising to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill, I am reminded of the purpose behind our education system. Regardless of how we build the system and how we operate the system, the desired outcome remains the same—to help future generations to learn. Following the member for Riverina's comments, I want to endorse some of the remarks he made at the end of his contribution with regard to Catholic and private schools. I have always been of the belief that taxpayer funds are for the children, for the students, and it really should not matter which school they attend.


Every bill that comes before this parliament should, in some way, enhance education and learning outcomes for future generations—and I am talking about all students here. I believe the coalition's amendments to this bill will do that. But we cannot expect our children to learn if the system's builders and operators demonstrate a fundamental inability to learn, if they are unable to learn the easiest lessons of all—and that is learning from one's own mistakes. Such a flaw would undermine the system. It would undermine the outcomes. It would deliver for future generations a standard lower than they deserve.


What we have in the bill before us is a warning that the current government is simply not capable of learning from its own mistakes. It is not for the want of opportunity. They have created more than their fair share of learning opportunities—or mistakes. Amongst an extensive back catalogue of these learning opportunities, we find familiar themes. There are common threads. These threads suggest that, if only a small number of lessons could be learnt by the government, a large number of future stuff-ups could be avoided.


The troubling thing is this. We can see the problems coming. We can see that the national curriculum and how it is going to be implemented have not been properly thought through. We know what happens as a result, because we have seen it happen one too many times during this current government. It is troubling because we can see it coming but the government cannot. It is like being a passenger in a car doing 200 kilometres an hour who can see the approaching cliff when the driver is too busy looking in the vanity mirror.


It is troubling because we can see yet another knee-jerk reaction in the pipeline. We can see a government going off half-cocked because they are so desperate to make it look as if they have actually done something. They are so desperate, in fact, that they do not even wait until the job is half done before claiming that it is finished. With this Schools Assistance Amendment Bill in mind I might remind the House that the Prime Minister said on 2 July last year: 


This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it. 


That was more than a year ago. There has still been nothing delivered, and that is why we are here debating this bill almost 14 months later, and implementation is still a speck on the future horizon. 


In addition to its concerns about delayed delivery the coalition also has serious concerns about exactly what is being delivered and how it is going to be delivered. That is why we have moved important amendments—amendments that we hope can stop this runaway car before it reaches the cliff.


We need the government not only to allow input from the appropriate sources but to listen to that input—to take in advice and admit to themselves that people and organisations outside the Labor Party and the Greens, people working in the education system and with the education system, might actually know what they are talking about. Because what this government thinks it is going to deliver as a national curriculum is nothing to skite about; it is something that should be cause for deep embarrassment.


The coalition believes that a delay in implementation is necessary. That is why we have sought previously to pass a similar bill. A delay in implementation of the national curriculum is necessary because it could be a very, very long time before this government could get the national curriculum right. The implementation of this national curriculum has all the loose threads—all the warning signs, all the hallmarks—of the multitude of miserable failures this government should have learned from. This government should have learned that what happens when you make promises you are not capable of delivering is something like the failed computers in schools program. There is a strong parallel between the Prime Minister claiming a year ago that she had delivered a national curriculum and the promise that computers would be delivered to every high school student by the end of 2011. In June this year, only 55 per cent of the computers had been rolled out, and that has taken three years to do. 



Mr McCormack interjecting—




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  That leaves the government another six months to roll out the remaining 45 per cent which, the member for Riverina reminds me, is missing. But that was never going to happen. Even the education department knew that was not going to happen. The only problem is, they never told the minister for education that it was not going to happen, because a month later the minister was still telling us the program was on track and on schedule.


The government has a proven track record of inability to deliver. But here they are, bragging about having delivered a national curriculum that is still miles away from completion. The government should have learned that what happens when you do not fully think things through is that you end up with a debacle like the overpriced school halls that picked the pockets of Australian taxpayers and ripped off state government schools. Did anyone ever sit down and think about how these school halls would be delivered, who would build them, how they would build them, how they would price them and how fair value would be measured? The result was a disastrous waste of money—money that should have created much greater benefit for our education system.


But here they are, skiting about having delivered a national curriculum when there is still no real plan as to how it is going to be delivered. The government should have learned that what happens when you do not consider the implications of a shoddy implementation plan is a pink batts scheme. If you create an environment where people are not properly trained for what they are supposed to do, not given clear guidelines on how to perform their task and not given the support they need to do their job, you have to expect a degree of failure. That should be a lesson learned from the pink batts program. But here we are, putting together a national curriculum content that will leave teachers ill-equipped for implementation. They will be overwhelmed with the size and scope of the task. There is inadequate provision for training and support and there is a distinct lack of clear guidelines to follow.


The government should have learned that what happens when you are led down the garden path by a minority interest is that you lose sight of the big picture. You end up pandering to a single entity with a minority view point. You end up pushing pokies legislation that is hated by millions of people just to garner the support of a single person. But here we are, creating content that is so ideologically skewed that it pushes every cultural context except reality.


The national curriculum in its current format goes to great lengths to add weight to minority views, Indigenous culture and Asian culture without equal weight for the dominant British heritage and Judaeo-Christian traditions on which this country was founded. I am not opposed to including such content in the curriculum. Indigenous culture is a very important component of modern Australian culture. Our country's geographical ties to Asia also need to be recognised, but these influences must be viewed, as they are in the real world, through the framework of our overwhelmingly British heritage and dominant Judaeo-Christian traditions. These are the foundations of Australian society. They are the foundations of the world our children live in. They are the foundations that have built our language—the language that our teachers will be using to educate our children. To ignore these foundations would be no less a failure than to completely ignore Indigenous and Asian culture.


These concerns about the content of the national curriculum are concerns held not just by the coalition; they are views shared by key stakeholders. Dr Kevin Donnelly, the director of the Melbourne based Education Standards Institute, said that he too could see this coming. He said:


I can see that my fears about the new curriculum were well founded.


He described the content as:


… a heady mixture of politically correct perspectives: sustainable, indigenous, feminist, class, postmodern and cultural relativist. 


He shares the view that it is only through the context of our Western heritage that we can understand our legal system, our political system, our language, our literature and our education. We have to question why someone would sit down and develop a national curriculum that goes to great lengths to ignore the terms BC and AD to indicate years simply because BC stands for 'Before Christ'. We must not mention the C-word. No, they thought it would be better to use the term BCE: 'Before common era'. That is rewriting history at its best.


Not content with rewriting history, this government is supporting a national curriculum that gives a fantastic outline of the Labor Party but conveniently neglects to balance the outlines of the Liberal and National parties. That is serious. That is in the national curriculum. Perhaps if the people on the ground were given the opportunity for input and the government took the time to put its ego in a box long enough to listen to what the people were saying it would avoid such embarrassment. 


The government should have learnt. They still are not listening to what people are saying about the carbon tax and it just makes people angrier—and we saw it today. It makes people more determined to force an election by any means possible. They need to avoid that personality flaw here and allow for more voices into the national curriculum formulation. In the time afforded by the extension of this deadline, the government should accept their own shortcomings and actively seek advice from those who really do know better. Including a representative from the non-government schools on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee would be a very good start, because so much of the future depends on our education system.


The lives of generations to come will be hugely shaped by the education that we provide now for our young people. It is of great concern to me that such an important part of our society is now in the hands of this government, Labor and the Greens, who clearly demonstrate that they are most incapable of learning themselves. I really do hope that this curriculum is delayed so that we can have some balance and we can get it right, because if we do not get this right it will not be the government that suffers but the children—that is, until we reach the ballot box.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (18:02):  Mr Deputy Speaker, it is always a pleasure to see you in the chair and I hope you are well today.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Sidebottom
):  Thank you.




Mr TEHAN:
  In speaking on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 this evening, I will start by reading a quote out because sadly it sums up where we are at with this legislation. It comes from the President of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, Bob Lipscombe:


The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented in New South Wales. We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards in this state …


There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.


Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.


Mr Lipscombe said that on the ABC news on 10 August 2011. He spoke not only for New South Wales but also for the states and territories of the Commonwealth because sadly, as we stand here this evening debating the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011, we see that the national curriculum is not ready to be implemented.


The coalition supports a national curriculum in principle. We are not concerned with the idea. We are sadly concerned, though, once again with how it is being implemented by the Gillard government. This dates back to 2008 when Julia Gillard, our current Prime Minister, said it would take three years to develop and implement. That was in 2008—three years ago—and it would be ready to go by January 2011. If I am not mistaken, it is now August 2011 and here we are debating this bill.


It is ironic that the coalition sought to amend the legislation when it was initially put so that we could look at a start date of 2013 or 2014 and the government would not allow our amendment, yet here we are having to look at either a 2013 or a 2014 start date. It shows that, once again, this government is lacking when it comes to implementation. Although it has been quoted by pretty much every speaker that has been before me on our side, it is worth reminding the House what the Prime Minister said during the election campaign: 'This nation's talked about a national curriculum for 30 years. I've delivered it.' Sadly, she has not and it is going to take some time yet.


If it is to be delivered in a way that is meaningful and does the right thing by schools in this country, it is going to need some change. That is why, in a very positive and bipartisan way, the coalition is putting forward two amendments to help improve the government's legislation, to show the government the way. It is often said—I must say wrongly—that we are negative in the approach that we take. Here we are being extremely positive. We are offering two sensible amendments to show the government the error of its ways and asking it to take them on board to improve the legislation that it is putting forward. It will be very interesting to see what the government does with this positive approach that we are putting forward. The two amendments we are putting forward make a lot of sense. The first relates to the importance of ensuring that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the Australian Curriculum. You would have thought that you would take that sort of assistance for granted—that schools would be granted support to implement. I would have thought that that is as logical as day following night. Sadly, it does not seem to be the case with this government. We are putting forward an amendment which would see that happen. We would see teachers getting the support that they need to implement the curriculum. Teachers would have the confidence to say: 'We are going to be teaching a national curriculum in maths, in English or in science. We know exactly what that curriculum is about. We know exactly how students need to be taught. Therefore, we have confidence going into the classroom and making sure all students across Australia get the teaching that they need to develop and go on and be wonderful individuals.' That is a very positive contribution to this debate and to this legislation, and I hope that it will be one that the government will take on board.


Our second amendment seeks to include clear representation of the non-government school sector with respect to decision-making processes for future time lines of the national curriculum. I would just like to point out to the government and to the education minister in particular—and the one that went before him—that there are actually two types of education that we have in this country. There is a very good government sector and there is a very good non-government sector. We do not just have one sector. Therefore, if we are to get balance in the way the national curriculum time lines are to be set, about what the character of those guidelines should be, about what should be in the curricula, it would only be wise and fair that both the non-government and government sectors can play a part in doing that. If a national curriculum is to serve the learning needs of our children then we should ensure that it does it for those children who are learning in the non-government sector as much as we do it for those students learning in the government sector. 


These are two what you would call positive, modest amendments—ones which will go a long way to alleviating the recurring concerns about the curriculum process. When you look at the detail that has been in the curriculum, or the overarching framework which has been set out, there have been concerns. Our two amendments will address them. The government should do the right thing and take them on board.


I would like to point out two particular flaws that the curriculum has in it. I think most of the speakers on our side who have been before me have touched on these, because I think they are fairly important. Sadly, Labor's curriculum is driven on ideological grounds. For example, in the history component, the Labor Party and union movement is included but there is no mention of the Liberal or National parties or the parties on the conservative side of politics that went before them. Imagine if we were developing the national curriculum and we put forward that it would only address the history of the United Australia Party, the National Party, and the Country Party that came before it, and the Liberal Party. Could you imagine the outrage if we left the union movement and the Labor Party out? The other side would be just ballistic in their rage if we did that. Yet they have the gall to do it here. It just beggars belief that they could do such a thing.


The worst thing about it is it highlights what they are about here. It is not about a national curriculum which is about teaching our students across the country maths, science and English in a uniform way; sadly, there is a deeper desire here, and that is to drive the ideology through our students. I would hope that Labor would be able to look at this and say: 'This is not the right way to teach the young people of this country. We need to provide balance.' They should put themselves in our shoes from a moment and say: 'Yes, look, if the reverse was done, we would have problems with that. We need to address this.' And I hope that they will.


The second point that I would like to make about this national curriculum as it has been developed so far by this government is that it is overcrowded. There is an excessive amount of content to be covered in courses, which means less flexibility for schools. I would have thought in the 21st century we should have been looking to put more flexibility into our schools, not less, by giving our teachers the freedoms to be able to operate within their classrooms by giving them an outline of what needs to be addressed but not detailing every last sentence. If you are trying to drive an ideological agenda maybe, because you would say: 'You have to talk about the Labor Party and the union movement. You have to talk about those things. Of course, don't worry about the other side.' It is overly prescriptive. We need to pull back from that. We have to allow teachers and our principals to be able to go about doing the things that they do best. They need the flexibility to be able to do it. I hope we will get a pullback from that overly prescriptive approach, because our students across the country will benefit from it, our teachers will benefit from it, our principals will benefit from it, and our whole education system will benefit from it. If we continue to be too prescriptive the national curriculum will not do the job it is meant to do.


I would like to draw my speech tonight to a conclusion. So it is nicely rounded, I would like to go back to where I started, which is the quote from Bob Lipscombe, because I think that quote, although it is on behalf of the New South Wales education sector, reflects what the concerns are across the country as a whole:


The Australian curriculum's not ready to be implemented … We must be careful to ensure that when we do implement it we don't do it in a way that undermines the already high curriculum standards …


There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.


Until these questions are addressed by the Federal Government, then a delay is quite appropriate.


The Prime Minister is on the record as saying: 'This nation's talked about a national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' She has not delivered it.


We have to make sure that her embarrassment of not having done that does not mean that we rush our implementation now. Our kids' futures are at hand. A lot of us here have students who are going through the schooling process at the moment. We want this to be done correctly. The coalition, in a very positive manner, have put forward two amendments—two positive approaches—to try to fix the mess that the implementation of this bill is likely to create. I hope the education minister will take those two amendments on board. I hope the Prime Minister will see the positive approach on which they have been put forward and see that this is being done to improve the educational outcomes of our children and to make sure that our schools, our teachers and our principals have the right guidelines going ahead. The coalition support the idea of a national curriculum. What we do not support is the way this government is going about it.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (18:17):  I rise tonight to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011; a bill that seeks to address a rather unfortunate oversight by the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, and one twice raised in this place by the shadow minister for education, but only now sought to be fixed by the minister. The oversight referred to is the implementation date of the national curriculum—currently set for commencement in just five months time for non-government schools. This sounds like a noble goal, but it is terribly hard to implement a curriculum that is yet to be finalised.


The shadow minister first raised the concern about the implementation deadline for non-government schools in November last year, and earlier this year repeated calls for a simple amendment to be legislated to remove this unreachable deadline. The reforms for a national curriculum—initially promised to be implemented by January 2012—have drifted and been left incomplete by a government well known for its inability to implement programs on time or on budget have start dates now pushing out to 2013 or 2014 and a legislative deadline rapidly approaching. This bill should have been unnecessary. But for the pigheadedness of those opposite in not understanding the problems in their own legislation, the problems this bill seeks to address would have previously been addressed.


Nonetheless, the fact that the national curriculum is yet to be finalised did not, of course, prevent the current Prime Minister from proclaiming on 2 July last year: 'This nation's talked about a national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.' One might have assumed that if a national curriculum had indeed been 'delivered' then an eraser would not have been needed to rub out the error riddled legislation the Prime Minister put forward back in 2008 when she was the education minister standing behind the former Prime Minister.


Ironically, the Prime Minister claimed to have 'delivered' the national curriculum, despite falling far short of doing so by the January 2012 deadline—as we see by the need for this amendment. The Prime Minister claimed to have 'delivered' the curriculum she has not delivered, just as she promised to the Australian people she would not deliver a carbon tax and is now doing so. No wonder, today, we find a 'convoy of no confidence' on our doorstep that has travelled to Canberra from across the nation to send a clear message to this incompetent government: the Australian people want an election now.


Let us be clear: this government is rushing through a national curriculum not for any good educational reasons but simply for a political reason to enable the Prime Minister to live up to her claim that she has delivered it. Simply, the Prime Minister is prepared to compromise children's education for a simple political purpose. What a disgrace!


Although the coalition broadly supports the intent of having a national curriculum, naturally, particularly under this government, we are deeply concerned about the looming implementation stage. This is especially of concern with a new minister who, as minister for the environment, rushed through an incompetent and poorly thought out program which will go down in our nation's folklore—a program that managed to burn down some 190 homes. We certainly do not want that performance repeated on our nation's schools or on a national curriculum simply because it has to be rushed through.


I would like to air a few broad points relating to the implementation of a national curriculum—or, if you would like, the important narrative and required elements behind the move to a national curriculum. Firstly, we must not allow a race to the bottom. In my home state of New South Wales, we already have a robust curriculum, developed over decades. The last thing we want to do in New South Wales is go backwards with our children's education. I have spoken to a great many teachers in my local area that are keeping a keen eye on the development of the national curriculum, yet they remain cautious about the dangers the implementation of the national curriculum may have and how it may have the potential to water down the high standards already in place in New South Wales. For the national curriculum to produce the results that the country has asked of it, it must look to the future and not backwards into the past. There must be an assessment of the needs of our country, and we must look to where it will be in years to come and present our children with a system that will meet their needs in the future and not lock them into the ways of the past. We will gain nothing and lose much if the national curriculum fails to provide for the future. This is why it cannot and must not be rushed. It is also worth noting that across New South Wales and the rest of Australia many schools who are doubtful of the quality of the national curriculum are considering alternatives for their students, such as the benchmarking International Baccalaureate program. In the past, the New South Wales Higher School Certificate has been recognised across the globe as being a first-class finishing qualification, and the move to a standardised curriculum could see this standing ruined in the eyes of the world.


The second crucial point to recognise is the important role that all sectors in the education system play in developing our children as well-rounded young adults. The national curriculum, if not established in the correct manner, with all the relevant checks and balances satisfied, could endanger the tireless work of the many great teachers of New South Wales. These teachers, who are responsible for teaching the future of our great nation, should not be sold short and forced to teach to exams. Instead, they should be allowed and encouraged to uphold the high standards that are currently evident in New South Wales. Time and time again, we have seen the failure of Labor ideology, the ideology of a deluded belief in centralised control of decisions by a small group of elite, when our history has shown, time and time again, that the best decisions are always made by people working at the coalface. We therefore should not implement a system that would tie the hands of our world-class educators and possibly cause a drop in our educational standards.


Non-government schools are a crucial pillar of our education system in Australia. Without these educational institutions, some of which are over a century old, our education system would not be able to meet the demands of our population. In fact, if government funding to these schools were to be cut, the resulting burden on the state system would mean the collapse of our world-class education system. Over the past decade, class sizes in secondary schools have increased, and in some cases there are now 45 students to one teacher. Without non-government schools, this number could very easily increase still further, reducing the quality of education for all. Within my electorate of Hughes, there are many schools, government and non-government, all which are great schools filled with dedicated teachers who are teaching the next generation of Australians. I have been out and about, visiting local schools, and these visits have reinforced the importance of our work in this key area. We simply cannot get these reforms wrong through rushing them through. We must not let any of these teachers or students down by pushing them into a framework that is not ready and is not able to deliver them the results that they deserve for their hard work.


While the coalition will not oppose this bill, due to the obvious need for the parliament to act on what the coalition has been saying since November last year, it is not possible to implement a curriculum that is yet to be finalised. The coalition will seek to make two important amendments to enhance the progress of the reform, to deliver reform that works and that does not let our kids and their dedicated teachers down. I call on all members opposite to look deep inside themselves and to consider these amendments carefully. Do any of you really want to carry the burden of knowing that you had a choice to improve this bill and this program and chose not to for political expediency? There is a deep black hole in the current national curriculum proposal, and that is a complete lack of assistance in implementing the reforms. Currently, there is no nationally agreed or consistent approach across all jurisdictions to ensure that schools are receiving support in the area of professional development to enable teachers to implement a new national curriculum. Our amendment will rectify this to ensure a smooth transition into practice. We must offer our education professionals the training and support that they will need to implement this big change in Australia's educational system. We must not lock out teachers who work for non-government schools and, as a result, cause their students to suffer, hurting Australia's future in the process.


Our second amendment seeks to include representation from the non-government school sector in the decision-making process for future time lines of the national curriculum, providing the non-government sector with a seat at the table which they have not had to this point. This is likely a key reason why the government has thus far appeared unaware of the implementation time frame problem sought to be rectified by this bill. The government's failure to provide the non-government school sector with a seat at the table in the implementation of a national curriculum is a stark reminder of the bad old days of Mark Latham's infamous hit list, heartily supported by many members opposite during those dark days. By locking the non-government sector out of the decision-making process, we will lose the expertise and wisdom of some of the country's best and greatest educators, who want nothing more than the best education for our students. Instead of knocking down our system to the lowest common denominator, we should be seeking to raise our schools up, and to do this we should be asking for input from all educational institutions, not just those run by government.


The coalition's proposed amendments are crucial to ensuring a smooth and successful implementation of the national curriculum, and while the performance of the government in this area has been weak at best, particularly in failing to recognise and act with the coalition to address the government's failures in the implementation of the national curriculum and subsequent legislative issues such as those we are having to address with this bill, I feel it is important to review what stakeholders are saying about these important coalition amendments. The President of the NSW Teachers Federation has spoken of concern about the lack of support for the implementation of the curriculum, which the coalition amendments would address. On 10 August this year he said:


There are issues around the overarching framework it fits in and importantly there are also issues around the resourcing that will be put in place to support its implementation.


Certainly, the coalition agree the government is failing to support our teachers to implement the national curriculum. We encourage those opposite to support our amendment on this key issue.


The President of the Australian Education Union also shares this position, having said previously:


… we're also seriously worried by the absence of any funding to support the implementation.


And, as previous speakers have canvassed, the Independent Education Union has described our amendment to provide a seat at the table for the non-government school sector as 'an important step forward' and an amendment 'that should be supported by all parliamentarians'. The amendments to be moved by the coalition are good and sensible. I encourage those opposite to support these reasonable moves to improve the implementation of the national curriculum.


In conclusion, there has been a lot of discussion regarding the overly prescriptive, biased and ideological content of the national curriculum, but I will not go into that in detail. However, as a previous speaker stated, I do understand the Labor Party and the union movement are included in this new national curriculum, whereas the Liberal Party have been left out. As a previous speaker noted, could we imagine if the reverse applied? We would not hear the end of the screams. I do not have any particular problem if the Labor Party and the union movement are included in the national curriculum—that is the way this current government is going. I simply suggest that these subjects belong in the ancient history curriculum.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (18:31):  I rise to speak on the Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011. This bill seeks to repeal the 31 January date for the implementation of the national curriculum in non-government schools as outlined in the Schools Assistance Act. I congratulate the member for Hughes and the member for Wannon, who spoke before me, for their very good contributions to this debate. However, I want to take up a couple of points made by the member for Hughes. He did go on a little too much about the strength of education in New South Wales. Everyone knows that Queensland has the best education system and the best curriculum! It is arguments like those that are divisive and are half the reason we have the problems we have. When it comes to the education of our children we must step aside and, from an educator's perspective, try to get a great result.


I represent schools in Townsville, Australia's garrison city. Children come from every corner of Australia. We see kids graduate from schools in Townsville with a great collection of school uniforms and unfinished subjects across the board. We see confusion between the states and between curricula, and about what grade they will stay in or go to, especially when they transfer between states and sometimes even intrastate. Clearly a unified approach would be great. The only way we can get this done is with a united approach.


It is clear that this time frame is far too rushed. Changing the deadline is vital in ensuring that independent schools are adequately prepared for the introduction of this curriculum, the first version of which has not even been approved yet, despite protestations and assertions to the contrary even last year and despite it being less than six months until the date of its expected implementation. I reiterate the statement by Prime Minister Julia Gillard in July last year:


This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.


That is pretty much like health reform. They talk about delivery before anything has even been parcelled up. That is probably the greatest statement since Prime Minister Chamberlain said, 'Peace in our time,' after having talks with Adolf Hitler. It is a bit too much to believe when it comes to these things. They just do not deliver. Has the Prime Minister of the country ever delivered anything so prematurely? We will wait and see because we have health reform and all sorts of reform that we are going to deliver that she has already said has been signed off.


It is over a year later and we still do not have a final copy of the curriculum that is ready to be used anywhere any time soon. This bill is the government's way of conceding that they have failed to deliver. They have failed to deliver the national curriculum they have been boasting about in the time line they have committed to. It is an abject failure. It should weigh heavily on the minister's mind.


The coalition has had the foresight to amend the act. Even in March this year the government failed to see the problem coming and are now scrambling to make the changes that we should have agreed to five months ago. As the member for Hughes said, this bill is completely and utterly unnecessary, but we support this bill as a necessary measure to ensure that non-government schools are given adequate time for the curriculum rollout. I acknowledge though that the government's blunders at every turn with the Australian curriculum have made this necessary.


The issues I have with the national curriculum are not related to the concept. Like many members of the coalition, I think it is important that the curriculum taught in schools is the same in Queensland as it is in every other state. My problem is the way in which this government are so lockstep, with square peg and square hole, that so many of their policies are continually mishandled. As the member for Wannon and the member for Hughes, who spoke before me, said, there should be a framework around which school principals and individual schools can work. What a school can do in Mt Isa, Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory or Townsville is different to what a school can do in the heart of Melbourne or the heart of Sydney. There are differences and there should be a framework around which they can work to achieve the same results and get the same outcomes but give the local environment, the local identity and the local teachers and educators a chance to show why they spent four years or more at university to become teachers.


This national curriculum is heavy on details but the support for it is light. Even experts across the country have acknowledged that the content will be overwhelming for many teachers. Funding to support its implementation has been completely absent. This money is essential to provide teachers with the training and professional development needs to give children a good education from a new curriculum. Too often we see that the teachers' time has been taken off. We have more and more student-free days and more and more time out for teachers for resource time when they are not in the classroom. Teachers are like nurses: they want to be in the classroom. They want to be with their class. Too often we are pulling these people away from what they want to do—what they are trained to do—to make them fill out paperwork.


The coalition has put forward two amendments, both of which I fully support, to address some of the national curriculum's shortcomings. The first of these aims to address the lack of support for schools in implementing the new curriculum. As I have said, the government has taken no measures to ensure that schools across the country are given the assistance they need to make the national curriculum a success. This amendment seeks to address this problem. The second of the coalition's amendments relates to the standing council responsible for the national curriculum time line. Neither this council nor its advisory officials committee, the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee, have representatives specifically to represent the views of the non-government schools sector. That surely must set alarm bells ringing for everyone in this country. That this part of the education system does not have a dedicated voice in the decision-making process for the Australian curriculum is a serious limitation, and addressing this absence will ensure that adequate consultation of non-government schools can and should take place.


Non-government schools are an integral part of Townsville's community and education sector. They are every bit as important as state schools and Catholic schools. Playing a vital part in offering parents choice and alternatives and with more than one-third of Townsville's schools being non-government, it is crucial that a group that accounts for such a big proportion of our education system be listened to when decisions regarding the implementation of the new curriculum are being and will be made.


I would also like to take this opportunity to raise my concerns regarding the government's NAPLAN tests. I have had concerns in relation to NAPLAN and the way it has been rolled out since day one. I have discussed in the past in this parliament the issues I have with NAPLAN. The program has been running for four years, and it seems as though the NAPLAN agenda has completely consumed the teaching agenda. In some schools children are being taught in preschool to prepare for the year 3 NAPLAN test. In between, music, art and sport have been dropped by the wayside as people prepare for nothing else because there is so much pressure applied to the results of the NAPLAN. I was speaking to a principal at a local state school just a couple of weeks ago. He told me that he knew right now that his grade 3s next year will not do well. They know, but there is nothing they can do. They will not get the resources, so they will fail the year and their funding will be cut. Their access to these things will be cut.


Students are taught to be proficient in the areas that NAPLAN will cover as teachers in schools do whatever they can to cater to the My School website, not to deliver a rounded education to students. I also add that there should be more aide time to go with the teacher. If you can get more aide time in primary schools and early childhood especially you will have a better result in years 9, 10, 11 and 12, because the problems of children not being taught the basics will be addressed by having a teacher there all the time.


The victims in all this are the areas that are so vital to a curriculum but not covered by the NAPLAN. Sport, music and art, as I have said, have all fallen by the wayside as schools have been forced to focus instead on improving their NAPLAN scores and concentrate on nothing else. Without a wide-ranging curriculum covering all areas, not only are the opportunities of these missing fields being taken away from kids; they will be less engaged in the teaching. A national curriculum is an important chance for Australia, and the government has already created far too many problems in trying to develop this change. We must get it right and we must take the time to get it right, and to get it right we need the right people sitting at the table to give their points of view—and they must be listened to.


In supporting this bill I would like to add one final point. From pink batts to Building the Education Revolution, this government has created countless problems by trying to rush through problems in legislation. We just cannot afford that sort of behaviour. We cannot afford to add the Australian curriculum to that list. It cannot be done and it should not be done. Thank you.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (18:42):  The Schools Assistance Amendment Bill 2011 before us today amends the original bill in order to repeal the date by which a non-systemic or approved school system must implement the Australian national curriculum. Whilst the coalition will not oppose this bill, I must say that I am frustrated—frustrated that once again in this House we are debating yet another amendment because once again the government could not get it right. Those opposite regularly stand before us, berating the coalition for what they say is opposition for opposition's sake, accusing us of only ever saying no. But how hypocritical are these claims when, back in March, when the government amended the legislation to change the implementation date for other schools, they simply said no to the coalition's amendment to address this discrepancy. They dismissed our positive and practical proposal out of hand. Why did they oppose our amendment? Only they know. However, if the government had listened at the time, we would not be here now, debating an amendment to this legislation yet again. This all could have been concluded back in March. But we should not be surprised; listening seems to be something this Gillard government regularly fails to do.


The coalition supports the principle of a national curriculum. However, I take offence that Prime Minister Gillard has claimed that she has already delivered it. In July last year the Prime Minister stated:


This nation's talked about national curriculum for 30 years. I delivered it.


If the Prime Minister had indeed delivered a national curriculum back in 2008, when she claimed to, we would not be standing here, having this debate today, three years later. The national curriculum was due to be implemented from January of this year. It was not. It is still not ready, and stakeholders have serious concerns with both the content and the fact that no funding has been proposed to support schools and teachers through this massive change to our education system. Yet from what the Prime Minister said last year, as far as she is concerned a national curriculum was delivered last year.


In principle I support a national curriculum. Like the International Baccalaureate does at an international level a national curriculum would provide an equal education standard around Australia, avoiding much angst when families need to move interstate. In our transient society, it is important that students are comfortable within their learning environment, and a national curriculum helps to give them confidence. A national curriculum provides students with broader opportunities, both domestically and internationally, as their achievements are more quantifiable.


But when will this Gillard government admit that making an announcement does not equal reform? Making an announcement does not equal delivery. Real reform comes with competent delivery, smooth implementation, and open and transparent consultation with stakeholders. When you look at this government's track record of schemes such as Fuelwatch, home insulation, and Building the Education Revolution, I have grave concerns as to how the national curriculum will be rolled out.


This concern is compounded as there does not seem to be any funding or support for the necessary training required for a national curriculum to succeed. It is imperative that teachers, in both the government and the non-government sector, receive adequate support throughout this process. That is why the coalition is moving an amendment to ensure that schools are provided with appropriate support and assistance to implement the national curriculum. I do not think anyone on either side of this House would deny the importance of our teachers. Teachers are an integral part of our society, shaping the youngest in our society into lifelong learners. I also do not think that anyone in this House would deny that teachers are already undertaking a massive job with enormous responsibility often without the support they deserve and need. With the introduction of a national curriculum, their workload will increase—there is no doubt about that. An entire overhaul of the teaching curriculum will take time to learn how to teach and deliver, and would greatly benefit from teacher training and development. This is common sense, and has been endorsed by the Independent Education Union yet the government has not taken moves to ensure this occurs for non-government schools.


Perhaps the government does not understand the concerns of these stakeholders. Again, we face an issue about a lack of consultation. I have spoken on a number of bills before parliament this year which have had a major impact on the direction of industry, the economy and the Australian people. Yet with many of these bills, there has been a very limited consultation period in which stakeholders could voice their concern, raise issues and make suggestions. It seems that this may be happening again, as the concerns expressed by experts in education, teacher representative groups, and professional associations share the coalition's concern about the lack of funding. However it does not seem that their voices are being heard. Non-government schools do not have specific representation on the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee. This means that non-government schools have little opportunity to share their experience and thoughts on the implementation of a national curriculum, despite being greatly affected.


The coalition is today moving an amendment to rectify that. The government is introducing a national curriculum across the board to both government and non-government schools. This means that students and teachers in both forms of schooling will be affected, so it is very important that representatives from both are heard. Around half of all students will attend a non-government school at some point during their education, and non-government schools bring further ideas and considerations to the table. Non-government school representation is an important step forward, and I hope it is one that the government will take on board and action.


I have 19 non-government schools in my electorate which educate a significant number of students. These students will experience the national curriculum just like those at the 26 government schools in my electorate—as will their teachers and school staff. They also need support and representation as the coalition provides for in our two amendments to this bill. Even more importantly these students, teachers, administrators and parents should not be overlooked again by this government just as they were overlooked in March with the original amendments to the implementation timeline.


I trust that this government will take a good look at its failures to date and go forward with the national curriculum in a much more positive way, not bungling its implementation as it has with so many other programs. The coalition amendments to be moved would be a good start. I trust that this Gillard government does not ignore them out of spite as seemingly happened back in March when the government missed an opportunity to rectify the blown out implementation time line for all schools. Let us not see such an important change to Australian education mismanaged again.


Debate adjourned.

That this House directs the Prime Minister to immediately establish a full and independent inquiry with:


(1) powers equivalent to a Royal Commission to investigate the bank note bribery scandal concerning the Reserve Bank of Australia, Securency and Note Printing Australia; and


(2) terms of reference that require it to investigate and report on at least the following matters:


(a) allegations of corruption in securing note printing contracts and payments to overseas agents into offshore tax havens;


(b) what the Reserve Bank of Australia, Austrade and the Australian Government each knew about the alleged behaviour, and when they knew it;

There is a dark cloud hanging over the Reserve Bank of Australia that only the government can remove. Saying hardly a word, the Treasurer has allowed this dark cloud to grow and cover ever more of the landscape. As a result, Australia's central bank sits with its governance under question. It is now time for the Prime Minister to step in and restore public confidence in the Reserve Bank with a full and independent inquiry.


It is absolutely essential in a democracy for the public to have confidence in the integrity and appropriate governance of our public institutions. In a market economy, it is particularly crucial that there is the same confidence in the key institutions that are tasked with managing the economy. That is what makes the recent allegations of involvement in bribery against two Reserve Bank subsidiaries, Securency and Note Printing Australia, all the more concerning. The more that is revealed about the bank note scandal, the more it appears that serious questions about corporate governance at the Reserve Bank need to be answered. It is also clear that questions need to be answered by the government, particularly with regard to Austrade and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.


I want to review briefly some of what has been disclosed about this whole affair. According to reports by the Age, the leadership of the RBA failed to notify the police of evidence that it had as far back as 2007 that its subsidiary Note Printing Australia was involved with the bribery of foreign officials. The NPA board, which included former and current RBA board members or officials, was provided information in 2007 that company agents were bribing officials in Malaysia and Nepal, according to the Age. After being alerted to bribery concerns by the NPA board, the Reserve Bank leadership decided to handle the matter internally rather than notify the police. The Australian Federal Police were not told about these allegations regarding the NPA until May 2009, about two years later, and only after the Age exposed corruption concerns at the other RBA company, Securency. This is despite the RBA's chief auditor finding serious problems with NPA's use of agents and his findings being examined by the bank's audit committee, according to the Age.


To get to the nub of it, we are talking about tens of millions of dollars of public money. Both of the RBA's companies have now been charged with conspiracy to bribe foreign officials and a number of executives have also been charged. Yet the RBA is still to explain what and when it knew and how its oversight of these two companies could be so flawed as to allow this to happen. Most importantly—and this is crucial—we must get to the bottom of why it appears that the RBA failed for so long to notify police of the serious evidence of wrongdoing.


It is incredible to me that, in spite of these serious allegations of corruption and bribery and the breakdown in accountability and governance, the government and, in particular, the Treasurer have remained almost mute about the problem. It is the Australian Greens' view that the government can no longer be silent on this matter and it is time for action. The Prime Minister should establish a full and independent inquiry that has the powers it needs to get to the bottom of what has occurred, and it needs to look at everyone involved, including the Reserve Bank.


So I am moving this motion to make clear parliament's view that the government cannot ignore this problem and must establish such an inquiry. I want to make clear that in moving this motion there is no suggestion on our part that the AFP is not doing its job in investigating and bringing charges. This inquiry will not cut across the AFP's work because the inquiry's focus will be on the failure of governance within the RBA, something the AFP investigation does not necessarily have as its focus. This is not about undermining the Reserve Bank; it is the opposite—because now, more than ever, given the global financial instability, it is vital that public confidence in the Reserve Bank is restored.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (21:05):  I am certainly pleased to have the opportunity to rise to speak on the matter of the Reserve Bank of Australia board and, in particular, its subsidiaries, Securency and Note Printing Australia. I note that this motion has been put forward by the Australian Greens. When you go to the heart of this matter, it is a call by the Australian Greens for there to be a full-blown inquiry into what the Reserve Bank knew, when they knew and what they did about it. However, the matters at the core of this issue, dealing with Reserve Bank board governance with respect to Securency and Note Printing Australia, are matters that I, as a member and Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, have already asked the Reserve Bank Governor himself about at two inquiries that the economics committee has conducted with the Reserve Bank.


There can be no doubt that the issues and the allegations at the core of this matter are substantial. There can be no doubt that, when it comes to corrupt practices such as paying bribes to foreign officials, this is the kind of matter that ought to be dealt with very firmly. When these allegations were first raised with me, off the back of some very fine investigative work by a number of journalists, that was part of the reason I took it upon myself to ask some hard questions of the Reserve Bank Governor. It is beholden upon all of us in this place to make sure that we walk the fine line between allowing transparency and asking difficult questions on hard topics while not allowing matters to become partisan politics purely and simply because it suits certain agendas at certain times. So in good faith I put to the Reserve Bank governor a number of questions in 2010 and subsequently at hearings of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. We know that the time line is not as apparent as the mover of the motion put it. Certainly, it would suit these conveniences of the Greens to argue that there is a large conspiracy and a cover-up—and, in fact, we know there were corrupt officials being paid inappropriately by Australian agencies—but the truth is that it is simply not that clear-cut. Where the evidence tends to indicate that there may be a prima facie basis to support the assertion of a conspiracy and a cover-up, charges have been laid. The AFP is investigating the conduct at the core of this. They are investigating it in a way that is not beholden to party political process or prone to grandstanding but rather in a way that is focused upon discerning the truth—something that I fear is not at the core of the Greens motion on Securency.


There is one area on which I do agree with the Greens on this matter—that is, that a full and frank account is owed to the Australian people by the Treasurer. The reason I say it is owed by the Treasurer is that under evidence from the Reserve Bank Governor we know that the first time that information was transmitted from the Reserve Bank to the executive arm of government occurred under his watch as Treasurer of the country. That was the first time that this Labor Treasurer—or, indeed, any executive member of the parliament that we know of—was informed about some of the practices that had taken place and whether or not these practices were appropriate.


In defence of aspects of the activities of the Reserve Bank, it is clear to me, based upon the evidence that I have been given in answers from the Reserve Bank Governor and my own reading of, for example, the audit by KPMG and the evidence from Rick Battellino and others, that shortly after the AWB scandal the Reserve Bank board instructed that there be a thorough review of the practices and policies of NPA—that is, Note Printing Australia—and Securency in their use of offshore agents. Although the headline figures that the Greens used sound controversial, they were not inconsistent with a business of this size. The findings of that review made a number of recommendations. In some instances the use of agents was ceased, and in others it was continued. But there was a breakdown of management controls, and that is part of what AFP investigation has gone too.


In the fullness of time, a thorough political investigation may be the prudent thing to do; but right now is not the prudent thing to do. There is an AFP investigation. Charges have been laid. It is not the time for political grandstanding; it is time for the AFP to do their work. It may, however, be the appropriate time once the Treasurer has given account.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (21:10):   In speaking to this motion, I say from the outset that I totally understand and accept the concern put up by the member for Melbourne to explain why he is raising this issue. I do not, however, accept and support his motion. The motion and the issue relate to the activity of the banknote marketing company Securency. Securency is half owned by the Reserve Bank of Australia and half owned by UK plastic film manufacturer Innovia. Securency was formed in 1996 to commercialise polymer banknote printing technology that had been jointly developed by the Reserve Bank of Australia and Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO. I think it is great to think that the CSIRO was involved in the development of the banknotes that are now being used by countries in other parts of the world. In order to win banknote supply contracts between 1999 and 2005 the marketing of the new design of these polymer banknotes began. If a contract is won, I understand that Note Printing Australia, a company 100 per cent owned by the RBA, manufactures the bank notes.


The prosecutions currently underway are the first under Australia's foreign bribery legislation introduced in 1999, and that in itself is quite significant—prosecutions are currently underway based on an act of parliament that was introduced 12 years ago, and this is the first time that it has been used. I understand that six former Securency officials have been charged with offences relating to bribing public officials in Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Nigeria. I understand further that Malaysian authorities have laid bribery charges against two individuals.


These matters are currently before the courts, and I would expect that the matters are also currently under continuing Australian Federal Policy inquiry. It is my view, and I believe it would be the government's view, that these matters are being properly investigated across international jurisdictions—and, in fact, charges have been laid. To widen the investigation, as the motion proposes, with powers equivalent to a royal commission whilst court proceedings are underway would in my view be inappropriate, regardless of whether it was to be an investigation conducted by a member or former member of the judiciary, by another suitable person or even by a committee of this parliament


As the member for Moncrieff has said, it may be appropriate to widen the investigation subsequent to the court outcomes, but it is not appropriate in the midst of court proceedings. In response to the member for Moncrieff's criticism of the Treasurer, I point out to the House that the alleged offences took place between 1999 and 2005—that is, prior to this government's coming to office and under the watch of the previous coalition government.


I also note, as other members who have spoken have noted, that in 2007 the Reserve Bank of Australia engaged corporate law firm Freehills to carry out a confidential probe of the activities in question. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, Freehills found no breach of Australian law involving Note Printing Australia. Of course, we have not seen that advice and we rely on the Reserve Bank's response in respect to it. I further note that since 2008—that is, subsequent to the matters before the courts—Securency and Note Printing Australia have both had a change of chairmanship; the Reserve Bank of Australia's Assistant Governor, Dr Rob Rankin, is now the chairperson.


The member for Melbourne referred to today's Age newspaper, where a story by Richard Baker and Nick McKenzie in which allegations of bribery associated with 2002 and 2004 note printing contracts for the Nepalese government by Note Printing Australia appear. I understand that the Australian Federal Police is also investigating that matter.


This is a serious matter—any allegation of corruption or bribery is serious—and it is reflected by the penalties associated with the matter. However, I say to the member for Melbourne, 'Let us wait to see what the court outcome is before we take this matter further.' (Time expired)

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (21:15):  I rise to speak on this motion regarding bank note bribery allegations. I would like to congratulate my colleague, Steven Ciobo, who asked a series of questions about this very issue during a recent House of Representatives committee hearing with the Reserve Bank.


We know that the role of the Reserve Bank is a critical one. The Reserve Bank of Australia is Australia's central bank. It conducts monetary policy, it works to maintain a strong financial system and it issues the nation's currency. It is a policy making body, and that policy making body has serious responsibilities. It provides selected banking and registry services to a range of Australian government agencies and to a number of overseas central banks and official institutions. It also manages Australia's gold and foreign exchange reserves. Any question as to the propriety of the Reserve Bank is a very serious one.


The question at the fore today relates to two subsidiaries of the Reserve Bank: Securency, 50 per cent owned by the Reserve Bank; and Note Printing Australia, 100 per cent owned by the Reserve Bank. There have been a number of allegations that have been ventilated in the media over a period of time. At the core of the issues that have been raised is the use of agents and those agents making payments, or bribes, to secure contracts overseas. This is currently under police investigation. However, there are still questions around who knew what, when they knew it and what they then did about it. It would be a serious issue indeed if the RBA did not have appropriate governance standards to identify any potential breaches of the law. It would be a critical issue indeed for the RBA if in fact it was made aware of issues and did not immediately refer those issues to the police for investigation. It would be a serious issue if the RBA tried to deal with this matter internally. It would be a serious issue if the RBA did not notify the government when it became aware of the concerns regarding allegations of bribery of foreign officials.


Thinking back on some of the recent matters that have involved allegations of foreign bribes, I recall Kevin Rudd making quite a lot of noise about these issues in 2005. In fact, he had quite a lot to say about it. He said it was most critical that in circumstances where these sorts of allegations are made they should be properly and thoroughly investigated. In fact, he indicated that, foreign bribes were associated with the 'worst corruption scandal in Australia's history'. The government needs to look very seriously at the position it is taking on this issue today compared with the position that it has taken it the past.


As I said before, before the Greens' member for Melbourne there was Steven Ciobo. He has done quite a lot of forensic work on this issue in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics in his pursuit of questioning of the Reserve Bank Governor. He asked a series of questions during the last meeting. Specifically, he asked when the Reserve Bank was made aware of these issues. The Reserve Bank Governor said in his response that he was first made aware of the issues in relation to Securency in May 2009, which is when the reports were first publicly ventilated. However, according to recent media reports, it seems that the board was aware of issues relating to the sister company, Note Printing Australia, in May 2007. So there are some serious issues to be properly investigated and looked at. I note that there is going to be a committee hearing of the Reserve Bank on Friday and I am sure that these questions will be addressed during that hearing. It is imperative that the police are able to get on with their investigation. This is critical. The government should not stand in the way of any police investigation. The police should be able to go about their business and to secure the information that they need in order to do their job properly and thoroughly.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (21:20):  I rise to speak on the motion of the member for Melbourne, which calls for this House to establish an independent inquiry into the 'bank note bribery scandal concerning the Reserve Bank of Australia, Securency and Note Printing Australia'. The motion suggests that such an inquiry should have powers equivalent to a royal commission. This is a serious call indeed, and one that this House should think about carefully before endorsing. It is a matter of record that serious allegations have been made, but it is also worth noting, as previous speakers in this debate have done, that the Reserve Bank has conducted internal reviews which found no wrongdoing on the part of any RBA staff or RBA appointed board members of Securency. The matter is also under investigation by the Australian Federal Police, and it might therefore be thought appropriate for this House not to step into a space which is already occupied by a police investigation.


It is a great irony that one of the great Australian inventions that we often point to, the polymer bank note—which, alongside the black box, is often regarded as one of Australia's great innovations—should be caught up in an apparent scandal like this. It is important to recognise the statements the Reserve Bank of Australia have made concerning the scandal which, as previous members have noted, arose in 1999 to 2005. By coincidence, that is around the same period the AWB scandal was occurring that the member for Higgins referred to. The Reserve Bank of Australia noted in a statement on 1 July this year:


None of the individuals charged now has any connection with the companies or with the Reserve Bank. 


No one in the Reserve Bank has been accused of wrongdoing, nor have any members of the company boards who were drawn from the Reserve Bank. 


The Reserve Bank's statement also noted:


Over the past several years much has been done to tighten controls and strengthen governance so as to avoid any re-occurrence of the alleged behaviour: 


Those charged with offences are no longer with the companies; 


The use of sales agents has ceased;


Policies and procedures at both companies have been thoroughly overhauled; and


The Reserve Bank added executive resources in the banknotes area and moved to draw all its appointees to the boards of both companies from the Bank's executive or the Reserve Bank Board.


The Reserve Bank statement ended by noting that it would not make further comments about the charges as they were now to be tested in the courts. Similarly, this House should wait and see the results of those police investigations before putting in place an investigation of our own.


It is absolutely critical that we recognise the context in which we are having this conversation. Amidst some global turmoil on US and European markets, Australia has extraordinarily strong economic fundamentals, one of the lowest unemployment rates in the developed world, one of the lowest levels of government debt in the developed world, and strict fiscal rules and strong banks. In the Asian century we are located in the fastest-growing region of the world, deeply enmeshed in the economies of Asia.


It is true, of course, that a high dollar puts pressure on certain sectors, Dutch disease puts pressure on manufacturing, domestic tourism and our higher education sector, which is reliant on overseas students. But it is important when we are discussing matters such as the Reserve Bank and the conduct of monetary policy in Australia not to forget the fundamental economic environment in which we find ourselves. Ours is a position that almost any developed country in the world would be glad to trade places with. Both the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank governor note that when they attend international meetings virtually any colleague around the world would be happy to trade places with them. So it is in that strong economic context that this conversation is occurring.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (21:25):  I am pleased to rise to speak on this motion proposed by the member for Melbourne that there ought to be a royal commission into the question of the allegations which have been made concerning the Reserve Bank of Australia and its subsidiaries.


The issue before the House this evening is not whether serious allegations have been raised about the conduct of individuals involved with the Reserve Bank or its subsidiaries. It is true that serious allegations have been raised. The issue is not whether the Reserve Bank of Australia or its subsidiaries should comply with the law. Of course they ought to comply with the law, be that in Australia or in any other jurisdiction around the world in which that organisation, its subsidiaries or its officials or executives are operating. The issue is not whether there is a need for this matter to be investigated. If allegations of this degree of seriousness have been made and have been reported then clearly there is a need for them to be investigated. The issue is not whether on this side of the House we take this matter very seriously. Clearly, we do take this matter very seriously and, as the House has already been informed, the member for Moncrieff has been assiduous in pursuing this matter in the House Standing Committee on Economics, asking a number of questions about it because it does raise a very serious question of public interest. The issue is not whether the Reserve Bank of Australia is a major economic institution in this country. Of course the Reserve Bank of Australia is an institution of the very first importance to economic management and to the economic security that Australians rightly expect the government to provide.


The issue before the House, which is encapsulated in the notion that we are considering, is a far more narrow and precise issue. It is this: what is the right process to investigate and to pursue the allegations which have been made? As the House is well aware, this matter is being investigated by the Australian Federal Police. I emphasise that on this side of the House we make no comment about the merits of that process and of course all individuals involved are entitled to the presumption of innocence. I simply make the point that there is a process being carried on as we speak by a federal government agency, the Australian Federal Police, in relation to the allegations which have been made and so therefore, against that backdrop, the question before this House tonight is a very simple, clear one: is there a case to overlay that process which is presently underway with an entirely new and separate process, the process embodying and involving a royal commission?


A royal commission ought not to be set up lightly. There is a high bar that must be met before any government should commence to establish a royal commission. There must be a demonstrated view that the existing mechanisms for investigating the matter are inadequate. There must be a justification. There must be a basis for granting the coercive powers which royal commissions typically have. Royal commissions typically have the capacity to deal with witnesses in a way which denies them many rights of procedural fairness that are available to a witness in an ordinary traditional judicial proceeding. If you are to set that higher standard, if you are to establish a body with these out of the ordinary powers, you need to demonstrate that there is a case to do that and that the established processes are not sufficient, are not adequate, to deal with the allegations which have been made. You have to do more than say that there are serious questions which need to be investigated. You have to demonstrate that the existing processes of investigation which, as the House is aware, involve the Australian Federal Police are not adequate. The simple point I make is that that has not been demonstrated.


Debate adjourned.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (21:30):  It gives me great pleasure to enlighten the House about my recent activities with organisations and individuals who are making a big difference to the City of Brisbane. I was delighted to have Senator Mitch Fifield, the shadow minister for disability services, come to host a disability forum in Brisbane recently. I thank the senator. I was very pleased with the turnout and the feedback that we received in this very important area. We heard many stories of dedication and commitment. We unfortunately heard many stories of the current system of disability support that is broken. The coalition recognises that people with disabilities, their carers and their families deserve a better deal. We support the NDIS. Along with the heart-warming stories we heard, we were also told about the woeful state of disability services in Queensland. 


Queensland's disability service is probably one of the worst in the country. It is an embarrassment and we must do more. We heard stories of a completely dysfunctional system that places a great deal of reliance on service standards compliance that proves to be a waste of time and money. This money could be used to improve the lives of Queenslanders with disabilities. It is estimated that some $500 million is spent each year by the not-for-profit sector just on regulatory compliance. Additionally the government has stopped listening to those who know what needs to be done. We hear examples of consultation processes with key stakeholders that occur after the policy has been decided, and those people really feel that they are not being listened to. I would like to thank two of my constituents, Mrs Ursula Agnew and Michelle Lawson, who was instrumental in arranging this forum. They have firsthand knowledge of the effort and commitment required to care for kids with disabilities. 


The day following the forum, the senator and I had the privilege of attending the Red Hill Special School for a disability tea. The event was to raise awareness of a national disability insurance scheme and the campaign to make every Australian count. I would like to highlight the great work being done at the Red Hill Special School and in particular Ms Cath McCulloch, the occupational therapist at the Red Hill Special School. I would also like to thank the principal, Pam Stack, and her entire staff for their hospitality and the terrific work being undertaken at the school. The school was established in 1986 to provide specifically for the educational needs of school aged people with multiple disabilities. An early special education class was established in 1995 and it was extended to cater for local children with a broad range of special educational needs in 1999. The programs cater for children and students from birth to 17 or 18 years of age, and approximately 50 children from birth to five years access the early childhood development program. There are roughly 40 kids of six to 17 years of age enrolled in the same school. Those early intervention programs are vital to the development of children with disabilities.


Finally, I was very pleased to visit a great organisation making a really positive impact on the lives of Queenslanders. Community in Bardon were instrumental in helping the people of Brisbane in the aftermath of the floods earlier this year. However, they do much more than that. Some of their services include aged and disability services, child care, community development, community education, emergency relief and settlement services. They have been working so hard in the community for over 30 years to develop and deliver locally based services and activities in response to the issues and opportunities that life can present. Their mission is to strengthen the communities' capacity by responding to the diverse needs and interests of their members. Community utilise an integrated recovery focused approach to assist people experiencing long-term mental health issues. This was why I was very pleased to meet with the manager, Ms Karen Dare. I was told by the managers that there are large numbers of families who are coming to them for financial assistance, particularly to pay bills and for food and clothing. I thank Senator Fifield for his time in Brisbane and his commitment to disability services. I also applaud the fantastic work that is being done at the Red Hill Special School and, particularly, the fantastic work that is being done in community.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (10:30):  The Prime Minister seems to believe that the installation of energy saving light bulbs is compensation enough for not-for-profits and charities that are going to get stung by a carbon tax. In particular, enormous costs will be borne by aviation rescue services, such as the Royal Flying Doctor Service, Rockhampton's Capricorn Helicopter Rescue Service and the Mackay based CQ Rescue Helicopter Service. CQ Rescue has estimated that through the increase in aviation fuel and electricity prices alone their carbon tax bill will be around $20,000 per year, which will grow as the carbon tax grows. Back in July the Prime Minister, when confronted by carbon tax concerns from the Royal Flying Doctor Service, referred to a so-called special fund and said that she would cover any impacts they feel from pricing carbon, including direct assistance. However, in the carbon tax documentation entitled Securing a clean energy future not once are the words 'not-for-profit, non-profit, charity or charitable' even mentioned. The Prime Minister has claimed this special fund, set aside for compensating not-for-profits, is contained within the Low Carbon Communities program. The entire Low Carbon Communities program is only $330 million over six years, with at least $30 million and quite possibly $130 million already earmarked for supposed assistance to low-income households. That leaves $300 million at best to be spread across some 600,000 registered not-for-profits in Australia, roughly equating to $83 per not-for-profit a year. 


Answering a question of mine in question time last week, the Prime Minister said, 'That's not how it works.' How does it work? The rest of the $300 million will presumably go towards items listed in the program's description in the Clean Energy Future documents. The description does not refer to compensation for not-for-profits. The closest this program comes to helping organisations like CQ Rescue, the Capricorn Helicopter Rescue Service and, indeed, the Royal Flying Doctor Service is in undertaking energy efficiency upgrades to community facilities, but installing an energy saving light bulb in the main office is not going to compensate for the increase in aviation fuel costs, which is the main problem, particularly for CQ Rescue, with its estimated $20,000 carbon tax increase. The Prime Minister has been well and truly caught out in this falsehood that she is going to compensate not-for-profits. The problem is that it will be the not-for-profit charitable groups that are trying to help people and save lives that suffer and not her—not that is until we get to the ballot box.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (11:00):  Only last month the Independent Republic of South Sudan came into existence as the culmination of a comprehensive peace agreement creating two Sudanese nations. It is a momentous threshold to be crossed in a part of Africa that has been ripped through with conflict and suffering for nearly half a century. It offers the prospect of greater peace and stability and of less violence, displacement and suffering for the Sudanese, but in all reality this prospect is still distant and uncertain. 


In human history, whenever conflict is sought to be resolved by separation, by the creation of separate geographical and sovereign regions and through the distillation of separate political, ethnic or religious populations, the fracture is never achieved without difficulty and pain and inevitably the point of separation represents a period of heightened danger, dislocation and violence. That is true in the Sudan.


The comprehensive peace agreement between north and south may have brought a formal end to a civil conflict that has been more or less continuous for 50 years, but the violence has not ended. It is estimated that 1.4 million Sudanese are currently affected by conflict in South Kordofan, one of three key protocol areas, and at least 200,000 are internally displaced. Some of the preconditions for independence set out in the comprehensive peace agreement have not yet been met, including notably the determination processes that were required to be held in critical border zones. The promised referendum on the status of Abyei has not been held and nor have the popular consultations in southern Kordofan and Blue Nile state. In recent weeks there have been reports of the targeted intensive slaughter of the marginalised Nuba ethnic group in South Kordofan and there is a desperate need for an enforceable ceasefire in that region. 


The border region of Abyei encapsulates much of what is difficult in bringing peace to Sudan. Abyei is an oil producing region in a country where oil production and oil wealth are the most valuable prize. Eighty per cent of Sudan's oil reserves are located in South Sudan, but the only pipelines run to the north where the refineries are also located. Under the CPA Abyei is supposed to have been subject to its own referendum in order to determine whether it will belong to the north or the south. Like Kashmir, it is a fragment that has bound within it a number of the root causes that define the Sudanese dilemma.


To people in Australia this will be a blur of regional names and acronyms that in the end are likely to be reduced to the general sense that the Sudan and its people are trapped in a state of unfathomable, intractable, internecine conflict, but we have to move beyond that barrier of incomprehension if we are, in Australia and in the international community as a whole, committed to supporting the achievement of peace and security for our fellow human beings and greater global stability and prosperity.


In addition to reflecting on what is a pressing international and humanitarian crisis—and I want to thank the member for Chifley for seconding this motion and to thank all members who have chosen to contribute to this discussion today—I hope the motion will have a further constructive value in identifying the steps Australia can take to continue our role as a contributor to the future peace and stability of South and North Sudan.


As part of its expansion and reorientation of Australian development assistance, this government has recognised the need to direct aid not only to our region but also to those parts of the world that need it most, and of course this includes Africa. The Sudan is already the second-largest recipient in Africa of Australia's humanitarian assistance, including the provision of $136 million since 2004, but there is more that we can consider doing at this critical juncture. Perhaps the highest priority is the protection of Sudanese civilians, whose safety depends on the observance of the current Status of Forces Agreement and it would be significantly aided if the peacekeeping capacity in areas like South Kordofan were strengthened, which could occur through the expansion of the UN interim security force for Abyei, or UNISFA mandate. Australia should continue to engage with the troika countries, the US, UK and Norway, to support the urgent creation of effective constitutions for North and South Sudan and to make representations to the government of Sudan to improve humanitarian access.


As an example of how difficult and frustrating the peacekeeping task in Sudan is for peace keepers, four UNISFA staff were killed when their vehicle hit a land mine two weeks ago, with the tragedy made worse by the fact that three of the four survived the initial blast, but died before medical help could arrive when the Sudanese government refused to allow the airlift, saying any unauthorised helicopter in the vicinity would be shot down. As I have done in this place a number of times, I pay tribute to all those who make the sacrifices necessary to give the best of themselves as peacekeepers and, in doing so, demonstrate the best of human nature.


There is no doubt that the commitment of predictable and long-term assistance funding is of great value in the circumstances that apply in Sudan. Australia is recognised for its substantial contributions to UN operations in Sudan, including generous contributions to the central emergency fund and the UN Sudan common humanitarian fund. A number of NGOs have identified the importance of Australia's long-term commitment to this kind of funding, especially where it is directed at the safe return of North and South Sudanese, the humanitarian effort in Darfur, where the terrible conflict is now in its eighth year, and ongoing, predictable funding to the UN and other non-government agencies.


I would like to share the experience of an extraordinary young Sudanese Australian women, Nyadol Nyuon, who has been in the parliament yesterday and today as part of a Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians Forum for 10 young Australian women to consider ways to increase the number of women in parliament. Nyadol, who is 23 years old, is the Commonwealth nominee for this event. Her family originates from South Sudan, but she was born and raised in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Kenya, until her family was accepted for resettlement through the Australian humanitarian program in 2005. Nyadol became an Australian citizen on 11 November 2010. Since her arrival Nyadol has worked within the social services sector to raise awareness of the impact of settlement on young people and how emerging communities might be better assisted in their settlement process. She has completed a bachelor of arts and is currently studying a law degree at the University of Melbourne. This incredible young woman sits on the board of the Ethnic Community Council of Victoria, the Federal Ethnic Community Council of Australia and the Australian Youth Forum among other things. She has published articles for the Australasian Review of African Studies. Nyadol was in South Sudan for the independence celebrations on 9 July. She shared with me these thoughts about her new nation:


Six years ago I sat in a classroom of over 90 students. I was a stateless refugee. Now I am attending a forum at Parliament House and a citizen not only of Australia, but now also South Sudan. Australia has given me so much that I cannot give back. My greatest hope is that others, such as those I left behind in refugee camps, can go back to an independent South Sudan and be able to achieve and live meaningful and dignified lives, but I know from my own experience and visits to that country last year to vote in the historic referendum and a month ago to witness the declaration of independence, that such an achievement will be hard to attain.


Nyadol identified three main areas where Australia can assist South Sudan: governance, agriculture and women's empowerment. She said:


Good governance, the greatest challenge of all, and the enforcement of the rule of law are essential to South Sudan's stability. The complex mixture of tribal and ethnic tension, poverty and a history of war pose great risks to development instability. 


South Sudan is blessed with fertile soil in the River Nile. Some have called it the bread basket of the East African region. South Sudan has the possibility of not only feeding its own people, but the whole region. Development of the agricultural sector would reduce dependency on oil, reducing tensions between the south and the north, but also lead to food security. The potential of South Sudan land has been realised and exploited so far by the gulf countries, India, China and even South Korea. These countries are buying or negotiating to buy huge areas of land to feed their own population needs, while South Sudan continues to be one of the countries heavily dependent on aid with over a million citizens currently receiving food aid. She goes on to say:


Poverty is a catalyst for war. For example, tribal conflict arising from raiding cattle of neighbouring tribes is currently one of the challenges facing the South Sudan administration. As of yesterday, 300 people died in conflict resulting from cattle raiding. Australia can contribute great knowledge and skill in the agricultural sector.


She continued:


In Sudan a girl is more likely to die in child birth than complete primary school. Education in Sudan is desperately needed to break the cycle of poverty. Eighty-six per cent of girls have no formal education, 96.5 per cent cannot read or write more than their name, 99 per cent have no electricity, 98.5 per cent have no access to running water, 93 per cent have lost at least one family member, 68 per cent of married women live in a polygamist marriage.


She says:


These statistics mean that women cannot sufficiently contribute to the political and economic life of the country and this can only disadvantage a country like Sudan, which really needs all hands on board.


Nyadol concludes by noting that 'investing in women, particularly in developing countries, is one of the most effective ways of aiding the development process'.


I pay tribute to this remarkable young woman, Nyadol Nyuon, who has already endured and achieved so much on behalf of both of her beloved countries, Australia and South Sudan. I also note the enthusiasm of the Sudanese Australian community in general to contribute not only to Australia but also to the harmonious development of the new state of South Sudan. I am confident that Australia will do all it can to assist the 193rd member state of the United Nations to achieve its full potential.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (11:10):  I would not want the motion to lapse for want of a seconder, knowing that one was present. It is an important motion and I want to commend the member for Fremantle for raising this matter. I was fascinated with her comments. The only part she missed out was the fact that I, in an earlier life, had the opportunity to institute the program for resettlement of Sudanese refugees, but I am not sensitive about those matters. I only wish to observe that I was delighted to hear of the success of one of those people who came to Australia for resettlement through the front door. It is a particularly important program.


It was very interesting that in one of the recent debates on Q&A there was a lady who put herself in the shoes of a refugee and went to Kakuma in particular where so many Southern Sudanese have been housed for so long. She saw a lot of the suffering that they endured and appreciated very much the fact that these were some of the people who do not have the funds to engage a people smuggler, are not free enough to travel and would remain there were it not for the fact that we did have a generous refugee resettlement program. I was delighted to hear of those comments and the acknowledgement in the motion. However, if I may, I want to focus on the broader points in this debate, because I think it is appropriate to acknowledge the fact that a new nation has emerged as a result of a referendum for the independence of Southern Sudan. There is now a unique opportunity for us to play a part in building the future of a new nation. 


Like the member for Fremantle, I am concerned that there have been continuing pressures and hostilities in some of the areas that have often been the subject of contest because of resources. One hopes that situation will not in any way deteriorate. I think it is important that Australia uses its aid to assist Southern Sudan in particular. There is a unique opportunity for us to be doing just that. Having recently visited Africa, I have made some comments about aid programs, and it germane to perhaps consider them in the context of this resolution.


I think Australia has some areas of expertise in which it can help in a unique way that others cannot. I have identified some of those programs in other parts of Africa. Australia's expertise in dry-land farming means that Australia can bring organisations like CSIRO to do research and assist in the development of those sorts of skills for feeding Africa's very large populations. It is a unique capacity and it is not something that others can do. I think there is insufficient emphasis on identifying those areas in which we can leverage our support. I had the opportunity of visiting a very marvellous Australian, Ms Hamlin, in Ethiopia. The leverage that you can have with an outstanding Australia who has made a commitment to Africa in the way in which she has is another matter on which you can build.


Some time ago I suggested to the government that there was another area in which Australia was uniquely positioned to help. I raised it with the former member for Fraser Bob McMullen, who was then dealing with aid issues. I have heard nothing further from the Australian government in relation to it. However, I had the opportunity of meeting a very unique Southern Sudanese gentleman by the name of Henry Dang Dang. I met him at a conference organised by an organisation that was once known as Moral Re-Armament, which was of great interest to members for Fremantle. It is now called Initiatives of Change. That organisation brings people together who are going to be involved particularly in the process of reconciliation and nation building. Henry Dang Dang was one such person.


In the context of the elements of isolation that some people in Sudan feel because of the prosecution of the President for war crimes, there are issues which engage the United Nations about which both Sudan and Southern Sudan are unwilling to engage with the international community through the United Nations. Australia has had an enormous experience in dealing with demining, and dealing with issues in relation to rehabilitating populations who have been injured as a result of hostilities. It has done that in places such as Afghanistan and Cambodia. Henry Dang Dang, who was in charge of the issue of dealing with the rehabilitation of those wounded through hostilities and who was dealing with the issue of restoring capacity, reusing arable lands through demining, recognised that Australia could play a very unique role by bringing its expertise to bear where the international community was not able to be involved.


I raised this with the government almost two years ago. We have been increasing very significantly our aid in relation to Africa. But there is an opportunity here with a new nation that we can develop a unique relationship with in the future that to date has not been picked up by the government. It disappoints me greatly. Henry Dang Dang was even willing to come to Australia to talk to our aid officials about the way in which they could engage in developing this initiative. 


Perhaps the minister and those who have responsibility for the aid program have been working behind the scenes on these issues and have not come back to me to tell me. It may be that that is the case. I would hope it is, but I suspect silence probably suggests that nothing has been done and that the opportunity is being fast lost. Here is a person who is of some influence in a new government saying to us, 'You are uniquely placed to be able to bring that tremendous experience that you have had in helping rebuild a nation that has been ravaged by war.' The reality is they cannot restore the capacity to be able to feed their own people unless they are able to demine those areas which have been so impacted by hostilities in the past.


There is going to be a significant disarmament of people who have been engaged in hostilities occurring. There is an opportunity to be able to help in that process. Of course, there are those who have been tragically afflicted by fighting who need to be assisted and aided. 


I want to use this opportunity to congratulate the member for Fremantle on raising this issue. This is a unique opportunity for Australia and I hope all of us can say to the government now, as this nation builds its future, that Australia can link with them in a very special way. It is not just through the people that we have resettled who may be able to go back and play useful roles in rebuilding the nation; but by building up our linkages on those matters in which they have asked us to be engaged.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (11:20):  Today I rise in support of the motion circulated by the member for Fremantle regarding the conflict in Sudan. I do thank her for bringing this important matter to our attention. On 9 July this year, following an overwhelming vote for independence by the people of Southern Sudan, two new nations emerged in what was an historic moment for Sudan and the African continent. Before, during and after the birth of the world's newest nation, Sudan had been gripped by civil war, famine and other humanitarian crises. Immediately after Sudan's referendum I made a commitment in this place to work with our local Sudanese support services in my electorate of Greenway to enhance the lives of Sudanese Australians. Today I would like to reaffirm this commitment and discuss the conflict that is plaguing the Sudanese region. I would also like to acknowledge the presence of the member for Chifley, whose electorate also shares a large number of Sudanese settlers in western Sydney. I am sure he shares that affirmation.


According to the United Nations, since 2003 the conflict in Sudan has resulted in up to 300,000 people losing their lives as a result of violence, hunger and disease and almost three million people displaced. As indicated by the BBC, accurate figures are difficult to research and have made no distinction between those dying as a result of violence and those dying as a result of starvation or disease in the camps. 


Resulting from disputes over land rights in the Darfur region of Sudan in 2003, the conflict has plagued the region for almost eight years. But as the US State Department outlines, Sudan has been at war with itself for more than three-quarters of its existence. Since independence in 1953, protracted conflict rooted in deep cultural and religious differences have slowed Sudan's economic and political development and caused massive internal displacement of people.


On 9 September 2004, the then US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, told a foreign relations committee that genocide has been committed in Darfur and that the government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility and that genocide may still be occurring. Most recently, conflict has flared in the border region of Abyei causing mass displacement and loss of life. According to the United Nations, 100,000 people have fled the disputed region, causing a major humanitarian disaster. In April of this year Sudan's President said he would not recognise the South's independence unless it gave up the claim on Abyei  made in the South's draft constitution. 


As stated in the member's motion, insecurity and inaccessibility remain amongst the biggest challenges facing the delivery of assistance by humanitarian agencies to vulnerable populations. Earlier this year I said in this place that to ensure that South Sudan can prosper and remain a safe and productive nation; the Australian government must have an active role in the development of this young nation. I would like to turn to the Sudanese community in my local area, because this motion is of the utmost importance to the large and very active Sudanese community I represent. 


I have previously mentioned the huge displacement that has been caused by the continuous conflict in Sudan. This displacement is very tangibly evident in Blacktown. I am reminded of this when I attend Blacktown City Council citizenship ceremonies in particular, which regularly comprise a large number of proud Sudanese born people who have chosen to call Australia home. This large Sudanese community makes a tremendous contribution to the multicultural fabric of our electorate. However, any new Australian citizens who have come from scenes of extreme violence in their homeland will of course unfortunately always find it difficult to feel truly included in their new homeland.


In the Blacktown community there are a number of leaders in multicultural services who are committed to addressing these very serious issues surrounding our newest Sudanese Australians. I would like to mention a few of them. St Patrick's Blacktown parish priest, Father Peter Confeggi, operates a service that deals with Sudanese Australian youth. Fr Confeggi works with members of the Sudanese community to ensure that young Sudanese Australians do not fall into traps of antisocial behaviour but are instead included and accepted in wider society.


Blacktown Police Superintendent Mark Wright works with Sudanese community leaders to ensure that young Sudanese Australians do not become involved in antisocial or illegal activity. Superintendent Wright has told me that we can do all we can in terms of sporting and other community initiatives to contribute to inclusive behaviour. Indeed, this has been successful in contributing to the betterment of the Sudanese community in Blacktown. However, his view is that there is a real risk of the next generation, the generation being affected by the most recent fighting in Sudan, falling into patterns of unacceptable behaviour.


Earlier this month I was joined by the Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs at Sydwest Multicultural Services in Blacktown to launch a new federally funded program designed to encourage good social behaviour in public spaces with a particular focus on our new settlement communities. The reality is individual members of the public often make judgments about specific nationalities unfortunately in an often generalised way based on behaviours they observe in public spaces, be it Blacktown Mall, WestPoint Blacktown Shopping Centre or around Blacktown station, and the behaviours of some often determine how members of the wider community judge the whole. Sydwest does a fantastic job in helping new Australians, including many Sudanese Australians, to become established in their new homeland. I am confident that this new program will lead to positive outcomes in our local area. 


I have previously mentioned in this place Blacktown resident and President of the Equatorial Community Welfare Association of New South Wales, Mr Faustino Aboka, who lost seven family members during the civil war in Sudan. He now calls Blacktown his home and works as a role model for new Sudanese Australians in our local area. 


All of these people work to ensure that the Sudanese Australian community are embraced in the local community of western Sydney in particular and are able to live and work in their new homeland. All of these community leaders have expressed concerns to me regarding the most recent fighting in the contested region of Abyei in particular, and I made a commitment to them that I would continue to raise this issue with Foreign Minister Rudd.


I take this opportunity also to mention the devastating humanitarian crisis unfolding currently in the Horn of Africa. East Africa is currently experiencing the worst drought in 60 years. According to UNICEF, in Southern Somalia a famine has been declared and some 600,000 children are on the brink of death suffering from severe acute malnutrition. The world is currently witnessing one of the worst natural disasters ever and of course we cannot stand by idly and do nothing. I thank the Foreign Minister for his rapid response to this crisis and note that Australia is currently the world's fourth largest country donor to the Horn of Africa, providing more than $88 million. However, we can never afford to be trapped by the perils of indifference and I encourage everyone in this place to do whatever they can to help the people of East Africa in their time of need.


In conclusion, I again thank the member for Fremantle for bringing these important issues to the attention of the house. As set out in item 7 of the member's motion, I believe we here are all of the same mind, that this government needs to provide ongoing and predictable, diplomatic and funding resources to address humanitarian and development needs in North and South Sudan. I also reaffirm my commitment to the Sudanese population living in my electorate and thank the various community leaders in Greenway for all their hard work in ensuring that these new Australians are included constructively in our society.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (11:28):  It gives me great pleasure to support this motion in relation to South Sudan. It is a community with which I have had a great deal of involvement over a number of years now. In particular, it goes back to 2007 when, as the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs, I was charged with the case of George Forbes. George Forbes was an Australian contractor in South Sudan. There was a tragic suicide of another contractor from Eastern Europe. Mr Forbes was set up—and I say this as somebody who is very cautious about overseas legal proceedings; but there was no question that this was a case of suicide—and the local authorities found that, and then there was a random decision to prosecute. Mr Forbes was held in a local prison in desperate circumstances and was facing not just the death penalty but potentially death through illness in horrific prison circumstances prior to that. 


We mobilised the Australian ambassador from Cairo at the time, Bob Bowker, who did a tremendous job. He lived in a tent and a mud brick hut in two different parts of South Sudan. He worked with the South Sudanese authorities. We also brought to bear an Australian legal team led by Julian McMahon from Melbourne, a friend of mine from university years who has become an outstanding human rights barrister, among other things, in Melbourne. As well, we brought together a team from Door of Hope. Door of Hope is a Melbourne-based church charity group. They have a particular focus in southern Sudan because at that time southern Sudan was not independent and Door of Hope, led by Bryan Grasby and introduced to me through my great friend Andrew Heard, has long been doing on-the-ground practical work through things such as assisting in providing brick-making facilities and local support. They have built great links, trust and confidence with the southern Sudanese authorities as that country moved towards independence.


What was critical was that at a time when the government, through the Australian ambassador, was doing all it could to get Mr Forbes a release, things became quite dramatic. Mr Forbes's health deteriorated and, had it not been for the intervention through Brian Grasby direct to the general secretary of the southern Sudanese authorities, it would have been almost impossible to have had justice done and Mr Forbes may well have perished in the southern Sudanese jail before he had a chance to face the courts and to be appropriately cleared.


What then occurred was that Brian Grasby rang the general secretary of the southern Sudanese authorities and explained the situation that there was not a question of doubt, but a manifest, clear, absolute injustice and that the life of an Australian was in imminent threat through illness. Mr Forbes was guaranteed release and given time in hospital where he was able to recover. In the meantime the legal proceedings were conducted at a higher court of authority. The submission by Julian McMahon, through local lawyers, on behalf of Mr Forbes was adopted in large part as the reasoning and rationale of the court, which gave a complete clearance—a complete quashing—of the lower court's verdict. Mr Forbes was released with a perfectly clear record and with the finding that there was a manifest injustice, that this was a clear case of suicide and that there was absolutely no relationship to Mr Forbes. So the life of an Australian contractor who had been helping to develop a country which was going through a course of development, attempting to move from the extreme and grinding poverty which had characterised southern Sudan, was saved. For that, I thank both the Australian ambassador at the time, Bob Bowker, and also in particular Brian Grasby; his assistant Michelle; Andrew Heard for the connection, and for all of those involved. 


This was a precursor to the path through which southern Sudan has subsequently travelled. It provided a basis for the Australian government, through successive Prime Ministers, to engage with the southern Sudanese authorities. As part of the confidence building program, it was subsequently agreed that the Australian government would assist in judicial training and judicial information, in particular to help the lower courts develop standards, structures and training sufficient that no such case of manifest justice would occur again.


The result, however, has been far more positive than any of us would have hoped at the time. Southern Sudan has been through a process of a plebiscite on national independence. That was overwhelmingly passed by the population. The country has come into being as of 9 July. I appreciate the work of the foreign minister's chief of staff, Philip Green, in facilitating the project put forward by Door of Hope for a brick-making facility to be part of Australia's independence gift. It is real. It is practical. It will help create local jobs as well as create local construction and development. These are the simple and practical things that are good examples of the Australian aid program in action. They certainly beat financial support direct to governments where there is not necessarily control over the funds.


Looking forward, South Sudan has a difficult road to hope. Let us be absolutely clear about that. It is a road which will have to overcome drought and famine within the region. It will have to overcome the problems of potential military conflict with its northern neighbour in terms of the rump of Sudan, which still remains under an authoritarian leader and an authoritarian government with a bent towards sharia law which in the Darfur province to the west of the country has presided over a catastrophic and tragic famine with huge human input in the form of the treatment of the local people. Fortunately, southern Sudan is now independent. It is responsible for its own future. It has that opportunity, but it will not be easy.


On the plus side, however, it has significant oil resources and it appears that there is yet to be a full post-succession arrangement for oil between Juba, the capital of southern Sudan and Khartoum in the remaining rump of what was previously Sudan and comprises the northern Sudanese area now. I understand there are also many mineral resources of great potential. I hope that there is a transparent process of freeing up those resources in a way which guarantees local community development, which does not lead to unbridled environmental impact, which is done through processes that provide long-term stable revenues to the development of the country, and that it avoids any corruption. There needs to be transparency in southern Sudan and I think one important investment from Australia would be to ensure that the processes for future tendering, for future mineral leases, are conducted through as open, transparent and non-corrupt bureaucratic and tendering mechanisms as possible. That would be a fair and reasonable place which would get opposition support if Australia were to dedicate some post-independence resources out of its aid program, as well as in the direct aid. If we can marshal the resources of that country in a way which helps the people then we can truly give southern Sudan a way forward.


I thank Bryan Grasby, Bob Bowker, Andrew Heard and all involved for their long history of supporting this country. (Time expired)

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (11:38):  The member for Fremantle has certainly endeavoured in this resolution to cover the full gamut of Sudan's issues, from the incursions by the infamous Lords' Resistance Army from Uganda to the situation in Darfur and the Janjaweed, a militia which is supposedly independent but is essentially armed and financed by the government of Sudan, to the question of South Sudan's recent independent announcement and the long-term problems of this nation. They are all included in this resolution.


Sudan, of course, has multiple issues confronting it. Its under-five mortality is 112 per 1,000 people. Ninety per cent of the nation lives on less than $1 per day and its maternal mortality is infamous, indeed, with 2,000-plus women out of every 100,000 dying in child birth.


Turning to Darfur, there has been a wide variety of estimates of how many have perished in this conflict. The World Health Organisation at one stage quoted 50,000. A British parliamentary inquiry has estimated 300,000, but the Lancet magazine, the famous British medical magazine, in January 2010 said that there was a 95 per cent confidence that the numbers were between 178,000 and 461,000. By any person's estimates, a significant number of people that have perished and, as I said, historically it is the so-called militias. There are issues, of course, between herders and between agriculturalists. There is, of course, an Arab negroid divide within the country, but it is essentially a regime that is excoriated throughout the world. The Bashir regime is, indeed, perpetrating most of these problems. The number of times in which military vehicles have been traceable to the regime and the number of times that armaments have been traced to them is on the public record.


We should also be historically concerned about Russia's continued violation of arms embargoes instituted by the United Nations. That has not helped the situation. There have been the disguised Russian purchased planes—disguised in actual fact as UN planes—that have participated in this conflict.


Historically, the government in the north has instigated an Arab apartheid style process, discriminating very intensely against those people who are essentially of negroid extraction, whether they be animist or Christian or indeed, in some cases, fellow Muslims.


The motion recognises the recent independence of South Sudan, which I think we are all pleased was the outcome of the 2005 Peace Settlement. Throughout the whole period there have been grave doubts that the regime in Khartoum would honour its agreement and, of course, in this last year there have been border conflicts around areas where there are issues as to the population balance, but also issues towards access to resources. It has been positive that a country with Juba as a capital with 8¼ million people has been established. It has been recognised internationally and, as the previous speaker indicated, there has been aid assistance. 


This, of course, is a very complex country. Probably one of my continuing memories is to attend with my colleague the member for Parramatta a riverside theatre event about five years ago with 500 people attending where there were 30-plus dance troops from different Sudanese ethnic groups. I had a little boy sitting next to me, about five years of age, and his mouth was agape. He could not believe the diversity of people from his own land. He could not understand how he could be a Sudanese from a particular tribal group and yet these people are there so different from him. It was far beyond an Albanian looking at an Estonian folkloric group in Europe.


Obviously the country is dealing with issues of illiteracy and poverty. It is a country that has been put together around colonial boundaries and past European conflicts. It has very significant problems, but these are not assisted by the continuing attitudes of the regime in the north, a regime which, as I indicated, is under a number of international bans and which continues to interfere in other parts of the nation.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-08-22,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:43):  Riverina has a large Sudanese community and its members have contributed much to our culture. There were plenty of smiles for independence when the local celebrations of the declaration of South Sudan as the world's newest nation were held in Wagga Wagga on Saturday, 16 July, just a week after independence was officially recognised. In fact, of the many events that I have attended in my first year of parliament, this was one of the most joyous. There was sheer delight, spontaneity and a feeling of togetherness at the function. People from all walks of life joined for an afternoon of music, dance and delicious food at a get together like no other. 


The Sudanese certainly know how to enjoy themselves. There was plenty of colour and movement as the choir comprising Acol Abuk, Apuol Tong, Susan Tong and Grace Wani performed traditional songs and then joined in the dancing. Soon everyone was on their feet, young and old, clapping hands, raising arms, swirling around and getting into the mood and the exuberant spirit. There was much to be happy about. Before the real action began a discourse on Sudan's troubled history was given. To listen made you really appreciate why the people of South Sudan are so gratified, proud and relieved they have achieved independence. 


The Riverina has played an enormous role in multiculturalism in Australia. In fact, Griffith in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area is the cradle of multiculturalism. People from all over the world, from countries where daily conflict and age old civil war is a way of life ended up at Griffith not long after irrigation opened up the area 99 years ago. Today Griffith is the showpiece for Australian multiculturalism. On 26 January this year, 90 flags representing the nations from which Griffiths's people originate flew proudly at the city's Australia Day ceremony. Next year the new ensign for South Sudan will flap proudly in the breeze.


Members of the Riverina's Sudanese community are proud people. They are caring, good people. At the Wagga Wagga independence day commemoration some powerful messages were given about tolerance, community contribution and acceptance. The aspect that I liked most about the day was the involvement of the youngsters. They were included and they showed that the day meant much to them. They are the ones who will bridge the divide between cultures. It is already being done on many levels, not least of which is sport. The Sudanese have already shown their proficiency in football, both soccer and the great game we invented, Australian Rules. Sudanese are a tall people and their speed and height will be assets to Aussie Rules. You certainly cannot deny they have other attributes which contribute to play the code, and I speak of toughness. South Sudan's independence underlines just how tough, how determined and how fiercely committed its people are to change to a better way of life to the future—their future, our future, a shared future, a shared vision.


In the 2007 census there were just 46 Sudanese people included in the Wagga Wagga statistics. That number has grown. One of Wagga Wagga's Sudanese refugees is Constance Okot, who took an active part in the local 16 July festivities. She came to my home town, a place she now, too, calls home after fleeing war-ravaged Sudan. She came to Wagga Wagga to escape a life in which each day was filled with uncertainty, fear and an overwhelming sense of dread. She did not know whether she or those nearest and dearest to her would see through each day or whether they would still be alive tomorrow or the next day. What a dreadful way to live your life!


I will not exaggerate. It has not been an easy transition for Constance and other Sudanese people. It has had its challenges, its upheavals, but Constance is a person of faith, of hope. She wants to try to ensure that refugees assimilate into Australian society. She wants to dispel the public perception that it cannot work. Constance is working hard to improve the image of her fellow refugees locally. She made an appearance on SBS TV's Cutting Edge, which examined the life of refugees when they reach Australia, and she also spoke with Chris Coleman on ABC Riverina Mornings. How does she like Wagga? 'Things are really nice', she said. 'Things are good. Very different to Sudan. First, when I came here it was like a dream. In Wagga, when I wake up every day I'm very happy. I have a lot of friends; a lot of people who are supporting me. Very happy to be in Wagga.' 


On how hard it is to fit into Australian society she said, 'Everybody has a different view or understanding of where to put themselves on where they belong. Everywhere in the world, everywhere you go we can see animals. They're different because they are animals, but you may find when there are new animals, when a sheep is brought in, they will not like that sheep immediately. It is similar for humans. It's normal for human beings. It's up to us to find how to fit in. This is my home. I've decided to be here, to be part of this town or city or whatever.' 


On when she found her family, 'Just like a dream', she said. 'You thought you were the only person remaining in the family, then you find somebody still alive.'

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (11:48):  I want to start by thanking the member for Fremantle for facilitating this discussion by moving what is a very important motion. Although it can sometimes be difficult to keep precisely abreast of the conflict in North and South Sudan and the region, given communication problems in the area, it is clear that escalating violence in the region is continuing to cause an unacceptable growth in mass displacement and appalling rates of death. As we have heard, the situation in southern Kordofan, on the border of North and South Sudan is particularly dire at the moment and has not improved since conflict broke out on 6 June in advance of the scheduled independence of South Sudan on 9 July. Other members have expanded on this matter and I add my support to calls for a ceasefire, which is after all the only path towards sustainable peace and political stability in that state.


I believe that Australia has the unambiguous responsibility to support South Sudan, the world's newest nation, as it establishes itself in the region. We also have a responsibility to do our part in ensuring that the facilitation of peace in the areas abutting South Sudan, including most urgently the southern Kordofan, Dafur and Blue Nile regions of Sudan, is resourced and to that end I cannot emphasise how important it is that the government takes heed of the final calls of the member for Fremantle's motion and provides ongoing and predictable diplomatic and funding resources to address humanitarian development needs in the two countries. 


Despite the distance between the region and Australia, our country can and must do two things. The first has been embraced. I am proud, Mr Deputy Speaker, of the extent to which Australians and local communities helped to facilitate the recent South Sudan independence referendum here in Australia. It is testament to the strength of the South Sudanese Australian communities and to the cooperation of the IOM, humanitarian crisis hub, AusAID, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that over the Christmas and New Year's break last year on the request from my office, an extra $15,000 was secured and logistics arranged with local communities to facilitate the transport of eligible voters from South Australia and Tasmania to Melbourne, given that there were no polling booths in those states. The Yes vote in Melbourne was one of the highest in Australia and we assisted the community in creating and then in helping celebrate those results. I have been proud to report to this house from time to time the ways in which the Sudanese community in my electorate and in Victoria have worked together and drawn energy from what has been an historic campaign for independence. But our attention also needs to turn back to the plight of those for whom violence and unrest is a daily reality and to now concentrate on the second means with which we, as a wealthy and stable democracy, can assist them.


The future stability of Sudan and South Sudan was never going to be guaranteed through the independence vote alone. What is happening in the north and the border areas adjoining it require our attention. We cannot take our eyes off the fact that on 9 July two nations were created. If we are intending to be consistent with our continued support for South Sudan and the referendum process, we must play our part within the international community to take action now while a political process is still possible.


We are also in a position, as part of the international community, to provide aid to the millions of people in Sudan who are facing increasingly high levels of food insecurity right now. I recognise the statements made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in recent times regarding Australia's share of the required aid to Sudan but, noting that Australia will be required to provide appropriate development assistance for years to come and noting that the provision of emergency humanitarian support is now paramount, I urge the government to do all it can to increase its humanitarian support for those displaced by this terrible conflict. 


There is another form of support that we can provide that became apparent to me over the course of the last several years that I have been working in Melbourne with members of the South Sudanese community. Many people have come here from South Sudan seeking to create their life here. As the member for Riverina said, there are many, many people who now want to call Australia their home and lead a peaceful life making a productive contribution to their community. Many of them are getting on with that. It may not often be seen as such from the media reports but that represents the overwhelming majority of desires of South Sudanese living here. 


But there also many who have come to Australia, attracted by its democratic values, who while in Australia have played a very important role in fostering democracy in their home country. I am very pleased that several members of the Melbourne electorate are in fact in South Sudan right now assisting with the creation and establishment of a stable democratic government. I think it is something that, as Australians, we can be extraordinarily proud of that not only can we provide a home and refuge to people but we can also provide a crucible from which democratic values can spread across the world. I put on record the Greens' support for this motion.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (11:49):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion on the independence of South Sudan. It was only fairly recently—this morning—that I was provided with this opportunity, but as someone who represents such great suburbs as Ballajura, Koondoola and Girrawheen, places where a number of those who have come to our great country from South Sudan reside, I do however welcome the opportunity to speak. Across the suburbs of Cowan and particularly in the south of Cowan, as I said we do have a number of those that hail from South Sudan. They came under the humanitarian visa system that was provided by the last federal government and we certainly welcome the contribution they have made. 



At a very good church that is based within Koondoola, the Flaming Evangelical Church, I have had the opportunity to meet those members of the church who are from the south of Sudan. As other speakers have said, they have welcomed the opportunity to come to Australia and take up the freedoms and the opportunities that this country has provided to them. They have made a good contribution. Whilst it has not always been a smooth path for all people who have come from Sudan, as has been said, the vast majority are very good, law-abiding people who have come here wishing to take up those opportunities. 




It is only relatively recently that the times of autonomy within Sudan for the south and now, just in recent weeks, the independence of the south have provided greater hope for the people of Sudan. As we know, the north of Sudan has dominated the country for many years and their system of policies are discriminatory and negative in a lot of ways. But autonomy and now independence have provided the opportunity for the people of South Sudan to flourish. 




We know that it is a fairly subsistence type of  economy, very rural in its nature. But we also know that 80 per cent of the oil reserves of Sudan are based in the south and this, of course, provides a great opportunity for the wealth of the south to make a positive contribution to the future. It is a very positive future that we see for South Sudan. Even the plans to move the capital from Juba into the Lakes State, the more central part of South Sudan, really is the epitome of a country that sees the future as all very positive and so we welcome that.




Although there are some eight million people who live in South Sudan—and barring comments about whether the past censuses have been accurate, or whatever—it does mean that the opportunities to share in this wealth that will be redistributed from the arrangements of the past, where the north basically sucked up all the wealth from the south, so you can see that there will be greater opportunities now in the future. It has also been said in other places that the infant mortality rate of 112 deaths for every 1,000 is far too high. The maternal mortality rate of over 2,000 deaths for every 100,000 live births is just far too high.




But within Cowan, and for those that hail from South Sudan and Sudan in general, those people have decided that their future lies here in Australia. It has always been the case that we welcome them. We welcome the positive contributions that they make. We welcome them in places like Koondoola Primary School where the intensive language school operates very strongly for them. We welcome the positive contributions the Flaming Evangelical Church makes in Koondoola as well. I see a great and positive future for the South Sudanese in Cowan and I see an excellent future for South Sudan, and the government should continue to back them strongly.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (16:04):  I rise to speak on the Legislative Instruments Amendment (Sunsetting) Bill 2011, although I do so relatively briefly because it is one of the administrative bills that we often deal with in this House that has the support of both sides of the parliament. I do not think it requires me to give an enormously long speech. The coalition support this bill in principle, although we note that it is still before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. It is right that the parliament wait to see the results of its report before we finally pass this bill through both houses of parliament. The intention of the proposed amendment seems rational in that legislative instruments will sunset 10 years from the time of their legal commencement. The effect of the current wording of section 50 of the principal act is that instruments with a retrospective commencement date can sunset before that time or can, in some cases, sunset before they are made because they need to operate longer than 10 years into the past. Routine review of legislation will act as a way to ensure that it remains current, clear and relevant. It is important that the status of legislative instruments is easily ascertainable. However, the number of retrospective instruments is not stated in the proposed amendment and there may be a number of instruments which will have their lives significantly extended by this amendment. 


As I said at the beginning, I only wish to speak very briefly on this bill. We are interested in what the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs finds when it inquires into this bill and we reserve our right to make any amendments in the Senate if it were to find something that we believe requires action but, considering that the inquiry is still ongoing, I do commend this bill to the House.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (16:06):  I agree that the Legislative Instruments Amendment (Sunsetting) Bill 2011 is a non-controversial piece of legislation. I can, at least, update members on the progress of the bill through the relevant committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, of which I am a member. Such is the non-controversial nature of this bill that, when it was referred to the committee for examination, no submissions were received on the bill and the committee determined it unnecessary to hold public hearings. The recommendation of the committee was that this bill be passed without amendment and the resolutions of the committee in that regard were unanimous.


Whilst this bill is non-controversial, it deals with a fundamental piece of statutory interpretation and rule-making law, the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. When one considers the nature and frequency by which legislative instruments are utilised in our modern system of parliamentary law making, the need to maintain a robust, unambiguous governing statute becomes clear. Indeed, the very definition of what constitutes a legislative instrument, as defined in section 5 of the act itself, is fundamental. Subject to the operation of a number of other subsections a legislative instrument is defined as an instrument in writing:


(a) that is of a legislative character; and 


(b) that is or was made in the exercise of a power delegated by the Parliament. 


And an instrument is taken to be of a legislative character if: 


(a) it determines the law or alters the content of the law, rather than applying the law in a particular case; and 


(b) it has the direct or indirect effect of affecting a privilege or interest, imposing an obligation, creating a right, or varying or removing an obligation or right.


The operation of this definition in practice, however, is not necessarily straightforward. Case law has explored the test of whether something is judicial or administrative in nature. One of the key consequences of this distinction is that the answer determines the relevant appealable avenues, primarily through either administrative appeal or the disallowance process. 


In the context of the Legislative Instruments Act, 'sunsetting' is usefully defined in the Legislative Instruments Handbook as 'the automatic repeal of a legislative instrument and its amendments after a certain period of operation'. 


I would like to turn to the object of the Legislative Instruments Act, as set out in section 3, namely:


… to provide a comprehensive regime for the management of Commonwealth legislative instruments by: 


(a) establishing the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments as a repository of Commonwealth legislative instruments, explanatory statements and compilations; and 


(b) encouraging rule-makers to undertake appropriate consultation before making legislative instruments; and 


(c) encouraging high standards in the drafting of legislative instruments to promote their legal effectiveness, their clarity and their intelligibility to anticipated users; and 


(d)  improving public access to legislative instruments; and 


(e) establishing improved mechanisms for Parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments; and 


(f) establishing mechanisms to ensure that legislative instruments are periodically reviewed and, if they no longer have a continuing purpose, repealed. 


As stated in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the policy intent of the primary act is that legislative instruments remain in force for 10 years after they are made, but they are subject to review before the end of this period. Hence subsection (f) of the section 3 objects, which I referred to earlier, is arguably the most relevant in this regard in terms of periodical review and repeal where appropriate.


I would like turn briefly to the existing sunsetting provisions in the legislation. The operation of the existing sunsetting provisions are usefully described also in the Legislative Instruments Handbook. Relevantly, the handbook notes the way in which an automatic cessation regime is set out in part 6 of the Legislative Instruments Act. Again consistent with the objects, the handbook notes that the aim of sunsetting is to ensure that legislative instruments are reviewed regularly and retained only if needed and kept up to date. 


I would like to briefly mention some of the main provisions of this bill. As I have noted, the Legislative Instruments Act establishes a comprehensive regime for the registration, tabling, scrutiny and sunsetting of legislative instruments.

Ms ROWLAND:
  The sunsetting regime ensures that legislative instruments are reviewed regularly and kept up to date. The bill makes minor yet important changes to the sunsetting rules as they apply to instruments which commence with retrospective effect. This change will ensure that these instruments have 10 years of operation from the date they are registered on the federal register of legislative instruments before they sunset. Under the current provisions, these instruments can often sunset much earlier than anticipated by the Legislative Instruments Act. The practical effect of this change will be that the calculation of the sunsetting date for legislative instruments which commence retrospectively will begin from their date of registration on the federal register rather than on the day of commencement. Similarly, where some but not all provisions of a legislative instrument commence retrospectively, the sunsetting date for those retrospectively commencing provisions will be calculated from the day of registration rather than commencement.


The changes proposed by the bill do not affect the act's rules about the limited circumstances in which instruments with retrospective operations may be made. As can be seen, these amendments to the Legislative Instruments Act work to make the act much easier to use and increase consistency throughout its operation. So this bill does some very important things through its minor amendments to the Legislative Instruments Act to provide that instruments with retrospective commencement remain in force for 10 years following their registration. I thank the Attorney-General for his work in this area and encourage all members to support this bill. It will give certainty and consistency to the very important advisory role when establishing legislative instruments and their currency.

 (Richmond—Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (16:14):  In summing up, I would like to thank the members for their contributions to the debate. The Legislative Instruments Act (Sunsetting) Bill 2011 is an important bill. It provides for the accountability mechanisms that apply in the making of legislative instruments as well as ensuring that all subordinate legislation is able to be accessed through an online register, the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments. The bill also provides for the eventual sunsetting—that is, automatic ceasing of the legislative instruments. Sunsetting ensures that there is a review of the continuing need for legislative instruments after 10 years of operation. This bill makes a minor and important change to the rules as they apply to instruments which commenced with retrospective effect. The effect of this change will be to allow such instruments to operate for a full 10 years before they sunset. This is consistent with the intended operation of the sunsetting provisions of the bill.


I note that the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs has prepared an advisory report on this bill. The report did not identify any issues in relation to the bill and recommends unanimously that it be passed by the House without amendment.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:16):  I would like to contribute to statements on this matter moved by the Prime Minister last week on Vietnam Veterans Day. In doing so, I mention the wonderful service held in the electorate of Casey on Sunday prior to Vietnam Veterans Day, Sunday, 14 August. It was a service organised and hosted by the Yarra Valley Vietnam Veterans Day Combined Service Committee. It is an initiative of the Vietnam veterans community, the Outer Eastern Sub-Branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association, many of the local RSLs within the Yarra Valley in outer eastern Melbourne, including Healesville, Lilydale, Upper Yarra, Warburton and Yarra Glen, and the National Serviceman's Association. I know the Croydon RSL were also represented at the service, which was held in the Lilydale main street on Sunday morning.


I pay tribute to the members of those RSLs who were there. I want to pay tribute to those Vietnam veterans from each of those RSLs and from surrounding areas who came to that service. The service was larger than in previous years. I make mention of that because I think it is the hope of all of us in this House that the importance of this day continues to grow. Vietnam Veterans Day is a time to reflect on so many matters associated with that long conflict. 


I have spoken on a number of occasions before in the House about some of those issues. I particularly reflect, as many members would, on the issues surrounding the Battle of Long Tan and the failure to award medals and appropriate citations after that battle. I do so having known one of the great heroes of the Battle of Long Tan, Cliff Dohle, now deceased, who was a helicopter pilot in that battle. I know the parliamentary secretary at the table is very familiar with the details of the battle and with the story of Cliff Dohle, who passed away a short while back. He performed a pivotal role on the day. Cliff and his wife retired to the Yarra Valley. Getting to know Cliff by meeting him in my electorate office and hearing those stories firsthand is something I have spoken about before. It is only natural that on each Vietnam Veterans Day I think of Cliff and reflect on the Battle of Long Tan.


It is also a time to candidly reflect on how we as a nation treated returning Vietnam servicemen. Former Prime Minister John Howard told the parliament back in 2006 that the entire Australian community failed the servicemen when they returned from Vietnam. All of us know that that is right; that some of those servicemen returning from Vietnam were treated disgracefully and appallingly. 


As we celebrate Vietnam Veterans Day, it is a time to remember their contribution and those who lost their lives, and to think of those men who are now taking leadership roles in our RSLs. It is a time to reflect on the past, but equally a time to look to the future. I know that both sides of the House will agree that they are performing leadership roles at so many levels within local RSLs as, with the effluxion of time, we wave goodbye to so many of the World War II and Korean War generation. 


Some progress has been made on the issue of the Long Tan medals; I would really like to acknowledge that to the House. It was a difficult issue to try to address many years after that conflict. On Vietnam Veterans Day, we remember all those who served in the Vietnam War and the more than 500 who lost their lives in that conflict. We say thanks as a nation for their contribution. We say 'well done' for the contribution that many continue to make in leadership roles within local RSL clubs.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and Minister for Indigenous Health) (16:23):  It is a great honour to speak in this debate. I thank the member for Casey for his fine remarks and his recognition and acknowledgement of the importance of Long Tan Day, and more generally the importance of recognising the contribution of our Vietnam veterans to the Australian nation. 


It is hard for us to understand that over a decade 60,000 Australian men served in Vietnam and of those, sadly, 521 were killed in action or died as a result of their wounds, and over 3,000 were wounded. It is very difficult for those of us who sit in a place like this and who have never worn an Australian uniform—whether it is Air Force, Army or Navy—to understand or appreciate what that actually means. Yes, the war in Vietnam was an unpopular war and, yes, almost half of the Australian men serving there were national servicemen, many of whom did not elect to go. But they went and they went to carry out government policy. This was a choice of government and government, as we know, is the voice of the people. Although we might not understand or even be able to imagine the horror of this conflict, our forebears in this place bear the responsibility for having sent these men to war, so we wear that responsibility. We have to understand and appreciate what actually happened and the depth of sorrow and anguish that results from decisions to send people to war and to see and to know what the long-term implications are of an effort such as this where we lose 521 brave men.


Last Thursday I attended the national Vietnam veterans commemorative service held here at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on Anzac Parade at which the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition were both present. The Prime Minister gave what I thought was a very fine speech. It was a cold wintery morning, very unlike anything that would have been experienced in Vietnam, but many came to pay their respects to the fallen and remember and pay tribute to the service of so many of our fellow Australians.


As we know, it was 45 years ago to the day that soldiers of Delta Company 6RAR held fast against a large enemy force in the battle of Long Tan. This battle on 18 August was one of the most significant engagements by the Australian forces during the war. There were others. But the importance of this bloody engagement cannot be underestimated—108 Australian and New Zealand soldiers fought a pitched battle against an estimated 2,000 determined North Vietnamese and Vietcong enemy at a rubber plantation near Long Tan. On this terrible day 18 Australians were killed, the most killed in any one engagement of the war in Vietnam.


To recognise their extraordinary gallantry in action, veterans of Delta Company were presented with the unit citation of gallantry by the Governor-General, Her Excellency Mrs Quentin Bryce. The special parade was at Gallipoli Barracks Enoggera in Brisbane on Thursday afternoon. I was honoured and privileged to be in attendance. The veterans there were hosted by the current 6RAR who themselves have only just recently returned from Afghanistan as Mentoring Task Force 1, MTF1. MTF1 was also presented with meritorious unit citation for outstanding service in warlike operations on Operation Slipper in Oruzgan Province in Afghanistan between 20 January and 30 October 2010. It was indeed a proud and very special moment for all involved to see the younger veterans and our Vietnam veterans together on parade and receiving recognition together for their service.


Australian service in Vietnam spanned over 10 years and we pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of Australian service personnel during that entire period. These battles in Vietnam were difficult battles. They were close pitched and intense, fought in difficult conditions. Our service personnel fought in the Anzac spirit, with great courage, conviction and valour. 


It is worthwhile pointing out that a number of years ago we still had four MIAs in Vietnam. We have discovered where those MIAs have been. We have recovered their remains and we have brought them home. So their final resting place is in the holy soil of Australia, their home. Sadly though, as we well know, in times past as a nation we have not recognised the service of our veterans from this war as we should have. Vietnam Veterans Day provides the nation with an opportunity to pause and reflect, to remember the service of our Vietnam veterans and pay tribute to those gone before, and to learn from our past so that we may better look after our ADF personnel of today and the future. This is not the time to talk about what we need to do for our current serving personnel but we need to do more.


I am a child of this generation when the war was deeply unpopular here at home. I knew people who were conscientious objectors. I knew people who were national servicemen who went to war. I knew people who were injured by that war, either mentally or physically. Sadly, as they get older, sometimes their difficulties increase. We have yet to come to terms and really understand the depth of hurt which many of these men carry with them today and appreciate what that means for us. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and I am sure as with previous ministers for veterans' affairs, I speak on behalf of the nation when I say to these veterans that, despite your experiences of the past, we are absolutely committed to providing the best we possibly can for your welfare and for your health and that of your families as you get older.


We know that in this country we are living longer and for the many people with challenges that remain, with demons which they cannot expunge, we will work with them to help them get on top of them—and we will. We will continue to do what others have done before. But the message here is very clear to us: as I said at the outset, we in this place bear a special responsibility. It is governments that send people to war. We wear a special responsibility towards our past veterans and today's veterans. We cannot do as was done in the past and ignore their pleas and ignore their needs. We need to accommodate them and work with them to satisfy them. I am committed to doing that.


This day last week was a special day for Australian veterans who served in that war, and for their families. For so many, the families are the ones who bore the burden of the hurt and many still do. We have a special obligation to defence force men and women and their families. Whatever their service, we need to continue to diligently apply ourselves to making sure that they get the very best we can offer.

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson) (16:33):  With parliament sitting last week, regrettably many of us were unable to attend services in our own electorates. Nonetheless, it should be recorded in this place that, particularly in an electorate like Dickson, we have a vibrant veterans community and they are people who stand very proud for their service, for the loss and sacrifice that they and many of their friends have endured over the course of their service. We salute their service, not just here but right around the country at those ceremonies last week.


The 18th of August this year marked the 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. With all such anniversaries there has to be a lot of reflection but even more so on this 45th anniversary of the gallantry of those who fought in the historic Battle of Long Tan in the Vietnam War. It was a battle which was recognised by the presentation of the Australian Unit Citation for Gallantry by the Governor-General, Quentin Bryce, to the survivors of D Company 6 RAR at Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, Brisbane, home of the 6th Battalion of the RAR. I understand that was a very moving ceremony. All of us have over the years heard different stories from veterans in our community about their recollections passed down to them, about the Battle of Long Tan. The youngest Australian to die in that battle was just 19 and the oldest was only 22 and, as I understand, from listening to somebody recently, over half of those killed were Queensland national servicemen. They are men whose bravery will never be forgotten.


On Anzac Avenue in my electorate, at the aptly named Nui Dat bus stop, there is Vietnam Veterans Place, a quiet oasis of reflection on a busy thoroughfare. This memorial was conceived and created by Vietnam veterans in conjunction with the Pine Rivers Shire Council, local businesses and local tradesmen. It includes a flag station, gardens and a brick walkway that includes bricks stamped with the titles of every Australian unit to serve in Vietnam and is a suitable place to contemplate and remember the sacrifices of those who served in Vietnam who are no longer with us.


There are 17 branches of the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia in Queensland, and one of those, the Brisbane North division, has its headquarters at Black Duck Cottage, at Kallangur in my electorate. With the number of very active RSL sub-branches in Dickson—namely Bray Park-Strathpine,Samford,Dayboro and Pine Rivers district—it is not surprising to note that the Vietnam Veterans Association, which draws from all arms of Defence, has a membership growing from strength to strength, year to year, and has a current membership of 168, all there to uphold their motto, 'Honour the dead but fight like hell for the living'. This Brisbane North branch of the VVAA was formed in around 1982, one of the earliest sub-branches after the Vietnam Veterans Action Group was formed in NSW in 1978. The Brisbane North executive: Peter Thorn, president; Len Halford, senior vice-president; John Barrett, junior vice-president; and Peter Farrelly, treasurer and secretary are to be commended for their work in looking after the welfare of veterans and their families, with the assistance of committee members Gus Fraser, Jim Shaw, Gordon Johnson, Raymond Royston and Fred Ellingworth, among many others. Needless to say, there is also of course a social committee made up of those mentioned above. The dedication of those who are part of the association is enduring, as can be seen in the case of John Smith OAM, who joined the Brisbane North branch in August 1992 and has served as the sub-branch president and vice-president, state president and vice-president and who is now the national vice-president and state delegate to national council.


These are all people of considerable talent and they have all in their own ways made considerable sacrifices. Not only have they made a sacrifice; their families have of course made significant sacrifices as well. At the memorial service at Black Duck Cottage last Thursday morning, Mr Farrelly was the guest speaker. I was given a copy of his speech. I found it quite moving and I want to contribute a little of his speech as part of this debate today. I want to quote him to allow the House to gain an understanding of the quality of the speech that he presented and also the message that he wanted to deliver. The speech reads as follows:


Australian military troops served in the Vietnam War from 1962 through to 1975. It was the longest conflict that Australian servicemen and women fought and served in during our military's short history. It is without doubt also one of the most controversial of wars that any country served, and divided a nation that led to riots and divisions that remain today. It has left a lasting legacy that will take several generations to finally put this part of Australia's history to rest, and during this time it continues to provoke arguments that rekindle and revise the merits of this conflict.


During this period 521 Australian servicemen were killed in Vietnam. In excess of 3,000 servicemen were wounded, whilst some 60,000 military personnel served. Many of these doing two and sometimes three tours of duty. To be able to put troops into the country and to keep our numbers up to the required quota, National Service was made compulsory for young Australians. Any male aged between 17 to 21 and born during a certain month were balloted. National Service evoked controversy from all sides of politics and civilian life and ultimately led to some of the most violent clashes between rioters and police this country has ever seen.


Australia has since recovered all of its war KIA's in operations that defy the massive procedures undertaken to achieve this remarkable feat. Using old memories, maps, co-ordinates given during battle and the ever changing landscape a few dedicated Australian people have painstakingly traced and tracked our war dead and ceremonially returned their remains to their Australian families.


These people continue their work in Vietnam but now assist in the search for the remains of South Vietnamese and North Vietnamese servicemen who died and were buried in the field. At the war's height more than 500,000 American servicemen were in country, where their losses exceeded 60,000.


Peter's speech goes on:


As Australian troops began the main withdrawal in September 1971, those who had returned home earlier found themselves ostracised by friends, the RSL, and even the military which had sent them there in the first place. There was no support from the military; the RSL did not want to know us, and in some instances families did not welcome them home. Increasingly ex-serving soldiers became loners, and sought refuge with other like-minded veterans where they could relate to each other without fear or condemnation. From this the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia was formed which united the veterans and unified them into a cohesive and powerful veteran voice. They remain the choice of many service organisations today.


The speech went on for a little bit beyond that in most eloquent words and closed in this way:


Today is Vietnam Veterans Day and the 45th anniversary of the battle of Long Tan. A day when Australians remember all those servicemen and servicewomen who served, suffered and died. A day to reflect and commemorate not only fellow Australians but our American and New Zealand comrades in arms and a time to reflect on the misery of the South Vietnamese people that this war ultimately inflicted. To those servicemen and servicewomen who perished in South Vietnam and to those veterans who have since passed, rest in peace my friends. We do remember you all. Lest we forget.


They are powerful words; they are words that speak very strongly for a generation of families who were disproportionately affected by what was a terrible war. It is not a pretty picture of our history, and the way in which people were ultimately treated for their presence in Vietnam, both at the time of their engagement and on return from their engagement, shone an even poorer light on the behaviour of some in this country.


As I said in my opening remarks, we have a very strong local veterans community. Over the course of the last 10 years I have made it my business to befriend and support wherever I can many of the veterans in our local community. I know that in the area of Kallangur, which is on the border of the electorate of Longman, Wyatt Roy has embarked on a similar process. We want to continue to help and assist those veterans and those families who still suffer many of those wounds, particularly mentally, today. We want to make sure that we continue to provide support wherever possible to those families and to the generations that follow, 'where the pain is still felt most surely,' as Peter mentioned in his speech. I close with the mission statement of the Vietnam Veterans Association, which is: 'To assist all veterans, dependants and their descendants in all matters relating to their health, welfare and wellbeing'. We can all be proud of their ongoing service. To the veterans in the Dickson community, I say thank you.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond—Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (16:43):  I am pleased to speak on the Prime Minister's statement on Vietnam Veterans Day. Last Thursday, 18 August, our nation recognised and honoured the veterans of the Vietnam War. Really, Vietnam Veterans Day is a day for all Australians to pay tribute to those who served in the Vietnam War. The day is commemorated each year on the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, one of the most significant Australian actions of the Vietnam War. This year marked the 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. This battle occurred on 18 August 1966 and during this battle 18 Australians were killed—the most killed in any one engagement of the Vietnam War—and 24 were wounded. In the years since it was fought, many people have said the battle has achieved a symbolic significance for the Australian military in the Vietnam War which is similar to that of other battles Australians remember, such as the Gallipoli campaign, the Kokoda Track and the Battle of Kapyong. Indeed, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War remains the longest in duration of any war in Australia's history. It lasted from August 1962 until May 1975. Although the Australian commitment was predominantly Army personnel, there were also significant numbers of civilians as well as Air Force and Navy personnel. According to the Nominal Roll of Vietnam Veterans, almost 60,000 Australians served in Vietnam and 521 Australians died as a result of the war, with over 3,000 wounded. Of the 521 Australian who died in the war, 496 were Australian Army personnel, 17 were RAAF personnel and eight were RAN personnel. The involvement of Australian forces in Vietnam was a gradual escalation, taking place over many years, and our forces battled against extremes of terrain and climate, through dense jungle and monsoonal conditions. They faced a very well-organised force. 


We must never forget the service and sacrifice of those very brave Australians; they fought with such great courage and valour in the face of adversity. As many speakers have commented on today, when those Australian troops came home from Vietnam they returned to a nation that was really divided in its view of the war and, mostly, they were not welcomed home by a grateful nation in the same way as troops returning home from World War I or World War II were welcomed before them. For many of the surviving Vietnam veterans, time has not always healed the physical and psychological scars that resulted from their service, and often their families share this physical and emotional burden. It is important to acknowledge that the aftermath of war has been difficult to deal with, and we should recognise the contribution that veterans' families also have made. That is just as vitally important. In acknowledging the very difficult time that many of our veterans had when they came home, it is important to realise, too, that the veterans of the Vietnam War did not receive an official welcome home parade until 1987. That was a significant period of time later and was an issue, understandably, for many of those veterans. It is for this reason, and of course for so many other reasons, that on 18 August each year Australia as a nation recognises, remembers and honours the veterans of the Vietnam War. 


My electorate of Richmond has one of the largest numbers of veterans throughout the nation. It has been my honour to meet and work with many of them over the years and to see their great commitment in so many ways. I note that many of them are veterans of the Vietnam War. As other speakers have mentioned, with parliament sitting last week, many of us were not able to attend local events. One of my staff members, Jodie Bellchambers, attended the event of a Vietnam veterans group in my electorate and she laid a wreath on behalf of the Commonwealth. Peter Crockett, a veteran, a lovely man whom we all refer to as 'Davy' Crockett, has organised this event for many years. It is held at South Tweed Sports club, which has supported the veterans group. The club has a lovely memorial garden, and the service is held there every year. I certainly would like to commend Davy for organising this very important event. I know there are many events locally and throughout the nation. It is important that we continue to have those events so that we can take the time to remember the service and sacrifice of all Vietnam veterans. 


I would also like to note that the Governor-General marked the day last week on behalf of the nation with the presentation of a unit citation to Delta Company, 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, at Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera in Queensland. The unit citation recognises acts of extraordinary gallantry in action by Delta Company during the Battle of Long Tan. 


In concluding today, I would like to quote from Paul Keating's speech at the funeral service of the Unknown Australian Soldier on 11 November, 1993. The Unknown Australian Soldier was a casualty of the First World War, but I believe the sentiments translate to all our veterans from all wars, who have made such sacrifices in the defence of our nation.


For out of the war came a lesson which transcended the horror and tragedy and the inexcusable folly. It was a lesson about ordinary people – and the lesson was that they were not ordinary. On all sides they were the heroes of that war; not the generals and the politicians but the soldiers and sailors and nurses – those who taught us to endure hardship, to show courage, to be bold as well as resilient, to believe in ourselves, to stick together.


The Unknown Australian Soldier whom we are interring today was one of those who, by his deeds, proved that real nobility and grandeur belongs, not to empires and nations, but to the people on whom they, in the last resort, always depend.


Lest we forget.

Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (16:50):  It is a privilege to rise and contribute to the debate. I want to endorse the comments made by my colleagues who have spoken before me. I want to acknowledge Vietnam Veterans Day. The Vietnam War has relevance in terms of my own life experiences as I am of that vintage. As young men and women, we grew up at a time when Australia was committing to the Vietnam War and to the conflict there. We know of some of the events that occurred over a period of time but the footage we saw on television for the first time covered the conflict from its beginning to its end. From those images, we had a sense of some of the challenges that Australian service men and women were experiencing.


Over 60,000 Australians served in the Vietnam conflict. Sadly, 521 paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country and its interests. Some 47,000 Vietnam veterans are alive today and it is for them, their fallen comrades and the families affected that we remember them specifically every year. There are many Vietnam veterans in Hasluck. I often believe that, as members of parliament, we have an incredible privilege in meeting, working and talking with the service men and women who served in many fronts and in many campaigns on behalf of this country. Service men and women when called do not ask; they serve. I have had the privilege and honour to meet with some of these men in my first year in office. The pride with which they acknowledge their service, the regret they express at the loss of life and the frustration of their treatment on returning home from Vietnam makes me truly humble. The pictorial representations that were so strong in those days have etched in my memory the way we treated some of our servicemen returning home from that conflict.


Vietnam Veterans Day is an important occasion but one made even more poignant this year on the 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. In 1966, 18 young Australians died and 24 were wounded in what would become the stuff of legend. I remember the headlines in the local papers that were common in Perth at that time. I particularly remember a cartoon—and I am sure it was drawn by Paul Rigby—that showed Aussie diggers surrounded, at the end of a campaign just leaning there quietly reflecting on the fact that some comrades had fallen but also looking at the insurmountable numbers that had charged during that campaign. 


Keen to inflict a politically unacceptable number of casualties on the Australian forces, the North Vietnamese Army and the Vietcong planned an ambush of the Australian troops in the rubber plantation area of Long Tan. I will not repeat the details of this well-known battle here today, but the men of D Company, 6th Royal Australian Regiment, the first APC squadron and a section of the New Zealand artillery defeated a numerically superior force, numbering in the thousands. In the pursuing battle, over 24 hours, the Australian courage and fighting spirit was shown to the world. 


Most of these men were not regular soldiers. Many of us of a certain age will remember the controversy surrounding conscription and the drafting of Australia's young men into the armed forces. At Long Tan, conscripts faced off against some of North Vietnam's toughest soldiers and they held themselves and their country in high regard. As a result, a long overdue Unit Citation for Gallantry was awarded last week to D Company of the 6RAR. I honour their courage and am pleased that this nation finally recognises the true sacrifice our armed forces made in this decade-long conflict, which shaped the sixties and the seventies. I have friends who served in the Vietnam War and each one has a different story to tell of their service. Some received devastating physical wounds, but all of them were wounded emotionally and mentally in some capacity. It has taken Australian society a long time to understand and acknowledge issues such as post traumatic stress disorder and the impact they have on returning soldiers and their families. I would like to think that we have learnt from these lessons and are prepared for our troops returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan. But more needs to be done.


I held a recent forum with the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator Michael Ronaldson. Veterans from the conflicts of World War II, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Iraq and Afghanistan came together to talk about their issues. The recurring theme was one of helplessness that our Vietnam veterans felt on return, especially for those who were physically incapacitated as a result of their service, and the impact that that has had on the quality of life. It was very interesting listening to the stories that they shared with us of both their pride of having served their country and the frustration they have for what they termed a 'continuing war', whilst retaining recognition for the rights and entitlements that they were seeking for both the physical, emotional and mental impact that that war had. Certainly, their shared stories brought back to me memories of three people in particular: Peter Keilor, who comes from the town of Corrigin; and two brothers, Peter and David Stone, who are twins, who also served in Vietnam. All three, as I remember them, went away as strong young men. They returned, but Peter lost his limbs, having stood on a mine. David and Peter shared some of their stories but never shared the detail, but certainly indicated their pride in having served.


I would like to thank Senator Michael Ronaldson and the shadow minister for defence, Senator David Johnston, for making it such an informative day for all those who attended, especially those veterans who were in attendance. I am sure that we are all proud of these men because they, as service men and women, fought to ensure that the freedoms we have and we will always enjoy are endured long into the future. 


I am equally as proud of the Returned and Services Leagues that call Hasluck home. The Gosnells RSL is a very vibrant group of returned servicemen. The Bellevue RSL and the Kalamunda RSL all represent their members well. I enjoy the camaraderie of the discussions that I have with them on issues that they raise. Issues about ex-Vietnamese servicemen now dominate their agenda, and the coalition continues to work hard to shape appropriate policy in this area. 


Earlier this year I held a Saluting Their Service ceremony in my electoral office. I was fortunate enough to be able to present several Vietnam War veterans with a certificate acknowledging their efforts in this brutal conflict. What was really warming, and it quite touched me and my staff, was not just sitting there, listening to them as veterans swapped their stories, their experiences about the challenges that they still grapple with but being able to contribute to that discussion. They were all men of different ages, from different conflicts, with different experiences but, from their perspective, they were all Australians who served their country. 


Once again, I want to acknowledge the 60,000 service personnel who served in Vietnam and sacrificed so much in the name of this great country. Our armed forces do not choose where they fight, but they fight when called upon and they must always be honoured and respected. It is the foundation upon which this nation was built. I want to acknowledge their contribution and ask that we never forget what they have given us. Thank you, Deputy Speaker.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (16:59):  It is an honour to speak on this issue today and it is a day when we recall not just the events of this very significant battle in the Vietnam War but commemorate the entire service of our men and women in the Vietnam War. It is in that spirit that I would like to draw attention to the range of experiences of the people who served in and survived that conflict. Those who came back injured, of course, are often forgotten among the stories of the casualties who did not come back, those who were killed in action. But those who did come back suffered horrendously in relation to the disabilities they acquired. In that conflict so many more survived to live on than in previous conflicts because the battlefield service of our medical services was so good in Vietnam. But they lived with horrendous injuries nevertheless. In fact I was recruited by Brigadier Billy Rolfe, who lost both legs in Vietnam and still went on to make a great deal of his life afterwards. He became a brigadier in the Army, he was a well-known rugby fanatic who coached teams, and he went on and got himself a law degree as well. He was typical of that spirit, the veteran who was not going to be defeated by such horrendous injuries. Quite often in the past those injuries would have led to death in the battlefield, but so many Vietnam veterans did come home to fight that battle.


For those who did not come back to the Army there was a real problem. They went back to a community that, in large degree, either ignored or vilified them. There was either apathy or actual aggression. Both sides of politics let these veterans down. For them it was particularly tough. To endure the things that they had had to endure and to perform their duty in the way they had had to perform it and then not to have support from their community was particularly psychologically devastating. I think we have all learned the lessons of that period. In the case of veterans who now return from conflicts such as Iraq, where there was also controversy, everyone across the spectrum has learned that you do not take out these issues on the veterans. It is the political masters who have to answer for making such decisions.


I think those who came back and stayed in the Army had an easier time because they were respected and admired within the Army for their service and for what they had accomplished. The Army that I joined—in terms of the key ingredients, the key bones and sinews and intellect that drove our organisation during my early service—was shaped and driven and influenced by that core of Vietnam veterans that fleshed out the entire organisation. I benefited enormously from the training that I received from those veterans. The training that they provided me helped me survive through the deployments that I went on to serve in, but the whole organisation benefited. The received wisdom that was passed down through the generations that have served since is still there in our Army and it has enabled us to serve well in similarly complex operational environments—these counterinsurgency environments. When we went to Somalia with the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, the very first thing Lieutenant General David Hurley, who is now our Chief of the Defence Force, said was, 'Well, this looks to me like a counterinsurgency type of environment.' And he went on to apply all of those intuitive things that he had learned at the hands of the Vietnam veterans who had trained us. I pay tribute to all of them who put me through the mill at Battle Wing in Land Warfare Centre, Canungra, where of course most of those Vietnam veterans also did their predeployment training to go to Vietnam.


So I think they coped better when they were in the Army, in an organisation that valued their service. But then there were the families of those who came back who did not have that support. The families certainly endured a great deal in living with veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and we should really acknowledge all that they went through over the many years that they had to cope with those psychological issues and other, physical, issues that their family members came back with. Their support for their people and their sacrifice on behalf of this nation as well, not only for those who lost their lives but for those they had to support, is certainly something that we should acknowledge as well as part of the commemoration of this day. We do need to have a better understanding of the day itself. It took a long time before we really appreciated the full strategic and tactical importance of this battle. Delta Company, only a company-strength unit, took on two manoeuvre units of the enemy—the Vietcong 275th Regiment, which itself was composed largely of regulars from the north and the famous, or infamous, D445 battalion of local force Vietcong. So two large manoeuvre units confronted a subunit, the Delta Company, of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. As has been pointed out, they were vastly outnumbered. One thing that strikes you as you read about this battle, or if you see the transcripts or hear the recordings of the radio telephone traffic that took place during the battle, is that you really appreciate the professionalism of these soldiers. Through the incredible stress of what was going on, they maintained their discipline and their professionalism in directing the fire support that they received was first class, and was what actually saved the members of the unit who were able to survive the battle. 


In that respect, I pay tribute today particularly to the New Zealanders who supported our troops—the 161 Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery—and to the service that Captain Morrie Stanley rendered that day. Morrie, unfortunately, passed away on 16 September last year. He was a tremendous professional but also a really fine man. He had tremendous empathy for the soldiers whom he was trying to support. You can see that if you watch the very fine documentary that the Foxtel company produced on this battle. I am so glad that we have that oral history of Morrie, since he left us last year. It was a poignant moment for other veterans of the battle who were able to see him in hospital and hand over to him the decorations that we were able to obtain in recognition of what this battle actually meant. 


This battle for appropriate recognition was a long-fought battle, particularly by Harry Smith, on behalf of his soldiers over many years. It was only recently that we understood that the efforts of Delta Company in fact saved the 1st Australian Task Force, which at that time was still establishing itself. This was a concerted effort by the enemy to annihilate the task force. Not only did Delta Company and the supporting elements achieve the success that they did and defeat that objective; also, through the overwhelming casualties that were caused to the enemy, they really devastated them to the extent that they were not able to mount such an effort ever again in Phuoc Tuy province. As a result, we were able to contribute to other efforts elsewhere.


This battle for appropriate recognition is something that is a bit of a shame on this country. I am so pleased that we were finally able to bring that to conclusion. Certainly, we know that the quota system, the system that applied at the time, really denied some of the key players of that battle the recognition that they deserved, such as Harry Smith whose award recommendation was downgraded. So we were able to give him the Star of Gallantry and, similarly, second lieutenants Geoff Kendall and Dave Sabben had their decorations upgraded to the Medal of Gallantry. Subsequent to that, we established the Honours and Awards Tribunal, which looked after a few other unfinished business elements of the battle, such as in relation to Cliff Dohle, one of the Iroquois pilots awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his efforts, and of course the overall awarding of the Unit Citation for Gallantry to Delta Company. They were of course, back in 1968, acknowledged by President Johnson with the Presidential Unit Citation, which I know the unit wears with pride.


An element of controversy was the South Vietnamese intention towards Delta Company. I was able to get together with Paul Ham, the Vietnam War historian, to get to the bottom of this issue. We were able to uncover diplomatic traffic that clearly indicated that it had been the intention of the South Vietnamese government to award the Cross of Gallantry with Palm Unit Citation to that unit. At the time the Australian government rejected that offer and instead members of the unit were given dolls by the Vietnamese, which as you will appreciate did not quite reflect the significance of their efforts. So we were able to clarify that and the members of the unit were awarded that Cross of Gallantry with Palm Unit Citation as well. We have managed to clear up a lot of unfinished business from the years when this was a running sore for people like Harry Smith. I know Harry was not able to get to the award ceremony on 18 August that the Governor-General attended, but Harry has been acknowledged by all his soldiers for the massive effort that he has put in over the years on their behalf. Harry, we really salute you.


It has been a real privilege for me to have known and had many conversations with Harry, as it has been for me to have known so many of the veterans of this battle—guys like Bob Buick, who I spoke to on the phone only a few days ago. I met many of them at the famous Sporties Bar at 6RAR when I was playing rugby for 6RAR. We won the premiership and these veterans would always turn up to Sporties and share their stories with us—a great bunch of blokes; fantastic people. 


Probably the most poignant and satisfying moment of my time in politics has been the mission to Vietnam that we went on to bring back the remains of Michael Herbert and Robert Carver, the last two of our service people missing in action in Vietnam, members of No. 2 Squadron, Magpie squadron, flying Canberra bombers. I went over there with a good friend, Alan Curr, who served with both of them, and with me in Timor. It was an incredibly emotional experience travelling over there with the families and veterans of the unit to bring our last two back. In effect, it is mission accomplished, in that we did not leave anybody behind.


At the same time, dealing with the Vietnamese authorities really brought a lot of issues home to us. They were so welcoming, generous and warm hearted in how they received us and the families. It was a tremendous experience, but the poignancy of it was emphasised by the fact that they still have 300,000 of their own missing in action from that war. It is a great source of pride to me that today Australians are assisting the Vietnamese to locate those who are missing in action in battlefields that we served on, and that we have the records and the technical capability to assist them. This is one of the things that is forming a wonderful bond between our two countries now. Something beautiful has actually grown from this horrendous experience. Thousands of Australian students travel to Vietnam, and many Australian tourists as well, and many Vietnamese come to learn and study in Australia. So a wonderful bond and thread has grown up—and also amongst the veterans of both sides in the dealings they have with each other.


Obviously, how we address the situation with the mental health issues that they face is something we have been trying to move on with. I am very pleased that we have had the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training program, which we have put $1 million towards, and that we have introduced the comprehensive mental health 'lifecycle' package. This fell out of the improve mental health studies that we instituted, and $92 million has been allocated for the implementation of both those studies. These are some of the things that need to be done to respond to the issues that emerge from these conflicts, and a lot more is still necessary.


I will finish by talking about the importance of maintaining the lessons from that war. All of my career has been basically in a counterinsurgency style environment, and all of those lessons that were taught to us by those Vietnam veterans remain relevant today. I am really pleased that finally we have managed to institutionalise that cultural and historical experience by now creating the Asia Pacific Civil-Military Centre of Excellence, which is based out at Queanbeyan. This takes the lessons that we need to learn from counterinsurgency and emphasises that the types of environments and conflicts we are facing in Afghanistan are not just military. They are social, economic and political issues and they all have to be addressed at the same time and meshed with a cohesive strategy.


Having recently spent a week on the ground in Afghanistan, I am delighted to see the impact of that strategy. That reorientation of our approach is really starting to take effect marvellously on the ground in Oruzgan Province, which is recognised by the other contingents in Afghanistan and by the Regional Commander South, who has emphasised that Oruzgan is the model that others should emulate if they are to achieve success in Afghanistan. So the spirit, the experience and the service of these veterans from Vietnam lives on in what our troops today are doing on the ground in Afghanistan. I salute what they gave to me and what they gave to the country. It is a proud tradition, a proud record and a proud experience which we should continue to honour in every way possible.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2011-08-22,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (17:15):  It is an honour to speak in this debate today and to acknowledge the 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. The date of 18 August should burn in all our psyches for lots of reasons. Looking back over Australia's military history, there have been great battles like Gallipoli in the First World War, and in the Second World War we talk about the Battle of Britain, El Alamein, Tobruk, the Kokoda Track and Milne Bay. When you get closer to home there is the Battle of Kapyong in Korea and there is Long Tan.


As the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Dr Kelly, just said, the Vietnam War left a lot of scars. Today is not the day to apportion blame to individual groups or political parties but, rather, to recognise that there was unacceptable conduct in our nation by some of our own people, who treated the Vietnam veterans abysmally when they returned from that conflict. Some of the veterans have told me that shortly after they got home they were advised by the military to get into civvies and not go out in their uniform—these fellows were not quite discharged, but they were back in Australia—for fear they would be abused and spat on. That really is a dreadful indictment on all of us. I put myself in that category. It was against that backdrop that those who fought in Vietnam, particularly those who fought in some of the seminal battles, like Firebase Coral and Long Tan, were never properly recognised. In fact, in the case of Harry Smith, Dave Sabben and Geoff Kendall—whom the parliamentary secretary just spoke about—their honours, recommended at the Battle of Long Tan, were actually downgraded. What a disgrace; what an utter disgrace. 


The 45th anniversary was an opportunity to put that right. We have not been really good at acknowledging some of our heroes, and it is good that we now have a tribunal looking into the cases of people—even of people from the Second World War, like Teddy Sheean. Just imagine that young man going down and firing his machine gun as the waves came up around him! He would not leave his post. It is the stuff of legend. We recently celebrated the death of the White Mouse and her contribution to the war effort. She was the most decorated woman of the Second World War. She was one of ours, but it took us 60 years to acknowledge her effort. The 45th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan was a time to put some of the ghosts to rest, to put some of our bad attitudes away and to recognise the Battle of Long Tan for what it was. 


I had the honour of being paired with Minister Warren Snowdon and going to Brisbane to see the parade. And what a moving ceremony that was: the whole 6RQR on parade at Enoggera Barracks; the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Morrison; the Governor-General; and, most particularly, of those who served at Long Tan there were over 80 soldiers, and widows. When you allow for the 108 who were there and the headquarters people, there were probably 120 in all—Harry Smith says probably about 120—and 80 of them could be there on that day to see the unit honoured. What a phenomenal day it was. The drill was impeccable, the music was perfect and the overlay was these 80 veterans. They have this ceremony where the troops march in open order through the ranks of the serving troops, and seeing them marching through the ranks brought the crowd to its feet with applause.


The other thing that struck us was that the Governor-General placed a wreath on the cross. We have different memorials for different activities in our history. If you go around Australia you will find that most of the memorials to the Battle of Tobruk are in the shape of the memorial that was built in the cemetery at Tobruk. If you go to Vietnam War memorials, you find that quite a lot of them are in the shape of the Long Tan cross, which is a roughly hewn cross with a circular panel, not quite a Celtic cross—I think all the honourable members would know what I am talking about. One of those crosses is at Enoggera Barracks, where the wreath was laid.


I mentioned Harry Smith, who was to be awarded the DSO, which was downgraded to a Military Cross and then upgraded again to the Star of Gallantry, which is the equivalent of the DSO. But the awards for Dave Sabin and Geoff Kendall were downgraded from military crosses to military medals and then upgraded again to the Medal for Gallantry. Dave Sabin had never received his and it was presented to him by the Governor-General, and the Unit Citation for Gallantry, which should have been awarded 44 or 45 years ago, was presented to the other lieutenant, Geoff Kendall. They both served beside Harry Smith in the battle.


Harry attended the Long Tan celebrations in Townsville. As a result of a recent medical treatment, he was not able to fly to Brisbane, and that was a sad thing because if it was anyone's day it was Harry Smith's. As you watched that magnificent parade, you could not help reflecting on what he did on that day. As the parliamentary secretary and others have mentioned, the Battle of Long Tan occurred by chance. A D Company, 6RQR patrol had gone out and, at around midday or early-afternoon, they encountered 2½ thousand Vietcong and North Vietnamese regulars—quite a formidable force. As we subsequently know, their real target was the base at Nui Dat, where there was to be a concert that day with Little Pattie and Johnny O'Keefe. It would have been a light and frothy day, so just imagine 2½ thousand troops descending on that. What a bloodbath that would have been. By chance, while out on patrol, the Australians ended up in battle with this group. They were a well-equipped group, as the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has just said. They had artillery as well. It was on the edge of the rubber plantation and it was in pouring rain. The battle raged for three hours—105 Australians and three New Zealanders took on 2,500 North Vietnamese regulars and irregulars. Shocking sorts of odds. You read the battle—and we do not have time to go into every aspect of it—but for example at one stage one of the platoons was surrounded and two other platoons went out to relieve them to fight their way into their position and to get them out back to the Australian line.


Then there was Morrie Stanley the New Zealand artillery officer who was lying beside Harry Smith, right at the front, in three inches of muddy water calling down the artillery that was coming from three units—Australian, American and New Zealander. That barrage was exploding in the rubber plantation and was causing devastating injuries to the North Vietnamese attackers. As I said, the battle went on for three hours. At one stage they nearly ran out of ammunition and equally bravely the RAAF flew in with an improvised drop of ammunition wrapped in blankets in the thick of the battle. That too was enormously courageous.


They persisted and they won the battle. They saved most of their unit. Tragically they lost 18 with 24 wounded but one only shudders to think what might have happened if that group had got anywhere near Nui Dat on that day. So they also saved the pride of Australia in that battle and as Parliamentary Secretary Kelly just told us it weakened for all time the role of the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese regulars in that province. So that was what we celebrated—45 years since that event.


I stay very close to my Vietnam veterans because I think they have had a rougher time than most. There were even some RSL clubs that would not accept them as members, thankfully not a lot, but some would not and that was a great sense of unhappiness to them. They did not lose their sense of camaraderie and having served for Australia and in many towns they formed their owned branches, some as South Vietnam Veterans' Association and others as South East Asian Group. In my area both main groups, the one in Bundaberg, has its own headquarters and as the local member I took some pride in helping them with former ministers and being able to get funds to purchase accommodation—it was an old church that they have turned into a very nice club. In Hervey Bay the old historic railway station is also now the headquarters of the Vietnam Veterans' Association Hervey Bay Sub-Branch. 


You often wonder just how much healing had really gone on but I think it was two or three years ago I went to the Long Tan Day at Hervey Bay and Harry Smith had some of his unit with him; I think there were eight of them. They went up as a group to lay their wreaths and as they laid their wreaths and stepped back the entire crowd—which was considerable I might add—burst into loud and sustained applause. I have never seen that at a wreath laying. Wreath laying is generally a very sombre thing; a reflective thing. But, on that occasion, the members of the public who were there could not contain themselves because they knew the story of how badly these men had been treated as veterans but also, in particular, how badly D company 6RAR had been treated in the acknowledgement of what was the seminal battle of the Vietnam War. I return to an earlier theme, when I said we are not very good at recognising our heroes. Two of the 11 have received some awards, but there are still nine who have received only MIDs, mentioned in dispatches, which hardly reflects what went on that day. They were all recommended by Harry on that day for truly exceptional courage, and I will not rest until those 11 are upgraded.


I bring that up not to put a political or dark overlay on the celebration of Long Tan Day but rather to say that there is still some unresolved business. We as a nation need to step back and take one last look, as we put this behind us, to make sure that we have honoured truly exceptional courage and, in the case of Harry Smith, Dave Sabben, Geoff Kendall and Morrie Stanley, truly exceptional leadership, and that we do not forget the ones who really stuck their necks out for this country, those last 11. Long Tan Day is a marvellous day, a day that is now well established in the Australian lexicon. I hope that it will lead to complete fulfilment in the coming years, once we have acknowledged the last 11 veterans.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (17:32):  Last Thursday marked the 45th anniversary of the legendary Vietnam battle at Long Tan, where 105 Australians and three New Zealanders fought and withstood an attack of some 2,500 Vietcong and North Vietnamese troops in a rubber plantation. At the end of that battle, 18 Australian soldiers had been killed and 24 wounded, while 800 of the North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong had been killed and more than 1,000 wounded. The Battle of Long Tan, involving B Company and D Company 6RAR, was probably the most famous action of Vietnam fought by the Anzacs. As long as Long Tan is remembered as one of the major battles in Vietnam for our troops, it will also represent a day that veterans come together with members of the community to pay their respects on what is now Vietnam Veterans Day.


The Vietnam War was the longest major conflict in which Australians have been involved. It lasted 10 years, from 1962 to 1972. In the electorate of McEwen, as occurs all over Australia, veterans, families, friends and supporters come together to reflect on and remember all of the 62,100 Australian service personnel and civilians who fought in the name of our country, the 521 Australians who made the ultimate sacrifice and the 2,398 who were wounded.


In the nearly four decades since the end of the Vietnam War, there has been much heartache and much healing. Although people will differ in their opinions on the Vietnam War, I personally want to put on the record my total admiration and respect for and thanks to all those who bravely went to war and how sorry I am for the mistreatment they received on their return. Our troops deserve our unqualified support and respect. These brave men and women are the ones who are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country and the beliefs we hold so dearly. For that courage and bravery, I want to say thank you. I, like many Australians, have visited Vietnam and been through Phuoc Tuy province and walked through the rubber plantations at Long Tan. I have been to the Australian task force base at Nui Dat and been through the tunnels at Cu Chi. I have stood at these sites; I have walked the Luscombe airstrip. I have reflected and paid my respects to the brave Australians. I must say it was a very haunting, emotional and overwhelming experience. I want to thank the tour guide who was with me, an ex-6RAR man, Breaker Cusack. Breaker really brought the whole thing to reality as we walked through the rubber plantations and the silence. With each step he talked about what happened here and what happened there before you finally get to the cross. You pay your respects to soldiers  from both sides who fought in that battle. One of the things I noticed in Vietnam was the reconciliation that has happened since that time and the warmth that Australians receive there. It was a very haunting experience to walk through those different battlefields and places of significance for Australian veterans.


My electorate of McEwen has a long and rich history of supporting our armed forces and the township of Seymour, in particular, has a proud military tradition. Since the Boer War the area has housed Army training camps. After Federation this troop camp became part of the 7th Australian Light Horse, camped at site 17, which we now know and recognise as the Australian Light Horse Memorial Park, a place of great significance to Australia and a place I think many Australians should visit to see the fields where the Anzac traditions were born and what they went through. 


During World War I a permanent camp was set up and in the 1920s the Seymour shire became the chief military area in the state. Eventually this led to the establishment of Puckapunyal Army Camp in World War II. During World War II my grandfather, George Mitchell, passed through there on his way to places like Tobruk, Alamein and Borneo, where he and many others fought for our freedom. To me, it makes sense that Seymour is proudly honouring all those who served in Vietnam with the construction of the Vietnam veterans commemorative walk. It will be an area for reflection and commemoration for the Vietnam veterans and their families. It will have over 300 metres of stainless steel walls with the name of every Australian personnel who served in Vietnam. The Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia say:


The Commemorative Walk is not to memorialise those who served in Vietnam and/or those who paid the ultimate price, but to commemorate the service of all who played their part in what turned out to be a tumultuous part of Australia's history.


Some of the stories of Vietnam are represented in a replica of Luscombe Bowl, which was once the entertainment venue set up by soldiers during the war, at the end of Luscombe Airfield at Nui Dat. The replica centre in Seymour is now an interpretive centre. The next stage of the walk will have imitation rubber trees, rice paddies and military artefacts. Through this government we have secured a Centurian tank and we are working very hard to obtain a M113APC, some M2A2 Howitzers and our ultimate goal is to get a Huey helicopter. At the opening of stage 1 of the commemorative walk, veterans came from all around our nation to this place of significance, because it was born by them for them. It was something to behold. They were the ones who put the idea together of the commemorative walk and they are the ones who turned up in droves to see it. One of the most interesting things was to see people who had not seen each other for many, many years getting together, having a celebration and enjoying what had been done by Labor governments, both state and federal, getting together and putting the money in to get this fantastic venture done. It will become a tourist attraction for many of the veterans who are entering the grey nomad phase so they can see the importance of what they have done for our country and to see all their names on a wall. 


Our Australian commitment consisted predominantly of Army personnel but there was also a significant number of Air Force, Navy and some civilian personnel who were involved throughout the Vietnam conflict. As I said earlier, the later parts of the war were the cause of social and political dissent in Australia—since the conscription referendums of the First World War. It was a part of our history and only time has been able to heal the emotional wounds of so many. 


I first recall my interest being sparked in the Vietnam conflict, and the resulting issues that veterans faced, when my good friend, Craig Ingram—the former member for Gippsland in the Victorian parliament—loaned me a copy of a book titled Well Done, Those Men by Barry Heard. I read that book straight through from start to finish and could not put it down. It was a fascinating read because it was about Barry's very personal account. It explains how, as a conscript, he was one of the many young men sent off to Vietnam, completely unprepared for the emotional and psychological impact of what they would do and what they would have done to them there. As a result, he spent the next 30 years having 'a slow motion breakdown'. His story of his long journey home from Vietnam is an inspiring story of a life reclaimed and it gives strength to that generation of Australian men who had been through very similar experiences.


Since that awakening experience, I have continued to work and support the brave men and women who were prepared to pay the ultimate sacrifice in the name of our country. There are many Vietnam veterans in my community and I can say that they are a dogged lot, especially when it comes to getting funds up and running for this Vietnam veterans commemorative walk. I guess that is what makes them so special. Recently, I was very honoured to present some 'Saluting their service' certificates to two of our finest—locals, Tony Gill and Bill Scott, residents of McEwen and people whom I am very proud to have made their acquaintance. In doing these ceremonies, we invited one of the primary schools who had just finished doing a term's work on military history. It was an absolute sensation to have those guys there getting their certificates, being recognised for what they have done, and to have this young generation of kids there with so much interest, passion and support for everything that they had been through in their schoolwork.


As my last note, I would like to say a simple thank you. Time cannot change the past, but what we do know can change the future and make us sure that this episode in Australian history is recognised and given the reverence and attention that it so richly deserves.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (17:43):  It is with great honour that I rise today to pay tribute to the men and women of Australia's armed forces who fought for this country in Vietnam between 23 May 1962 and 29 April 1975. The nominal role of the Vietnam veterans includes 61,000 men and women who served in the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force in Vietnam or in the waters adjacent to Vietnam during this time. On Vietnam Veterans Day last week, I was pleased to see survivors of Delta Company 6RAR honoured with a Unit Citation for Gallantry for their actions in the Battle of Long Tan. It is a shame it has taken 45 years for these fine soldiers to be recognised. Let us hope we have learned from our past when recognising the sacrifice and service of our ADF personnel now and into the future. 


Not detracting from the inspiring efforts of Delta Company 6RAR and the Battle of Long Tan, today I would also like to make mention of the 103rd Field Battery, who supported Delta Company in the Battle of Long Tan all those years ago. They were part of four artillery units from 1 Field Regiment at Nui Dat, which also included the 161st Field Battery, Royal New Zealand Army; 105th Field Battery, Royal Australian Army; and A Battery, 2nd/35th Howitzer Battalion, US Army. My father was a member of 103 Field Battery and fought gallantly in the battle. It was one of the biggest and most important conflicts in the Vietnam War involving Australian troops. Whilst my father understands and accepts that 103 Field Battery will not receive a citation due military protocols, I believe every member of this battery, and all other support batteries, would be worthy recipients. I have been approached by family members of these men who also believe these soldiers deserve recognition for their efforts during the Battle of Long Tan, even though they were officially attached to 5RAR. It saddened me on Vietnam Veterans Day last week to have a number of phone calls from people crying and reliving their stories. I believe that these support batteries should be shown the respect and honour they deserve. Surely this is not too much to ask.


The battle was one of the most successful campaigns Australian troops have ever been involved in. Eighteen Australians died, while the enemy death toll was put as high as 800. It was August 18 1966 when 108 Australian and New Zealand soldiers of the 6th Battalion, RAR, D Company faced an enemy force of over 2½ thousand. The 103 Field Battery played a pivotal role in this historic battle. Its members pounded the enemy with 1,000 rounds of artillery, a round every 10 seconds, creating a wall of steel around the embattled men of D Company. Revisiting this battle: non-military personnel at the base formed ad hoc teams of labourers and worked through the night in the pouring rain to keep up the supply of ammunition to the guns. The 103 Field Battery had to be resupplied by Iroquois choppers from 9 Squadron RAAF, making the guns a prime target for enemy fire. These men struggled through torrential rain which made aiming the guns almost impossible, leaving gunners to rely on their own intuition to ensure they fired on the enemy and not on the men of D Company. To make a bad situation worse, poisonous cordite fumes from the artillery fire built up a toxic haze around the guns. Despite hardly being able to breathe or even see through the haze, the brave men of the 103rd and 105th field batteries kept up the artillery fire all through the night and into the morning, delivering victory to the Australians. The men involved in the Battle of Long Tan demonstrated courage, bravery and determination in spite of next to impossible conditions.


It is for these reasons that I believe that the members of 103 Field Battery are also worthy of citation. Even though military protocol prevents this citation from happening, I will always be immensely proud of my father, Reg, for his courageous actions on that horrific day. Unfortunately, the Vietnam War was especially cruel to the minds and bodies of returned servicemen because of the strong political anti-war sentiments that were rife at the time. While the success of the Battle of Long Tan will be remembered by generations of Australians to come, we must also consider the effect the war has had on many soldiers, their families and the community. I remember vividly as a young child my father returning from Vietnam. We used to go into his bedroom, where he slept with his eyes open, to try and wake him up. He would jump up and nearly strangle you, reliving the war in Vietnam. He slept with his eyes open. He relived every moment of Vietnam in his dreams. I remember him sleepwalking through the house. Still to this day, when I visit him on holiday, my father relives those memories in his dreams. These are things that I will never forget and they touch me deeply. As a young child it was very, very disturbing to see what was happening to my father, and it still happens to him today and to the many Vietnam Veterans who returned from war, especially those who were involved in the Battle of Long Tan.


There are currently more than 500 Vietnam Veterans living in the Macarthur region. I am a member of the Macarthur branch of Australian Vietnam Veterans and I have always supported its members in whatever I can do, particularly in relation to their health and their wellbeing. The veterans of this group are a fantastic group of men who have all fought gallantly for this country. Now they meet on a daily basis to offer support to each other. They have established a museum in memory of those who fought in Vietnam. I am proud of all our local veterans, not only for their courage during battle but for their strength during the anti-war sentiments that targeted our troops after their return home. My hope is that Australia will never allow Defence Force personnel returning from duty to be treated as Vietnam Veterans were. I know that a number of speakers today have touched on this. There are few who will endure the haunting realities of war. We should not take these soldiers' personal sacrifice for granted. My hope for all Australian Vietnam veterans, including my father, is that 45 years later they can all hold their heads up high.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (17:50):  It is an honour to follow the member for Macarthur on this. I know this is an issue that is very close to his heart as I recall he spoke about his father's commitment in the Vietnam War in his first speech to the House. I also rise today to pay tribute to the veterans of Long Tan and to all the Australians who served in the Vietnam War. As the member for Fowler—and I have to say this—it probably has an even more special significance for me, given that I also represent one of the largest Vietnamese communities outside Vietnam.


The commemorations that took place throughout the country on 18 August certainly did stir the emotions and the spirit of all involved in the conflict, their families and those who recognise the effort that was put in on behalf of the nation. As in all other theatres of conflict in which Australian soldiers have served, these Australians served bravely in Vietnam, they served their nation with courage and they served it with distinction.


Having said that—and following the point just made by the member for Macarthur—the veterans of the Vietnam conflict were treated very poorly on their return to this country. No matter what your views may have been with respect to the Vietnam War, those who served this country in our country's interests did not deserve to be treated the way they were when they returned to this country. I would like to put on record my apologies to all those veterans who were subject to that treatment. It is something that needs to be said as the grieving is still taking place for many of those Vietnam veterans. There is no excuse at all for treating our returned servicemen and, indeed, some women that way. After all, they were the ones who were called to put their lives on the line when their country needed it. Their dedication and their commitment to service must be honoured. They dedicated themselves to the service of this country, no matter how they were recruited to Vietnam—many were national servicemen who were drafted into it. But regardless of how they came to be in the war, they did service in the interest of the Australian nation and they discharged their duty with all due valour and honour.


This is something that does sit very solidly in the Australian psyche. You do not have to attend many Vietnam veteran occasions to see this. It is not only the pride of the returned servicemen you see there. I see it, and no doubt the member for Macarthur and all the other members present know that you actually see it, in the school children who are now turning up as they learn about our commitment. It is quite clear that this is the day we not only the commemorate the battle at Long Tan, but also the day we remember all those who served in the Vietnam War. The Battle of Long Tan stands equally proudly in Australian military history with Gallipoli, the Somme, Tobruk and Kokoda. These are things that young school children now learn, and rightfully so, because they are things that they should be proud to know. It was an engagement against all the odds, where Australians were called upon to engage an enemy in what was probably a very much unforseen battle under very, very difficult circumstances. Long Tan was the first major engagement in Vietnam in which Australian troops were involved. This battle was the stuff that, quite frankly, legends were made of. Once again, Australian soldiers found themselves in a position where only their sheer bravery and their determination allowed them to stand against the odds. You draw lines of similarity with all those other theatres, such as Gallipoli, the Somme, Tobruk and Kokoda. We should recall that Delta Company 6RAR encountered a far superior force numerically as they fought in the rain, mud and mist of the rubber plantation that ran along the outside of the village of Long Tan. No-one could have reasonably expected that a force of 108 Australians, mostly young National Service men, led by a few regulars, with the support of artillery, including some Australian and New Zealand artillery as it turned out, could have held off a force the equivalent of almost two battalions. It comprised over 2,000 North Vietnamese army regulars and local Viet Cong guerrillas. There was wave after wave of enemy attack on the Australian position. During the few hours that this battle lasted, there were many acts of bravery and mateship which have come to typify Australian involvement in war. To put it realistically, it is the Anzac spirit. 


For three hours they fought in the rain, with nothing more than a few plantation rubber trees and the mist generated by the rain for cover. They were waiting all that time for reinforcements to arrive. In the Anzac tradition, as I said, these Australians were supported by both Australian and New Zealand artillery. Sadly, lives on both sides were lost that day. By the end of the battle, 18 Australians had lost their lives and another 24 had been wounded. It is interesting that the oldest Australian casualty on that occasion was a 22-year-old and the youngest was a 19-year-old. That puts it in context when you think about your own kids. The other side, I understand, lost in excess of 250, with another 500 wounded. 


As I mentioned at the outset, despite the significance of the Long Tan Battle, its commemoration is not simply of the battle itself but of all Vietnam veterans. It is about the nearly 500,000 who served in Vietnam, it is about the soldiers and it is about the families of the 500 Australian troops who lost their lives in service to their country. It is also about the 3,000 who were wounded during the conflict. Everyone who served in the Vietnam conflict deserves proper recognition and the full respect of the Australian people. 


We always need to be mindful of the fact that, even though the last of our troops were withdrawn from Vietnam in 1972, it was not until October 1987 that Australia officially held ceremonies to recognise the homecoming of our Vietnam veterans. Vietnam veterans throughout Australia continue to suffer and are haunted by the ghosts of their involvement in the war. It is an important part of Australian history and should be given that status. I hope that no group of Australian veterans is ever treated in the way that we treated our Vietnam heroes on their homecoming. That is a wrong that we need to right. 


As the member for Fowler, I now have the honour of representing one of the largest Vietnamese communities outside of Vietnam itself. As a consequence of that, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War takes on a special significance. On 30 April this year, I attended a ceremony in Canberra to commemorate the 36th anniversary of the fall of Saigon to remember not only the Australians soldiers but also the many thousands of Vietnamese soldiers who died fighting for freedom and democracy. I had the opportunity to speak about the fall of Saigon to the communist forces and about what had occurred to the nation subsequent to that—for instance, the imprisonment of various Vietnamese people for essentially trying to exercise their own fundamental human rights—the human rights that Australians, New Zealanders and Americans were there supporting and trying to protect at the time of the Vietnamese conflict. At the time of the commemoration ceremonies of the fall of Saigon, I was advised of a march that was being planned by members of the Australian RSL and former Viet Cong soldiers. I reminded the crowd on that day that unlike the First and Second World Wars there was no repatriation for Vietnamese refugees. At the conclusion of the Vietnam war the communist government reacted quite cruelly to any of those it suspected of having stood up against it or assisted in efforts against the communist insurgency, to the point that people were placed in very inhumane concentration camps or, as they are colloquially referred to, re-education camps. The communist government's actions forced millions of Vietnamese to flee their country, many in boats. They would have been, from Australia's point of view, the first boat people. Regrettably, many hundreds of thousands of people did not survive that journey.


I am deeply concerned at human rights in Vietnam—it is something I have spoken of on many occasions in this parliament—because not only is it a continuation of past abuses of one's rights but also Australia, with its allies, fought in Vietnam to support and to protect the basic issues of freedom and democracy. Regrettably, these days people are accused of crimes such as supporting political groups not recognised by the state, criticising government policies, calling for democracy, even being interviewed by foreign journalists. Those matters are enough to subject you to a trial and, if found guilty, you are imprisoned. Our troops fought with distinction and with valour but they fought for Australia's interests to protect people from the insurgency of a communist regime. As a consequence they fought to protect those basic rights that we in our nation can freely enjoy.


Whilst I applaud every effort towards world peace and harmony, I believe, as I indicated on that day, that a parade by former Australian diggers who served in the Vietnam conflict alongside former Viet Cong guerrillas will send a very wrong message throughout our region. There has been a significant number of recorded abuses of human rights, continuing to this day, including more than 400 people incarcerated for trying to exercise their fundamental human rights. A parade will effectively say that you can continue to deny people their freedom and democracy whilst enjoying the support of a country such as Australia.


In March this year I was also invited to the unveiling of the newly renovated Vietnam War Comradeship Memorial at Cabravale Park, which is in my electorate at Cabramatta. I was invited there by the President of the New South Wales chapter of the Vietnamese Community in Australia, Mr Thanh Nguyen. The community I represent are so proud of all Australians and all those allied forces who went and fought valiantly on their behalf. They have been busy fundraising to ensure that the comradeship memorial stands with pride of place because they want to demonstrate in Australia how proud they are of people which o made the sacrifice on their behalf. The comradeship memorial commemorates the friendship and sacrifice shared between Australian and Vietnamese soldiers. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of the organising committee, among them Tri Vo, the project coordinator for the upgrade of the comradeship memorial, the presidents of the respective RSL clubs and the many Australian and Vietnamese war veterans who attend.


The Vietnam War is not going to be something we simply condemn to the history books; it is something that we will commemorate on the basis that it is a true example of the Anzac spirit. It is a defining moment not only in Australian military history but for the spirit of Australia itself. The 18th of August is a very significant day in Australia's national calendar. We commemorate and acknowledge the efforts, bravery, courage and commitment of all of those who fought for this country, whether they were regular soldiers or members of the national service. We should ensure that we speak about this each year in commemoration of Long Tan. Lest we forget.

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (18:06):  What marvellous recognition it would have been if my Vietnam veterans could have been here in this parliament in the last hour or so and heard the heartfelt addresses from the members for Macarthur, Fowler and Eden-Monaro. I could not even contemplate entering into the feelings that they have for their communities, especially the Vietnam vets community, but I am sure that if my Vietnam vets were here they would know that there are members in this place who remember what they did, determinedly work for their betterment through this parliament and their communities and do it with a passion and an understanding that they probably do not believe exists in this House. I want to commend them for that in the first instance and say, 'I recognise you.' As the member for Macarthur pointed out, when you have direct family pain such as he has been prepared to volunteer to the records of this parliament and you come into this place, it is great recognition not just for your father but for all the Vietnam vets who have felt alienated from the communities that they left to go to Vietnam and then returned to in difficult circumstances.


I had the great pleasure of being the debutant partner for Margaret Kennedy. Margaret Kennedy was the draper's daughter in Pakenham and I was from the neighbouring town of Koo-wee-rup. Those towns were sporting mortal enemies, but I had the great pleasure of being invited to escort this girl to make her debut. Her brother was Robert Kennedy. We called him 'Noddy'—Noddy was taller than most boys—and I was with him yesterday. But Noddy is not Noddy anymore; he is now 'Buzz'. We were different people in the 1960s. It was a wonderful time for all of us, but those who went off to Vietnam had a different experience. It was a distant war for us. We went on. I was not balloted. We got on with our lives. Buzz went through the Vietnam War and I met him yesterday as a member of the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club's Gippsland chapter. Having grown up with my wife, Bronwyn, he was thrilled to see her there with all the other Vietnam vets. We remember that even in this House we had Tim Fischer and Rod Atkinson, who were returned soldiers. I do not know whether there were any others; someone might fill me in, I will get back to the office and someone will say there was someone else. There was Ron Edwards, the Western Australia member for Swan; I think it was Swan. I think that is correct.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr BROADBENT:
  It was Cowan; he was the member for Cowan, of course. He came back with severe injuries but ended up in this House. So that is three that we can think of.


Yesterday there were many, many beautiful motorbikes. There were also a lot of fractured men and families. They were supported by God's Squad, and I should have said that Buzz is a patched member of the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club chapter in Gippsland. I can only enter in but cannot understand how their fractured lives have affected all of them over those years and how they congregate around Harley-Davidsons. It is a lovely way to be, because they are with their own. They are in their comfort zone. Yesterday you would have been proud of every one of them, including Russell Oakes —'T Rat', as I have to call him—who was a president of the club. They had organised around their memorial and around their clubhouse there at the old Longwarry Hall, which they had made into a fantastic clubhouse. They had organised a whole ceremony to remember Vietnam Veterans Day and the Long Tan remembrance. In that, probably the most heartbreaking moment was when the words of the song I Was Only 19 were not sung but just read out as a poem. There were many tears that flowed in those few moments as that was read out. The sun was shining on a most glorious day in Gippsland—unusual with the wet we have had. So you can imagine the sparkling motorcycles surrounding this whole place. Not all the Vietnam veterans there came on motorbikes, you know; some came in cars. There were people like me, hangers on, that came along to the commemoration with them. But you felt a quiet comfort in the place as they remembered those fallen and as they remembered their mates who have fallen since and who have not made it into what we call old age—and there was a lot of grey hair yesterday; I think the boys would forgive me for saying that.


So I want to recognise one—not only the boys who were there yesterday at Longwarry but all the support that they have had around them from their loved ones that support them in what they do; all of the people that went away with them to support them and that were part of that conflict; and the Defence Force support that came from this nation for them. That probably has not been recognised either, but they know who helped them. I will come to a plea in a moment, but I will just say this to you: yesterday, as a member of parliament, you would have been proud to stand amongst those men at the Vietnam Veterans Motorcycle Club commemorations at Longwarry. It was a place where any member of this House would have been pleased to be standing. I know the former minister knows all about what I am talking about because he was the minister when much of these funds that were provided to this group were extended, allowing them to rebuild what they have done there at the moment. There is a bit of controversy right now over some money that is not going out to veterans in regard to welfare. I have raised that with the new minister and we are doing the best we possibly can. I admit that Victoria has had generous payments in regard to the welfare of veterans and that there has been a pull back. But I have a different set-up in Gippsland. 


There are welfare agencies quite close to each other across parts of Australia and they may be duplicating services. Government always has a right to question its own expenditure—there is no doubt about that. However, South Gippsland has one service only and it goes from Wonthaggi all the way through the bottom country to Fish Creek, the Foster area, then right up to Korumburra and Leongatha—one service. I have been told there are some transitional funds, so I think in the process we can work through that for those transitional funds. In the north of my electorate, I do not have the same issue because there are welfare support groups for veterans all the way through. I think we will get a good outcome from the government on that. I have been in this parliament through a number of administrations and there has not been one administration in this place, from Hawke to Gillard, that I have been a part of that was not totally and absolutely supportive of the welfare of veterans, to the best of the government's financial ability. There has not been one Prime Minister who has not been in support of veterans, as best they possibly could in the financial straits of the government of the time. If we have failed veterans, we will take responsibility for that and endeavour in the processes into the future to support veterans and support them well. 


Vietnam Veterans Day was a great celebration. I congratulate all at Longwarry. I congratulate all who played a part in its presentation. But the moment of excitement came when one training aeroplane from the Roulettes came straight out of the sunlight towards the clubhouse, twisting and turning and throwing itself up into the air to a complete stall, then dropping towards the clubhouse again, circling three times, rolling and then flinging itself back to sail—a fitting tribute that is only given to very special occasions.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (18:14):  I rise tonight to honour our Vietnam veterans and to make some comments with respect to Vietnam Veterans Day and the Battle of Long Tan, and to remember all those who fought and those who died, and those who suffered as a result of our involvement in the Vietnam War. In the process, I will mention some of the people I have met in my time in this place, both as shadow minister and subsequently as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, where I have had the honour and the privilege to work with many members of the Vietnam veterans community. 


Many speakers have spoken about the Battle of Long Tan and the nature of what occurred on that occasion, the tremendous courage and bravery of all those who fought as part of that engagement and who safeguarded the very real threat to the Australian base at Nui Dat, recently established, and the nature of the struggle that occurred subsequent to that time around the question of honours and recognition. I will not go into the detail of that other than to make a couple of comments about several of the individuals that were involved, to highlight those individuals as examples of the very fine men who fought on that occasion—and recognising them as representative takes nothing away from others whom I do not mention. I will then talk a bit more about some other broader points with respect to our involvement in the Vietnam War. I note the presence of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs prior to me, the honourable member for Dunkley. 


You cannot really go past then Major—subsequently Lieutenant-Colonel retired—Harry Smith. Harry is someone who I have had a lot to do with over the years, as I know the member for Dunkley had, in what was for government a very difficult issue to deal with: the question of how to deal with recognition with respect to events long ago when we were but very young lads and when, it is acknowledged on all sides, things did not turn out the way they should have in terms of acknowledging the great courage and sacrifice that occurred.


Harry is an amazing bloke. He is as tough as nails, as hard as they come. There were times, it is fair to say—and I am prepared to say it now that I am not minister—he was bloody unreasonable. But, if I were ever in the dire situation that D Company was in, with its support units at that time, in that awful rank jungle, in that terrible driving rain, facing such a numerically superior force, I would have wanted someone like Harry Smith there to help me maintain what I needed to do in the circumstances. I have no doubt—from dealing with him over the years with respect to the outstanding matters which relate to acknowledging his men for what they did—that he is a man of enormous conviction, enormous courage and the sort of guts that a lot of people in this place, me included, can only dream about. 


Harry remains committed to continuing to focus on and fight for recognition for a number of his men who he feels have not been recognised. I welcome the recent granting of the unit citation as long overdue recognition. It took a long time to get to the stage of being able to have the presentation. There were certainly issues around that, but I will not go to that today. I know from speaking to Harry very recently that those other issues remain outstanding and he remains concerned with aspects of the decisions taken at the Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal. I think there are issues around the operation of the Defence Honours and Awards Tribunal. Several issues have come before it where there have been legitimate concerns raised. I think it has an incredibly complex role to play dealing with outstanding matters of recognition, but I think it is also time for that tribunal to be reviewed. It has been in operation for long enough for that to occur, and it would be a positive step forward to ensure that a tribunal which does, by and large, a very good and important job is meeting the requirements that the government had when it was established.


I also mention Captain Morrie Stanley, who, as other speakers have mentioned, recently passed away. Then Captain Morrie Stanley was the forward artillery observer attached to the artillery, a Kiwi and a man who directed some 61 artillery fire missions into the site over 3½ hours in the most desperate times and the most appalling conditions. Morrie was able to be granted the unit citation in the time before his passing. Morrie Stanley was a modern epitome of the great linkage between Australia and New Zealand that dates back to the time of Gallipoli and he was a man that was enormously respected by those he worked with. No doubt, given the work he did at that time, his professionalism, his dedication and his skill saved many Australian lives. One other person I would mention in passing—again, someone who would be known to the former minister—is Lieutenant Adrian Roberts, who was in charge of the APCs that arrived in support of D Company. Adrian is one of the people whose individual acts of valour I do not believe have been sufficiently recognised. He came back a man suffering from the circumstances of his service but, always dedicated to helping others, he became involved in the TPI association and served fellow TPIs with great distinction in some of the years since.


I recently came back from Afghanistan. I was talking to a bunch of young blokes at Tarin Kowt, who were serving, and a young bloke came up to me and said, 'I think you might know my grandfather.' He was in fact Adrian's grandson serving in a very similar unit and therefore following on a great tradition. He is a young bloke whom I am sure Adrian is very proud of, and I believe Adrian has every right to be incredibly proud of him.


But it was not just Long Tan. This was a day to recognise the tremendous courage, sacrifice and service of the more than 60,000 who served in Vietnam and the region throughout the conflict. It is a time to recognise that it was not just the Army; it was also the Air Force and it was also the Navy. It is a time to recognise that, although more than 500 died and more than 2,400 were wounded, many others have returned and have suffered from their service. It is a time to acknowledge that service. It is a time to recognise that these men did what they were asked to do on behalf of the governments of the day and many suffered in silence for years afterwards. It is important to recognise that at that time it was a difficult situation in Australian society in dealing with the issues of that conflict—partly, in my view, because it was in effect the first TV war. In those circumstances, the issues we deal with today, with the sorts of reporting that we now almost take for granted, were in fact incredibly new at that time. We were not used to seeing the sorts of scenes that were coming across our TV screens on a nightly basis. We as a society, and frankly our political leaders, were not able to understand at the time or reflect properly on the reality of that and what it meant for a society dealing with the circumstances around a conflict of that nature. I think that that impacted on those who went, their families at home and the broader community and we did a disservice, as a nation, to those who returned in those circumstances.


But rather than focus on that I would like to focus on some aspects of what has happened since then that really highlight the great courage and camaraderie of many of those who went. I will briefly speak about a particular group of individuals who served in the Vietnam War who were also very familiar to the former minister, those around Operation Aussies Home. People like Jim Bourke and Peter Aylett, who never forgot that there were some six individuals who were missing in action subsequent to our involvement in that war; people who remembered that and never forgot; people who have dedicated in recent years a lot of their time, money and efforts to doing all they could to bring those men home. The work that they did has been acknowledged in this place before, but I am very pleased to acknowledge it again today. Jim and Peter in particular are two of that group whom I know reasonably well. Again, they are tough old so-and-sos. They are as gutsy as they come—dry and funny when they want to be and determined and tough when they have to be. It has been a great privilege for me to have known them over these years and to have worked with them. And I am sure that the former minister, the member for Dunkley, would share those sentiments. The work that they did ensured that the Defence Force followed on from that in a manner which ensured that the remains of those brave servicemen, the last of our remains from Vietnam, were returned home over a number of occasions, starting in effect with Parker and Gillson, under the time of the member for Dunkley as minister, through, in my time, to John Gillespie, David Fisher, and then on to Herbert and Carver, the last two who were returned home. Jim Bourke is now working on getting a PhD at a university in Melbourne. I now call him professor and he is now looking at the very issue of what this means in respect of what occurred at the time and also what it means about the efforts to understand remembrance and the work that was done to return these men home. I think his work and the work of those like Peter Aylett with him is in fact work that we can all be very, very proud of.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",Nats,2011-08-22,"



Mr HARTSUYKER
 (Cowper) (18:30):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion that is in my name. The New South Wales north coast has endured floods, damaging winds and torrential rain on a number of occasions in the last two years. The unusually wet weather in late 2010 and early 2011 has devastated our local sugar industry. Many farmers planted crops twice and lost both crops to the wet weather, leaving them with no possibility of a harvest but still out of pocket because of the substantial cost of planting. There are currently some 6,000 hectares of land in northern New South Wales which should be covered with sugar cane but lie unplanted. The New South Wales Canegrowers Association is working with the affected parts of the industry to develop solutions to this problem. 


I am calling on the government to match the assistance provided to the Queensland and Victorian farmers following the natural disasters in those states. New South Wales's support measures currently fall some $10,000 short of the assistance available for farmers in Queensland and Victoria, who are able to access up to $25,000 re-establishment assistance in flood declared areas. Unlike in other areas, New South Wales sugar cane is primarily a two-year crop, so the impact of poor conditions in late 2010 will flow through until at least 2012. Canegrowers New South Wales estimates that the 2012 harvest could be 50 per cent lower as a result of poor weather. Canegrowers in northern New South Wales have been forced to take on short-term financing of $1,000 per hectare at a 7 per cent interest rate with the loans to be repaid from the proceeds of the coming crop—an example of the local industry attempting to help itself in a very difficult situation. Unfortunately the crops around Broadwater and Harwood are expected to be the worst in 50 years. Without decent crops in the next couple of years the viability of the cane industry in New South Wales will certainly be called into question.


In northern New South Wales sugar cane is a major driver of local economies. Money from sugar cane operations flows through the many different suppliers in towns like Maclean, Yamba and Grafton. The sugar cane industry is one of the region's biggest employers and accounts for $230 million of economic output each year; total direct and indirect employment in the industry is estimated at some 2,200 people. This includes 600 cane farmers and 150 seasonal harvesting workers. The sugar mills provide employment for 450 people. I have been advised that these mills are currently operating at a loss due to the difficulty in conditions and increased costs. 


The cane industry in New South Wales is broken into three regions with each region have a milling facility. Should the tonnage from any of the mill areas fall below sustainability levels, this would bring into question the future operations of those mills. It is vitally important that we maintain the critical mass of product flowing through those mills to retain our industry in the long term. The New South Wales Canegrowers Association put forward a plan which they believed would assist the industry to get back on its feet and assure the sustainability of sugar in northern New South Wales. They estimate that about 6,070 hectares needs to be replanted and, to put this in perspective, that is the equivalent of around 8,900 football fields with the estimated cost of replanting being some $10 million. The industry acknowledges that some losses are manageable and come with the territory, come with what it means to be a farmer; however, the industry also believes that the record adverse events in 2010 and 2011 result in the requirement for a comparatively small amount of government intervention to help get the industry back on its feet. 


The industry has put forward a proposal to the government with two important elements. The first problem is the inequity in the disaster assistance provided to canegrowers in New South Wales, and I have touched on that inequity between Queensland and New South Wales. Their second proposal is a package involving a partnership between the Australian government, the New South Wales government and the cane growing industry. The industry is proposing that the cost of replanting be funded equally between the two levels of government and individual growers, and predicts a maximum replanting cost of $1,750 a hectare, with an independent auditing program to ensure the integrity of the scheme. The New South Wales Cane Growers Association met with the member for Page, Janelle Saffin, on 12 July to present its case. However, we are yet to hear of a response from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Sugarcane is generally planted in September and October, and this means we must get the issue sorted out in the next few weeks if we are to avoid irreparable damage to the New South Wales sugar industry.


These weather related problems in New South Wales are further challenges for Australian industry at a time when many sectors are struggling with increased costs and difficult trading conditions. Manufacturing in Australia is already struggling due to a range of factors. BlueScope steel announced today that it will cut 1,000 jobs and close one of its blast furnaces due to difficult conditions. Recently OneSteel announced it will shed 400 jobs. AWU National Secretary Paul Howes said we are 'facing a major crisis in Australian manufacturing'. Businesses around Australia are facing very difficult trading conditions indeed. The high Aussie dollar is hurting exporters, consumer confidence is low and households are saving more money. Wasteful government spending is helping to keep interest rates higher than they would otherwise be.


Instead of working with Australian industries to protect Australian jobs and growing Australian businesses the government is pressing ahead with plans to introduce a carbon tax that will push up the cost of electricity and transport. This particularly affects our cane industry, where transport is such a major factor in the cost of production. Businesses in Australia are crying out for support and a fair go. Instead the government is waging war on Australian businesses and Australian jobs by introducing new taxes, reregulating the labour market and mismanaging government programs. I met recently with cane growers to discuss the impact of the carbon tax. They were deeply concerned about the impact of this tax, particularly on the cost of transport and of operating local sugar mills.


It is clear that the Gillard government does not have the will or the competence to support Australian industries. The New South Wales cane industry desperately needs help from the Australian government to ensure its long-term prosperity. We still await a response from the minister, and I note that the member for Page is in the chamber and will be speaking shortly on this matter. I call on the parliament to support this motion. Hundreds of jobs and local businesses are at stake. Certainly the vibrant, long-term future of the cane industry is very much at stake at this very difficult time.

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (18:37):  I am speaking tonight in support of local cane growers. It is a significant industry in my area and I want to outline some of the assistance and some of the work that I have been able to do with them. It would be nice for once to come together and work together in this place for the good of the community and for the good of industry, and I wish the honourable member for Cowper were fair dinkum on this and not playing games with it. I suspect that that is not how it is, so it makes it difficult to say: 'Yes, let's get together. Let's work in the best interests of cane growers on the North Coast.' I have certainly done that, because it is a significant industry in my area.


I met with the cane growers recently and meet with them all the time. They also wrote to me earlier this year. Mr Andrew Tickle, the General Secretary of the NSW Cane Growers Council, said:


I appreciate the efforts you have made on these issues to date, including arranging the meeting between industry representatives and the federal Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert McClelland MP, at Greenridge Hall near Casino in January.


Further quoting:


Your early action in seeking NDRA—


I think it means NDRRA—


declarations for the local government areas in northern New South Wales has also been greatly appreciated by all cane growers.


Speaking to that point, it is up to the state government to make the declaration of natural disaster; then the federal assistance kicks in. It was during the period when we had the floods. There were about seven floods in my area in Northern Rivers of varying degrees—major, minor and moderate—as there were across the North Coast area. I was able to hop onto the phone and ring anybody I could at the state level and federal level and say, 'I want these natural disaster declarations as soon as we can'. I knew that the sugar industry would be impacted and I wanted them to have access, as other farmers and small business do, to what we commonly call the cash grants. I wanted to make sure that that happened. That was not something I advertised, but it became known—hence, the thanks in the letter.


I have met with the cane growers since. When I look at the honourable member for Cowper's seven-point motion, points one, two, three, four and five are straight forward. When you come to number six, it talks about the amount of cash available—the $15,000 and $25,000—it is up to the state government to ask the federal government to increase that assistance. That is how it works. It has worked like that for a long time and we can come into this place, we can get into the media and we can talk about that as much as we like, but that is the system that exists. It just muddies the waters if we are not accurate in how we talk about that. It is up to the state government. Whether it was the previous state government, which was a Labor government, or the now  coalition government, it is an issue that I have always said had to be taken up with the state government and the state members. That is absolutely clear.


On the other issue, the cane growers did put up a novel proposal for seeking assistance for planting at any level. In their submission they talk about having two crook seasons. There have actually been three major weather events in total over the last four years that have impacted on the sugar cane farmers. That is what they were asking for. I also had written to the Hon. Katrina Hodgkinson, the Minister for Primary Industries and Minister for Small Business. I have a recent letter from her where she said, 'Thank you for the representations on behalf of the New South Wales cane growers.' They wanted me to write to her on the issue of increasing the category C NDRRA Grant from $15,000 to $25,000 and seeking financial support for the replanting of sugar cane. I knew that the state members in my area had done that. I was asked by the cane growers to do it. I was happy to do it, although that is normally within their bailiwick to do.


I received another letter back from her. The minister says that she is extremely sympathetic to the concerns raised. She said she has had various meetings with local members to discuss these issues and she has also encouraged them to discuss it with the federal minister. That is what we have been doing—discussing it with both. I did not want to do this. I was not bringing partisan politics into this; I was just playing an absolutely straight bat in trying to get the best deal I could for the cane growers. The motion the honourable member for Cowper has put here tonight forces me to bring this in here. It is not what I wanted to do. I just want to see what we can do for them.


There is a letter here that the honourable Minister Katrina Hodgkinson enclosed for me. It is to Mr Andrew Tickle, the General Secretary of the New South Wales Cane Growers' Association, to his address at Wardell. I also meet with Mr Tickle as well on behalf of the New South Wales cane growers. In the letter, among other things, the minister says about the $15,000:


The level of assistance is determined on the impact of the disaster on whole communities and implemented to address the longer term holistic community recovery following a severe natural disaster. The floods in Queensland were very extensive and of a greater magnitude than those experienced in New South Wales and in many cases reached historical record water height levels resulting in extreme flood damage. Therefore the maximum eligible level of support as determined by the national NDRRA was activated in Queensland.


The letter goes on to outline what is available under the scheme and advises members to contact Mr Rik Whitehead, who is the Assistant Regional Director, North Coast Department of Primary Industries, or the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority for assistance.


It is really clear what the state minister is saying about that issue of the $15,000 or $25,000 and there have been two natural disasters where the honourable member for Cowper has been in the media saying we should get extra money. One was when the Labor government was in at state level and now there is this one, with the coalition government. It is up to them to ask. That is the way the scheme works and I am not sure the honourable member for Cowper understands that. It is up to them to ask and then it can kick in. The minister has been quoted on that point—and when I say minister, I mean the minister at the federal level. 


There is one issue I discussed with the local cane growers and also with the Rural Assistance Authority, the body at state level that administers all of these programs. I asked the RAA: 'Is is possible to have a collective loan? There are $130,000 concessional grants—is it possible to have that done in a collective way?' I thought it had happened before, but they said it was not possible. In fact it had happened once before, but for a whole range of reasons it did not work out—the money did not get paid back and it was harder to get money back in that system. That was an example of trying to think a bit outside the square.


Just recently, the New South Wales Sugar Milling Co-operative Chief Executive Officer, Chris Connors, announced the start of the Grower Loan Planting Assistance Scheme, which is being offered in partnership with the Manildra Group. This scheme will offer plant loan assistance of $1,000 per hectare and will be available to all cane planted this year and next year. This is in my local paper, the Northern Star, and it was also in the Daily Examiner. Wayne Rogers, a grower and Chairman of the Richmond River Cane Growers Association, said the initiative was necessary because many people had attempted to plant at least twice last season without success. He said: 


They had incurred significant cost but had nothing to show for it. 


The scheme is a great initiative and one that they have taken themselves.

Mr COULTON
 (Parkes—The Nationals Chief Whip) (18:44):  I too rise tonight to speak in support of this motion introduced by my colleague the member for Cowper. I have been quite interested to sit here listening to the contribution from the member for Page. While I do not doubt her concern and empathy for the cane growers on the North Coast, I am afraid that does not help them out of their predicament. The member for Page should note that this motion calls on the government to take action to help the cane growers in northern New South Wales. We have heard a monologue on the member for Page's activities and on letters she has written, but it missed the point: that governments can make this happen. The frustration the cane growers have is that, while they are seeing money squandered elsewhere—in home insulation programs and double priced school halls and a whole range of other things—when something comes up and they really need the funds—



Ms Saffin interjecting—




Mr COULTON:
  I sat silently, Member for Page, during your contribution. When something comes up and we need some decisive action, the money is not there and we get excuses. There is a precedent for this. In 2000, a major rainfall event went through western New South Wales and, at the point of harvest, decimated the wheat crop. The Deputy Speaker would have been a member here at the time and may remember it, as someone involved in agricultural activities. It was devastating—right at the point of harvest, in early December. The then Deputy Prime Minister immediately instigated $60,000 in replanting grants. That was a huge benefit, to not only those farmers but the entire community and Australia as a whole. It was not welfare. It was not benefits. It was not relief payments. It was an investment by the Australian government in its food producers. I would say that the money that went into those farmers in that wet harvest, that replanting grant, would have been repaid in taxation 10 times over in the next couple of years by stopping those farmers going to the wall. And it is not only the farmers that it goes through. A replanting grant—and that is what the Member for Cowper is speaking about—flows through to the agricultural suppliers and the contractors. And having that cash going through helps to keep that core number of people in a community so that you can keep services like education, medicine and all those things going.


I, too, am disappointed sometimes at the misguided nature of the finance coming out of this government. My electorate also suffered, largely through the floods at Christmas time. Indeed, parts of my electorate, communities and individual farms, were underwater or surrounded by water for two or three months. They received no funds. And now some of them, who had received Centrelink payments, have been asked to return them. There are farmers who had come through eight or nine years of drought who, on the point of harvest, were completely wiped out. I flew over thousands and thousands of acres of unharvested wheat standing in water; that wheat will never be harvested. A replanting grant at that point would have been very useful as well. But it was not forthcoming, and so those communities now are really suffering a cash shortage.


So I support the member for Cowper's motion here. I am not a cane farmer, but I understand that cane is a very intensive crop. It is very expensive to get established and to plant. And it is a little bit unusual, and different from the crops that I am used to, in that it lasts in a two-year rotation. So when an event wipes out the crop, as this one has, it is very expensive to replant, and the consequences of that flow through for not one but several years.


The member for Cowper has every right to come into this place and speak up for the farmers on those issues. And if the member for Page is offended by that, or needs to apologise for the inaction of the government on that, then I am disappointed because I would have thought that it was the role of all in this place to bring to light, to the Australian Parliament, the issues that concern the people they represent.


So I am concerned about the priorities of this government when money seems to be bountiful for some things and very tight for others. We speak a lot in this place of food security and climate change and looking after the environment, but here is an opportunity to actually do something practical. And it is not just about funding these farmers to plant a crop. If these farmers are forced off their land, if they have to sell out because they are in a financial bind, then years of expertise—sometimes two or three generations of expertise—is also forced off that land. And that becomes a problem because quite often the land is bought up by corporate investors who have no idea about growing cane. One of the great frustrations in here to me, as someone with an agriculture background, is that, in some quarters, there is no recognition of the skill that farmers have. It is as if they are a tradeable commodity, so that if someone goes off a place and leaves the land we will just replace them with someone else. While many farmers have tertiary degrees, many do not. They gain knowledge and skills from the time they are knee-high and following their father and grandfather around the farm until they finally take control of the farm themselves. That will be the real loss here. It is not just about $15,000 or $25,000 for a replanting grant. The real loss will be if these people decide: 'This is just too hard. We will cash this out. We will sell our cane farm to a developer. They might turn it into a Club Med or an ecovillage or put in some ski boats down by the Clarence. There is good money in that, and we will buy a unit at Yamba and watch the Pacific Ocean.' That is not a bad outcome, except that the expertise of these people, their productivity and the dollars they give and have given over the generations to their community, to the state of New South Wales and to this country will be lost. It is appalling that for just a few dollars—we are not talking about a large number of farmers—their situation could be alleviated. 


I understand why the member for Cowper has brought forward this motion. He understands how difficult it is for people in Australia who are running their own business, particularly those who are running an agricultural business, when mother nature throws a double whammy at them and puts them in a place they have not been before financially. When this happens, it is very nice to think that the government of this land can make their future and the future of the community in which they live a priority.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (18:56):  The member for Parkes may understand why the member for Cowper has brought this motion before the House; but, please forgive me, I do not. But I do understand the area that the member for Cowper represents because I have lived there longer than he has. So I really do understand the issues surrounding this motion. I suspect, knowing the good people of Cowper the way I do, that if they had a member who really concentrated on honestly putting forward their case they would be a lot happier with the member for Cowper than they would be with him getting up in this parliament and sprouting rhetoric. 


You might ask: why did the federal government give only $15,000? It was because that is what they were asked to give. They delivered what they were asked to give. Now we have the member for Cowper standing up in this parliament and playing politics by saying, 'The cane growers should have been given $25,000,' when only $15,000 was asked of the federal government. The federal government delivered what they were asked to deliver, and it is very dishonest of the member for Cowper to stand up here and try to make any other argument. What we need to do is separate fact from fiction. 


I agree wholeheartedly with the member for Parkes: every member has the right to stand up here and speak on behalf of the people they represent, but let us do it in a way that is honest and that delivers a quality debate. Let us talk about the issue as it really is, not how we would like it to be. Let us not put things on the record just to score political points; rather, let us see what we can do to really help those cane farmers whose livelihoods have been devastated by these most horrendous conditions. I would attribute the abnormal wet weather to climate change; the member for Cowper would be, I think, denying its existence. We have had many adverse weather events in the area that I come from. I must say that, if the member for Cowper were prepared to support the government in putting a price on carbon so that the 500 biggest polluting industries were held to account for their behaviour, then maybe, just maybe, there would not be as many devastating climate events. I know there has been a very long period of time in the northern part of New South Wales in which there have been very adverse weather conditions and an enormous increase in the rainfall in the area, and this has had a devastating effect on the industry. I would just like to go through a few points in relation to this. Under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, each individual state determines the level of assistance to be paid, subject to caps agreed between the Commonwealth and the state. Why doesn't the member for Cowper argue that? For clean-up and recovery grants for small business and farmers, often referred to as category C grants, the NDRRA clearly provides that the Commonwealth will meet half the cost up to $25,000. This can consist of tier 1 clean-up and recovery grants of up to $5,000, not requiring any proof of damage or expenditure, and tier 2 grants of up to $20,000 for small businesses and primary producers. 


I hope the member for Cowper is listening to this because it is a very important point. The government has made it clear that it is willing to meet its share of the cost of grants up to the maximum amount. That is not what the member for Cowper tells this parliament. The government has done so following the recent devastating natural disasters in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. It is up to the New South Wales government to determine the level of assistance they believe is to be provided and therefore the level of assistance they should be seeking from the Commonwealth. The member for Cowper should talk to his mates down in Macquarie Street and ask them to support him, not bring it up here in the federal parliament. He needs to get his National Party mates and Premier Barry O'Farrell to support him. As I said earlier, $15,000 was the amount of money that was asked for and $15,000 was what the government delivered. 


The NDRRA assistance for the December 2010-January 2011 flooding was made available for 13 local government areas. Included in that were a number that fall within the member for Cowper's electorate, including Bellingen, and the electorates north of Cowper. The money that was given to these local government areas was for personal hardship and distress assistance; certain counter-disaster operations; restoration of essential public assets; concessional loans of up to $130,000 for small businesses and primary producers; concessional loans of up to $25,000 for voluntary and not-for-profit organisations, who really stepped up to the plate at that time and provided assistance and support on the ground for those people who had been adversely affected; transport freight subsidies of up to $15,000 to assist primary producers for the carriage of livestock and fodder; and clean-up and recovery grants of up to $15,000, which the member for Cowper would like to see capped at $25,000, when that was not even asked for. 


The member for Cowper comes in here, he argues one way, he puts forward a point of view that really is not based on fact and he expects this parliament to take him seriously. Come on. We just cannot take anything that the member for Cowper says seriously when he comes in here and does not tell the true story, does not paint the picture as it is. The government has already responded to Mr Andrew Tickle, the General Secretary of the New South Wales Cane Growers' Association. In his motion I think the member for Cowper refers to the fact that the government has responded, but the motion has been moved. As a National Party member, he voted against the flood levy which would have assisted the people he represents in this parliament. The flood levy would have supported his communities and helped them in the recovery and reconstruction after the devastating floods.


It is up to the New South Wales government. He needs to talk to his mates in Macquarie Street to get it sorted out. He should not come in here trying to blame the federal government for the ineptitude of his colleagues in New South Wales. Just so that the member for Cowper is aware of this the next time he raises an issue such as this, natural disaster management is a state and territory responsibility under the Constitution. Each jurisdiction determines the criteria and the level of assistance provided to individuals and communities affected by natural disasters.


I am disappointed that the member for Cowper did not even do the basic research need so that he could come in here and honestly debate this legislation. The cane growers of northern New South Wales have my 100 per cent support. I know they have done it tough and they really deserve a member who comes down here and argues effectively for them.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (20:27):  by leave—I move:


That the motion be amended to read—That the House:


(1) notes:


(a) the positive impact compulsory and voluntary income management is having on the wellbeing of families and children in Perth and the Kimberley in Western Australia;


(b) an independent evaluation of income management in Western Australia reported that income management had made a positive impact on the lives of women and children including increasing their ability to meet essential needs and save money;


(c) that a non discriminatory model of income management system has been rolled out in the Northern Territory to help children who are being neglected or are at risk of neglect;


(d) that more than 1,700 people have moved off income management across the Northern Territory including because they have found jobs and apprenticeships or improved their parenting skills; and


(e) that income management produces positive life impacts for individuals acquiring new skills through training and getting jobs;


(2) welcomes the Government’s decision to trial income management in other communities to help those families and individuals receiving welfare payments who:


(a) are identified as vulnerable by Centrelink social workers;


(b) are referred by child protection workers; or


(c) volunteer to participate to improve their ability to manage and save money and provide the essentials of life for their children; and


(3) calls for continued evaluation and monitoring of income management in the new and existing locations with a view to assisting further expansion for the benefit of vulnerable Australians—


I move In my last speech regarding these matters I spoke a great deal about Western Australia. I do not propose to do that tonight. The member for Durack and others from Western Australia can do that. It has been a long time since I have had anything to do with Western Australia. But in the conclusion of that speech I spoke about the income management and other welfare reforms which have been undertaken by this government. I spoke about their extension to other areas around Australia, in particular into my own community and I think that these reforms are critical but only if they are matched with opportunity. Specifically, I asked for them to be put into the community of Playford. I have been not only talking about this in parliament but also lobbying government ministers because I believe that while Playford, which incorporates the old city of Elizabeth and the old city of Munno Parra, has always been a great working-class community it has always been a community that has been buffeted by changes in the Australian economy, in particular the reduction of tariffs and the demolition of unskilled jobs. So we find that while the average unemployment rate across the country is 5.1 per cent, something we can all be proud of, the average rate across Playford is 12.7 per cent. In some suburbs it is as high as 20 per cent. We know that in some of these communities up to 48.2 per cent of the working age population is in receipt of some Centrelink benefit. We know that the average duration of unemployment is 54 weeks, as against the national average of 36 weeks. We know that all of this has a devastating impact on people's employment prospects, particularly in the new economy.


It is interesting to note that in Playford we used to have a problem with jobs as there were just not enough jobs. When I came out of university I ended up, as a university graduate, being a cleaner. I ended up working in warehouses. I ended up being a trolley collector. I ended up doing casual work of all shapes and sizes—and if I were doing that work then almost certainly I would have displaced someone with less education, someone who was less able to participate in the education system and in the economy.


We know that for such a long period people just did not have the opportunity to work. Of course, unemployment is the most destructive thing that you can do to a family. It is the most destructive thing that you can do to a community. We know that out of all of that has come the terrible blight of decades of unemployment. We have had intergenerational unemployment, simply families that could not get a start even after education and desperate attempts to find employment. Even after really trying hard, they could not find work and this led to all sorts of social problems.


The destruction of the family unit in many of these communities led to problems that were symptoms of this economic and social breakdown but ended up being problems in their own right. So we know that many of these communities need both specific action as to and specific changes to our welfare system. They need the linking of income management with the social security system and the child protection system. We know we have to interlink those systems so that they effectively manage people's incomes and effectively give people the assistance that they need to stabilise their households and, from there, gain employment, education and participation in the broader community. But we also know that we have to provide not just training but the prospect of a job at the end of it.


Governments can do things and I think in this area we have done a great job in terms of income management. Some five of 10 communities around the country are getting income protection and the others of the 10 are getting special programs to intervene to help teenage mothers and the like. But we are not at the end of it. A job is the most valuable thing. A government can take action but we need to provide work. That is why it is so good to see that in my community Holden's have provided a guarantee of 20 jobs off the line to long-term unemployed people who have completed a three-month, five-day-a-week training course. This training course is designed specifically to lift people out of unemployment and into work. It is designed specifically to intervene in people's lives and give them personal presentation and literacy and numeracy skills. It is designed basically around employability. I think that is critical, along with the government's welfare reforms, to sending the message that, although we expect more of people in this new economy and we are not prepared to leave people behind anymore after two decades of economic change, we are prepared to provide opportunity. Nearly all of the money to run these employability courses, these pre-employment courses, comes from federal programs.


They need employers to engage and we have seen both Holden and Woolworths provide these opportunities, provide this work. We have seen Holden now running a second program again some 40 places in the program with 20 employment opportunities. We have also seen Woolworths at Blakes Crossing embark on the Fresh 40 Program, which is all about providing people who have been unemployed and giving them the employability skills so that they can get to work. 


Welfare to work is about many things. It is about the government's changes, particularly around income management; particularly around team mothers. But it is also about embracing communities. It is about linking reform to opportunity. That is the critical part that has been missing in previous attempts. We have heard a lot about these matters over the years. We have seen many shock jocks say that if only people did a bit more or knocked on a few more doors they would get work. We have seen a lot of people frankly make excuses for those not seeking work. Neither approach is responsible. It is not responsible for community members; it is certainly not responsible for government members of MPs to advocate. Basically we need both reform which requires more of people and asks more of people in certain instances and it requires that they have stable households. It requires that they send their kids to school; it requires that they participate in the community the same way we would expect anybody to participate. It also requires the government and business and others to come up with the path to employment; to come up with a path out of the mire of intergenerational unemployment which can be so heartbreaking and so difficult and you can only feel for those people who often try. They try and they try and sometimes they get casual work and they just lift themselves out of these problems and something comes along, they lose their job and they are back on the heap. 


We do not want to see that happening. We want to make sure that people are lifted out of poverty and lifted out of unemployment. We can only do that if we provide opportunity. As I said, for so long in these communities opportunity was absent. It is now the opposite. We now find that employers cannot fill vacancies; we find, in particular, employers who have skilled vacancies unable to find employment. We have to set up a system where we retrain those who are currently in employment. Retrain them to take on the work that is provided in the Defence industry; retrain them to work in the mines and in the civil construction area where there are going to be so many high paid opportunities and we will kick ourselves if we miss them. We need to retrain the unemployed—this group of people who have been left behind in previous economic growth; left behind after a decade of indifference by the coalition government, to these communities interests. We need to retrain them to take the unskilled jobs or the semi-skilled jobs that will be left behind in this great transition that we are going through. This great change in our terms of trade; this great economic bounty that will hit us which is presenting all sorts of challenges in all sorts of areas but one of them is this area and I think all of these reforms that the government has undertaken and which I personally lobbied for are the beginning of that transformation and the beginning of hope coming to these communities. I commend it to the house.'

"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr HAASE
 (Durack) (20:38):  Thank you Madam Deputy Speaker. I rise this evening to support this private member's motion. I believe income management, either compulsory or voluntary, has a valid place within Australian society regardless of the recipients colour or creed. This private members motion moved by a member of the government is rather refreshing. So many members of the government, because of their apparent high regard for equal opportunity, believe that the intervention by government with a program of income management somehow takes away the more important basic rights of individuals. This lofty, worldly view of human rights may be fine in debating circles however to hold a view that income management and its potential removal of basic or equal rights is more important than the lives of small innocent children, has moved me to support this motion. The motion is outlined in detail by the member for Wakefield. He highlights a number of statistical benefits as a result of income management. The negative impact of welfare does not discriminate against race as our moral responsibility to ensure all children—children of any heritage—trapped within the walls of welfare are fed, clothed, educated, safe and in a warm bed at night. These expectations must be realised for all children, not just some. 


A few months ago the ABC, in cohorts with Animals Australia, put to air a carefully compiled piece to denigrate the live cattle export industry in Australia. I find it alarming that a population so ready to stop an industry in its tracks in an effort to stop the cruelty recently shown to be inflicted on animals overseas cannot show the same passion in response to the very real problem of cruelty to our children. The only explanation is that the population is unaware of the truth. That they have to be shown by the same people who pushed the button on their computer or got out of bed on a Sunday to attend a rally to influence a decision on something they know nothing about is remarkable. To choose to be sympathetic to animals and ignore our abused children, often in remote communities—children who have no voice and no button to push for help—is truly remarkable.



A government member:  Surely you can do both.




Mr HAASE:
  Not necessarily multi-skilled. The Little children are sacred report of the Northern Territory board of inquiry into the protection of Aboriginal children from sexual abuse published in 2007 seems to have been forgotten. The board of inquiry into the protection of Aboriginal children from sexual abuse submitted an interim report to the Chief Minister in October 2006 and it said:


Sexual abuse of children is not restricted to those of Aboriginal descent … nor to just the Northern Territory. The phenomenon knows no racial, age or gender borders. It is a national and international problem.


The classic indicia of children likely to suffer neglect, abuse and/or sexual abuse are unfortunately, particularly apparent in Aboriginal communities. Family dysfunctionality, as a catch-all phrase, reflects and encompasses problems of alcohol and drug abuse, poverty, housing shortages, unemployment and the like. All of these issues exist in many Aboriginal communities.


I can stand here and espouse all manner of doctrine, but the truth of the matter is I do not have the answers to all of the problems faced by not only those in our remote Aboriginal communities but also those in the wider community who are suffering from the same—dare I say—social malaise.


I do know, however, that income management appears to be working and should be extended. It is instinctive to protect our young and we are morally bound to protect not only the young but also the feeble, the infirm, the disadvantaged. What sort of country have we become that our moral compass is so out of whack we have forgotten the horror that was made public in 2007? Women, children and the elderly are being abused on a daily basis and too many are pretending it is not happening. Income management ensures priority items such as rent, utilities, food, clothes, health items and basic household products are paid for. What it does not allow for is the spending of money on alcohol, pornography, tobacco, gambling products, gambling services, home brew kits or home brew concentrate, very specific.


The Northern Territory Centre for Disease Control provides sexually transmitted infection data for children in the Territory for 2000 to 2005. The following is from the Little children are sacred report:




The per capita rate of sexually transmitted infection amongst all Aboriginal people is between seven and thirty times greater than for non-Aboriginal people. From 2001 to 2005 of all SDIs diagnosed in Aboriginal people, 8 per cent occurred in children under the age of 16 years, compared with 3.2 per cent for non-Aboriginal children. SDIs are statistically more likely to be found in Aboriginal children. From 2001 to 2005, an STD was identified in 64 children aged under 12 years. Some 54 of these children were identified as aboriginal, five were identified as non-aboriginal and the cultural identity of another five was not reported. 



Sixty-four children under the age of 12 years were identified as having sexually transmitted diseases. Regardless of racial origin, these figures are abhorrent. I very much doubt that these children were having sex of their own free will. I dare say the majority of these innocent children were from homes where alcohol and drug abuse is the norm and where welfare money was spent on getting high. If even one child is saved from both the physical pain and the ongoing mental anguish because of welfare quarantining, it is worth it. I challenge anyone to disagree with me and I dare any civil libertarian to look me in the eye and tell me I am wrong. I have seen the damage done, I have heard the stories and I am disappointed that we did not initiate income management sooner. 


   Our welfare system in some cases creates long-term intergenerational dependency too often including those able to participate in work. Yes, good old-fashioned work. Work promotes self discipline and self-esteem—the Australian idiom of a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. Inability to manage money or spending in a manner that ignores the basic necessities has been a major problem in my remote communities. It is sadly a problem that for too long has been overlooked. Why, you may ask. I suggest because some bureaucrat decided that equal rights and political correctness were more important than mutual obligation. Going further than this motion, I would suggest that those communities which are supported by taxpayers but which have no chance of jobs are unsustainable. Imagine a life where each day rolls into another, one where nothing punctuates those days—no challenge, no responsibility, nothing to look forward to except the day the welfare cheque comes in. It is a life of boredom and hopelessness.


We have no right to take away a person's dignity; no right whatsoever to keep giving handouts and expect nothing in return. We must educate our people. We must move them to work. We must give back a sense of self pride. We must demand mutual obligation. Tough love is required. No matter what our colour, we instinctively know the difference between right and wrong from a very early age. Drugs and alcohol blur the ages of reality, but they do not change right from wrong.


There are civil libertarians who argue against income management, but I wonder if they have ever looked into the eyes of a child who is no longer raped by a drunk or drugged father, uncle, brother, cousin or neighbour. Have they looked into the eyes of a wife who is no longer beaten and raped by a husband fuelled by alcohol and drugs? I do not think so. If they had, they would support income management. There cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach to reform, and income management may not be the best answer to a range of insidious social conditions; but it is the best answer we have at this point in time. To ignore the plight of children locked within the walls of generational welfare is to be complicit in the horrendous outcomes of that cycle. I seriously support this motion.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-08-22,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (20:49):  This is an important issue. It slips through when everyone is trying to be politically correct around the way we view and identify issues, particularly those associated with welfare. What the member for Wakefield has been able to do is to ensure that our focus is firmly and unwaveringly fixed on families and children in particular. Just to reiterate, income management is an arrangement whereby a percentage of the income will be quarantined to be available for priority goods for families, such as food, housing, clothing, education and health care.


Income management is an essential tool necessary for individuals to participate, particularly families, in the normal discourse of life and for ensuring that their families will not miss out. There are many families in Australia that sometimes struggle to stretch their budget to ensure that they are providing the necessary support for basic elements of life. Sometimes, regrettably, because of various choices, particularly bad choices, that people make there is not enough money available in the family budget to ensure that provision for their family, particularly for their children, is met in an appropriate way.


One thing that this initiative seeks to do is ensure that individuals have the necessary skills and knowledge about how to manage their finances, things that many of us take for granted. But the truth of the matter is that it does not equally apply to everybody, particularly those on a limited income through a welfare system.


When we discuss things like this, often people want to talk about the fundamentals of human rights. In fact, the member for Durack just referred to that. I often speak about human rights in the House. But, first and foremost, in any discourse on human rights must be the human rights that prevail for children. A child who is being neglected or at risk of being neglected deserves to be assisted in having a brighter future under the care and guidance of their parents, particularly those who are capable of taking care of them. Sometimes they have to learn to take care of them. It would be a great tragedy to see people lose custody of their children simply because of lack of education and information on how to manage their family finances.


I have only been in my current electorate for a little over 12 months but within my former electorate was Macquarie Fields, which is a very significant housing commission area and certainly an economically challenged area. There are many issues there. I spent a lot of time there with people such as Father Chris Riley, trying to do things, particularly post the 2005 riots. I met up with a bloke who freely admitted he was a drug addict. When we were having some discussions about his financial situation, he became very morose. He admitted to me that if there had been some greater effort to actually control his welfare he may not have lost his three children. He thought he had a system available to him where he got his payments and all the rest of it. He had good intentions of looking after his kids, sending them to school and doing all the other things that most parents do. But when he got into drugs and alcohol and things like that, a lot of that fell away. In fact, so did his parental responsibilities of ensuring his kids went to school and a few other things.


The consequence was that the New South Wales government, through DOCS, moved in and, rightfully, put the children into foster homes where they, at least, could have an opportunity for a future. This bloke asserted to me, 'If there were some system of intervention, some system that could have prevailed, other than ""Give me the cheque every fortnight""—some way that I could have been held to account for what I was not doing, I might have woken up to myself.' I think that is the point that the member for Wakefield made. This is not necessarily a case of people being bad or squandering their money and doing all those other things; a lot of it is just inexperience in doing the right thing, failing to learn and failing to see the relevance of that to children.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (20:54):  I wish to add my support tonight to the concept of income management. The reality is that right around this country, from different groups, different communities, different places, there are parents who are making decisions that are not always in the best interests of their child. Whether that is through human frailty or an intent to put their own priorities first and above that of their children, the outcomes can be the same. The children finish second, and that is a tragedy. It is something that we need to guard against.


I have said in the past that I believe there should be more times when, if a child is in danger or is in circumstances of such negativity in the home, children should be taken from their parents to protect them, to make their lives a better opportunity for them in the future. But it is the case that after times of crime or drug use or abuse of various substances, in circumstances where the parents are not making good decisions, then there is that place for income management. When the agencies have identified the families, the parents or the carers who need to be assisted then that is certainly the case and that should occur.


I welcome the fact that income management started as part of the Northern Territory intervention and continues today. I hope to see it rolled across the whole country, not only where we just say a particular area needs support and everyone in that area should be on income management, but also in those circumstances where state agencies have identified the opportunities for families to be assisted under an obligation, if nothing else. If they have identified those families then it does not matter what colour their skin is or what race or from what background they are. The important thing is that we have the will in this place to step in and do what needs to be done for the sake of the children. I certainly appreciate that there is wide bipartisan support for exactly these sorts of measures.


As part of this scenario, we know there are times when people will go out there and decide what the priorities are for their family. Sometimes it can be cigarettes, alcohol, drugs or maybe it is gambling. There are a lot of different vices in many respects that demonstrate that a person has a skewed view of the world. Those vices are the high priority and the needs of the child, whether it is good food on the table or clean clothes on the children, tend to come second. That is a tragedy and again it goes to the point that, in all the cases when families are identified as being in need of assistance such as income support, this is where it comes in.


We know that here has been success. There have been people who have embraced the obligation put upon them and have risen above the old circumstances under which they lived. But we need to be careful as well. People need to never forget that in these cases of adversity or when things are going wrong in their lives, the first thing they should do is look in the mirror and decide what part they have played. We need to be very careful in this country that we do not always look for someone who has failed or has these sorts of issues. What has society done wrong? The reality is that we need to look at ourselves first. We need to have that sense of personal responsibility before we look for others to blame. So we need to be careful that the victim culture in this country does not let people off the hook, so that they do not embrace their own weaknesses, so that they can work on improving themselves to get themselves out of trouble with the help of society.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2011-08-22,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (21:00):  It is with some regret that I rise to speak tonight, at a time when there are numerous consequences from global financial turmoil and equally from the effects of the poor economic and financial management of this Labor-Greens government. It is only going to get worse once we start to see the full impact of the carbon tax, which is like a cyclone bearing down on our economy, businesses and consumers, who are already beginning to feel some of the effects and are beginning to batten down the hatches. We are seeing this in reduced retail trade and poor business sentiment survey figures.


The Labor-Greens government has, over the course of the past four years, presided over waste and mismanagement on a scale never before seen in the history of this great nation, and now they wish to finish the job by introducing a carbon tax at a time of great global economic uncertainty. It is important to consider in this context the principles that allow a market economy to function effectively. These principles include protection of private property rights, freedom of contract, personal responsibility, open and fair markets, monetary flexibility and a steadiness of economic policy.


It has been well demonstrated globally that countries with a well-defined system of laws that protect private property rights have prospered, and it is concerning to note the doubt being placed in the agricultural industry due to the rights of mining companies under their mining leases. The doubt that is created in one of our nation's most important industries is a grave concern, as it flows through to other areas of the community as people begin to wonder about the security of food supplies and other agricultural products in the future.


Freedom of contract is an essential component of a well-functioning market economy and means that individuals and businesses are free to negotiate the terms and conditions of their own contracts free from government interference. A current example of the government's failure to adhere to this principle is in respect of the changes proposed under the FOFA reforms, particularly in relation to opt-in provisions. Clients of financial planners have always had the option to move to another financial planner at any time that they see fit, and there is no necessity for the government to add to an already large body of red tape and regulations swamping the financial planning industry by applying onerous opt-in provisions. If the government wish to truly improve the future outcomes for the community, they would do far better to focus on the corporate governance issues affecting the industry, as has been clearly outlined by the Cooper review, and seek to make the product manufacturers more accountable for the products that they bring to market.


Personal responsibility, as we frequently discuss, is something that over the past several decades has been increasingly on the wane. We as a nation seek to have other people solve our problems for us and, unfortunately, over the past few decades increasingly the government has been seen as a saviour for people's problems—and that is irrespective of what side of politics we are on. That devalues the notion of personal responsibility. It is time that we again value the notion of personal responsibility and be prepared to be held accountable for our actions and accept the consequences thereof. It is not good enough for people to go cap in hand to governments to solve their problems, as this ultimately leads to bigger governance with more legislation to administer, the end result being an ever greater bureaucracy and a growing loss of freedom.


Open markets are the cornerstone of our economy, and the ability to trade both internally and externally is vitally important to the future economic prospects of this country. It is important that we continue to pursue new free trade agreements and also to prosecute the argument for removal of subsidies and tariffs globally, which distort our global trade markets. Distortion of subsidies and tariffs results in an obscuring of price signals that indicate to companies what goods and services are actually required. In addition, governments who provide these subsidies are in actuality redistributing the nation's wealth to industries that would not survive without the subsidy. This does not provide the basis for sound economic policy. 


One of the greatest problems we have in the world today is that of monetary and financial stability. Since 1971 we have had a global financial system which has developed into a debt based fiat money and inflationary model. This has resulted in a perceived increase in wealth, when in reality it has lead to a decrease in real wealth, increasing inequalities in wealth and income and a general loss of income for the future. 


The principles that I have touched on ultimately should all lead to a steadiness of economic policy and activity. It is therefore instructional to look at the current results being generated under the guidance of the current Labor-Greens government. In the four years since Labor came to power, they have squandered a surplus of over $20 billion and succeeded in racking up a net debt of some $107 billion—and growing. These funds have been spent on a variety of projects which may in the initial concept have been sound, but the execution has left a lot to be desired—projects such as the pink batt insulation scheme, which was rorted and resulted in many homes being burned and lives being lost, and the BER school halls program, which in some areas resulted in buildings that were grossly overpriced, were not what schools wanted or were a combination of both. That program lacked consultation with schools and communities to determine what those schools and communities actually required—although that was not across the board; there were areas that were very successful. The NBN has the potential to cost far more than the allocated $36 billion, a cost far in excess of any other similar program globally and one which, despite assurances to the contrary, does not appear to be providing any cost savings in services. It is a project whose magnitude should be reviewed. A cost benefit analysis should be completed to ensure Australian taxpayers are getting value for money. We can touch on many other programs. The set-top box program and the  immigration program are other  examples of failures of this current Labor-Greens government. 


On top of this we have the spectre of a carbon tax, which, according to my investigations at this point at least, will provide no practical on-the-ground environmental benefit. It will however provide us with some of the most expensive power in the world and significantly damage our small to medium sized businesses, which are the majority employers in this nation. That will provide a consequent flow-on to the impact on jobs. In addition, government wishes to seek to implement a mining resource rent tax, which will impact on the sole successful industry in our economy at present. 


It has been ably demonstrated over many years that bigger government and higher taxes or higher fees and charges is not the solution to future economic growth. It is actually lower taxes and less regulation, a sound financial system, that provides the framework for businesses to grow and prosper and for our economy to grow and prosper for future generations. It will always be the case that capital being retained by business for future growth will be used far more effectively and thoughtfully than that dollar of capital being in the government's hands for purposes of taxation, government spending or redistribution of wealth. It is those avenues, through capital being retained in business, that will fund the future growth of our economy to prosper into the future, not through the new and higher taxes and regulation imposed by a government that appears to have little if any economic understanding, despite their protestations to the contrary.
