"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-03-06,"It is my recollection that when the debate on this legislation was adjourned I had a few minutes remaining to me to wind up my remarks. I think the truth is that the substantial burden of my remarks is now on the parliamentary record, and in the four minutes that I have left it is perhaps appropriate to summarise exactly what the opposition's view of this legislation is. We have made a decision to not oppose this legislation. That decision was a closely run thing, when you balance the competing interests. We think the decision at the end of the day is appropriate that a competitive requirement should be applied to EFIC.
But on the other side of the ledger we are concerned that at a time when there is a record current account deficit for Australia and a record trade deficit for this nation, the impact of this bill may be to impose higher costs on exporters, the very people that we would want to see being more competitive so that Australia ceases importing more than it exports and turns the tables and starts to export more than it imports, and particularly exports more at a high value added level rather than making its name in world trade as an exporter of mineral and agricultural commodities at minimum level of value added and, therefore, not generating the jobs in Australia that could otherwise have been generated were we to add value to our primary products.
That said, my concern is that EFIC will be put in a position where it competes in the private sector on competitive neutrality grounds but the private sector will pick and choose which areas it competes in, and thus pick the more lucrative areas of competition. This will leave EFIC, as the government commercially driven agency, to compete with them where the economies of scale are but EFIC will bear the cost and weight of responsibility of providing a service to exporters in areas where there is little competition or no competition at all. A national facility like EFIC has to be provided to ensure that we capture high risk markets for our exporters and insure our exporters against that risk, because if we did not do that we would not have those markets. And some of them are quite substantial markets. I will not go to particular countries, but for the wheat industry there are countries in the Middle East and in the former Soviet Union there are republics—as well as Russia itself—which are valued as high risk destinations for Australian exporters and where, if you were exporting, you would need to take out insurance as to whether you would be paid for the goods once delivered. If there is a degree of non-commerciality about that, that degree of non-commerciality could be driven further by this bill.
Therefore, our concluding position is we will go along with the legislation that the government has proposed. We will monitor its application. We will reserve the right to argue for a reintroduction of the status quo should EFIC be driven into a marginal situation where its costs are driven up and its services to exporters are driven down and where exporters have to bear a higher burden.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-03-06,"—The Australian Democrats share many of the concerns put forward by Senator Cook in his speech in the second reading debate. However, we will be opposing the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 1999, which is now before us. The Commonwealth's Export Finance and Insurance Corporation provides internationally competitive insurance and finance services. It is a commercially viable corporation which provides an important function to support Australian exports that has not been traditionally provided by the private sector. It, like all export credit agencies under the terms of the World Trade Organisation's subsidies code, is required to operate in a way such that it is financially sustainable into the long term. 
Facilitation of Australian export trade through the provision of credit insurance and finance services and products has required the establishment of a Commonwealth statutory authority to adequately guarantee the provision of such products and services for Australian exporters. EFIC was established with a particular charge: to provide support in areas where commercial organisations were unable—or perhaps unwilling—to be involved in the provision of services in relation to credit insurance and financial services, due to risk or a range of other factors. EFIC supports the full spectrum of Australia's export trade and provides one of the very few methods for national assistance in trade. Non-tariff measures are one of the few ways in which assistance can be provided for trade without infringing—certainly these days—on our international trade commitments. This said, the Democrats have grave concerns with the legislation that is before us today.
The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 1999 aims essentially to make the corporation subject to the principles of competitive neutrality as per the Commonwealth's competitive neutrality policy. Competitive neutrality forms part of the national competition policy which aims primarily to ensure that publicly owned enterprises are not favourably treated, in comparison with private sector counterparts, in receiving a competitive advantage. In general, the promotion of the national competition policy, the NCP, has not necessarily been an Australian Democrat pursuit. I note that the application of competitive neutrality commenced under the former Keating government and its application to statutory bodies receives bipartisan support, which is evident in the chamber again today.
Unfortunately, this policy and this legislation has been employed in recent years to pursue an unqualified agenda of competitive neutrality. Although the legislation and the National Competition Council do not require organisations to pursue competitive neutrality at all costs, I fear that this has been the manner in which the policy has been interpreted and implemented by the current government, basically as a means to execute their at times excessively rationalist agenda. This perception has been noted in the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy. The report's executive summary states:
The community is clearly expressing concern at the social consequences of the changes that are resulting from NCP, general micro-economic reform and globalisation. There is a concern that the policies labelled as `economic rationalisation policies' are eroding the social cohesion of some communities and devaluing social objectives at the expense of economic objectives such as productivity and efficiency.
In fact, the National Competition Council and national competition legislation contain the proviso that, if the public benefit cost of the organisation becoming nationally competitive outweighs the benefits of being nationally competitive, then it should not slavishly pursue a nationally competitive agenda. The public interest guiding principle of the national competition policy asserts that competition in general will promote community welfare by increasing national income through encouraging improvements in efficiency. This, however, does not sit well with all sectors of the community, especially those who have expressed concerns about possible adverse social consequences from pro-competitive reform.
The recent Riding the waves of change report has found that there has been inconsistent application and interpretation of the public interest test in the application of national competition policy, and that economic assessment has dominated assessment to the cost of less equally quantifiable factors, such as social and environmental impacts. So instead of evenly balancing or at least acknowledging the social and environmental impacts, the economic assessment seems to have dominance. In fact, the report in its recommendations called for jurisdictions to ensure that in implementing this public benefit test, environmental externalities are appropriately considered. Clearly, that is something that the Democrats are very concerned about. We must view the bill before us today in light of the issues that the Riding the waves of change report highlights about national competition policy and, furthermoreand, indeed, this is something pointed out by the previous speakerin light of Australia's current trade figures. 
Australia has currently its greatest trade deficit, the largest current account deficit and the highest level of net foreign liabilities. Basically, we are more in debt-borrowing and buying more internationally than ever before. On top of this, the Asian economic crisis has resulted in a reduction in private sector credit insurance facilities, thus putting increased pressure on the EFIC facilities. This pressure has been noted by DFAT to be slowly easing as banks and commercial insurers are rebuilding their books for the Asian countries that were most severely affected. Asia is EFIC's largest market for medium to long-term finance and political risk insurance. It has been noted that this has been reduced by the crisis. However, this trend seems to be reversing. Requiring EFIC to be competitively neutral at the stage when the need for EFIC's services in the Asian region is of great public importance must be of questionable wisdom. The uncertainty surrounding the ongoing impact of the East Asian financial crisis and the government's record low international trade figures once again puts into question the timing of this change.
Senator Cook stated that the Labor Party would not support any attempts by the government to further undermine EFIC in whatever form. May I suggest that the added pressures of changes such as those contained in the bill before us may indeed drive EFIC to marginality, or in fact affect its commercial viability considering the requirements for EFIC services at this time. Surely, the public benefit of EFIC's operations is greater than the benefits of being nationally competitive.
The Democrats believe that the timing of this change is inappropriate, given the government's poor international trade figures and the ongoing financial impact and uncertainty related to the East Asian financial crisis, although this is not the extent of the Democrats' concerns with this bill. We support the provision of additional funding and support to enhance Australia's export facilities. In fact, Democrat policy extends beyond this, with the goal of providing support rather than merely providing EFIC style assistance. However, a range of concerns are guiding operation of this bill, its timing, its impact on various sectors and what some have considered a dearth of consultation in its introduction. We must consider the impact of this bill within the current trade context.
For example, President Clinton made an announcement on Friday, 11 February regarding the introduction of two safeguard measures restricting imports of steel wire rod and welded line pipe into the United States. The United States will introduce a tariff rate quota of 1.58 million net tonnes on imports of steel wire rod valid for three years. The quota level will increase by two per cent annually, but imports exceeding this quota will be subject to an additional import duty of 10 per cent in the first year, 7.5 per cent in the second year and five per cent in the third year. While the European Union have concerns about this development, it will also impact on our export steel industry. Forcing EFIC to be competitively neutral at a time when our own industry is obviously suffering and requires assistance can only be detrimental. Given that its basic function is to provide assistance when the market will not, it is somewhat odd and inconsistent to suggest that the organisation should be preparing for competition when its role is to provide a service which the market has not already extensively provided. How may competitive neutrality be achieved when there is not a private sector counterpart in this case?
Another concern that the Democrats have with the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 1999 is an increase in fees and charges to EFIC's clients. While it is not possible to estimate at this stage the total sum of the payments to the Commonwealth proposed by the bill, we can only assume that the payments will raise EFIC's costs and therefore the charges to exporter clients, who in turn will pass on the higher costs. This aspect of the bill is likely to have a significant impact, particularly on small to medium enterprise clients of EFIC. This anticipated cost passing could very likely result in a reduction in the share of Australian exports which are subject to credit insurance. 
The government has noted in the regulatory impact statement that there has been no formal consultation with exporters, although it does acknowledge that they would `potentially be affected by any changes proposed'. There have been no indications of EFIC's or the private sector's view of their predictions of the possible impact of this bill. The Democrats are certainly concerned about this lack of consultation. We believe that that is inadequate.
We also have environmental and ethical practice concerns about Australian companies currently funded by EFIC. We believe that there is a need to ensure that our Export Finance and Insurance Corporation is able to operate not only commercially, as everyone is so keen to see it do, but also ethically. We have brought the issue of taxpayers' money being used to support companies' overseas operations that do not adhere to Australian environmental standards before this chamber on a number of occasions—namely, in questions by my colleague and our environment spokesperson, Senator Andrew Bartlett. The example of the operations of Australian company Esmeralda, which did in fact lead to a cyanide spill into the rivers in Hungary and more widely in Europe, is an example of the need for EFIC to require environmental standards from company clients and customers. I acknowledge that this may not be possible within the scope of the bill we are dealing with today. However, it is an overdue change to current practice.
The use of Australian taxpayers' money to assist mining projects, such as Esmeralda's overseas operations through EFIC, is at the very least inappropriate. In fact, it is in contradiction of the basic role of encouraging Australian export trade. In this day and age, our international trading reputation is of course essential to successful trade operations. Our environmental track record will be a basic platform to launch Australia's exports from in the emerging global and, I believe, consciously green marketplace. If we allow Australian companies to operate overseas and not adhere to environmental standards, then we will only act to exacerbate Australia's current poor international trade figures. Appropriate legislation is required to ensure that environmental standards are practised overseas at such a level that they provide an international display of environmental best practice. The government must ensure that environmental standards are maintained not only for the purposes of respecting the biological integrity of the local habitat but furthermore—and this is of direct relevance to this bill—for international competitiveness in the emerging global marketplace.
Placing environmental and human rights employment practice standards on companies that undertake overseas operations is a reasonable and practical method of ensuring that taxpayers' money is supporting companies which are ethically responsible. It is also a suitable means of ensuring that Australia's international trading reputation is protected in a shrinking, media saturated world, where companies' environmental and human rights records are international news. We have obviously seen that in the last couple of weeks. Such incidents may not only damage Australia's reputation but damage those that seek to invest overseas.
As the Riding the waves of change report notes, `market forces are global but the social fallout that policy makers have to manage is local'. Our poor environmental practices on foreign soil will indeed come back to haunt us. For the varying reasons I have outlined in my comments, the Democrats will not be supporting the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill. The promotion of Australian exports requires further consideration—we believe that very strongly—particularly in light of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Socio-Economic Consequences of the National Competition Policy entitled Riding the waves of change. The Democrats would seek to provide additional funding and support to enhance ethical and environmentally sustainable Australian exporting beyond the EFIC style assistance.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-03-06,"—The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 1999 is in its essence a bill to apply the principles of competitive neutrality to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. Labor is supportive of this bill because we are supportive of the principles of competitive neutrality. Indeed, as has been pointed out, it was a policy that the Keating Labor government introduced and is one which continues to have bipartisan support. However, we are very concerned that this bill will introduce additional costs to exporters at a time when the country can least afford it. We are concerned about the timing of the bill and the fact that there has been no consultation with the groups that it will affect the most—that is, Australia's exporters. 
Let us remind ourselves of some key facts. In 1998, Australia recorded the largest ever trade deficit in our history—over $10 billion. In 1999, we recorded the largest ever current account deficit—over $34.6 billion, an increase of $5.8 billion or 20 per cent on the deficit recorded for 1998. We have also recorded the highest ever level of net foreign liabilities—the last figures were over $350 billion. The increase in the current account deficit was largely due to an increase of $4.5 billion or five per cent in goods imports together with a fall in goods exports of $2 billion or two per cent.
What is happening to our economy is that we are sucking in imports and we do not have the export income to pay for them. Our traditional export industries are struggling. As an example, coal, coke and briquettes are down $1.4 billion or 14 per cent. Metal ores and minerals are down $0.9 billion or eight per cent. Wool and sheepskins are down $0.6 billion or 20 per cent. We need our manufacturing industries to increase their exports, but the latest figures reveal that our export of manufactures fell over the past year. But the worst thing for Australia is that, in the area of the new economy, not only did exports fall but the fall was greatest in elaborately transformed manufactures, the export of which dropped by five per cent. This is a sector that represents our future. It is exactly the sector that we should be promoting if we are to realise the goal of creating a high skill, high wage Australia. In a time when we are running record trade deficits, the last thing that we need to do is give our exporters additional costs, yet this is exactly what this bill will do.
The proposed changes to EFIC will impose costs on exporters at what is clearly a difficult time. It is a time when our exporters are fighting against dumping in traditional markets. It is a time when we have flat exports to our two largest Asian trading partners, Japan and South Korea. It is a time when resurgence in the economies of South-East Asia and North-East Asia may bring the pressure of import competition. This is the background against which we need to assess the EFIC amendment bill. This bill applies the principles of competitive neutrality to EFIC, ensuring that as a government business it does not have a comparative advantage over its private sector competitors simply by virtue of its public ownership.
We support this principle, but this bill has a short-term potential to have an adverse impact on our exporters. We do know increased charges will impact on our exporters. According to the Parliamentary Library in its analysis:
While overall it is not possible at this stage to estimate the total amount of the payments to the Commonwealth proposed by the Bill, it must be assumed that they will raise EFIC's costs, and unless corresponding savings can be found, EFIC will be forced to pass on these higher costs to exporters in the form of higher charges.
Higher charges to exporters—this is at a time when we have a record trade deficit, at a time when our manufacturing industries are struggling to compete, at a time when our traditional exporters are facing dumping in traditional markets. We must ask the government: why are you doing this at this time? Do you understand what our exporters are going through or are you ignorant of their needs? Have you talked to exporters about these changes? The answer is no. Why not? What is your real motivation? Are you really seeking to rip some money out of a successful Commonwealth enterprise to prop up consolidated revenue? We do not know the answers. We do not know what level the government will set these fees at. The opposition will support the bill, but we condemn the government for its timing. We will scrutinise the implementation of the bill to ensure it does not adversely impact on our exporters.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-03-06,"—I particularly thank Senator Cook for his contribution to the debate. I would like to respond to a point raised by Senator Stott Despoja; otherwise, I wish the bill a speedy second reading. Senator Stott Despoja, on behalf of the Democrats, raised the issue of the environmental requirements upon EFIC. For Senator Stott Despoja's edification and that of other honourable senators, EFIC is subject to Commonwealth environmental leg-slation. The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act does apply to EFIC and, as all honourable senators would know, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act—which comes into force in July of this year—will replace that piece of legislation. The Commonwealth, at this stage, is examining a new legislative regime for when that occurs. So we do have that in mind. 
Senator Peter Cook raised concerns about what happens in the marketplace. He raised concerns about private sector insurers cherry-picking and not entering markets which are more vulnerable and risky where enterprises have trouble getting insurance. That is a legi-timate concern, I have discussed that with Senator Cook privately and it is an issue that the government will be keeping under active scrutiny and formally scrutinising as part of the first review, which will take place in just under 12 months time. So we will keep a close watch on that, as I am sure Senator Peter Cook will. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-03-06,"—The Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill 1999 seeks to abolish the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, known as NBEET. This bill was first introduced into the parliament on 27 June 1996. It never got a second reading and is now being presented to us again today. This was originally an election promise made in 1996. To my knowledge, there has never been a definitive statement put down by the government as to why they sought to abolish NBEET. It has been effectively undermined by the actions of the minister who, without having a bill to support his actions, instructed the three councils and the board of NBEET to wind up their activities back in 1996. That was an act that should never have occurred. 
The bill being introduced for discussion here today is an act that should not have occurred either. It reflects not the government's priorities in regard to this particular piece of legislation—after all, it is legislation that has been hanging around since 1996—but the paucity of the government's management in regard to its legislative program. The legislative program is so thin that we have bills like this under discussion: bills that go back to 1996. We already have a bill in relation to the Australian Research Council listed on the Notice Paper for debate this current session. The intention of that bill is to fundamentally restructure the ARC.
The proposals we have before us here are not only very old but grossly out of date. The government has so badly managed its legislative program that it needs to dig deep into the barrel of legislation—old, redundant legislation—in a bid to cover up the air time in this parliament. It has not been able to get a sufficient legislative program prepared ready for consideration by this chamber. This bill seeks to alter the ARC in a rather pointless way, given that the new bill the government plans to introduce will seek to redress those provisions on yet another occasion. The bill establishes a structure that the government has absolutely no intention of implementing. It has already seen detailed plans to completely revamp, rewire and restructure that particular council.
It strikes me that this government has failed to get its act together in this matter. I think we are entitled to know why it is seeking to introduce a measure which has already been superseded by government announcements. Therefore, one is entitled to ask: `Why is such an irrelevant action being taken?' I come back to the proposition that this is clearly a case of the government wasting the time of this parliament. It is seeking to have a legislative package put through which does not in fact reflect its actual intentions. As I said, this bill, which was first introduced in 1996, sought to abolish the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, along with the Australian Language and Literacy Council, the Employment and Skills Council, the Higher Education Council and the Schools Council. This measure seeks to retain the Australian Research Council and the government later on will then reintroduce another measure to have the ARC operate under its own act. This was announced in the government's white paper and released last December. It is quite clearly no longer news. However, the old form of the ARC is retained needlessly in this particular bill.
The more fundamental problem relates to why the government has effectively abolished NBEET to begin with. We have a new look ARC as envisaged by the government, but there are some serious flaws in that measure. It is comforting to see that at least one of the important areas of educational policy will remain: the capacity to have independent, arms-length advice in regard to the ARC. What troubles me, however, is the general proposition of the abolition of independent cross-sectoral advice. I indicate here that this speech at least provides one opportunity; that is, it allows me to restate the Labor Party's commitment to the reintroduction of a cross-sectoral independent body for advice to government, upon our re-election to government. 
NBEET was established in 1988. It reflected then the government's intention to have available to it advice across a range of education and vocational education issues. It was conceived to provide a unifying advisory mechanism outside of the department, and independent of the department. It provided a vehicle whereby the different views across the education community could be noted and different issues could be confronted in a way that forced that body to provide a unified view to government. The views were not always acceptable to government, were not always appreciated by government; nonetheless, they were generally regarded to be of an extraordinarily high standard. NBEET reports were generally well received throughout the community, even though the issues and opinions they canvassed were not always well received by individual ministers.
The functions and activities of NBEET and its councils have to be set against the long history of independent advisory structures that have been the feature of education policy making and implementation in Australia since the 1950s. This is the first government that I can recall that has effectively turned its back upon this important aspect of political debate in this country. We have seen it in a range of areas. We have seen a range of bodies defunded, that have lost their support from government, because on my judgment they provided advice that the government did not want to hear—that is, they were too independent.
We of course know of the Youth Policy Action Coalition and the Pensioners and Superannuants Federation. They are just two bodies that were found at the wrong end of government because they provided advice that the government did not want to hear. The Family Planning Association of Australia also ran into the same problem. The Australian Community Health Association, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission and the Association of Civilian War Widows are other bodies that have been defunded because they provided advice that was too independent for this government to be able to handle.
That is not the way it has always been in this country. The Australian Universities Commission was in fact set up by the Menzies government in 1959, following a major review of the Australian university system which culminated in the Murray report of 1957. The commission's main task was to advise on the allocation of Commonwealth funds, which at that time was about 29 per cent of university income. The Martin report in 1964 paved the way for the establishment of the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Advanced Education, which was in turn replaced in 1971, again under a coalition government, by the Commission on Advanced Education. Members of the Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education were appointed by the Governor-General on advice of the government of the day, but the convention included, variously, `representatives from the academic community, from the states, from industry and from the Commonwealth'.
The Australian Research Grants Committee, ARGC, was set up in 1965. Reflecting the committee's unique and specialised role, its members were senior and prominent researchers and academics. The policy of `expert' membership was reflected later in the membership of the Australian Research Council, the ARC—the body the government now seeks to restructure. As I say, that is another matter for another bill for another day.
The Schools Commission was established by the Whitlam government in 1973, following a report of a committee chaired by Professor Peter Karmel. In the same year, the Commonwealth Committee on Technical and Further Education was established as the precursor to the 1975 Commission on Technical and Further Education. Under Labor, in 1974, the Commonwealth assumed full responsibility for the funding of both universities and the advanced education sector. In 1977, the Fraser government replaced these three Commonwealth statutory corporations with one overarching body—then titled the Tertiary Education Commission, later the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, CTEC. This body had under its aegis three councils—the Universities Council, the Advanced Education Council and the Technical and Further Education Council. 
By statute, these councils, and the overarching commission, included among their membership representatives of a range of stakeholder organisations right across the industry. They did have some executive powers, and I think there was some criticism of the way in which that was at times exercised. However, the Hawke and Keating governments set as a very high priority the reform and integration of Australia's educational industry and, of course, established a unified representative body under NBEET. It was a body whose councils included for the first time the schools sector under the same advisory framework as the other post-school sectors.
So there is a history of development throughout the last 40 years where governments of all political persuasions were not frightened of the prospect of independent advice being presented to government. Under this government, however, we see a complete reversal of that position. John Dawkins told the House of Representatives during the second reading debate on the legislation to establish NBEET:
The central purpose of this Bill is to enhance and streamline advisory structures in employment, education and training in a manner consistent with the high economic and social priority placed on these activities by the government.
The Howard government has given no priority whatsoever to education and vocational education issues. So, in that sense, it is not surprising that a body like NBEET would be seen by this government to have so little value. To my knowledge, neither the board nor any of its councils—save the ARC—have any current membership. The government has allowed NBEET and its councils to fade into oblivion, pre-empting the abolition of the entire structure and thus technically breaching the NBEET act. The ARC, which the government plans to retain in its heavily modified form, remains functional; otherwise NBEET is no longer able to perform any of the functions required under its own act.
Cross-sectoral advice and perspectives that I think NBEET was famous for are still needed. What we see is that valuable functions have been lost to this government and to this parliament. That is the important point: the reports that NBEET produced were to this parliament and were available for public debate and public discussion. They had the ability to examine issues on a cross-sectoral basis. At a time when the traditional sectoral barriers separating schools from TAFE colleges, from universities and, of course, from labour market programs are all breaking down, you would have thought the need was all the more apparent right now, but not according to this government.
It is important to emphasise that the NBEET structures included employment and labour market issues because there was a perception that there was a need for an integrated response to the relationships between our educational sectors and our employment market. This was appropriate, but it has again been lost in this government's administration, with employment being taken out of the education portfolio not for any sound policy reason but because of Dr Kemp's demonstrable incompetence in being able to administer labour market programs.
We have seen a range of issues discussed in recent times: the convergence of general and vocational education; the nature and importance of employment related key competencies—in regard to articulation, credit transfer and recognition of prior learning both within and between services; the way in which people are encouraged to follow particular pathways through the different parts of structured education in this country to ensure there is an appropriate combination of skills and knowledge; and the emergence of the lifelong learning concept within education. All of these things point to the need for an independent, high quality, highly credible source of advice to government, but this government has failed to respond to these needs.
We have seen in recent times a revolution in methods and technologies for the delivery of education and training, and we have seen the blurring of the traditional divisions between sectors. The advent of the Internet and computer packaged learning, particularly within the VET system, is set to bring in whole new approaches to the delivery of education at all levels. This again points to the need for governments to respond to these developments.  
What we have under these arrangements is essentially an ad hoc response by government to each of the issues that are thrown up—and they quite often arise as a response to the opposition raising a particular matter within this chamber. We have seen, for instance, the review of the ESOS Act. We have seen the review in regard to the accreditation of universities, particularly with the scandal associated with Greenwich University at Norfolk Island. We have seen a whole range of devices this government seeks to compensate for as a result of the need to respond to day-to-day political pressures, when there ought to be a structural response built in to allow the whole industry to deal with these very serious issues in a much more thorough and comprehensive manner.
The Senate inquiry in 1996, which was initiated by the opposition, saw a range of people come forward and point out the need for there to be an independent advisory body such as NBEET. For instance, Professor Ian Chubb, the Vice-Chancellor of Flinders University, said: 
If some relationship between employment, education and training is assumed, then I believe a minister will need some body or other to integrate the often conflicting advice that will come from the various interest groups and to turn it into policy advice.
Professor Chubb went on to say: 
I have seen no good reason put forward for the abolition of NBEET.
And we have yet to see any good reason put forward some four years after the event. Mr Peter Laver, a former chairman of NBEET, told the Senate inquiry:
One of the benefits of the national board's structure has been the confederation style, where six councils basically report through a board to the Minister. This means that the implications of various pieces of advice are fully considered by putting it through the board so that the cross-sectoral aspects are accommodated prior to the advice being forwarded to the Minister and tabled in Parliament.
Mr Laver also said:
The other thing that I would have to say about the board is that in terms of providing advice—I have been associated with other government advisory bodies in the manufacturing industry and in science and technology and in rural areas—NBEET is quite a cost-effective way of doing it. The cost of running the national board compared to its output is a pretty good investment.
These are views that we, Labor members of the Senate inquiry, concurred with at the time, and views I still believe to be valid. Mr Laver's views about the effectiveness of NBEET were shared by Professor Ken Wiltshire, who conducted the review of the board, which reported in February 1994. The report concluded:
It can reasonably be stated that NBEET has fulfilled the bulk of the high expectations which were held for it six years ago.
The executive summary of the Wiltshire review talks in the following way about the changes facing Australia:
We still do not have, in this country, a clear enough understanding of, and a better capacity to address, the crucial linkages between the nation's economic performance, its employment parameters, and the implications for the role of the education and training sectors.
These challenges face all nations in the approach to the next century and millennium, but Australia is better positioned than most, with a portfolio grouping aligned to these dominant themes, and an independent body capable of marshalling the requisite knowledge and expertise ... 
The Wiltshire review continued:
The themes which should be the challenge for NBEET in its second era are intersectoral and international, for it will be policy advice of this kind on which Australia will depend and which any vision of this nation's future will encompass.
The coalition has effectively abandoned those sorts of visions. We have seen a policy predicated on the assumption that this government can do without independent advice. We have seen a pattern emerge within this government where it has sought to punish those who provide independent advice. It is for these reasons that I now move the opposition's second reading amendment: 
(1)	At the end of the motion, add:
	“but that the Senate: 
	(a)	is of the opinion that the measures proposed in this bill, relating to the Australian Research Council, are superseded by the bill listed as the Australian Research Council Bill, therefore rendering that aspect of the bill unnecessary and reflecting the Government's poor management of its legislative program;
	(b)	is of the opinion that education and training are of fundamental importance to Australia's social and economic well-being;
	(c)	notes that many of the emerging issues in employment, education and training are cross-sectoral in nature;
	(d)	expresses great concern that the body charged with providing independent, cross-sectoral advice to government on these significant issues has been dismantled by the Government;
	(e)	calls on the Government to establish immediately an independent review of the impact of its changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, one of the roles previously undertaken by the Higher Education Council; and
	(f)	notes the commitment of the Australian Labor Party, when returned to government, to re-establish a structure to provide independent, cross-sectoral advice on education and training”.",SENATE,"<title>EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,1,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-03-06,"—It is not unusual and it is expected that from time to time governments would review their policy and rationalise their advisory structures but what is unfortunate about this Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill 1999 is that it not only seeks to relook at advisory structures of the government's in the area of employment, education and training; it also abolishes them. The bill puts forward no proposals to replace those structures. Given the current debate about the interaction with employment, education and training that has been going on for some time and that will continue to exist, this is a most unfortunate position being taken by the government.
I will go to the history of some of this. Since this decision was made back in 1996 as a result of their election promise, almost four years later we are dealing with the bill but the unfortunate thing about it is that NBEET has, for some time, ceased to exist by direction of the minister. In 1987, the then minister, John Dawkins, undertook a rationalisation of advisory programs at the time and in fact sought to establish NBEET. The Bills Digest provided by the Parliamentary Library makes a very interesting point about this. It talks about the new system being the unified national system that was created under John Dawkins, integrating TAFE institutions and higher education institutions. The digest continues:
The new system was open to the charge that it could be subject to political manipulation and lack of accountability. Unlike Commonwealth funding for schools, which is governed by known formulae and public processes, grants for higher education institutions were to be determined largely in confidential negotiations without the benefit of fixed arithmetic criteria. To safeguard against possible abuse of this process the Senate amended the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988 to require the Higher Education Council to report annually on the operation of the education profiles process after consulting with institutions.
In fact, the Higher Education Council was one of the councils established under NBEET. NBEET was seen as an important component of the program in the whole training and education reform agenda. In fact, Minister Dawkins said, when establishing NBEET, that the central purpose of the bill at that time was to enhance and streamline the advisory structures in employment, education and training in a manner consistent with the high economic and social priority placed on these activities by the government.
Given this government's current attitude and the way in which policy for this sector is devised—in the middle of the night, with secret cabinet documents that, thankfully for the rest of the nation, get leaked to the media, with a minister who is admitting that we have a number of higher education institutions that are in disrepair and under threat—and given that we have an employment, education and training sector that is grappling with the demands of industry versus the needs of clients versus outcomes provided by educators, it is no surprise that we have a minister who does not really want to know what is happening in this industry—other than to gain advice, he would say, through MCEETYA, which is the advisory council of employment and education ministers. 
So NBEET has been a target for termination and does not exist any more. Why is that? Is that because the minister did not believe it had a role to play or because he knew that, given his current policies, it would be reporting on outcomes that he did not want to hear? And there is a big difference there about why you have advisory programs. This is a government that only sets up advisory committees if those committees are going to provide the kind of advice that it wants to hear—rather than critical advice it needs to take on board to change its policies. NBEET originally comprised a board to report directly to the minister, and there were four advisory councils: the Australian Research Council, the Employment and Skills Formation Council, the Higher Education Council and the Schools Council.
The specific value of NBEET lay in its ability to examine issues on a cross-sectoral basis which, at that time in 1987, was forging a new path. We now know in the education sector that those cross-sectoral divisions and those lines between when school education stops and post-compulsory education starts are becoming even more blurred—when traditional barriers separating schools, higher education and vocational education are in fact being pulled down and re-established. At this crucial time when schools such as Casuarina Secondary School in Darwin in my own state of the Northern Territory and Centralian College in Alice Springs are trying desperately to provide high school students with valuable education that encompasses VET and training courses and not just higher education or high school education courses, why is it that we have a minister of education who is not prepared to listen to independent experts in the field about what is happening in his portfolio? The ongoing directions and the development of the cross-sectoral perspectives that are being canvassed at this point in time in the industry mean that this body and its operations should have been gathering importance rather than irrelevance. NBEET was a body that I think had the opportunity to grow, to undertake research and to provide independent advice that would have been crucial to this minister, given the development of the training industry, but in fact it has been terminated and has become irrelevant.
NBEET has the opportunity to look at issues such as: the convergence of general and vocational education, the nature and importance of employment and the relationship with key competencies, credit transfers, recognition of prior learning, how people could be enabled to follow pathways through different education and training institutions, and the emergence of the often discussed concept of lifelong learning. All these examples I have outlined serve to reinforce the importance to the government of developing and receiving cross-sectoral advice—advice that this government has now terminated and no longer wishes to receive from an independent body. The changes in methods and technology for delivering education and training also contribute to the cross-sectoral debate and should mould the training reform agenda into something meaningful, but it will not be moulded into something this minister seeks to understand or hear about from those independent experts.

"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-03-06,"—On 17 February Senator Hogg asked me a question as Minister representing the Minister for Defence. I have brought additional information for Senator Hogg. I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
SENATOR HOGG asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence on 17 February 2000:
Is it correct that this is the first time in at least a generation that a Commonwealth government has raided the “white book” of capital projects the government itself had already approved to meet shortfalls in recurrent expenditure?
SENATOR NEWMAN - The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1) The transfer of funds between the capital budget and operating expenses is fully consistent with Defence's global budgeting flexibilities. Such transfers have been a regular feature in previous budgets.
(2) This specific transfer was designed to accommodate a number of cost
pressures:
(a) To maintain the Defence Force of 50,000 people.
(b) To meet real increases in personnel costs, reflecting this Government's commitment to maintaining competitive remuneration rates for Defence personnel.
(c) To meet additional costs arising from an increased operational tempo.
(d) To meet increased information technology and communication costs, including Y2K costs.
(3) No major capital project has been cancelled as a result of the transfer although a slow down in some deliveries is expected.
(4) The transfer reflects the Government's policy of having a strong and effective ADF now, as amply demonstrated by our highly successful deployment to East Timor, as well as investing in future capability.
(5) Without the efficiency benefits flowing from the Defence Reform Program, cost pressures would have been far greater and there would have been a much more significant impact on the capital budget than the transfer that occurred in the Additional Estimates.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence: Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-03-06,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care (Senator Herron), to questions without notice asked by Senator Allison and Senator Chris Evans today, relating to aged care. 
Particularly in relation to the question I just asked of Senator Herron, it is important to note that he was unable to answer the question about whether or not the Minister for Aged Care, Mrs Bishop, had misled when she said that she had not seen the report from Elite Care, which was tabled in Senate estimates on 1 December last year. It is a very important question because the minister claimed some months after the report was tabled, some months after it was sent to her office, that in fact she had not seen the report, that she would be most concerned about the complaints raised in it, but that she had not had the opportunity to see the report and would be interested in following up the complaints.
We know, and it is a matter of public record, that, one, the report was posted to her—and she has admitted that it was received in the department—and, two, it was tabled by me in Senate estimates, the department responded to me and they said would have a look at the matters raised. When tabling it, I specifically referred to it being made available to Minister Bishop. The minister at the table was Senator Herron. He was there. I would have thought he would have taken some responsibility to ensure that these very serious concerns, which the minister now concedes are very serious concerns, ought to be brought to her attention.
It was not clear from his answer today whether or not they had. Clearly, if they had—and it seems to me they should have been, and the department and the minister should have made sure they were—the minister must have been misleading Kerry O'Brien and the Australian public when she said two weeks ago that she had never heard about these concerns—that they had never been raised with her. They cannot have it both ways. Either the government and the department take seriously concerns raised with them and direct them to the minister because they are serious issues or the minister has misled the Australian people. They cannot have it both ways.
The minister has maintained that she knew nothing about it, that she would have acted, that she would have been concerned, that she would have taken decisive action, but that the concerns had not been raised with her. I do not know what you have to do to lodge a complaint to which this government listen. Posting it to them does not work, ringing them does not work, ringing the complaints line does not work and tabling it in the Senate does not work. It does not matter what you do to raise complaints about nursing homes in this country, the minister does not hear them. It does not matter what process you undertake. She says, `Ring the complaints line.' The nurses at Riverside rang the complaints line in the middle of January and nothing happened for a month. Their serious concerns about bathing residents in kerosene were ignored. That is the complaints system in action.
Complaints were raised about maladministration of medication in hostels and a dossier was sent to the minister and the department—no action. It was raised in the parliament in December—no action. In February, the minister still claimed she did not know anything about it. What sort of complaints mechanism is the government running? Is there a rule that everything must stop before it reaches the minister's ears or desk? Has she adopted the rule that she does not want to see anything—that she wants to be the blind monkey and not have anything brought to her attention? She cannot have it both ways. She cannot encourage people to complain and then fail to respond to the complaints. It is all right having a phone number that you advertise at every opportunity, but, if no-one then does anything about those complaints, what is the point? What is the point of having Senate estimates committees or of tabling documents in the Australian parliament if the government are not going to do anything about them, if they are not prepared to take them seriously?
We have a minister completely failing aged care in this country. We have a minister who has not had one spot check in two years, despite defending vigorously in the parliament last year the need for spot checks. She defends the need for them, but she does not authorise any. She will not allow adequate regulation of the aged care sector, she will not investigate complaints, she will not respond to complaints that have been made to her and she will not take decisive action. There is no point in having Minister Bishop as the minister because she will not do anything about problems in her portfolio. She does not care, she is not interested and the rule seems to be, `You can complain all you like, but don't bring it to my attention because that will highlight the fact that I have done nothing about it.' 
Minister Herron should provide an explanation to the parliament and to this Senate about what his role in this matter is. Either he failed to take the issues seriously and report them to Minister Bishop, or she has ignored the report. But he has to explain what his role is in this, or he will go the same way she is about to go. It is just not good enough that serious concerns about the health care and the residential care provided to older Australians are totally ignored by this government. Serious risks are exposed, brought to their attention and they are not interested in action.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2000-03-06,"—I stand here again today after listening to the Labor Party go on and on about nursing home care, and I am amazed at the level of amnesia on the other side. I wonder if Senator Evans has forgotten just how bad aged care was under Labor. Have you forgotten how hopelessly the ALP managed the aged care portfolio? It is clear that his leader, Mr Beazley, has conveniently forgotten just how bad things were under their system, and in fact the Leader of the Opposition went over the top this morning—and some of the members on the other side should distance themselves from the disgraceful comments and scaremongering that he engaged in today.
When we came into office, 75 per cent of homes did not meet building standards. Senator Evans does not want to hear this. He is chatting away. Thirteen per cent did not meet fire safety standards and 11 per cent did not meet basic health standards. Why? Because Labor had cut capital funding to nursing homes by 75 per cent in their last four years in government, and they would not allow the introduction of entry fees and bonds, as they had done in hostels. When we put up a proposition to actually introduce the same sort of policy that existed in hostels, where we saw an upgrading of capital under Labor—and, as I have said, I give credit where credit is due—they were not prepared to bite the bullet and do it with nursing homes.
—He is leaving.
—Senator Evans is now leaving because he likes to throw a bomb and then leave. They did not want to engage in assisting in upgrading nursing homes. It is to their eternal discredit that they ran around frightening older people, and that is what they are doing again now.
We should look at the record of Labor in government. We would all agree around here that it is disgraceful that any older person should suffer in a nursing home as a result of poor care, but you would think it never happened under Labor. In 1995 a monitoring team inspected a nursing home—and I will not name it now because some of these places have actually lifted their game—and found a high incidence, 13 cases in one visit, of skin tears and pressure areas amongst the residents, and when questioned about these the staff blamed the old equipment used to transport residents, staff cutbacks and shortages of clean linen. `Although skin conditions are identified, treatment plans are unclear and there is no evidence of evaluation of treatment or review,' the team's report went on to say. At least four residents were seen as having long, dirty fingernails. The report said that residents were not assured of protection from infection or infestation because the team heard that a bedpan sanitiser did not clean properly. I could go on. There was report after report like this about nursing homes when Labor was in government. 
Professor Gregory, in a report commissioned by the Labor Party themselves, blamed the poor conditions in nursing homes on the funding system that provided homes a set amount based on resident frailty, regardless of the condition or age of the building. I have said before: they failed in 13 years to work out a plan to upgrade the facilities and they had none when they left. As Professor Gregory said, `Consequently, the quality of nursing home building stock might be expected to deteriorate'—this was under Labor—and he gave that report to the then minister, Dr Lawrence.  
In that report Professor Gregory also painted a particularly poor picture of nursing homes. As I have said, a survey in the report revealed 13 per cent of homes had problems meeting fire regulations, 11 per cent did not meet health regulations and 75 per cent failed to meet Australian design standards. So to come in here and go on like they have, rather than looking at their record, is just a nonsense. 
A caring nation should not tolerate nursing home standards which do not meet even basic fire standards, but Labor did for 13 years. Even when Dr Lawrence, the then health minister, got the report on what was happening, she did nothing. She sat on the report for months and months doing nothing. Bob Gregory indicated that $540 million was needed just to upgrade nursing homes, but Labor put a pitiful $10 million in, a lot less than what was needed.
The ALP also has a bad memory of how badly it treated nursing homes in its recurrent funding arrangements. The arrangements were so complex and arcane, and we will not know how many organisations were not able to provide services because provider funding was locked in at rates established in 1987. I could go on and on about how Labor failed to fund rural and regional nursing homes. There was a comment the other day about the residents of Riverside being relocated and how far they would have to travel.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-03-06,"—You can tell that the government is extremely worried about this issue. First of all, we had the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care on two occasions in the Senate today asked this question point blank: `Did you refer the report that was tabled and presented to you during the estimates hearing to the minister last December?' On two occasions he failed to answer. He has since left the chamber. The Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care is not prepared to stand in here and defend this government's record on aged care. Why not? Because he knows, the Minister for Aged Care knows and Senator Patterson knows that their record in the six years that they have been in government is pathetic. 
—Six years? 
—Four years rather, I am sorry. It seems like six years. In response to a most serious issue that has been exposed regarding maladministration and atrocious care of elderly people in a nursing home in Victoria and in other locations, what did Senator Patterson talk about? She went back to supposed situations in the previous Labor government.
—Not supposed.
—Senator Patterson, the ball is in your court now. When this government came to office, one of the first things it tried to do it claimed was to reform the aged care system. It introduced a bill in 1997 to introduce nursing home accommodation bonds. It put the entire aged care industry and the relatives and residents of many, many nursing homes in this country into a state of utter confusion and extreme concern. The government wanted to force people to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars and give up their homes to get into nursing homes. That policy failed. The government moved to another policy and, since then, every single one of its initiatives has been a failure. 
Minister Bishop has continued with the rhetoric that somehow they have created a new world for aged care accommodation in this country. She has on numerous occasions put out press releases saying that they were going to clean up the industry, that they were going to protect nursing home residents. Yet Aged Care Australia, in a press release put out on 26 July last year, said: 
The Government's failure to protect residents in sub-standard aged care facilities can and must be remedied immediately, according to Aged Care Australia (ACA), the leading peak body representing the not-for-profit providers of aged and community care services across Australia.
Minister Bishop has been strong on rhetoric and has absolutely gone missing in action when it comes to putting her words into action. She is on record as not even having known about some of the problems that were exposed in reports last year—as far back as July last year—about failures in the system and also failures in the reporting. Now what do we find? We find that this minister has today put out a press release detailing a huge list of problems that have been identified in the agency's report.  
Yet this same minister spent the latter part of last year denying that there were problems. The opposition, through Senator Evans, was raising these issues time and time again in estimates and in this chamber, and Senator Herron here and Minister Bishop in the other place continued to deny them. You cannot continue to deny them. The problems are there and they have been pointed out. It has been the opposition's job to do it and we will continue to do it. It is no answer to the issue of providing decent quality care, proper training, proper professional supervision in nursing homes and proper accreditation for the people who most need it in the community—the elderly—to go back into history and try to lecture others about what may or may not have been the case in the past. That is an abrogation of responsibility and it is also proof that this government has failed and failed miserably.

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-03-06,"—Isn't the sensitivity of the Labor Party in terms of their own record interesting? I would not actually mind if the Labor Party came in here with clean hands and a good record in aged care. They do not. But, most importantly, they do not want to know what has happened. Senator Forshaw just issued a challenge to `Talk about the present.' I will talk about the present, as Senator Forshaw requests, but I will also contrast it with the past 13 years of Labor. No-one can say that is not fair. I can tell Senator Forshaw that one of the tragic things that happened under Labor is how much money they withdrew from aged care. The Labor Party ran down residential care and withdrew $1.5 billion, leaving the coalition government 10,000 residential places short of their own benchmark. 
The Australian National Audit Office report tabled in parliament on 8 December 1998 exposed a large drop in the level of residential aged care service provision over the last 10 years of the Labor government. In 1986 the Labor government promised there would be 100 aged care places for every 1,000 people over 70 years. The number then was 98.3 places. Ten years later in 1996 when this government had to take over the legacy of the Labor government, the service ratio had dropped to 93.4. This was a shortfall of 10,000 places and meant a cut of around $1.5 billion over the 10-year period Labor denied the care to thousands of individuals.
Senator Forshaw wanted to know the contrast; I will give him the contrast. Since the coalition government has been in office, it has allocated around 17,000 places to meet the care needs of older Australians. Of these, around 6,100 have been residential care places and around 10,900 have been community care places. In the allocation round announced in November 1999, the coalition government announced an extra 7,000 new places. There will be 2,500 more residential aged care places and an extra 400 places for those services restructuring to meet the needs of the community. But, importantly, we are also significantly increasing the number of community care packages by making 4,300 new packages available. This is the contrast with what we had to pick up. 
My colleague Senator Patterson has already talked about the other legacy that we had to rectify—the fact that 75 per cent of nursing homes did not meet building standards, 11 per cent of them did not meet fire standards and 13 per cent did not meet basic health standards. Surely, this opposition should be ashamed of that but they come in here and poke fun and point the finger instead of making sure they work constructively to resolve this situation. Nobody but nobody can make an excuse for poor treatment of the aged, but the opposition should make sure that the priority is the treatment of the aged and not the vilification of individuals and governments who are trying to rectify the problems left to them by 13 years of mismanagement. 
I give the Senate another example. Labor cut capital funding to nursing homes by 75 per cent in its last four years of government. There was no access to other forms of funding. They commissioned the Gregory report, as Senator Patterson said, and yet they allowed it to gather dust—and that was a report into capital funding. They ignored the report because they were not willing or able to make long-term decisions for the longer term benefit of older Australians. Senator Forshaw wanted the contrast. The capital income stream from the coalition is over $1.4 billion over the first 10 years of the aged care reform. A small number of facilities, particularly those in rural and remote areas and those that service other special needs groups, may need capital assistance in addition to that available through the capital income stream. In the 1999-2000 budget it was provided an extra $23 million in addition to the $10 million indexed per year already available.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Nursing Homes and Hostels: Administration of Medication</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2000-03-06,"—I too wish to speak to the motion to take note of the answers given by Senator Herron to Senator Evans. I was in estimates when those documents were tabled, and I can assure you that the responses given today were most unsatisfactory. We have all heard of the disgraceful events that occurred in the Riverside Nursing Home in Victoria where fuel was recently used as a medical wash. Apart from the obvious negligence of this act, one is entitled to ask what the working culture was in the institution in which this occurred. On 13 May 1998 the Department of Health and Aged Care had a report on the Riverside Nursing Home that found it failed to meet 26 of the 29 care standards. Again, on 19 July 1999, the standards and accreditation agency report on the same nursing home found that it failed in all three areas of standards of care. Did the minister act on any of those findings? No. It was not until the media started to write up that kerosene was used to treat conditions that it was drawn to the public's attention.
This has to be neglect and/or incompetence. It was not until today that action was taken to rectify anything in that nursing home, and the nursing home I believe has been closed. Apart from the obvious negligence of this act, one is entitled to question what was the working culture of the institution where this occurred. Relatives are naturally now asking whether there any other nursing homes where these practices occurred. Naturally, relatives are concerned about their elderly. There are people who have no relatives, so there is no-one to care for them or watch over what happens in their nursing homes, and that should not be the case. Is this just negligence on the part of one carer or one worker, or is it a symptom of something deeper? This is what the relatives of people want to know. Is this a symptom of something deeper than just negligence?
In a previous speech I mentioned that last year, 1999, was the International Year of Older Persons. I alluded to the fact that if this was the year of the older person heaven help them when it was over. Not even I had foreseen the end of that year and what it would mean to older persons. Not even I realised that there were people being bathed in kerosene. There was an article in the Canberra Times last weekend by Penelope Layland, `Growing old in the body but never in the mind', in which she says:
A fat lot of good the Year of the Older Person did us. We must now assume that during that entire year, even as the television advertising exhorted us to recognise the value of our “seniors”, frail, elderly Australians in various states of dependence were being dipped in kerosene baths, dressed in babies' nappies, given the wrong medication and having inappropriate meals rammed down their throats.
That is probably emotive reporting but it is this sort of thing that people with elderlies in homes are going to be terribly concerned about. Tasmanian nursing homes are soon to be hit by the rationalisation bandit. This will see the industry lose up to $6.8 million a year. This will happen despite the Productivity Commission's finding that suggests the policy is deficient and inequitable. I quote from the Tasmanian press at the weekend, where Mark Stemm, President of Aged Care Tasmania, says:
Unfortunately, negative reports about a few problem facilities also seem to reflect on the majority of high standard nursing homes and hostels.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-03-06,"—I want to pick up from where I was contributing prior to question time. That was a discussion about a Senate inquiry that occurred into this bill when it was first introduced in 1996. That was this government's first attempt to abolish NBEET. We now know, of course, that that bill never completed its passage through the parliament. But that Senate inquiry did take up the issue of the need for cross-sectorial perspectives in the education industry and the need for a body to be continued—as opposed to being abolished—that had the capacity to look across the sector, from schools to TAFE, NBEET and higher education, and make a comment about what was happening in the industry. In fact, in a submission to that inquiry, as my colleague Senator Carr has said, Professor Ian Chubb, the then Vice-Chancellor of Flinders University and also former Deputy Chair of NBEET, said:
If some relationship between employment, education and training is assumed, then I believe a minister will need some body or other to integrate the often conflicting advice that will come from the various interest groups and turn it into policy advice.
He also went on to say:
I have seen no good reason put forward for the abolition of NBEET. 
Might I reiterate on that comment that, even to this point in time, neither has the opposition seen any good reason for NBEET to be abolished. 
In the remaining time, I particularly want to concentrate my comments today on what was the role of the Higher Education Council. The 1996 legislation retained the Higher Education Council and it had the role to provide considered advice to the government through the board on directions, priorities and funding issues relating to higher education. The Higher Education Council also had the important responsibility of monitoring the impact of HECS—the Higher Education Contribution Scheme—on participation in university education. It had done this through a series of reports tabled in parliament. In its sixth report, published in March 1992, the NBEET board said:
The Board noted the results of the Council's commissioned research on the impact of HECS on the participation of disadvantaged groups in higher education.
It concluded from that research that HECS, as it was in 1991, had little effect on the decision of the educationally disadvantaged groups identified in the research to participate in higher education. So nine years ago the research, which NBEET had noted and which was carried out by the Higher Education Council, indicated that HECS, as previously introduced under the former Labor government, had little effect on the decision of the educationally disadvantaged to participate in higher education. The disadvantaged groups examined in the council's research included students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, rural students, students from non-English speaking backgrounds, indigenous students and single parents. 
It is interesting to compare the advice provided in March 1992 with the 12th and most recent report from the Higher Education Council which looked at outcomes for 1996 and 1997. It will not come as any surprise that the Higher Education Council said at that time, `Clearly, issues such as these are beyond the scope of the report on 1997 activity, but will be covered in future years.' In other words, they could not provide an analysis or a comment on changes to HECS in 1997 because it was beyond the scope of the report but it could be covered in future years. Why was that? Because the changes to the HECS regime had been introduced only in 1996 and the Higher Education Council admitted in this report that it was not possible to assess those changes by 1997. But they had suggested, as was right at the time, that it would be covered in future years. Now, of course, they will not have an opportunity to do that, with NBEET being abolished and the Higher Education Council being disbanded. If this bill is passed, these issues will not be examined—an outcome many believe the coalition government will be quite thankful for, because the last thing it will want is to have the microscope of the Higher Education Council's research and comments brought down on the impact of HECS in this country in this day and age. There would also be no opportunity to examine the radically reduced repayment threshold or to assess the impact that it has had on participation in higher education. 
As I mentioned before question time, this government does not want to know the bad news that its advisory bodies may give it. For example, looking at the current performance in higher education Australia wide, applications for enrolment have fallen by 3.3 per cent in 1997 and have fallen a further two per cent in 1998. Although they recovered slightly in 1999, they are still 4.8 per cent below the level of 1996. So why would the government want its performance in higher education examined? That is the overall picture. There is no information about specific groups such as those included in the Higher Education Council's surveys. It is no wonder that the Howard government wants to silence the Higher Education Council before it has a chance to deliver the bad news since 1996 with the changes afforded to HECS. The information we need to know, which will no longer be provided to this parliament because this council has been abandoned, includes: how much damage has been done by this government's cuts in funding to higher education; what is the impact of the increased charges for university students; and what is the impact of the decision to lower the repayment thresholds for people who build up a HECS debt. The reason that this government wants to stop the Higher Education Council is so that it cannot report in the form of detailed information about the extent of the damage done to access and equity in higher education in Australia. 
The council's commissioned report entitled The effects of the introduction of fee-paying postgraduate courses on access for designated groups, which was published in 1997, concluded that fees do have a deterrent effect on postgraduate enrolment by some equity groups, pushing them towards HECS based enrolment. Under the Labor government, fee paying postgraduate places were balanced by broad availability of HECS places as well. This has changed completely under the coalition, with a fall of around 40 per cent in Commonwealth funded postgraduate coursework places as a direct result of the coalition's $840 million cut to the universities' operating grants. The 1997 Higher Education Council report also raised the issue of cuts to university operating grants noting that, to the extent that universities have fewer resources, they have less capacity to undertake measures to improve equity and access. Since that report, universities have felt the impact of the major funding cuts announced by the Howard government in 1996.
The retention of a body like the Higher Education Council is crucial in this day and age because we have regional universities that are suffering greatly from the cuts to their operating grants. The Northern Territory University is now attempting its fourth or fifth round of staff cuts because it is not meeting its higher education targets in terms of HECS students. We have the then Minister for Education, Peter Adamson, going cap in hand to Minister Kemp. I assume that Chris Lugg, who has recently taken over that role, will do the same, almost pleading and begging that special consideration for additional funds be given to the Northern Territory University so that it can survive. The Higher Education Council could have played a role in assessing the relationship that the Northern Territory University has in its current funding crisis together with the impact that the government's policies and cuts to operating grants would have on regional universities around the country. Now we have MCEETYA or ministers going one by one to the government trying to provide them with some advice or at least an overall picture of what is happening, as opposed to an independent advisory body such as the HEC. 
In conclusion, let me just say that I think there is a very important role here for the federal parliament in considering this bill. If ever there were a greater need for advice from a body like NBEET, I think it is now because reducing access to vocational and higher education needs to be monitored and needs to be reported upon. Through this bill, the Howard government has shown not only that it does not understand the concept of linkages but also that it does not want to understand, it does not want to listen and it does not want to know what is happening out there from an independent source.
As far as NBEET is concerned, all the damage is done; it has been wound up and it no longer exists. The corporate knowledge of NBEET has been scattered about the country, its personnel have dispersed and the board exists practically in name only. When the Higher Education Council has been abolished, as it will be, there will be no statutory authority qualified to perform these functions. So, if parliament wishes to continue to receive annual reports on the education profile process, including the views of institutions, and the Higher Education Contribution Scheme—and, in fact, the impact that particular policy has on the higher education sector—we must defeat this bill.
It is important and a requirement, I believe, that the parliament should report on the proposed institutional allocations for the coming years, for each and every year, and provide information enabling an assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of Commonwealth expenditure on higher education. But that is not going to occur. It is not going to occur because this government, as it has done with many other advisory bodies, has made an assessment that the advice it is going to hear is not advice that it wants to hear. So its answer is to just completely abolish the advisory body and the advice it may possibly get.",SENATE,"<title>EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-03-06,"—I commend the remarks of the previous speaker during the second reading debate, the content of which I completely agree with—that is, the theory that this government needs cross-sectoral advice on education, employment and training issues more so than ever before but is probably more reluctant—and understandably so—than ever before to subject its policies and its funding mechanisms of those sectors to any kind of investigation or analysis simply because of the deleterious impact that this government's policies have had on those very sectors.
The Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill 1999 comes before us as a result of the government's 1996 policy announcement that the coalition would abolish the NBEET and establish independent councils to advise on higher education and research. As we heard earlier today, not only was this a 1996 pledge but I believe this legislation was first introduced back in June of that year. Certainly it has been not weeks or months but years since this legislation was first drafted and considered, yet it has not made its way to this second reading debate until now. That, in itself, I think is a complete indictment of this government's policies in relation to accountability, the transparency process and, quite clearly, democracy.
This bill also comes as a precursor to a bill implementing the recent research white paper's foreshadowed restructuring of Australia's research sector and the proposals for change to be made to the Australian Research Council, which I hope will be tabled in the near future. Other than the ARC, the councils and NBEET are no longer in operation. So, although we debate this bill today, there is almost no point in trying to alter this bill or to impede its passage because these measures have already been implemented by a government which clearly has an open and obvious disdain for democracy. 
Of course, having said all of that, the Australian Democrats do not support the intent of this bill. We did support the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988, which established the National Board of Employment, Education and Training to provide the relevant minister with advice on matters relating to employment, education and training. The act established councils and provided for committees and councillors to be appointed to assist the board and the minister. Under the act, the Australian Language and Literacy Council, the Australian Research Council, the Employment and Skills Council, the Higher Education Council and the Schools Council reported to the minister through the board. This allowed both a cross-sectoral approach and for the information and advice provided to governments to be accountable, representative and for the process to be transparent—that is, people in the community could look at the reports in much the same way as any member of this chamber or the other place could.
So not only does the bill before us today seek to remove the ability of stakeholders within the sector to have a voice or for ideas and advice provided to the minister regarding the education and training sector to be scrutinised, but the bill also comes before this chamber not months but years after the implementation of the measures we are debating. As you have heard in this debate, NBEET has effectively been disbanded by this government without the debate that should have taken place in this place—certainly without the consent of the Australian parliament. The intent of this bill has effectively already been implemented by cutting the funding and by letting appointments to the various councils of NBEET lapse. Consequently, we are now left today with a farcical situation in debating this piece of legislation: we are effectively being given by this government a Hobson's choice.
Certainly the Democrats do not support the abolition of a body that provides essential cross-sectoral advice to the government and other bodies on education, employment and training matters. This government has chosen that particular course of action at a time when the need for cross-sectoral advice and a cross-sectoral body is probably more necessary than ever before. The bill comes at a time when cross-sectoral activity is both expanding and becoming more diverse. The boundaries between the education and research sectors, as we all know, are becoming increasingly blurred. With the VET sector now able to award postgraduate degrees and the very definition of what constitutes a university being a major point of confusion, particularly in light of the Greenwich University fiasco and greater collaboration taking place between universities and TAFE, we need that advice; increasingly we need advice that has a cross-sectoral approach. Indeed, this very fact was highlighted by one of the last HEC commissioned documents. Notably, the report was only ever published online, I believe, after a decision not to publish in hard copy—such is the respect given to independent analysis and advice on these matters by this government.
I recently attended the government's Innovation Summit, and I note and support the Innovation Summit's call for a doubling of expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP over the next 10 years. I note too that there were many people who felt excluded from some of the debates in that summit. I do commend the minister for industry on what I thought was a very productive debate over those couple of days. I just wish it had been a broader forum for debate because, of course, 60 per cent of all researchers in Australian universities these days are postgraduate students and a lot of those people were not represented, certainly not in a volume sense, at that event.
I also note some of the very positive recommendations that came out of the summit in relation to the funding of education and training and research and development in Australia and recommendations that business and industry heads, as well as representatives that were there from, say, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and in once case the National Tertiary Education Union, agreed on. So that was quite a positive outcome. I think it probably reflects the broad community support for increased recognition of and support for, in funding terms, education and training in today's society.  
It has been joked that there are `lies, damned lies and then there are government education statistics'—a joke increasingly doing the rounds. The Innovation Summit in some ways highlighted the way in which, largely as a result of the abolition of bodies such as NBEET, statistics regarding funding for education and research are becoming themselves a major point of contention. A media release issued from the summit and authored by several authoritative bodies—including the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the National Tertiary Education Union and the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies—decried the fact that Australia's investment in higher education had dropped by 13 per cent over the past four years. I note that the minister, Senator Minchin, was quick to criticise this figure, claiming it was misleading. And, after a reissuing of this media release, it was made clearer that this drop of 13 per cent was as a percentage of GDP. 
Hypocritically, successive ministers under the Howard government have been consistently selective with the statistics they chose when it came to higher education and research funding. The statistics that this government has chosen or has used to claim the higher education and research sectors are healthy have been consistently misleading—and not just under the current minister. Ministers Vanstone and Kemp have consistently trumpeted the headline statistics that we now have more students in our universities than ever before and that this trend is somehow an achievement of this government. What they have been most reluctant to highlight is the fact that we have more students in the system, yet the government has systematically withdrawn public funding from those very institutions. 
Recent figures indicate that the mix of public and private funding for our public universities is now the same as that for Australia's private schools with around 44 per cent of university revenues coming from non-government sources. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee stated: 
If we discount the Princetons, the Harvards and the Yales of the US system, the Americans actually have a public university system which is more heavily subsidised by Government than our own, with a significantly lower average cost to students.
So much for those people who say, `Let's not head in the US style direction. Let's not emulate their privatised university structure,' even though it is something I suspect the minister for education would like to do. Forget that. We have already gone down that path. We have outdone the Americans at their own game. When it comes to a comparison of public funding for universities—and certainly when it comes to fees and charges for public universities—in America versus public institutions in Australia, we are certainly in a much more deleterious situation. Australian students are paying more for their education than ever before while this government is paying significantly less.
The Howard government HECS slug has more than doubled in three years. According to the Australian Taxation Office, in 1996-97 Australians paid $251 million in HECS repayments. As a result of this government's reduction of the HECS repayment threshold to significantly less than average weekly earnings, the HECS slug has been shouldered by the just over one million Australians who contributed over $6 billion in HECS to government revenue last year. So we have seen a reduction in the rate at which graduates begin to repay their debt as well.
Ministerial proclamations of increased student numbers also hide the fact that in 1999 the number of full fee paying domestic postgraduate students increased by 15 per cent or that on the first census date in March last year the enrolments in excess of fully funded undergraduate HECS places numbered 37,459. Because of the Howard government's policy to not fund these so-called `over-enrolments' at universities, that has effectively saved the government $270 million in the last academic year alone. So that cynical policy of allowing those over-enrolments is, of course, saving the government money but not compensating institutions in a way that they need to be compensated for additional enrolments. That is $270 million worth of shirked government responsibility.  
Some may remember in this place and in the community the claim by the former minister for higher education, Senator Vanstone, that university funding had increased. That was given great fanfare by the minister in her National Press Club address, so much so that the minister actually personally printed—or her department, I suspect, printed—a table showing the increased funds onto mouse pads for journalists at the luncheon. The government was so proud of its particular record in that respect. Most of the additional funding that is going into our university education institutions has come from students, not from government. 
Coalition ministers have been quick to highlight overall enrolment numbers but slow to acknowledge the prohibitive increases—and they are prohibitive increases—to HECS in the 1996 budget which saw significant declines in the rate of applications to study. Applications nationwide fell by 3.3 per cent in 1997 and again by 2.8 per cent in 1998, and it is a trend that is only now reversing. Certainly in the previous speech we heard references to these statistics as well. This is a cause for grave concern and, were the operations of NBEET still intact, I trust that we would have seen greater concern regarding the drop in applications. 
Presumably such a significant decrease is a direct result of the increased financial burden of higher education, an increase so great that we suspect many Australians simply decided they were not able to take this particular burden on despite their academic qualifications. Before the minister or others are quick to jump up and say, `But we don't know that for sure,' that is precisely the point: we do not know. We will never know for sure perhaps why this trend has occurred because this government has not allowed for open analysis and debate of those particular policies through mechanisms such as HEC or NBEET. 
Fundamental to the ethos of education and research is the search for truth, although under this government it is more the search for funds, and the tenet of academic freedom is one that some of us hold dear. It is curious that this government was elected in 1996 with its promises to allow for greater freedoms of speech in a variety of forums. We have not seen this government nurture free speech; in fact, we have seen this government systematically silence its critics. I have no doubt that this bill and the abolition of NBEET are simply part of that silencing. We have seen NBEET lose funds and staff. We have seen the defunding of the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, a body which was equipped to research and advocate on behalf of young people in Australia. We have seen a vengeful and petty piece of voluntary student unionism legislation designed to stop students from controlling their own affairs. We have seen the Women's Electoral Lobby and others, such as pensioner groups, lose their funding after criticism of this government. We have seen the government resort to bludgeoning the education, training and research sectors into submission through actual and threatened budget cuts.
Former Minister Vanstone was at one stage very keen to take advice in brown paper envelopes from disgruntled staff through a program of `dobbing in a don', as it was nicknamed. Yet this government refuses to take advice from those who were at the coalface of its budget cuts. While the current minister has promised a two per cent wage supplement only if the universities adopt the government's regressive industrial relations practices, it is reminiscent of the threats which enabled the passage of the 1996 operating grant funding cuts and increased HECS charges by threat of deeper cuts if the Senate block their passage. So, effectively, those reforms, so-called, went through because otherwise the government was threatening to hold up funding of operating grants to university institutions.
The advice that this government seeks is not open to the processes of this parliament or to the sectors involved. It is the stuff of leaked cabinet documents advising that HECS, for example, should be charged at real rates of interest on what seemed to be ideologically driven arguments. Again, before the minister or anyone else suggests that this was not adopted, that this was just a policy idea, those policy ideas are not being debated or discussed in an open and transparent manner. Certainly there is no inclusion or consultation with those within the sector who would possibly disagree with the government's economic rationalist views. Rather than giving us freedom of speech, this government has silenced its critics and it has systematically silenced bodies providing research and advice which contradicts the very narrow philosophy of this government. 
Last year, we saw this reach extreme lengths when the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee—the peak representative body of vice-chancellors in Australia—had to resort to using freedom of information, FOI, laws to access advice and research in the area of higher education and research. The peak body of vice-chancellors—as we have said before in this place, they are not necessarily the most radical lot—is very concerned about the state of quality of education today and has to use FOI to get the information that is so important to the daily running of institutions. Institutions which, I might add, require a degree of certainty for future funding choices, staffing decisions and, of course, curriculum decisions. The government's approach to the issues facing us as we attempt to become a so-called `knowledge nation' has not been constructive nor useful in addressing the challenges we face as nation.
While the Democrats welcome the Labor Party's statement in their recent policy pronouncement that they will support research and advice which looks at the broader context of our education, training and employment potential—and I note the reference in the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr to what a Labor government might do—I express the Democrats concern that the work force 2010 document assumption that this can be resourced through current mechanisms and that DETYA will be able to simply absorb this role within its current budget may not be achievable. I fail to see how this can be achieved without additional funding, given the massive cuts to the Public Service we have seen under the Howard government and given the manner in which policy and monitoring activities have been starved of funds, staff and resources. I hope to see a commitment to funding independent, cross-sectoral and representative advice for the education and training sector in any future policy pronouncements of the opposition.
The recent history of higher education in this country has been marked by rapid change, massive upheaval and funding cuts, the nature of which has not been seen in this country before. We have seen an increase in fees and charges and the introduction of a three-tier HECS system. We have seen a reduction in the threshold at which graduates begin to repay their HECS debts. We have seen a failure by government to actually meet the needs for increased wages for academics and general staff in university institutions. We have seen, effectively, more than a $1.7 billion cut in operating grants which, I have no doubt, has affected the performance of institutions. Of course, it has also affected the quality of education provided by those institutions, not that, I might add, through any fault of their own but just through the sheer difficulty—some might say impossibility—of providing many services in departments and on campuses, especially those regional campuses to which Senator Crossin referred. It is incredibly difficult, almost impossible, due to the change in funding arrangements. These measures have been implemented by a government that has effectively abolished the mechanisms for monitoring their impact on equity and access to higher education, and the government refuses to listen to or acknowledge the devastation that it has created in this sector.
I lament the fact that decisions we make in this chamber today may not necessarily bring back the national board. I think for two reasons people should be very distressed by the legislation we are debating today: not just because it is basically confirming the abolition of that cross-sectoral advice in these sectors but the undemocratic way in which this has been pursued. I remember asking questions in Senate estimates of the former minister for higher education, Senator Vanstone, about what was happening with NBEET. The response seemed to be, `Well, if the Senate does not look like it will approve it, that is fine, we are cutting funding anyway.' This effectively cuts people's livelihoods and abolishes people's jobs. Basically, it is a stagnating of the work of NBEET and its councils and committees anyway.  
I think people have very good reason to be concerned about the undemocratic and unparliamentary way that we have dealt with this legislation. It is extraordinary that something that was effectively organised or drafted back in 1996 has only today reached the chamber and has reached the chamber in a way that presents senators with a Hobson's choice. I certainly look forward to supporting the second reading amendment moved by Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition and add to it the Democrats condemnation of this legislation in the way the government has handled this process.",SENATE,"<title>EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Senator ELLISON,",LP,2000-03-06,"—At the outset, I will proceed on the basis that the Democrat amendment has now been withdrawn in favour of the second reading amendment proposed by Senator Carr on behalf of the opposition. In looking at this legislation, it is necessary to place on record the history of this bill, because it is not a result of the management of the legislative program or any deficiency in the government's handling of this matter that this bill comes before the Senate today. It is true that the bill was introduced into the Senate on 26 June 1996. It was then referred to the Senate Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee for consideration and report. That it did later in 1996. There, of course, was a dissenting report from the opposition and the Australian Democrats to raise concerns about mechanisms of this proposed legislation. No further formal action was taken on the bill in the Senate at that time, and subsequently the bill lapsed when parliament was prorogued in August 1998. This bill now comes back before the Senate as a necessary requirement to reflect what has been in place for some time—that is, the abolition of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training—paving the way, if you like, for the Australian Research Council legislation which is to come before the Senate. That brings me to the first point of the second reading amendment, as proposed by Senator Carr.
The measures proposed in this bill are not superseded by the Australian Research Council bill. What we have here is necessary housekeeping, if you like, to reflect the abolition of NBEET and its other councils, and it sets the way for the Australian Research Council legislation then to be passed. The government, through its white paper `Knowledge and innovation: a policy statement on research and research training', clearly set out its proposals, and it has been no secret what the government proposed in relation to the setting up and strengthening of the new structure for the ARC. This does not mean that the government is going to abolish any means of advice or consultation in relation to education. In fact, rather than just having one point of advice through NBEET, it paves the way for the government to seek advice from a myriad of sources, and the Australian Research Council is perhaps not the least of these.
As to other parts of Senator Carr's amendment, I might say that the government agrees that education and training are of fundamental importance to Australia's social and economic wellbeing, and that is reflected by the importance that the government has placed on education and training in its policies and the success that we see in the record number of undergraduate places and also in vocational education and training. Other aspects of Senator Carr's amendment also require comment. The concern that is expressed that the dismantling of NBEET will result in a loss of cross-sectoral advice is, I believe, without foundation. The government's process of obtaining advice and the process of consultation which it is undergoing at present are more than sufficient for significant issues in the education sector to be brought to the government's attention.
The independent review that Senator Carr calls for in his amendment is not required either because we have an ongoing review, if you like, by the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs in relation to the monitoring of the impact of HECS. Information on HECS is collected and analysed by the department and published on a regular basis. In fact, a recent report by the department titled Does HECS deter? showed that there is no evidence that undergraduates are deterred from education by HECS, that there was no impact, in other words, on undergraduate places. This is an ongoing review, one which is much preferred over a one-off review or inquiry, as proposed in Senator Carr's second reading amendment. The government, of course, relies on its record in relation to education and training, which is an excellent record and one which has benefited hundreds of thousands of Australians. 
One comment by Senator Stott Despoja does need some attention—that is, the government is not funding overenrolments. This government is the first government to acknowledge the need to fund universities which enrol additional students, albeit on a marginal basis. But that is a first step. It is something which has not been done by any other previous government. This government provides funding for each student taken on by universities over and above their target level. I would just place that on record as yet another example of this government's commitment to higher education.
This bill really is of no great moment. It reflects something which has been working now for some time. It is housekeeping more than anything else, and the concerns of the opposition and the Democrats really are without foundation. I commend this bill to the Senate and indicate that the government will certainly be opposing the second reading amendment, as proposed by Senator Carr.
Amendment agreed to.
Motion (by Senator Carr) agreed to:
That, pursuant to standing order 154, this resolution be communicated by message to the House of Representatives for its concurrence.
Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-03-06,"—I rise to speak to this bill. In doing so, I carry on the theme that Senator Carr was pursuing a little while earlier. This has been an amazing period in Senate process. We were here two weeks ago for one week, and we are here on day one in March, and it has to be said that the government's legislative program is very thin. When we sat some two weeks ago we actually went through at a very fast rate legislation which in the normal course of events would, after discussion among government, opposition and minor parties, be classified as non-controversial. But the government has to pad out the program. The government has to find legislation with which to consume the Senate's time. As a consequence, legislation such as what we are discussing now—legislation which in normal consultation would have led to some agreement between government and opposition and been classified as non-controversial—appears on the agenda for debate. That in a sense is a good thing because it gives us a chance to go through some of this legislation.
What it does reflect, though, is the fact that legislation which would have been down the batting list in the parliamentary process finds itself on the agenda on day one of a parliamentary sitting. It is quite amazing. It is not just the Prime Minister who has run out of ideas, as we have seen over the weekend detailed in the national newspapers; it is the whole government that seems to be dumb struck in terms of ideas and legislation. It is the whole government that has itself sitting on the railway lines like a bunny facing the headlights of the GST coming fast down the track. As a consequence, it is not focusing on the continued reform that is necessary for the Australian parliamentary process and the Australian system. This is a government that so early in its history has run out of ideas for the Australian public. I think it is a real pity that as we embark upon the year 2000, when so much rapid change is confronting the world and so many new ideas are about the place, this government is finding itself not receptive of any of them.
I turn to this legislation. Can I say, as I implied a little while earlier, that the aims of the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 1999 are to be commended. The bill implements the 1996 protocol to the London Convention and increases penalties for contraventions of the sea dumping act through amendments to the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 and Sea Installations Act. These are positive and important developments in the environmental protection of our oceans.
The purpose of the bill is essentially twofold. The first purpose is to amend the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 in order to: implement the 1996 protocol to the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, the so-called London Convention; clarify the committee's responsibility for regulating the construction of artificial reefs; apply the act to the exclusive economic zone; revise offence, penalty and exemption provisions; simplify roll back provisions for application to states and the Northern Territory; include the Australian Customs Service as inspectors for the purposes of the act; and simplify provisions to make them consistent across the act. There is a fair bit of housekeeping involved in this legislation, though some are important issues. 
The second purpose of the legislation is to amend the Sea Installations Act 1987 in order to remove the prohibitions on issuing and varying a permit that would authorise a sea installation to be located partly within and partly outside an adjacent area—that is, Commonwealth waters adjacent to state coastal waters. As I say, the aims of the bill are to be commended, but there are some relatively minor but nonetheless important weaknesses in the legislation as it currently stands which our proposed amendments seek to address. These primarily relate to the application of the precautionary principle and the definition of artificial reefs.
For thousands of years, humans have viewed oceans as vast dumps for domestic and industrial garbage. Since the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act has been in operation, over 100 million tonnes of sediments have been dredged from harbours and waterways. Three million tonnes of industrial waste, 20 vessels and 1,500 tonnes of munitions have been dumped. A number of materials were licensed for dumping which are now considered unacceptable, such as munitions, car tyres, concrete, asbestos and industrial waste. These materials may never become evenly diluted into a weaker mixture, and ocean processes may even concentrate some materials.
 The costs of dumping materials at sea are not generally borne by those who dump. They are borne by the fishing industry and the community at large. Recent decades, however, have seen a remarkable shift in international attitudes to the dumping of waste at sea. This shift has been characterised by a move from an assimilative capacity approach, where the dilution effects of the oceans were thought to be adequate to mask the detrimental effects of waste, to the precautionary approach, where waste should not be discarded when there is the risk of serious or irreversible damage.
Concern for the health of oceans has led to a number of international agreements which restrict the dumping of waste and indeed the movement of hazardous waste. The London Convention was the first international convention to address ocean dumping and was ratified in Australia in 1985. The sea dumping act incorporates the convention into Australian law. The London Convention aimed to prevent the indiscriminate disposal at sea of wastes liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life and to damage amenities or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea. The fundamental principle of the convention is the prohibition of dumping of certain waste, the requirement of a specific permit prior to dumping of other waste and the demand for a general permit for the rest. The first two categories are determined by annexes to the convention. Although it was, and continues to be, an important development, the convention has been limited in scope. It applied only to waste from ships or aircraft and did not cover material dumped from a land source or the operational discharges from ships. Similarly, the offshore processing of seabed resources is not covered by the convention or the domestic legislation.
The waters surrounding Australia's coastline are also threatened by pollution from waste dumped at sea which Commonwealth laws seek to control. Some materials, such as those produced for biological and chemical warfare and radioactive material, cannot be dumped in Australian waters under any circumstances. The 1996 protocol to the London Convention has considerably strengthened the provisions of the convention. In addition to a more restrictive list of substances which can be dumped, the protocol requires contracting parties to explore alternatives to sea dumping. We welcome the increasing rigour applied to the protection of the world's oceans through this protocol. The protocol also retains the objective of the convention and has captured the essential measures propounded by the convention to prohibit dumping in the sea. However, it does so while taking into account developments in technology for waste management that have occurred over the years along with those anticipated for the future. 
Although the protocol discourages as far as possible any dumping at sea, incineration at sea for the deliberate disposal of waste or other matter via thermal destruction is prohibited. Environmentally preferable land based alternatives are largely encouraged in order to avoid unwanted disposal of waste or other matters at sea. However, the protocol does recognise that current technology does not permit the disposal of certain categories of waste or other matters on land and that certain small island states lack the landmass for land disposal facilities. In this respect, dumping may be allowed but, before such a decision is made, candidate wastes or other matter must first undergo a thorough assessment, including evaluation of a waste prevention audit, waste management options and identification of waste characteristics.
Turning to the bill, we recognise that the bill also extends the area to which the restrictions apply from the outer edge of the Australian fishing zone to Australia's exclusive economic zone—such extension including also Australia's exclusive economic zone around Antarctica, which is an important extension. The bill has a number of weaknesses in its current form. There are a few inconsistencies with the London protocol, which we will seek to rectify via an amendment. Of more concern is the bill's treatment of the precautionary principle and the placement of artificial reefs. We believe the precautionary principle is critical in the area of oceans policy, where scientific data is often incomplete. We believe the bill needs to recognise the application of such a principle as set out in article 3 of the protocol. It should be noted that Senator Hill has stated that the protocol incorporates the precautionary principle and that, if there is any concern that the substance may harm the environment, it will not be dumped until testing has proved otherwise. We believe this is not currently embodied in the bill, and we believe the bill should be amended to do so.
The creation of artificial reefs is an issue as well. The creation of such reefs is not considered dumping as recognised in the convention. There is a possibility that dumping might be proposed under the guise of reef creation. This should be recognised in the definition of the artificial reefs, which should limit artificial reef placement to the dumping of controlled materials as defined under the legislation. So we will be moving some amendments in the committee stage, and I have given some notice of those, but the opposition supports the aims and objectives of the bill.
Whilst canvassing the question of the marine environment and the subject area of this legislation, it should also be recorded that we are concerned that the government has still not implemented a substantial part of its oceans policy. We believe such implementation needs to proceed as a matter of priority, and we urge the government to look at the recommendations of the government's oceans policy advisory group and to quickly start to implement such recommendations. There is a whole raft of recommendations which the government has proudly from time to time invoked as reflecting concern about coastal policy. But there has to be concern not only that those recommendations are not being implemented substantially but also that the position of head of the oceans policy office has not taken up his position some 15 months after his appointment was announced by the minister. As we saw once again in the press over the weekend, a person was announced to take the position of director of the oceans policy office but—and this is a matter that I want to pursue during the committee stage—that person has not been appointed, and it seems as though the government is now seeking another person for that particular office. There is concern in the community and in the opposition that an oceans policy which has been announced by government has been slow in its implementation and an office which was announced very widely by the minister—and the director for the office announced by the minister some 15 months ago—has also not been filled over that period. 
Going back to the bill, I do not think there is much more to say other than to once again indicate that we are talking about legislation which, with just a cursory degree of discussion between government, opposition and minor parties, could have seen amendments accepted by the government that would have saved the Senate time and would have seen some consensual outcome. But it seems as though we have to go through this particular process in the chamber. The opposition looks forward to moving amendments which we hope at least the Democrats will support.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,20,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-03-06,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats to speak about the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill 1999. I will not go into great detail about the content and purposes of the bill as Senator Bolkus has done that reasonably well in the contribution he has just concluded. The minister's second reading speech also outlines it in detail. In very general terms, the purposes of the bill are clearly a positive improvement. The bill's main activities are to amend the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 and the Sea Installations Act 1987 and to improve the regulation of dumping at sea. It links into changes that have been made to the protocol that covers this area: the protocol for the London Convention. Those changes are positive and for that reason the Democrats are supportive of them. We will examine the issues that Senator Bolkus has raised about some of the perceived loopholes or inadequacies in the bill and potential improvements when we get to the committee stage. We will be interested in listening to any views put forward at that time about the value of the additional amendments that Senator Bolkus has circulated.
I think the committee stage is probably the better stage to go into the detail of some of the issues that Senator Bolkus has raised and some of the suggested improvements and amendments that he is going to put forward. Suffice it to say, this bill has been around a little while now. It was introduced into the Senate not much less than a month ago—that is, at the end of March last year—and it has already been to a Senate legislation committee for examination. The committee did not receive a significant degree of submissions. As that committee report indicates, the general thrust of the bill is positive. Despite the fact that it is a positive bill, that does not mean there is not scope for improvement. We will examine those issues when we get to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,20,1

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-03-06,"—In rising, I first apologise to the listeners of radio 5DN in Adelaide for leaving quickly to attend the chamber. I wish to speak tonight to the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999. This bill contains technical changes of a mildly beneficial nature and serves to incorporate three pieces of subordinate legislation from the 1998 youth allowance legislation package into the Social Security Act 1991. While the opposition is broadly supportive of this consolidation exercise, we are seeking to amend those provisions which lower the benefits available to some young people and place further financial pressure on their families. 
The opposition is concerned to ensure that this bill does not disadvantage youth allowance recipients and further shift the burden of support to the shoulders of low income families. Under the guise of mutual obligation, the government continues to build a tougher world for young people undertaking education and training or engaging in the difficult search for work. We are opposing changes in the bill that tighten the screws further still.
I turn to the specific issues in the bill. Three of the bill's five schedules seek to incorporate into the Social Security Act youth allowance provisions currently contained in two disallowable instruments and one set of regulations dealing with aspects of Austudy. The opposition has always argued that, for the sake of clarity, these measures should be included in the one act so we support the thrust of this move.
Schedule 1 will allow easier access to fair concessions, a provision the opposition supports. Schedule 2 repeals the social security financial supplement scheme 1998, a disallowable instrument, and replaces it with similar provisions in the act. The scheme allows tertiary students who receive youth allowance, Austudy or the pensioner education supplement to exchange some amount of their benefit for a loan of twice that amount. 
Schedule 3 transfers the family actual means test regulations into the act. While the schedule leaves the means test largely unaltered, there is one change that may be unfair in our view in practice. The family means test applies to students who are not deemed to be independent of their parents. In such cases, the means test is usually applied to the parents' taxable income. However, in certain cases, such as where a parent has an interest in a company or is self-employed, taxable income may not reflect the family's true means and the actual means test may apply. The actual means test assesses total savings and expenditure of the family. 
Under schedule 3, the question of whether the actual means test should apply is determined by reference to the base tax year—that is, the last tax year—regardless of whether this is the year during which the actual means are to be assessed. Although this proposal reflects the old Austudy regulations, the opposition is concerned it could prove unfair in the following circumstances. For example, the parents of a youth allowance applicant might have owned a company until January 1999 when they sold that interest. Under the proposal, they would be subject to the actual means test in 2000 on the basis of an interest in a company they have not had for 12 months even if they have been assessed on their expenditure in the 1999-2000 tax year. The opposition intends to move an amendment to restore the status quo so that persons in these situations will not be disadvantaged.
I note there have been some discussions with the government late this afternoon regarding our concerns about schedule 3 of the bill and that the government argues that those are unfounded. We have flagged this issue since the debate in the House of Representatives in March last year, and we have not as yet had a chance to fully understand the government's objections but, with the cooperation of the minister, I have arranged to have some further discussions about that before we move into the committee stage. I think that might help the Senate transact the business more effectively than we perhaps have on some recent bills when we have been arguing about what we mean rather than about the principle. So I appreciate the minister's cooperation in that, because we are anxious to have the debate about the principles involved rather than any misunderstandings we or anybody else might hold about the effect of changes.
Schedule 4 makes it easier to establish independent status for young job seekers. The opposition supports this measure. However, this schedule also seeks to make changes to the benefits of young people with disabilities by aligning the disability support pension with youth allowance rather than the Newstart, which is the situation at present. Some people would gain from this change but others would be disadvantaged; and we intend to move amendments to ensure that no-one is made worse off. In particular, I am concerned about disability support pensioners between the ages of 18 and 21 who have dependants. Again, we are happy to discuss that measure with the government before we move into the committee stage. 
The opposition will also seek to amend the provisions in schedule 4 that change the family allowance income test. Currently, family allowance begins to taper out once income reaches $23,550 per annum plus $624 each for every child who is deemed to be a family allowance child. This bill would stipulate that only children under 18 years of age could be so deemed for the purposes of the income test. We think this is another example of the government's harsh treatment of families who are forced by the youth allowance system to support their adult children.
Schedule 5 would also cause a loss of benefits for some young people. The objectionable provision concerns payments made under the Farm Household Support Act 1992, exceptional circumstances relief payment, and the restart income support payment. Again, this schedule would align these payments with youth allowance rather than Newstart for persons of youth allowance age, resulting in a reduction in entitlement.
In terms of Labor's attitude to the Democrats' amendments I wanted to flag in the second reading debate that we only received those amendments very late and have not had a chance to consider them in detail. We would be happy to have a bit more of a consideration of those amendments. But we are inclined to not make major changes to the broad social security approach in a minor technical sort of bill. We do not see that this is the vehicle for some of the changes that are being proposed. Some of the amendments proposed by the Democrats are supported by Labor's general position and will be taken up as part of our broader approach to reforming both the welfare system and putting in place our Knowledge Nation policy framework. However, we would rather do those in our own time rather than in the context of what is a largely technical bill. Indeed, we are concerned that some of the Democrats' amendments do not take into account the full financial impact, the precedents they may set or the inconsistencies that might arise in terms of other areas of the social security system. So I want to emphasise the point that our rejection of some of these amendments in no way signals an intention not to address some of the issues they raise but that we are concerned that this may not be the place and we may need to make our approach to some of these issues in a much broader way than merely looking to amend this bill. As I say, I will have a broader discussion of that during the committee stage, and I would also like to have some time to have a closer look at the Democrat amendments which I received only this afternoon.
I do not want to lose sight of the fact that the current form of youth allowance is a product of the coalition government's obsession with reducing costs at the expense of all other goals. Labor is committed to achieving the best system for students and young people—one that is considered and therefore effective. The opposition intends to move to amend provisions in this bill to prevent any reduction in benefit. As I said, we are prepared to have further discussions with the government to ensure that there are no unintended consequences and that we are agreed about the impact of amendments so that, if there are in-principle issues about which we cannot agree, we debate those issues rather than get caught up in a debate about what particular amendments mean or what  unintended consequences may be caused by particular amendments. 
I wish to conclude by noting that the government's youth allowance legislation package provides important lessons about what we do not want to see in the government's welfare review. If the youth allowance changes were to be used as a prototype, then welfare reform will be shorthand for reduced payments, punitive measures and a withdrawal of government responsibility for the education and training of young Australians. ",SENATE,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-03-06,"—I preface my remarks on the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999 by acknowledging the comments made by Senator Evans in relation to the Democrats' amendments, but I do wish to point out for the record that we did contact the shadow minister's office on Friday with the intention of explaining what we were going to do with our amendments, and we received the ALP's amendments this morning. But having said that, I still think we would all benefit from time to analyse some of the proposals before us. I think that is a consequence of this bill coming on a little earlier than was anticipated.
I also acknowledge Senator Evans's comments that in some ways this is a technical, perhaps housekeeping bill. But that still does not stop us from using this opportunity to correct some anomalies that may be part of this legislation or to make the schemes fairer in a way that this bill does entitle us to do. In an attempt to achieve that purpose the Democrats have signalled that we will be moving certain amendments, some of which have been around for a while now, given that some of the debates we will have during the committee stage on this bill mirror those we had during the introduction of the legislation in relation to the youth allowance.
This bill makes a number of minor amendments to the Student Financial Supplement Scheme, fares allowance and the family actual means test concerning youth allowance, Austudy and the Student Financial Supplement Scheme. In 1997 the youth allowance merged all income support for young unemployed people under the age of 21 years and full-time students between the ages of 16 and 24 years into one payment. This concept was seen as having some benefits, and certainly in many cases it has been pleasing—and the Democrats certainly acknowledge this—to see a more streamlined approach. And in some cases positive measures, such as some categories of students being able to access rent assistance, have been welcomed by the Democrats and of course by young Australians who have been able to access those entitlements.
This bill completes the transition of student income support legislation from the DETYA legislative practice to the DSS legislative practice. It incorporates two disallowable instruments and one set of regulations dealing with aspects of Austudy into the Social Security Act 1991. The Democrats welcome the incorporation of the practices of the DSS to ensure that legislation regarding social security is presented in plain language and does not rely unduly on delegated legislation. Certainly one of the failings that we would have nominated quite clearly with the Austudy and students' assistance legislation prior to the introduction of the common youth allowance was that heavy reliance on regulation.
This bill has been described as a housekeeping bill, as I mentioned, with few real amendments. However, the Democrats do believe that there are many issues that we need to address before the youth allowance house is put in order. These include anomalies such as the student age of independence, which we believe is set at a ridiculously high level of 25 years. It has placed an undue burden on families of students who are treated by this government as dependent upon the parental income to support them throughout their studies. We do not support—we never have supported—the notion that students can or should be dependent upon their parents until the age of 25. Once again, the Democrats will seek to lower the age of independence. That is one of our amendments. Indeed, we have tried a number of times, without success, to achieve that.
One of the government's claims is that under the common youth allowance students are the big winners, yet this legislation fails to recognise—and I think the government has failed to recognise this—that one of the most vocal campaigns for students on Austudy has been for them to access rent assistance. Under youth allowance students can qualify for rent assistance, but the anomaly is that under Austudy the same rules do not apply. The Democrats will move an amendment to allow students on the Austudy payment to access rent assistance. Students under the age of 25 on youth allowance can access rent assistance, yet those of more than 25 years of age on Austudy payments cannot. I fail to see how the government can justify what appears to be a double standard. 
The Democrats note that the concessions to full-time students provided under the previous Austudy scheme have not been transferred to the youth allowance with regard to the definition of full time in relation to concessional rates and special circumstances. Again, we will be moving amendments to this bill to recognise that, for a variety of reasons, students may need to undertake less than a full-time study load. These reasons of course can include personal circumstances, disability, illness or academic requirements.
Under the previous and current Austudy scheme two concessions—66 per cent and 25 per cent— were provided so that students who met certain requirements continued to be seen as full-time students. Under youth allowance these students are no longer regarded as full-time students. As part-time students they may retain eligibility for youth allowance and may even receive exemption from completing other activities. However, they lose the additional benefits that come with being a full-time student—for example, the higher income free area, the income bank and access to the supplement loan. The loss of these benefits may disadvantage some students, particularly those who are restricted by their course structure and, through no fault of their own, are unable to maintain a full-time load.
I note that there are cases where the lack of defined concessions for students are of benefit and this has allowed Centrelink to be more flexible to those students who are studying just under two-thirds so that they can maintain payments. Certainly that is something we recognise and support. However, this flexibility needs to be built upon for all tertiary students not just those that are under the age of 21 years.
Another inconsistency between the youth allowance and Austudy payments which has come to our attention and which the Democrats again will seek to rectify are the progress rules. The Austudy payment has retained what are known as the time spent rules—that is, the period of study a student can undertake and maintain eligibility for assistance. This is usually the minimum length of the degree plus an additional semester and has traditionally, I think, been extremely harsh for many tertiary students who may start a course that for a variety of reasons they are not suited to or for whatever reason they are unable to complete. Many students have found that they lack income support for their final semester of their degree. Some students have consistently overloaded in order to reduce their time.
The youth allowance has a more acceptable approach to this issue. The current guidelines state that there are no legislative limits on the number of courses that can be undertaken at any one level, and this has been of enormous benefit to students under the age of 25. Again, the Democrats recognise that as a positive aspect. However, there may also be students over the age of 25 who are in receipt of Austudy payments who still find themselves facing no income support in the same scenario.
I note that currently under youth allowance it is possible for some studies towards a masters or a doctorate to be incorporated into an activity agreement. Again, this highlights the new divide in student financial assistance based solely on age. The inaccessibility of Austudy for students undertaking masters courses has long been a source of frustration. This frustration is compounded by the fact that students who are undertaking masters coursework studies are ineligible for scholarships. For example, at the Flinders University in my home state of South Australia, Australian postgraduate awards with stipend and Flinders University research scholarships are only allocated to students undertaking higher degrees by research. Yet many masters qualifications are required as a minimum qualification to enter into a specific profession. With rising employer expectations students are typically discovering that they require these qualifications just to be competitive in the market, even if a masters level is not a direct prerequisite for a particular position. Many mature age students who may have gained qualifications some time ago are also faced with the prospect of having to re-skill or update their skills to remain competitive. 
Currently, tertiary courses are grouped into four levels—A, B, C and D. The Democrats will seek to amend this to include a further level, a level E, for masters studies to be incorporated for Austudy payment and youth allowance. This would ensure that students would be able to access assistance for masters studies regardless of their entry pathway, whether they have come up through an honours year or, for example, a postgraduate diploma. It is in recognition of the increasing credentialism of our nation, and I am presuming that is a credentialism that the government supports and promotes and something that certainly all sectors—business, industry as well as the parliament—would be keen to promote in such a way that people not only are told to go out and get more credentials but also are supported while they are doing so.
This government's record on youth allowance and Austudy is not a proud one. In 1997 we saw the Howard government raise the age of independence from 22 years to 25 years for students and at the same time cut over $400 million in unemployment benefits to 18- to 21-year-olds. That was not a proud year, budget decision or policy decision. As many people in this place will recall, the passage of these measures was gained through the support of Senator Brian Harradine in exchange for a deal—and this was very transparent; it was discussed quite openly in this place—whereby families adversely affected through the implementation of such a high age of independence would receive compensation through a tax deal. 
I note that that deal this government made with Senator Harradine was never adequately honoured. While the youth allowance legislation cut the total income for Australian families by $150 million per annum, the budgeted tax concessions for families amounted to only about $48 million and a further cut of $12 million has been made to family allowance since the passage of the youth allowance. It was like a mugger leaving these families—and perhaps Senator Harradine—a tip. I look forward to his comments on this measure. Certainly he has raised concerns on this in the past.
—The youth allowance was an expenditure measure, not a savings measure.
—I acknowledge Senator Newman's interjection, which I caught the second time. She was suggesting that the common youth allowance was not a savings measure. I think we should be examining the impact of the streamlined approach—an approach that we supported—on particular families. There are many cases, many examples, where families have missed out on benefits—in some cases hundreds of dollars per annum and in some cases thousands of dollars—or lost their benefits completely. There is no doubt, if you examine the impact of the government's reforms in relation to student financial support and support for the unemployed, that many families have missed out. Certainly this was a concern, specifically in relation to the age of independence and families that would miss out as a consequence of raising that age level, raised not only by the Democrats and by some opposition members but by Senator Harradine. He did a deal. He got the measures through, but the deal was not adequately honoured. I look forward to seeing that deal honoured some time in the future. I look forward also to hearing Senator Harradine's comments on the bill before us.
This is despite the fact that in 1996 Australia ranked 24th out of the 29 OECD countries in terms of taxation as a proportion of GDP—figures that we all know well in this chamber now—with only Mexico, Korea, Turkey and Japan collecting a lower proportion of tax. I note that it has also been estimated that, if the rate were brought up to the OECD average, it would have delivered an additional $40.9 billion in the 1999-2000 financial year. That money could have gone a long way towards support for higher education and research. 
I have just come back from a very brief visit to the AusIndustry dinner this evening. Many of the people who went to the function today were talking about the themes that have emerged—themes that were certainly mirrored in the Innovation Summit discussions—that business and industry are calling for more money to be set aside for research, for development and for the education and training sectors. It is money worth investing in our nation. Similarly, ensuring that people have the support so that they can undertake these kinds of studies is important. So clearly that is where student financial support plays a key role. I do not think the government has made adequate recognition of that fact. I think that is a glaring anomaly we are dealing with in relation to the common youth allowance—and I will say positive things about the concept of streamlining and various incorporations of the DSS practices later.  
We have an age of independence that is defined as 25 years, which I think has little precedent and certainly does not match many other pieces of legislation we deal with in this place. Certainly when it comes to the government spending money you find that the age of independence gets higher and higher. But when it comes to the government stopping or getting money back from families, you find the age of the family and the age of independence much lower than that. In stark contrast to the options adopted by other OECD nations, this government since 1996 has decreased the proportion of Commonwealth revenue being spent on social security and welfare, and family and community services from 36.4 per cent in 1995-96 to 31.9 per cent in 1999-2000. Clearly, we have a government that is not as serious as it should be about helping Australian families or assisting our young unemployed and students. Unfortunately, we have a government that has not kept its deals with either members of the Senate—and one member in particular—or Australian families. I look forward to the minister's response to the suggestion that the deal with Senator Harradine was not adequately honoured. I think it is a very brave government that argues it has fulfilled the promises it made to Senator Harradine back in 1997. 
I once again urge the Australian Labor Party to consider the Democrat amendments. Once again I urge the ALP to support a reduced age of independence. Most people recognise that it is ridiculous to define independence for Australian students at the age of 25. I think that is widely recognised by all sectors in the community, including quite a few constituents of the Labor Party. Certainly peak bodies—whether it is the National Tertiary Education Union or the National Union of Students—are very concerned about what effect this has had on their members. Similarly, the postgraduate representative organisations are concerned about some of the problems I talked about in relation to the master's qualifications and the lack of income support that accompanies those. I hope the ALP will consider the amendments put forward by the Democrats. I look forward to discussing this bill further in the committee stage of the debate.",SENATE,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-03-06,"—I thought I would also make a few brief comments in the second reading stage of this particular piece of legislation which deals with the youth allowance payment and various components of it. The issues that my colleague and Deputy Leader of the Democrats, Senator Stott Despoja, has outlined relating to the amendments that we are planning to move and to some of the related issues need emphasising and reinforcing. We are in a year where, according to statements made by a number of government ministers, a major priority of this government in terms of future directions will be in the welfare area. The so-called welfare reform agenda, which is still to be finalised and revealed in the second half of this year, has the potential to affect millions and millions of Australians. We have had a lot of shift and rhetoric in recent years in relation to welfare payments and income support payments, moving away from the idea of entitlement and meeting need and moving towards a rhetoric of obligation.
Whilst nobody would deny that everyone in society to varying degrees has obligations to other people in the community in terms of how they behave, it is important that we do not let the priorities get out of order. The basic fundamental priority of an income support system is to ensure that basic needs in the community are met and that there is not an increase in inequality or, more importantly, an increase in deprivation, need and poverty. These are some of the issues that the Democrat amendments go to. 
I think I heard Senator Evans mentioning the length of time in which these amendments have been circulated. I would have to say that the particular piece of paper may have gone around earlier today, but the amendments contained within it and the issues contained within it have been around for a long time. The Democrats have been bashing on about some of them, in particular the one relating to the exemption of farm assets, for a good 10 years. It is certainly one of the earlier things I can recall when I first got involved in the party around a decade ago. The issues that are raised here, including the ones relating to age of independence, were raised at the time the youth allowance was brought forward. The exemption from activity test and the inapplicability of masters degrees have been around for a significant length of time. To suggest that they are appearing out of the blue is a bit disingenuous. I would hope that the issues raised in the amendments are considered on their merits.
Getting back to the fundamental issue of the basic purpose of a social security system, which is addressing poverty and need, I think the issue that I would like to highlight specifically, which was also mentioned by my Democrat colleague, is that of rent assistance and the inapplicability of that payment to Austudy recipients over the age of 25. As I said at the time the youth allowance measures were introduced, it was a major positive that the government extended rent assistance to a number of students who did not have it before, but the fact remains that there is still a significant group in the community that does not have access to that. That is a significant indicator in relation to poverty and need—one that is quite blatant, open and undeniable. There is no rational reason why that particular group of people should be denied access to rent assistance, particularly when we are often going on about the need to encourage older people to retrain, to get into reskilling and to increase their education levels. There is no reason to provide such a massive disincentive as that.
I have had individual constituents in this specific circumstance who have been unable, because of their inability to access rent assistance, to afford to switch across to undertaking education. It is a blatant area where there is a clear need and one where, if we are going to have any meaningful examination of improving the adequacy of our welfare system, there needs to be action. It is one that I would particularly like to strongly reinforce on behalf of the Democrats. Housing costs and housing issues have fallen down the agenda at federal level over a number of years, stretching back to when Labor was in office. A lot has been pushed back onto the states in that area, yet in something as fundamental as one of the few remaining areas of direct Commonwealth involvement in housing assistance, which is through rent assistance, we have a major gap. It is an area where something clearly needs to be done. I very much hope that we are able to address that through this bill or through the welfare reform process later in the year.
It also comes back to the issue of consistency, which was one of the strengths of shifting to the common youth allowance. It tried to streamline and provide some consistency between different payments. A lot of progress can still be made in that area, and I hope that is addressed through the welfare reform process. This is an area where there is clearly a major inconsistency and gap in terms of poverty, and it very seriously needs to be addressed. I hope that when we get to those amendments all senators will give full consideration to them. There are a number of important issues that need to be examined as part of income support payments. Some of them are appropriate for this legislation; some of them are perhaps appropriate for a broader debate at another time. But it is always important to re-emphasise what we are dealing with in legislation such as this, which is about ensuring that basic needs are met and that people have the opportunity to participate fully and productively in wider society and at least have the limitations of lower income reduced in terms of enabling them to contribute effectively. I think it is important to keep that principle in mind when we debate some of the issues that are involved in this bill and some of the amendments that will be dealt with in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSOLIDATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-03-06,"—I thank honourable senators for their contribution. I make it clear that the Youth Allowance Consolidation Bill 1999 follows on from the 1998 youth allowance package of legislation, and it does meet the government's commitment to parliament to move the provisions in the package's subordinate legislation into the Social Security Act 1991. The bill has two main purposes. The first is to incorporate in the Social Security Act the provisions currently contained in the three major pieces of subordinate legislation that are part of the package. Those are the Social Security (Fares Allowance) Rules 1998, a disallowable instrument, the Social Security Student Financial Supplement Scheme 1998, also a disallowable instrument, and the Social Security (Family Actual Means Test) Regulations 1998. 
The other main purpose of the bill is to deal with any technical issues identified during the implementation of the youth allowance package. That is something that senators need to focus on—that that is the other main purpose of the bill. It will also make consequential amendments to the Social Security Act and to relevant tax, data matching and farm household support legislation to reflect the new placement and structure of the relocated provisions and as a consequence of the commencement of youth allowance. So, in a very real sense, we are dealing with a technical bill, a housekeeping bill, as Senator Stott Despoja said.
As a general principle, the provisions are being moved without any change being made in their effect. Those provisions themselves were originally set up with the intention of preserving the effect of the pre-existing Austudy provisions so that students did not suffer any disruption to their payments because of the youth allowance changes—which, if you recall, happened halfway through an academic year. The only changes in these provisions are either for technical or drafting reasons or minor changes that are either beneficial or neutral in nature.
The schedule of technical amendments to the Social Security Act will essentially finetune the large and complex youth allowance package. The amendments make minor drafting clarifications and technical refinements to ensure that the package operates in line with the original policy intentions, including the alignment, where appropriate, with the pre-existing Austudy provisions—that is, the amendments are either to refine provisions in line with original policy intent, for necessary alignment with other programs and provisions, to close technical loopholes or clarify the operation of the existing provisions, or to make minor technical corrections and drafting refinements.
This legislation is not about policy change. Having listened to Senator Stott Despoja speak about her dissatisfaction with the ALP over the exchange of draft amendments between their two parties, I would like to point out that, although the Democrats' general principles were given to the government on Friday, we received the Democrats' amendments only just now, and some of them are not ones that were included in the distribution on Friday. Because of the complexity of social security legislation, just like tax legislation, it is really not fair to (a) those who have to administer social security legislation and (b) those whose entitlements depend on that legislation. It is not fair to have amendments essentially taken on the run in a debate.
—What about the ones we gave you early last week! You had them before the ALP!
—Senator Stott Despoja, you have had your chance. You can have it again in the committee stage. But I have listened to you. It should be recognised by Senator Stott Despoja that this particular piece of legislation is not an appropriate vehicle for the sort of major policy changes that are being proposed in most of the Democrats' amendments. Senator Stott Despoja should also acknowledge that the youth allowance is currently being evaluated by a rigorous process of evaluation which was promised when the legislation went through the Senate. If the Democrats wish to attempt to make substantial policy changes to the youth allowance—and, I must say, at extreme cost to the taxpayer—it is appropriate that that sort of consideration be given when the report is received on the evaluation. I do not think it is unreasonable to suggest that at all, especially as the Democrats clearly cannot have much idea about the sort of bill they are sending the taxpayer with some of the amendments that have been distributed this evening. I have heard both Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Bartlett give credit to the government for streamlining the payments. 
—We won't waste our time next time!
—I find it fascinating that that is what the Democrats appear to think was the purpose of the exercise. I would like to think that you might focus for a bit tonight, as you go to sleep, on the reasons the government introduced this. Firstly, we had too many young people who were jumping school early into a climate where skilled jobs are available and unskilled jobs are not. We had too many young people who were presenting into a work force where they had no skills to offer. The importance of the youth allowance was to ensure that fewer of our young people were left disadvantaged in the job market. That, surely, is a commendable purpose. It has achieved significant results in that regard already with young people who have returned to the education system, having dropped out, since the introduction of youth allowance.
Secondly, we had a situation, which we inherited when we came into government, where the taxpayer was paying more to young people to be unemployed than they were to be students of any age. What a nonsense that is, and what an important thing for Australia's young people that the benefits for students were raised to reach the level of the benefits that were being paid to the young unemployed. Surely, any adult with commonsense and concern about the future of our people would want to see students on benefits that are the equal of those of the unemployed. I am glad to hear Senator Stott Despoja acknowledge that rent assistance has been a beneficial measure. When the Democrats are talking about the lack of rent assistance for people on Austudy, it is pretty reasonable to put on the record that there was no rent assistance for students of any age until we came into government and introduced the youth allowance.
We introduced rent allowance for the very good reason that it was one of the measures to equalise the treatment of young unemployed people and young students. Those people who are on Austudy are mature age students—I recognise that—and many of them have saved to study. They are people who one might have expected to have had some more put by in order to undertake studies. In a tight financial circumstance it was therefore logical that the young people who were looking for support from the taxpayer would be the first priority, and that has been government's position. I do not think it is an unreasonable one. Senator Stott Despoja also referred to the agreement that the government had with Senator Harradine about some families that were missing out because of the introduction of youth allowance. These were families that had higher incomes that did not allow them to access youth allowance. There was an agreement honoured by the government with Senator Harradine. Family allowance was extended to people who were not eligible for youth allowance. That $50 payment commenced last October. That arrangement was negotiated in good faith and it has been delivered. I do not take kindly to Senator Stott Despoja coming into this chamber and talking about the government not honouring its agreement.
The age of independence seems to be an issue on which Senator Stott Despoja has hung a pennant to the mast. She cannot get over the fact that there is such a thing as financial dependence and financial independence. Where young people can prove that they are financially independent, they can get youth allowance on the basis of their own financial position. But if they cannot prove their financial independence, their family should support them before they ask the taxpayer to do so. That seems to be foreign to the thinking of Senator Stott Despoja because she is hung up on this concept of the age of independence. I do not believe it is fair to the Australian taxpayer to have all students getting youth allowance regardless of their family's financial circumstances and I do not believe it is fair to the Australian taxpayer to have young people in well-to-do families getting taxpayer assistance when their family could support them. This is not something that is directed at students; it is treating them equally. It was already unequal in terms of the age cut-out when we came into government, if you can recall. 
I think there are some ideological barriers in the way for Senator Stott Despoja—I cannot think it is otherwise. I must say that the taxpayers seem to be pretty satisfied that this is a fairer system to help finance young people to stay in school longer and acquire skills; that it is a fairer system to give the same sort of financial support to young students that was always given to young unemployed people; and that it is a fairer system to ensure that parents take responsibility for their young to the extent they are able before that family, including the young person, turns to the taxpayer for assistance. I will be interested to see what proposals finally come to the Senate after the discussion that is to take place tomorrow. I appreciate Senator Evans being prepared to have a closer look at some of the proposals that he was interested in putting forward. It can be a time wasting exercise for the Senate to have people disagreeing on what amendments actually mean. If those sorts of issues can be cleared out of the way before we meet again in the committee stage, it could be that this essentially technical measure could go through as originally proposed by the government. Certainly this is not a bill which sets out to diminish people's entitlements. As I said, the only changes in the provisions are either for technical or drafting reasons or they are minor changes that are either beneficial or neutral in nature. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-03-06,"—In speaking about this legislation I will provide some background first and then put the opposition's position. When we talk about manufacturing in bond we are talking about a scheme that was utilised in Australia by a limited number of manufacturers until 1988. It was abolished as a result of the Industry Commission 1987 report. It was suggested for reintroduction in The Australian iron and steel industry: report to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism by the parliament committee inquiring into the steel industry in 1997. In December 1997 the government announced `Investing for growth'. That contained both the MiB and the Tradex initiatives. Manufacturing in bond is a provision to allow the manufacturing of goods in a Customs licensed warehouse. A firm with MiB approval will be able to import dutiable goods into a licensed warehouse free of duty and sales tax. If these goods are subsequently re-exported, either in their original or manufactured form, no duty or sales tax liability is incurred. Imports brought into the warehouse and subsequently entered for home consumption—that is, sold on the domestic market—incur a duty and sales tax liability at the time they leave the warehouse.
Benefits to manufacturers in these circumstances are similar to those of free trade zones, such as deferral of duty until products are sold into the domestic market, duty payable on goods released onto the domestic market being the lesser of the amount payable on the input goods to that applying to the finished product, and duties not being payable on inputs imported into the zone and then re-exported without the domestic market. The objectives of MiB is to facilitate trading operations by streamlining the administration of imports which are subsequently re-exported, whether processed or in their original form. The broader objective is to generate net additional economic activity and employment within Australia.  
As I stated earlier, the government announced the Manufacturing in Bond scheme in December 1997. However, the success of the scheme has been severely limited because of restrictions within the scheme and also as a result of the processing arrangements made by Customs. The most important problem identified so far has involved the problems with Customs. A cost recovery charge of $22.80 was applied by Customs on each and every imported component. That is, the manufacturer of a product who imported 100 components would face an additional cost of  $2,280 from this cost recovery charge so-called. Up until now operators of MiB warehouses were subject to import processing charges and fees that were introduced in 1997 to recover the costs incurred in processing what are known as `customs entries'. Currently, a charge applies to entries lodged to allow imported goods to be moved into and, if goods go into Australian commerce, out of Australian warehouses. 
A parliamentary committee report identified that industry has claimed that these charges and fees make the operation of MiB warehouses uneconomic and serve as obstacles to attracting international manufacturing and investment to Australia.  The Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Vanstone, stated on 29 April 1999:
These changes being announced today are in response to industry's representations that removing the processing charges on imports entering Manufacturing in Bond facilities would improve the ability of the scheme to attract international manufacturing and investment to Australia.
That was a principle repeated by a most unlikely partner of Senator Vanstone—that being Senator Minchin—in a press release of the same day. There are some questions emanating from the government's response. Why did it take such a long time for the government to look to resolving this problem? The government said it was talking to business but it seemed to have been talking to business forever. The government has been aware of this problem for a long time and one has to ask: why so slow in responding?
The other concern to the opposition is that the amendments do not directly resolve the issue. The Import Processing Charges Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999 before the parliament today does not really do what Ministers Vanstone and Minchin stated that it would do. For instance, it is up to Customs to ensure that only one cost will apply to a completed product rather than one for every component. Customs has told business that it will apply the cost recovery duty this way but has not confirmed this in writing. One explanation for this failure by the government was addressed in the Bulletin magazine by Fred Brenchley in January 1999 where he stated:
Despite meetings and pressure from then industry minister John Moore's office through 1998, Customs refused to budge. Cost recovery had been foisted on it by the Finance Department and was a major source of the agency's own revenues.
We now have a situation where what the government has given is not what industry wants and it is also not what the opposition seeks to support. Industry has stated its position quite publicly: it is concerned that an MiB should be treated as an export destination for Australian domestic manufacturers and suppliers; it is concerned about the removal of duty paid on consumables using the production process; and it also wants a single licence/multiple user application. Business does not believe that the necessary attention is being placed with this issue and that the response of the government is inadequate. 
Further, I am informed that the actions of government in the eyes of industry demonstrate a substantial and fundamental problem in that it really does not understand the problems associated with running businesses with an MiB framework. The shadow minister for Customs, Duncan Kerr, has quite explicitly enumerated the concerns that the Labor opposition has on this issue. Our starting point is that we have to be a competitive and innovative economy in a global economy and, for that principle to be achieved, ideas such as the MiB need to be developed fully. But they need to be done correctly. We believe that the government has managed to completely wreck a potentially good idea and has wasted some 2½ years of this potential in the meantime. 
Labor has looked into various aspects of the issue: we looked at duty paid on consumables before the production process; we looked at duty paid on capital equipment; we looked at the costs imposed on this process by Customs and the best methods required to reduce them to the smallest possible level; we looked at the current high cost of obtaining a manufacturing in bond licence; and so on. At the end of the day, we are not proposing to micro manage the government's failed industry policy through this bill. We believe that this bill addresses a small, albeit important, aspect of this industry but we do intend to move the amendments circulated in my name. 
Labor's amendments do not alter the tariff regime put forward by the government in the bill. They simply move the setting of tariff and treatment of MiB goods that enter the Australian market for home consumption out of the act to be set by regulation. In proposing this amendment we recognise the flexibility that may be required and that industry has suggested strongly will inevitably be required from time to time in addressing the changing need and different circumstances. Not to have this regulatory flexibility would also, we believe, unnecessarily inhibit our capacity to attract new investment in Australia. 
In conclusion, I stress that the amendments Labor is proposing maintain the government's ability to protect local industries but they also provide, we believe, the flexibility to encourage manufacturing by lowering input taxes where appropriate. I commend to the Senate the foreshadowed amendments that I will move during the committee stage. I do not think I need to say much more at this particular stage of the debate other than to reiterate that we are talking here of an initiative which is 2½ years in the making and that, in a sense, is half baked.",SENATE,<title>IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES AMENDMENT (WAREHOUSES) BILL 1999CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (WAREHOUSES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second reading</title>,Miscellaneous,22,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2000-03-06,"—I rise on behalf of the Australian Democrats in support of the general principles behind the Import Processing Charges Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999 and the Customs Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999. However, there remains some concern over details within the bills, and I would hope that these issues are able to be resolved and that the amendments can be put in place so that there is certainty offered to those businesses wishing to operate under this scheme-and I will expand on that further.
Australia is a nation that has seen itself as a domestic manufacturer for domestic markets. As a result, our Customs systems have been designed to reflect this. During the 1980s and especially in the 1990s, our industries were being outdone by imported products and manufacturing continued to decline. Although, generally speaking, our manufacturing and our exports were matching our imports, this was more as a result of primary products exports than adequate levels of exporting within the manufacturing sector itself. In the South East Asia region Australia is the second largest domestic market behind Japan and, if we combine this with what is considered a safe investment area, it has reasonably low infrastructure and wage costs. You then have the potential for greater export investment in manufacturing through such schemes as trade-free zones or manufacturing in bond warehousing.
The proposed amendments to the Customs Act to formally allow for manufacturing in bond are, I believe, the result of a good working arrangement and cross-support from the different parties that have been involved. I believe that this is a fundamental approach to policy making in this area so that existing and potential investors in this area are provided with the necessary levels of confidence and political stability to continue to invest, irrespective of changes in government. I also understand that the changes that are contained in these amendments represent a change of thinking for the Customs administration and the manner in which Customs warehouses may operate in the future.
Just on that particular matter, I refer to comments of the honourable member for Newcastle, Mr Allan Morris, where he sees MiBs as the start of the process of having companies operating what he describes as `virtual bond stores'. In time, these bond stores will make use of improved technology as the medium for information exchange. In this regard, it is unlikely that bond stores will be limited to site specific locations. However, such technological changes will more than likely have a positive effect by reducing red tape, removing the disincentives for existing companies to extend their operations and to provide a better climate for new companies to invest in the sector. Just specifically on that matter, not having to pay import duties on goods unless they enter the domestic market is, in my view, a significant step forward in opening up opportunities for companies that wish to use Australia as a base for item assembly. This in its own small way will promote jobs growth and create niche markets for local manufacturers to supply support inputs into such processesan opportunity that will arise as a result of the proposed amendments, I believe. 
At this particular point I would like to foreshadow, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, support for the opposition amendments relating to removing from the act the manner in which import duties are placed upon imported components and to instead have them dealt with by regulation. This will add flexibility, I believe, to the application of import duties.
It is the belief of the Australian Democrats that the issue of charges was not dealt with in a manner that was acceptable so as to be convincing in the economic committee's report into this bill, and I make reference to sections 1.48, 1.49 and 1.50. The report states:
1.48 The Committee notes the apparent anomaly identified by DHL under which Australian manufacturers of computer equipment pay import duties on components. These local manufacturers operate at an apparent disadvantage compared with companies importing computing equipment as a finished product duty free.
It went on to say in 1.49 that, `while the legislation referred to the Committee is not intended to address anomalies of the type identified by DHL, the Committee urges the government to resolve this issue as soon as possible to ensure that Australian manufacturers of such equipment are not disadvantaged'. Yet the committee concluded in 1.50 that `the committee recommends that the bills be passed in their current form,' without addressing that particular issue.
The amendment that is proposed by the opposition will in some way address the issue that the committee itself raised yet failed to address. I say this with the understanding that there is a need to provide reasonable protection to our own domestic manufacturers rather than expose them to an uncertain future. Nevertheless, where there are components that are not manufactured domestically and they are imported into a MiB warehouse and the final item that is produced, if imported, does not attract an import duty, we would agree that these components ought not attract an import duty.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2000-03-06,"—This afternoon I gave notice of a motion on behalf of myself and Senators Crowley and Lees to recognise the life of Dame Roma Mitchell. The motion is formal and appropriately highlights the achievements of Dame Roma. But I think it is worth reflecting for just a few moments on what they really mean. Of course, they were all important milestones for women but they are even more important for what they actually tell us about the person, Dame Roma, herself. They tell us about her intellectual skilland that is nothing new; we all knew thatabout her determination, about her commitment and about her hard work.
Dame Roma commented recently that she had led a charmed life, almost as though these achievements and milestones simply fell her way. That kind of humility hides very clearly all the determination that is needed, all the commitment and the skill and the hard work that went into making it a charmed life. The plain facts are that she earned each of those achievements and milestones. Such humility and good gracewhich, if I may be slightly disparaging of our own profession, is not particularly common in either of these housesis a part of what made Dame Roma so specialabsolutely so.
The American poet Edna St Vincent Millay would hopefully not mind a slight alteration of one of her poems as a description of Dame Roma, the hard worker, the achiever and the charmer—an absolute charmer, Madam President, as I know you know well. The poem, slightly altered, goes something like this: 
She burned the candle at both ends;
It finally met the night;
But ah, her foes—
very few I hope—
And oh, her friends—
It burned a lovely light.
I do not know if Dame Roma ever read, as I suspect she did, Theodore Roosevelt's speech about advocating a principled and strenuous life. It was actually written in 1899 but still holds true today. But whether or not she did does not matter because in many ways—in fact, probably in a large portion of her life—she certainly lived a principled and strenuous life. We should all note, however, that her achievements came from a person who was almost relentlessly charming, another skill sadly not found in that proportion in either house, unless a secret has been kept from me. 
Only once in about 35 years did I hear her speak with a hint of malice, just a hint, about someone else. Like all of us, Dame Roma liked some people and liked others less—I would say disliked—and one was certainly left in no doubt as to her views. She was a very articulate woman. But such was her skill that her view was, to my thinking, only once tainted with malice and even then ever so moderately—certainly from a politician's perspective, acutely moderately. She was not a person who was just admired by many—who is just admired by many, because admiration stays on—but she was genuinely loved by people whether they knew her particularly well or not, odd as that might seem. She had and used freely that magical skill—very magical skill not available to all of us, certainly not available to all of us frequently—of making other people feel special. 
Twenty-five years ago in 1973 or thereabouts there were not too many judges who would happily hold an animated and friendly discussion with a 21-year-old retailer on whether or not we should have a bill of rights because judges would in the end be the decision makers on a bill of rights. Gareth Evans's article in the Australian Quarterly in 1973, citing the track record of a few nominated High Court judges always making decisions that leant one way or the other for the workers or bosses, for the Commonwealth or the states, prompted just such a discussion with me. I still remember her enthusiasm for the discussion and the web of interest that she wove, as opposed to simply nominating a position and standing for it. She always encouraged people, especially younger people and especially women. She was a giver in life, not a taker. 
We were talking quite latish one night prior to one of her many, many much loved overseas trips—she was a born traveller—and her cat, as cats often do, chose to sit on the visitor's lap and was very much enjoying having its back stroked. To my horror, when I looked down I saw that there was a very large collection of soft cat's hair at the back of the cat. Experienced cat strokers, as I believe the Deputy Clerk of the Senate may be, will understand that, when you stroke an animal backwards, if it is moulting a quantity of hair collects at the back of the animal. Not only was this a quantity of hair; it was not sprinkled but laden—and I choose my words delicately here out of respect for Dame Roma; laden is the nicest description I can give—with cat's dandruff building up on its back. I looked down and saw this in horror. Here was this collection of nastiness descending from the cat onto my clothes. Dame Roma, in a very matter-of-fact way, which is a typical description of her, said, `I'm very sorry about all that, but the vet had said it'—the condition—`would only improve if the cat's diet improved.' And as the cat was nearing the end of its life she had no intention whatsoever of being so unkind as to deprive it of its nightly bowl of ice-cream, which it liked. So I put up with the hair and the dandruff. 
On that night I gave her a key ring I had made in the shape of a shamrock for good luck. I am not in the habit of denigrating my own skills, but I do not think it is any secret that Hardy Brothers and Tiffany's have not been seeking my services as a jewellery designer or a silversmith. Sadly, that offer has not come my way. But it did not worry Dame Roma one bit that the shamrock was not as good as it otherwise might have been. In fact, it was not really very long ago—I cannot remember how many months—that something she said about the key ring occasioned me to really start to worry. She was joking with me that she had nearly lost it because she had left her keys in the letterbox and she only discovered this when a neighbour returned them to her. I thought at the time that that was an ominous sign.  
As a judge, she opened my first business premises for me when I was 23 or 24 and seemed embarrassed by the suggestion that she should choose a silk-screen or a lithograph from my stock to commemorate the occasion. As I recall, I thought a lithograph for a Supreme Court judge of a woman with birds' nests and birds coming out of her bosoms seemed a rather odd choice, but she seemed particularly happy with this item, and so I was happy. What does this story tell us? That she had an appreciation of far more than simply things legal. She was extremely good in the legal area but, because she was extremely good in that area, it is a mistake to look at just that.
Recently, she and I had gone to a few movies. I had been told by a member by my staff that there was a movie called Go that I should go to see. He rightly deduced that my experience was such to indicate I had not been to a rave movie. (Extension of time granted) The movie was about a rave ecstasy party, and my staff member had rightly deduced that I had not attended such a function and, as the Minister for Justice and Customs, I had thought it was inappropriate. So as I was not prepared to attend one, a movie would be second best. Roma initially declined to attend this but then, pursuing her change of heart, she rang my office to point out the date she was available, and off we went. It was a shocker! The volume was loud; it was disjointed; it was very druggie-odd. When my husband picked us up after the movie and asked what it was like, she said in that very nasally way, `I might go back and look at it again just so I can see your face, but I think we will go to dinner instead.' So off we went to dinner. I am sure she has dined out on that story, but the point is she endured the movie and said she enjoyed it. As I said, she was a real charmer.
Last but not least, I think I should mention the last meal I had with her which was when she was in hospital. She and I, one of her executors and another friend had a picnic—such as one can have in hospital—of oysters. I presented her with a present. It was not beautifully wrapped; it was in a David Jones bag actually. It was two pairs of bedsocks. The present was not diamonds, but it was practical and, as bedsocks go, quite elegant. I made the mistake of apologising that they were not washed. That in itself was not the mistake; it was adding that it was not as if it was a cup or a plate from which one could eat and catch a disease. She sat up to her full height and allowed me to enjoy one of the typical Roma remonstrations. She fixed me with her eye and said, `Don't you remember the Australian Knitting Mills case?' I think it was Grant and Australian Knitting Mills: some poor sucker bought some underwear that gave him eczema. With a sparkle in her eyes, I was so charged with being forgetful. I demanded a chance to wash the socks: `Give me another chance. I will take them back. I will wash them at home overnight.' She said, `No, you will go to Canberra and you won't bring them back. You will be called away and I won't get them.' So I said, `Give them to me now and I will wash them in your bathroom.' She replied, `No, they won't dry properly in the bathroom; they will not be ready for me tomorrow.' Behind the back they went, which is very authoritarian of someone terminally ill. It is hardly as if I was going to challenge her on this issue and rip the socks back. I had to leave her with the socks and my incapacity of not having remembered Grant and Australian Knitting Mills. I hope that if I am faced with a terminal illness with a short time frame—unlike the rest of us who, of course, have the terminal illness of life which starts from the day we are born—I have the presence to remind others and remonstrate, however playfully, with those who forget these sorts of details. 
I should add that the nursing staff at St Andrews ensured that Dame Roma had the care we all wanted her to have. We are grateful for that. Others, who were very close to her, looked after her and guarded her privacy in her last week or so, which is not easy with such a public figure and with so many people wanting to go and say whatever they want to say. They do not need to be named—they know who they are—because they, like Roma, are very private people. They however should not forget how grateful we all are for the job they did.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Dame Roma Mitchell</title>,Adjournment,23,1
