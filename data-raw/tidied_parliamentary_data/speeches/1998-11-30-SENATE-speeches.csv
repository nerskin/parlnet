"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—I wish to speak to this motion. I believe that it ought not go through without some debate. We are dealing with the cut-off motion in relation to the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Bill 1997 [1998] . While this bill was included in the list of legislation to be introduced during the spring sittings, the government did not indicate that it would be debated during these sittings. Consequently, my staff and the community groups and specialist advisers that we would normally consult on these issues are not prepared to debate the bill at this time.
While the bill was examined by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee, it was a fairly speedy process. Submissions were called for before Christmas last year, and the closing date was just after the New Year. Not surprisingly, only three submissions were received by the closing date and, consequently, there were no public hearings.
This is an important bill which establishes part of the framework for handling environmental issues in this country. It would be preferable if this bill could be delayed until the broader framework in the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 (No. 2)  was considered in the Senate. I will not be supporting this motion by the government.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-11-30,"—This objection by the Greens (WA) is 
 really quite remarkable. Bear in mind that it is only for what could be described as a technical reason that the cut-off clause comes into effect at all in this instance. The technical reason is that, as a result of the election and the standing orders of the House of Representatives, the bill has to be reintroduced into the House of Representatives before it comes here. The purpose of the cut-off provision was to enable senators to have adequate time to prepare themselves for debate so that there were no surprises.
This bill was introduced into this chamber on 21 October 1997. It then went before a committee of the Senate, which reported on 12 March 1998. It was given category T status by the government then, demonstrating its urgency. Unfortunately, it did not get to be debated because of other bills that were regarded as even more urgent—so be it. The opportunity was lost when the election was called.
The history of this bill goes back to 1992 when the previous Labor government agreed on a national system for coordinating environment protection in Australia. The concept is a good one. My only criticism of the Labor Party is that, although it set up the council to administer it—and the Commonwealth chairs it—it did not get around to holding any meetings. So the scheme was put in place but it did not achieve outcomes.
Under this government, we have got the process moving and we have introduced a number of measures through the cooperative state-Commonwealth arrangement which will provide for consistent environmental protection standards across the country. We have done it in relation to the national pollutant inventory. We have done it in relation to ambient air quality. And, as I recall, we have done it in relation to transfer of hazardous wastes across state boundaries. We are working on a number of others at the moment, including one in relation to packaging waste. It is a good concept. It was approved in 1992. The apparatus was basically set up, but to be implemented it required—apart from having a Commonwealth minister who was prepared to do the job—complementary state and Commonwealth legislation. Every state has 
 passed its legislation. It is the Commonwealth that is now holding back the capacity to enforce, at both state and Commonwealth levels, these consistent national environmental standards.
It is extraordinary that the Greens come in here, claiming the constituency that they do, and argue that it should be even further delayed. If it was introduced into this place on 21 October 1997, that should be enough time for even the Australian Greens. There is no reason to delay further debate and, hopefully, passage of this bill so that the Commonwealth can meet its responsibility to the states and put into effect national standards of environment protection, which has to be in the interests of all Australians.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-11-30,"—What a mess the minister has got himself into yet again. He says that he did not consider that this was an urgent piece of legislation before the election. He did not get it the priority before the election that he now says it has. He failed to get it in amongst the jostling for bills before the election, but suddenly it is the end of the year and he says that it is important. He goes back as far as 1992 to put his case.
He is an inconsistent, vacillating minister who cannot make up his mind. He indicated to the Senate just a few weeks ago that this bill would be coming on next year—at least his office did—and suddenly he thinks it is urgent. I suppose somebody has given him a kick in the rump somewhere along the line and said, `Hey, we want this through. It is a piece of environmental legislation and we want it to get up.'
The problem for the minister is that it is an ancillary piece of legislation, if you like, to his general push to divest himself, this government and the Commonwealth of their national environmental responsibilities. It is generally part of the push to move to the lowest common denominator as far as the environment is concerned, to say that the only things that this government is interested in are those things where it can achieve agreement with all the states and territories.
We ought to be taking the other tack. The real debate here, which is not going to be 
 entertained in this process, is how the government is going to implement its powers under the constitution to protect the environment of this nation. Pushing through under these circumstances this sort of change to the rules to allow this piece of legislation to get through under the covers before Christmas is not something I am going to entertain as well. The minister has made a hash of his program. He has not been able to get it in order. What was not urgent a month or so ago is suddenly very urgent now. He is totally inconsistent. He does not know what he is doing. It is because he does not have a shred of reputation as far as the environment is concerned. Coming in here this morning and saying suddenly that this is urgent, that he wants the rules of the Senate to be changed and that on this occasion he sees it only as a technicality is not good enough. The minister has got to do better than that, and I will be joining Senator Margetts in voting against this.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1998-11-30,"—The opposition does have considerable criticisms of the way in which the government has handled its legislative program. However, I do note that the minister outlined the time lines on this particular measure. My understanding is that this bill was introduced into the parliament on 21 October 1997. It was referred to the Standing Committee on the Selection of Bills on 19 November 1997 and the committee reported on 12 March 1998.
Nonetheless, there are considerable concerns about the way in which this bill has been developed. A number of interest groups and state governments have expressed significant concerns about the deficiencies and inconsistencies of the bill, in particular on the means by which the Commonwealth has sought to exempt the Commonwealth from the application of certain territory laws and on the particular measures of compliance.
There have also been concerns expressed about the degree to which this minister would be able to attract unfettered discretion in the consideration of environmental matters and at the way in which this bill seeks to concentrate on the enforcement mechanisms without necessarily seeking to ensure that there is actual compliance with environmental protec 
 tion measures. So there is a range of matters that the opposition has concerns about, and the way in which this bill has been structured is part of those concerns. We are concerned about questions of accountability and the degree to which transparency tests will apply to Commonwealth actions in this regard. However, we do not support the use of the cut-off motion in this regard for this particular bill, and therefore we will be supporting the exemption from the cut-off motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—I rise on behalf of the Democrats to echo some of the concerns and criticisms that have been put forward in response to the government's motion today. The Democrats do not support this bill being exempt. We have policy concerns about this bill, but we also seriously question some of the processes that have led up to the motion before us today. We certainly support the Greens in their comments before the chair.
	 Question put:
	 That the motion (Senator Ian Campbell's ) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—During the committee stage of the debate on the Space Activities Bill 1998  on Thursday I set out the reasons behind this amendment, namely, that we seek to include a safety as well as an accountability provision in the bill. It is in relation to the powers to grant a launch permit and the criteria that should be taken into account by the minister when making that particular grant. The Democrats consider the amendment before the chair to be a compromise amendment. It is adding a requirement that space objects should not contain radioactive or toxic materials if certain reporting arrangements or special considerations have not been satisfied.
So this amendment does not prevent the granting of a launch permit to someone who seeks to put these substances into space, even though the Democrats have said repeatedly now that we would prefer a blanket ban on such substances. We are saying that it is up to the minister but we would like to see certain accountability provisions in place, and 
 that is that the minister has to table a risk and a hazard assessment. We think that that is the least that can be asked under such serious circumstances.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—The government is not inclined to accept this amendment. We believe that it involves an excessive degree of regulation that is unnecessary. The Space Activities Bill 1998  clearly provides in 26(3)(e) that, in relation to a launch permit, the minister must be:
. . . satisfied that the probability of the launch or launches, or any connected return, causing substantial harm to public health or public safety or causing substantial damage to property is sufficiently low . . . 
The minister has to be satisfied of all those things before the permit can be granted. That clause will require the new Space Licensing and Safety Office to approve the payload and the launch vehicle fuel as part of the approval process for each launch. The launch permit will specify the nature of the payload.
I note that the fuels to be used in the launch vehicle will be part of the environmental impact statement process, which is the case with Kistler. We have difficulty with using the word `toxic' in relation to this, given the fact that the definition is so wide. `Toxic material' in the definition in the Democrats amendment is:
. . . any material which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death or harm to life forms.
What does `harm to life forms' mean? If an insect is harmed, is it toxic material when this thing is activated? It is incredibly wide in its scope. Kerosene and liquid oxygen, which are the main fuels, could, under this definition, come within it. That could mean that every single launch is caught up by this particular amendment.
We have, as other parties know, agreed to accept an opposition amendment providing that the space object:
. . . must not contain any fissionable material unless the Minister's written approval has first been obtained . . .  

That is an additional safety measure which we are prepared to accept. So on that basis we do not believe there is any basis for introducing this Democrats amendment.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—There are a number of issues in relation to safety in space and, of course, for launch procedures. We are finding that over time space is being seen to be, as the air and water are often seen to be, a commodity that can be used and abused to an endless extent. As we are going further into the satellite age, we are putting more and more satellites into the atmosphere. I believe there are something like 25,000 objects currently in orbit. I also believe that when there are explosions in the atmosphere a lot of those bodies can break up into something like 800 or so pieces.
Putting satellites into space is actually getting to be a relatively dangerous thing. This harks back to the original proposal by the Australian Democrats in relation to liability. We actually have to consider, on a case-by-case basis, the toxicity of what we are putting into space, and what the growing likelihood might be of a collision in space. We have to consider what the likelihood is of the items on board, which might be toxic, radio-toxic or otherwise, somehow either getting into the atmosphere or causing a collision which will affect other satellites or objects in space.
We have to have a cumulative risk assessment. You probably have to adjust this risk assessment, based on the nature of each launch and the area into which it is launched. There was an explosion within about 25 kilometres of the Hubble space platform, and in space terms that is not very far away.
Like everyone else, we are impressed by what can be done with technology but we, as Australians, ought to be taking some responsibility for the potential problems that exist with the technology. We should consider what our responsibilities might be. I think that the Democrats amendment is worthy of support. I am concerned and disappointed that the government is not prepared to support it.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—by leave—I move Democrats amendments (3) and (4):
(3)	 Clause 26, page 19 (line 6), omit ""of mass destruction"".
(4)	 Clause 29, page 20 (line 24), omit ""of mass destruction"".
These amendments relate to the clause which provides the criteria which must be satisfied for the grant of a launch permit. From the Democrats' perspective, as I have outlined, radioactive material should not be sent into space, either where the material heads off into deep space beyond the Earth's orbit or where it orbits the Earth. In the latter circumstance the orbit decay means that the material will return to Earth. For low orbits this can be a matter of days and for very high orbits this can be over a thousand years.
The Democrats are particularly concerned that space should not be used as a place of war and that weapons should be excluded from space, so these amendments remove the words `of mass destruction' from both clauses (26) and (29) to exclude all weaponry. Although these amendments will not stop all defence space objects, they should at least stop Australia's commercial use of space for weapons. This is where our concern lies with this bill in general. We are not addressing the Commonwealth's powers to involve itself in defence; we are concerned here only with the commercial use of space.
The Democrats do not think a launch permit should be granted to launch weaponry into space commercially. For example, a private sector company in the United States can deliver, through a launch into space, what is called an `exo-atmospheric kill vehicle'—or EKV—weapon. It says that in space the `the EKVs will separate from their boosters, immediately detect attacking missiles, distinguish real targets from decoys and destroy them by hit-to-kill intercepts'. These are part of United States government contracts. My concern would be that a private sector company should not be allowed to launch such devices.
Under the present legislation it is possible such devices might be granted a launch 
 permit. These amendments would prevent this. The government would need to rely on other powers to launch such devices. The increasing power of the private sector—and its capacity to resource undertakings in space—means this is a valid concern for many Australians. All we are asking is that the private sector not be allowed to launch weapons into space without government involvement. Where the private sector is involved in defence, that should be outside the scope of this bill.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—I believe that we should not be setting up a new frontier for conflict and weapons. According to Reuters Business Briefing  of 26 August this year, entitled `USA—new space race', the US Department of Defense, despite paying out hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade its own satellite capabilities, is still only able to pass one-third of the data required to meet projected demand. With plans to spend a further $7.8 billion on refurbishing and on leasing commercial satellite time over the next years, it is under pressure to make more use of commercial satellites and commercial launch facilities.
Is this why Australia's space industry is going to be relied on? Are we to be the United States military's low cost, offshore option? We believe the United States are our allies in many ways, but just how closely do we want to be integrated into the global military industrial network? Where has it gone in recent years? We have seen the Gulf War. Where now? In the aftermath of the Gulf War, we do not have the guts to stand up to America and say, `Enough is enough.' With regard to Iraq, where the Iraqi people are starving, we still have a situation where I believe, for commercial reasons in relation to oil, the United States are keeping up the blockade. It is not because of famine or drought or some other natural disaster but because of politics and the politics of a boycott.
The more we tie ourselves into this commercial military machine, which is building a multimillion dollar industry based on the needs of this military machine, the more difficult it will be for us to assert an independent position on issues like Iraq or on any 
 other issues for that matter. It is time for us in Australia to assert our real independence, to take a principled stand and to say no to war, no to the military uses of space and no to weapons of any kind in space. We are not talking about nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction but about all weapons. Who would we be shooting at in space?
This is an opportunity similar to the position taken by New Zealand in banning nuclear armed ships. It is a bit like that for us today. We could say that we are a small nation, one that could make a lot of money by joining in the war game. And, besides, someone else would do it if we did not. But we are prepared to give that up for a more important principle—the principle of space as a no-go area for weapons and space as a zone of peace.
The notion to take the ban on weapons one step further is one that recognises that we are not just part of the global military overkill—and I use that word advisedly—if we participate in a whole range of military activities in space, including targeting systems, command communications in the event of military strikes and military intelligence gathering. We do not necessarily want to stop Australian troops from using mobile phones or geopositioning technology, but there are other exemption conditions in this bill for defence and national security. It does not specify what it is to be used for.
Section 16 excludes the Commonwealth or a member of the Defence Force. We want to ban the use of Australia's commercial facilities for launches for other people's military purposes, such as spying by friendly nations, positioning of weapons and all other military uses. This again would send an important signal to the international community about Australia's determination to make space a weapons free zone and a zone of peace.
I urge the Senate to support this amendment. The amendments by the Greens (WA) seek to achieve the same end as those of the Democrats. Obviously we are fully supporting amendments which have a similar basis to our own. We do believe that we leave ourselves open to being involved in the commercial use of military technologies of quite unspecified 
 types as a result of the passing of this legislation.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—The opposition is not going to support amendments (3) and (4) moved by the Democrats or similar amendments moved by the Greens (WA) and Senator Margetts, Nos (2) and (5) on their sheet. There are a couple of things I want to raise. Nowhere can I see in these sheets from the Democrats or the Greens (WA) their definition of what a weapon is. If you had a monkey wrench in your hand inside a spaceship and you were going to belt someone with it, you would probably say that was a weapon. That might be a trite example—
—Yes.
—That is what I said. But legalistically if you are putting this in and the minister is giving a declaration, unless you put a definition of what a weapon is then the minister or whoever it may be in the future is always going to be hung out to dry over an argument of what a weapon is.
Both Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Margetts gave an extraordinarily broad interpretation of weapons. Senator Margetts even got down to satellites that are spying or collecting intelligence. These satellites are a part of the accepted verification systems that operate in the world today to ensure that we do not blow each other up. Senator Margetts spoke as though those satellites from all sides—not just the Americans but the Russians, the British, the Europeans and more to come—could be considered to be weapons if they were spying or carrying out surveillance or verification.
—But it's not covered in this bill. It should be done properly, through legislation.
—I believe that it has turned out in a pragmatic way over the evolution of the last few decades. Such intelligence gathering satellites have actually made the world a safer place. No matter what the leader of a country may have said, the leader of the other country that is potentially in conflict would know that what had been said could only be taken at face value, because they 
 would both know what they were really doing. Both sides would know in the end that they could not hide what they were doing. That made the world a safer place. Intelligence gathering satellites carried out the verification programs. To imply that these would be covered by the definition of weapons is of extreme concern. It is something I do not think we should embark upon in this particular bill. Our colleague, the shadow foreign affairs minister, would have a much bigger interest in this bill if that were the case in terms of the definition.
On the next area of weaponry I would have liked to have heard from Senator Stott Despoja in particular. Apart from nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, what are the other weapons that could be put on a satellite or in a space vehicle that would possibly be a threat? There may be some—I am not a technical person in this area—but I would like to have heard some examples of other weapons. I do not think having a revolver inside a space capsule is a great threat to Australia or to other citizens on the face of the earth, although it may be a threat to the other astronaut or cosmonaut inside the space station. I am not sure that you can operate many traditional and conventional weapons, machine guns and so on in existing satellites and with the technology we have at the moment. I may be wrong; I would be more than happy to hear some of that evidence.
As I said in the debate last week, this bill is our first attempt to regulate our involvement in space activities. I said the opposition does not see this as the ultimate end, as a perfect bill in any way, but experience will dictate to us what further amendments may be needed. Also, we have on the record, which I think is most important—and I raised this with the minister—that publicity given to any approval will be made public. He quite rightly said that he as a minister, and probably any other minister, to make political capital for the government of the day would be up there with drums beating saying that he had approved a rocket launch from Australia. I accept that completely.
If there is publicity and public debate about the approval, we are satisfied. If there is some 
 attempt to hide it we may have to come back and amend this bill to say, `Before the approval is given, you have to have a 30-day or two-month or whatever period when anybody can object and put evidence to the minister to say why he should reject the approval.' If it turns out that that is needed, let experience dictate it, but I do not want to tie it down at the moment. Though no-one wants to see development of weapons in space or space be turned into a new cold war or hot war field, I have to say I think the lack of definition, by both the Democrats and the Greens, means that on balance we certainly will not be supporting the amendment.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—I think Senator Schacht has very usefully and succinctly put the arguments against this amendment. Like Senator Schacht and the Greens and Democrats, the government has no interest in seeing space become a theatre of war; but this amendment simply goes too far. We have, in recognition of that sentiment, put in the two clauses (e) and (f) requirements for the minister to grant a launch permit: that he has to be satisfied that it is not going to cause substantial harm to the public health or public safety and that it does not contain a nuclear weapon or weapon of mass destruction of any other kind, which would include biological and chemical weapons. Just to say that if the object concerned contained a weapon then the minister must automatically deny the permit is ridiculous and unworkable, given, as Senator Schacht said, `What is a weapon?' 
I took the trouble of having my office look up just how weapon is defined. It includes, according to the Oxford Dictionary, `a thing designed or used or useable for inflicting bodily harm, e.g. a gun, rifle, sword, spear, stick, hammer, poker, horn or claw'. I could throw this glass at Senator Schacht and cause him considerable harm and that could be considered a weapon. I appreciate where the Greens and Democrats are coming from, but we believe 26(3)(e) and (f) cover all reasonable contingencies and will prevent any real weapons going into space, but does so in a way that is workable.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—I thank the minister and the opposition spokesperson for outlining their concerns with the amendment. I am glad to hear that neither of the old parties wants to see space as a war zone or see inappropriate weaponry launched in a space.
—We signed all the treaties.
—Thank you for mentioning treaties. I acknowledge schedule 3, which is entitled, `Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies,' and note that it says:
Recognizing the common interest of all mankind in the progress of the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes.
I hope we are all committed to that worthy objective. I state for the record one of the examples that I gave in my comments in relation to the amendment and weaponry was the EKV weapon, which is not, Senator Schacht, considered a weapon of mass destruction. So I did not provide simply an example of a weapon of mass destruction. Rather, it was the opposite.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—Greens (WA) amendments (2) and (5) are of the same nature as Democrats (3) and (4), so I will not be proceeding with my amendments. I seek leave to move Greens (WA) amendments (3), (4) and (6) together.
Leave granted.

(4)	 Clause 29, page 20 (lines 19 to 22), omit ""substantial"" (wherever occurring).
(6)	 Clause 29, page 20 (after line 24), after paragraph (b), insert: 

(ba)	 the space object or objects must not be used for any military purpose;
We are talking here about the standard conditions of launch. What we are hoping to do with these amendments is set up the standard launch conditions. It is important in determining the culture of the industry. We want to delete `except to the extent that the permit otherwise specifies'. There is no way a permit should ever specify that a launch or return can be conducted in a way that is likely to cause substantial harm. No exception should ever be allowed to the rule banning nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction, and no exception should be allowed on insurance issues either. We were concerned at the standard expression represented by the words `must not be conducted in a way that is likely to cause substantial harm'. Surely it is so obvious as not to be worth saying `if it is likely to cause substantial harm'. I certainly hope not.
It is the word `likely' that leads to the concern. What does it mean? Does it mean `more likely than not'? That is just not sufficient protection from substantial harm. We tried to address this by a form of words similar to those used elsewhere in the bill which refer to the probability of substantial harm being sufficiently low. We were advised of problems with this and instead tried to achieve the same aim of encouraging a culture of safety in this industry by deleting the word `substantial'. With our amendment, it will read: `the launch or launches, and any connected return, must not be conducted in a way that is likely to cause harm to public health or public safety or to cause damage to property'. I urge support from the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—Senator Margetts has now moved 3, 4 and 6 together, but I think she has spoken only to amendment 3. Senator Margetts, are you going to move them separately or will they be moved as a lot, because I want to speak on another one?
—Leave was sought that they would be taken together. Senator Margetts was granted leave and we are now proceeding down that path.
—I would like to raise some points in addition to the issues Senator Margetts has raised. We do not support the amendments to clause 29 moved by the Greens. We believe that the first amendment, where she is deleting `except to the extent that the permit otherwise specifies', is a standard technical arrangement made in many regulations. Of course, the minister, if he were to use that clause, would have to publicise the fact and it would become a matter of public debate if he tried to rort it or overwhelmingly use it to get around other matters contained in the legislation, but you cannot be totally prescriptive in all the regulations you draw up in a piece of legislation. We believe that it is unnecessary and is not conducive to the good workings of the regime to remove that clause—to remove that ability of the government. Again, the proof will be in the eating of the pudding and, if it were rorted, the people and the parliament would expect it to be amended.
I would like to hear what the minister has to say about Senator Margetts's amendment to clause 29, which deletes the word `substantial'. I believe that if you remove `substantial' then you have to provide a definition of what is `harm'. Someone could claim that when the rocket went off and lit up Tarcoola in the middle of night, they lost their sleep and suffered some harm, but I am not sure that that is real harm if the people of Tarcoola, which is a fair way still from Woomera launch site, were given fair warning that the launch would be taking place. If you remove the word `substantial', some people could get litigious about a few things, and you could find anything related to the launch could cause harm to somebody somewhere and make it very difficult for the launch to take place.
The final amendment is to insert after (b) a new clause:
(ba)	 the space object or objects must not be used for any military purpose;
I turn to the verification role of satellites. Satellites, which all sides use, could be claimed to be for a military purpose, yet they have been very successful in ensuring that for the last 50 years we have not had a nuclear 
 war in the world. They have also been used extensively at a conventional level for monitoring of military activity in Bosnia, which has helped the NATO forces try to conclude peace or a cease-fire. It has been published that the Americans used their satellites to identify the mass graves where war crimes had been committed in Bosnia. I suspect that it is a military satellite that provided that information, but it is also information that hopefully may lead one day to the people who perpetrated that awful atrocity—that massacre—being brought to justice and suffering the penalty accordingly. So to say that you cannot use—
—That is not what we said.
—Your amendment says `must not be used for any military purpose'. What is the definition of `military purpose'? I can understand the Greens and the Democrats moving these amendments in the general principle that no-one has any argument at all with, but if someone vexatiously were to use this amendment, if it were carried and adopted, this regulatory regime would be hung out to dry again and again in the courts as people argued, often for malevolent reasons—for negative reasons—to stop any launch ever taking place, and I do not think that that is what the Australian people want and I do not think it is what the parliament wants.
I think the Australian people would be happy to have a modest space program operating in Australia with reasonable and proper regulation but not regulation designed to stop it happening at all. Until I can get a better definition of `military purpose'—and it is not provided in the amendment—the opposition will oppose these amendments.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—It was a very nice speech from Senator Schacht, except that he did not get very good advice. He did not look at where it is in the bill. It is under `standard launch permit conditions', and all that it is asking is that that be part of the permits so that those issues—that the space object or objects be used for any military purpose—be written in the permit conditions and so the reality is that 
 it has some oversight. Senator Schacht has been representing this part of the chamber to a certain extent as space Luddites and in this particular instance unfortunately did not look at the context in which the amendment was placed. The bill says:
The following are conditions of each launch permit (called standard launch permit conditions), except to the extent that the permit otherwise specifies.
Basically, all it says is that, if it is to be used for military purposes, that should be part of the permit. Then at least when we are looking at what a satellite is going to be used for, we will have an idea what Australia's liability is, what we are going to be involved in, what we can reasonably say is covered and what is reasonably regulated. If there is a possibility that certain satellites will be used or leased for military purposes, I do not think it is unreasonable that that should be part of the permit conditions.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—The Democrats support the Greens (WA) amendments and also the comments made by Senator Margetts. She has pointed out the error of Senator Schacht's ways—there are too many to go into, I know. In this particular circumstance, no-one was doubting the potential and maybe beneficial—
—You have been watching The Empire Strikes Back  too much, Princess Leia!
—If Senator Schacht wants Star Wars  jokes, we can go right ahead.
—That is a compliment.
—It's okay; I'll take Princess Leia.
—Address your comments through the chair, Senator Stott Despoja.
—As Senator Margetts pointed out, Senator Schacht missed the point. No-one was doubting the potential and maybe beneficial aspects of some of the military equipment or devices to which he was referring. No-one was denying a modest space program. No-one was stopping such an 
 enterprise. Senator Margetts pointed out that it was just making sure that this was specified in the clause that deals with standard launch and permit conditions.
I also wish to refer to Senator Schacht's comments regarding definitions and his continual concern and claim that the words in the amendments being put forward are not clearly or appropriately defined for the benefit of this bill. I found it interesting to listen to Senator Schacht refer to `substantial' as if that were somehow more real in relation to harm. I apologise if, at any stage, I misrepresent him. He was talking about how to define harm. `Harm' can be so open ended and difficult to define, but I am wondering what makes `substantial harm' any easier to define. According to the dictionary definition, `substantial' can be both real or actual. So the implication of some of Senator Schacht's comments is, if it is substantial harm, that it is real; it is not just peripheral.
On the general issue of definitions, I think `harm' is just as easy or hard to define as is `substantial harm'. As we have outlined, our concern is that, if any harm results or eventuates as a consequence of the launch or certain materials, this section, in particular, does not seek to prevent such launches. It is just specifying the conditions under which a permit will be granted.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—I do not want to be seen to be provoked by my good colleagues from the Greens and the Democrats, but I have to say to Senator Margetts that when she responded to the point I made, she proved my point. Yes, this is a condition that you are putting there for any military purposes. If the minister provides a permit—and this is in there—someone could be vexatious or just difficult and say, `You have a screwdriver, you have a wrench inside it, or you have some other thing that could be considered a weapon,' or `We don't trust what you have done,' et cetera. The definition is so broad that anybody with a reasonable lawyer will start saying that they are going to try to stop it.
In the commercial world of space launches, the competition is red hot between the various consortiums. If the Kistler Corporation decid 
 ed to use Australia—from which we would get some social and economic benefits, jobs, et cetera—and the French were launching from Guyana, it would not be beyond the French, on my knowledge of some of these matters, to have a lawyer turn up in Australia and use your amendments to delay and make it commercially more difficult for Kistler or anybody else to launch rockets with satellites that may be in competition with the French. That is just the way the commercial world is.
I do not think that is your intent, but until you get your definitions much more firmly written out and defined, that will be the way this will be applied. We will suffer commercially. Our opponents will use the opportunity to say, `We don't have any of these restrictions, but your definitions, as proposed by the Greens and the Democrats, will restrict our space activity and make us less commercially competitive.' I do not think that is the intent which, overwhelmingly, Australians want.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—I am horrified at the concept that this is a race to the bottom to be as competitive as possible to attract space launches.
—Whenever you try to use a commercial argument with the Greens, it goes down like a lead balloon.
—Maybe Senator Boswell would like to take the floor.
—Order! Senator Margetts has the call.
—I do not know whether too many members of the opposition have studied for higher degrees in economics, but I have. It has been an ongoing interest of mine to see benefits for the community and not wide-scale community subsidies. If we have a race to the bottom for liability, which we have talked about already, or a race to the bottom for standards, let us not put these companies off because of the commercial implications. We saw another situation on the TV on the weekend, another seabird island—I do not know whether you heard it; ironic, wasn't it—in another part of the world; and I have even forgotten what part of the world it was. There were terns, other endangered species, breeding colonies of seabirds, and so 
 on. Also, the same arguments were being used against the communities who were concerned about this particular ecosystem. `If we don't do it, other people will and we've got to have the money.' In the end, we are going to use this commercial argument against any reasonable control and regulation.
We have talked about weapons, and that amendment on weaponry has gone down already, but the situation exists that a satellite or satellite system could be, and is, used as part of weapons systems. They are not weapons themselves, but they could have a military use. Australia may not be engaged in Star Wars per se, but another commercial operation engaged in some future version of Star Wars may use the satellite system as a means of space war of some sort. I would like to think that this parliament has enough responsibility for Australia not to be dragged in by its own legislation with no means of refusing these kinds of situations. It is ridiculous.
I do not think we should get into a situation of a race to the bottom to attract space technology. We should be taking our duty of care seriously here. That means that, if there is a necessity to use satellites for military purposes, (a) the  minister is advised of it—I think that is reasonable—and (b) it is written into the basis upon which that satellite can or cannot be used. If it is felt that there is a necessity in the public interest to change that at any stage, there should be an ability to change that. It does not need legislation for the minister to change the nature of that permit, so it is not immutable.
The issue is that the public—the Australian public or any other public—should be protected. There should be a reasonable duty of care so that the Australian legislation does not see us dragged into something that we should not be involved in simply because our legislation will not allow us to take action at some later stage.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—Senator Margetts has talked about the reasonableness of this amendment, but I have a query for the minister. I am wondering if military purposes 
 should be included in a framework regime for commercial operations in space. Is it appropriate that, if it is for a military purpose, it be done under different or other powers? Is that appropriate?",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—In general terms, it does distress me to see parties on the left arguing so vociferously about government legislation. But in this case—again, for the reasons so well put by Senator Schacht—we are opposed to these amendments, particularly in relation to military purposes, for the reasons set out by Senator Schacht. To say that the condition applies to every launch permit that it cannot be issued if there is any possibility of it being used for any military purpose would mean huge definitional problems.
I do not know, but the Australian Defence Force may well, for the defence of Australia—which I would have thought we are all interested in—and for national security reasons want to use a commercial launch to put up a defensive satellite of some kind. It may be the military that actually commissions the launch for purposes that relate to the security of every single one of us and for the defence of Australia. To put this clause in means that could never ever occur—that would be completely and utterly prohibited. So there is a question there about national security. There is also the verification issue that I think Senator Schacht very sensibly raised. There are a whole lot of reasons this clause would be a ridiculous limitation on the regime.
As we have said before, the minister can only grant the permit if he is satisfied that there is no risk of substantial harm to public safety and it does not contain weapons of mass destruction. We think there are enough protections in the system as it is. If it appears that a problem is emerging, there may well, as Senator Schacht has said, be a need for the parliament to reconsider the regime. But we see no purpose in these amendments, particularly that amendment in relation to `any military purpose'. It may be that anything relating to communication satellites, global positioning systems and things like that would get caught up in that and severely hinder the 
 development of the space industry in this country for no purpose, particularly given, as I say, there are adequate safeguards already in the legislation to ward against any reasonable risks associated with the emergence of a space industry.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—Just a month ago—that is, at the end of October—a draft United Nations resolution on international cooperation and the peaceful uses of outer space was approved by the United Nations Fourth Committee. We should note, particularly in light of my comments in my speech in the debate at the second reading stage, that the Fourth Committee, that is, the one responsible for space cooperation, is the Special Political and Decolonisation Committee.
The text of the draft resolution approved by the committee requires the General Assembly to urge all states, particularly those with major space capabilities, to contribute actively to the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space as an essential condition for the promotion of international cooperation in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes.
Given that the minister has argued on commercial considerations, I wonder how the government is planning to abide by this United Nations resolution, or is the government ignoring on a blanket basis United Nations resolutions of late that they cannot control?
Amendments not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—I understand the government is sympathetic to opposition amendment (2) on sheet 1178. The amendment takes into account, quite rightly, some of the general concern about fissionable material. The amendment states, as one of the conditions, that the space object or objects must not contain any fissionable material unless the minister's written approval has first been obtained. If the minister approves fissionable material being in a satellite or in a rocket and it is publicised, then I am sure there will be a pretty robust debate in the Australian community about why fissionable material would be allowed in a particular launch or in 
 a satellite as part of that launch. Any minister worth their salt, who wants to be around for a while, will not take such a sensitive issue as fissionable material lightly unless they have very strong and justifiable grounds for doing so. We think, at this stage of developing our space regulatory regime, that this is the appropriate level needed. Again, we will see how it develops. But I think this is a balance between unnecessary regulation and knowing that the minister of the day has to accept the responsibility to argue the case why fissionable material should be allowed in a space launch. I move:
(2)	 Clause 29, page 20 (after line 24), after paragraph (b), insert:
(ba)	 the space object or objects must not contain any fissionable material unless the Minister's written approval has first been obtained;",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—The Democrats believe that this amendment is an improvement on the existing provision, although we do not believe, of course, that it goes far enough—because it refers only to fissionable material; it does not refer to all radioactive material. I wonder if Senator Schacht would clarify the position of the opposition on this question: I am assuming the ALP supports nuclear material in space which is not fissionable?",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—You said nuclear—
—Non-fissionable.
—We accept the fact that in some areas of technology, for quite peaceful purposes, there may well be a case for the energy source within a satellite, for a long deep space probe, to be powered by nuclear material—fissionable material. That would be an example. There may even be a case to say a small nuclear reactor. I have to say I would have considerable concerns about the safety aspects of launching a nuclear reactor on top of a rocket, but the Russians have done that in the past, as I understand it, and have created some problems in doing so.
Again, we believe that the minister would have to approve such an activity from areas 
 within Australia. I also point out that over many years Labor in government and in opposition have always supported the signing of the appropriate international space treaties proposed by the United Nations. We think that is the appropriate body to draw up the international regulatory regime dealing with such issues, not only of nuclear weapons in space, but the safety regime and the issue of fissionable material. As I understand it, those treaties do not ban fissionable material being used in space launches and space satellites. They have been used, apparently quite safely, over the recent past. But, until you give me a specific example, we believe the particular international regime is satisfactory.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—I thank Senator Schacht for that answer and I note that you did say that there may even be cases for, say, a small nuclear reactor—so you would consider there are some examples where fissionable material might be appropriate. In relation to non-fissionable material, would you have any concerns if that kind of material was to come from Jabiluka?",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—The Labor Party policy is quite clear on the extension of the existing uranium mine at Jabiluka. If the contracts are signed and in place when we get back into government, we will not break the contracts so long as—and we make this clear—all of that uranium is sold, exported or treated, in accordance with the policy we have laid down about the safe use of such material. We certainly clearly prohibit any of it being used in any nuclear weapons anywhere. That has been our policy for over 30 years.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—Perhaps the minister or Senator Schacht—who is acting as the minister in a few of these discussions—
—I have got to shut up and give it back to the minister.
—and who is defending the indefensible on behalf of the opposition—could explain the difference. 	 Nuclear reactors on land are subject to very specific conditions—I won't say adequate condi 
 tions—in relation to encasement in lead and concrete and so on. We are told that nuclear reactors on board ships are subject to different conditions. Because ships have to be lighter, it would be too difficult to have a nuclear reactor on board with the same level of safeguards—encasement and so on—as would be the case with a land-based reactor. Then of course, we have nuclear reactors which, the indications are, the opposition would be prepared to hurl into space under Australian commercial conditions, providing the minister gives a tick—and I have never seen the coalition mention too many problems about nuclear reactors so far.
However, I just wonder what the actual safeguards are on board a spacecraft or a satellite? Could the minister let us know what the current situation is with the retired Russian powered rorsats which, according to the US `Haystack' long-range imaging radar, are leaking liquid metal coolants at the rate of some 70,000 droplets every 90,000 to 100,000 kilometres?",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—In response to that, as Senator Schacht indicated, we are happy to accept this amendment. It is probably not absolutely necessary but we think it is reasonable. Again, with regard to safeguards, I come back to the requirements in 26(3)(e) and (f) in relation to public safety and weapons. A permit cannot be granted unless those conditions are satisfied—unless the minister, whoever that may be, is satisfied of those requirements. So we have built in those safeguards. We believe they are adequate and appropriate—there is no evidence they will not be. If we are all wrong and that proves to be the case, of course parliament can amend the bill in due course. We think that with those measures and this additional measure these are reasonable, sensible and appropriate safeguards against the circumstances to which the Greens and Democrats point.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—The minister says, `If we are all wrong'—and of course we would all like to hope we are not wrong—but it once again highlights the reasons why both the Greens 
 and the Democrats were specific about the need for liability. We know that there have been problems in relation to nuclear reactors on land. We know that there are leaking monstrosities of nuclear reactors from the former Soviet Union. We know there are nuclear reactors leaking under the sea. We also know—as I have just given the example, and the minister did not bother to reply to that—that there are nuclear reactors leaking in space. Considering the Christmas Island example is actually using Russian space technology, if we are ticking off the potential for hurtling nuclear reactors into space, I wonder whether the Australian government is so confident with the technology that we are actually prepared to provide full liability. The answer from the earlier debate was no. So if we cannot provide that full liability, then we should not be sending enough fissionable material into space to form an independent explosion if something else happened to it. We should not be sending it into space with or without a minister's approval.
—The question is that opposition amendment (2) on sheet 1178 be agreed to.
Amendment agreed to.
Amendments  (by Senator Schacht)—by leave—agreed to:
(3)	 Clause 44, page 29 (after line 31), after paragraph (b), insert:

(5)	 Clause 108, page 66 (after line 30), after paragraph (b), insert:
(ba)	 the space object contains any fissionable material and the Minister's written approval for this has not first been obtained; or",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—I propose to move Democrat amendment 5 on behalf of the Democrats. This amendment proposes a mechanism for reporting to the parliament where an exemption certificate has been granted according to sections 11, 13 or 15—that is, for return certificates and licences for 
 launch facilities. I would not expect that there would be a huge number of these licences and certificates and, because the safety issues involved in launching and operating space vehicles are significant, it is reasonable to require reporting to parliament. Further, the possibility that the requirements for certificates and licences might be exempted suggests that increased parliamentary scrutiny is required.
The safety issues here are central to this amendment, but I am also concerned that the opportunities for development and jobs may encourage the government of the day to be tempted to take some shortcuts. So I asked the minister—and I acknowledge once again the excellent assistance I have had from him, particularly his office and the department—in what circumstances the minister might issue exemption certificates. In the response the minister suggested that the circumstances were those where the risk to public health and safety were minimal and the launch was in the national interest or conferred a significant public benefit. This might include the acquisition of valuable scientific or meteorological data. The minister also suggested that a launch of an experimental project by an educational institution was another circumstance. This amendment would meet my concerns and would be unlikely to impede in any way the operations of the bill.
I seek clarification through you, Mr Chairman. I understand that the government is prepared to support this amendment if I remove subclauses (4) to (6). I am happy to do this because the purpose of the Democrat amendment is to have a reporting requirement. I seek clarification from the minister before moving the amendment or amending the amendment.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—When I read this amendment, subclause (3) of amendment (5) seemed to me to have some attraction, because it requires tabling the exemption notice in the parliament. When I read (4), (5) and (6), I dropped off, because this should not be made a disallowable instrument. There would be mayhem arguing commercially over a disallowable instrument. You would never get any 
 launches at all if somebody said, `Oh, by the way, you could be hung to dry for 15 days while someone thinks of moving for a debate before allowing your exemption', even though these are special cases. So (3) by itself, which is just the notice given and tabled in the parliament, is not unreasonable. If the Democrats drop off (4), (5) and (6), we would think that (3) by itself is a reasonable outcome.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—There seems to be at least near unanimity. We are prepared to accept clause (3). It is probably not necessary, but we have nothing to hide and I do not see any reason why an exemption certificate should not be tabled. I think, as one of the participants said, it would be a rare occasion that an exemption was granted. In those circumstances there is no objection to it being tabled. But, as Senator Schacht has said, to then subject it to the possibility of disallowance would cause havoc.
An example that has been drawn to my attention where a government or a minister may wish to grant an exemption may be where the Commonwealth itself wishes to waive the insurance requirements and carry the liability itself for a launch that was seen as being in the national interest. Under the current conventions, in the absence of this law, all the liability does fall on the Commonwealth. Part of the purpose of this bill is to share the liability, but there may be occasions when the Commonwealth believes it is appropriate to take on the liability. Or there could be emergency situations—for example, if for any particular reason the space shuttle had to be brought down in Australia and immediate action was required to ensure that that could occur under this regime.
—Landing at Adelaide airport.
—Exactly; it is now long enough to take the space shuttle. I am sure it would be a matter of considerable public notice in any event and, for that reason, given that it is not going to be a secret, we have no difficulty with clause (3). But we would appreciate it if the Democrats were 
 prepared to consider dropping clauses (4) to (6).",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—The Greens (WA) are happy to support the Democrats' amendment No. 5. I am a little concerned that if there were to be an exemption that would waive insurance requirements, as the minister has suggested, that would appear to be something that does not necessarily need to be an emergency issue. It is not that he said it needed to be, but it seems to me that if there is going to be the potential for public money to be spent it ought to have the scrutiny of parliament, otherwise we might end up with something at a Senate estimates committee for which there is no actual announcement ahead of time—the money is spent and then basically we have no say in it because it has already happened.
Some of these insurance requirements may involve a lot more than the government thinks. We believe the risks may be wider than what the government has admitted may exist. I am not sure that the government saying it has not put in a liability for other issues will, in the final analysis, protect it from further liabilities. I think I would be concerned if we had exemptions on insurance requirements simply to make a launch more commercially viable, because that means the taxpayers of Australia will be put up to a commercial risk which in other circumstances would not be considered acceptable.
I can see that there might be issues in relation to some emergencies, but I also see that we need to have an open process in relation to exemptions. Minister, apart from the issues you have mentioned: insurance, emergencies for getting Skylab down—everyone seems to look at the so-called deserts of Australia as a suitable place; sometimes it is for radioactive waste and at other times it is for other objectionable activities—could you give a brief outline as to what kinds of activities might be subject to this kind of exemption?",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—Again, I think we are allowing some flexibility in this new regime on space regulation to ensure there is some flexibility 
 for the government. I outlined to you two instances where it may be that the minister of the day wishes to grant an exemption to what are otherwise binding requirements. I gather my office has talked with the Democrats about other instances; I do not have any others off the top of my head. We can get further research on that if you like, but it is really just to ensure that there is a mechanism by which, if circumstances arise that dictate the need for an exemption, that can occur. We think it appropriate; the minister is still bearing a considerable burden of responsibility and, in so doing, I would not have thought it would be done lightly at all. But we think it is important in developing this regulatory framework that there be some flexibility to allow for unexpected circumstances to arise where an exemption may be required.
—Senator Stott Despoja, you should move amendment No. 5 (3) and not proceed with the others. We do not have a record of you moving that amendment at this stage.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

(3)	 Within 7 sitting days of issuing an exemption certificate under this section, the Minister must cause a copy of the exemption certificate to be tabled in each House of the Parliament.
Amendment agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—I move Australian Democrats amendment (6):
(6)	 Clause 48, page 33 (after line 24), at the end of the clause, add:
(4)	 As soon as practicable after the end of each financial year, the Minister must cause a report to be prepared, setting out details of insurance cover for each launch conducted during that financial year.
(5)	 The Minister must cause a copy of the report mentioned in subsection (4) to be tabled in each House of the Parliament before the expiration of 6 months after the 
 end of the financial year to which the report relates.
Amendment No. 6 is in relation to insurance requirements. The provision we are seeking to amend sets out the insurance requirements for launches and returns. This amendment merely adds to the existing provision a reporting requirement of the amount of insurance. We believe that this is a necessary addition for the purposes of accountability. The mechanisms for determining the amount of a maximum probable loss are presently quite vague because the method of this calculation is to be set out in regulations.
Of course, we have yet to see the regulations, and we have no clear guidance on how this figure would be achieved. I am particularly concerned that this insurance sum should be adequate and the means of ensuring this is to include a reporting requirement. Like many of the amendments that the Democrats have moved to the bill so far, this is to seek a reporting requirement and some degree of accountability in this bill.
I am also happy to say something about leaving out key elements of legislation to be set down later in regulations. We have seen that this is an increasing practice in the Senate. We are told not to worry, that we will have an opportunity to deal with the regulations and the issues when we see the regulations, or that it will all be sorted in the regulations. The Democrats, and I suggest others in this place, do not particularly regard that as appropriate. Legislation before the Senate is here to be considered as a whole. We are debating a particularly complex package, and this includes essential elements which have to be sorted out in the regulations. We have seen the same response to other legislation, such as the fees structures in the Australia New Zealand Food Authority amendment bills, to name just one glaring example.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1998-11-30,"—I have some further information in answer to a question from Senator Harradine 
 on intercountry adoptions with China, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The information read as follows—
INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION AGREEMENT WITH CHINA

Senator Hill : On 24 November 1998 Senator Harradine asked whether I, as Minister Representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, was aware that the Department of Human Services in Victoria had quoted an estimated cost of $A17000 for adopting a child under the proposed intercountry adoption agreement with China. This cost purportedly includes approximately $A8000 for immigration fees and court costs Senator Harradine asked whether these costs are prohibitive.
RESPONSE:
.	 The Victorian Department of Human Services advises the estimated cost of adopting a child from China under the agreement will be approximately $A16000. (This may vary according to exchange rate fluctuations.)
.	 The cost may vary according to the individual circumstances of a particular case, but may generally be broken down as follows:
-	 application fee for assessment of prospective adoptive parents by Australian state/territory child welfare authorities—approximately $A5500 (may vary from state to state)
-	 administrative costs in China—approximately $A6000
-	 certification of documents by the PRC embassy in Australia- currently being negotiated with the embassy
-	 cost of travel to PRC by the adoptive parents to collect the child and finalise the adoption approximately $A4000
-	 visa application charge—$A1060
-	 migration health check—approximately $A150 (dependent on the child's health status)
.	 as a comparison, an American couple resident in the USA and adopting a child from China would expect to pay costs ranging from approximately $A23000 to 32000

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1998-11-30,"—by leave—These two notices I have given relate to two reports of the Committee of Privileges which were tabled in the last parliament. The Senate did not have the opportunity to deal with the reports before the election was called. The committee's reasons for making the recommendations and findings in both reports are included in my tabling statement on 30 June 1998, see Hansard  pages 4436-38.
Senator Brown to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
(a)	 notes, with approval, the recommendations of the World Heritage Committee high level mission to the Kakadu World Heritage Area; and
(b)	 urges the World Heritage Committee to list the Kakadu World Heritage Area without delay as `in danger' from the Jabiluka uranium mine.
Senator Chapman to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
(a)	 strongly condemns the recent grave attacks on the Iranian Baha'i community, including the brutal execution of Mr Ruhallah Rawhani in July 1998 in the absence of due legal process, raids on 500 Baha'i homes in an orchestrated nation-wide attempt to prevent Baha'i youth from receiving an education, confirmation of death sentences against two Baha'i men and the imprisonment of 16 other Baha'is for practising their faith;
(b)	 calls on the Government of Iran to end its oppression of the Baha'i community, ensure the safety and early release of all those Baha'is imprisoned in Iran, immediately take steps to implement United Nations resolutions defining steps required of the Iranian Government and calling for the emancipation of the Baha'is, and respect the principles of the International Covenants on Human Rights to which Iran is a party; and 

(c)	 expresses its deep disappointment that, despite the consideration of this matter by both Houses of the Australian Parliament in 1997, the Iranian Government, far from taking action to remedy the situation, has intensified its persecution of Baha'is.
Senator Allison to move, on the next day of sitting:
That the Senate—
(a)	 notes that:
	 (i)	 Monday, 30 November 1998, is Ocean Care Day,
	 (ii)	 on Sunday, 29 November 1998, more than one thousand people attended a protest rally at the Gunnamatta beach on the Mornington Peninsula to draw attention to the 500 000 litres of partly-treated sewage which is discharged there every day,
	 (iii)	 in the 22 years since the ocean outfall was constructed, there has been a massive deterioration of the marine life for some kilometres along the adjacent coast,
	 (iv)	 heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, Mercury and arsenic, organic toxicants such as dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorinated hydrocarbons, petroleum and nutrients such as phosphates and nitrogen are contained in effluent discharged,
	 (v)	 industries holding licences to discharge toxic waste are self-regulating and the Environmental Protection Authority does not have the resources to check the concentrations data supplied by industry, and
	 (vi)	 more than 60 per cent of Australia's sewage is still discharged to sea; and
(b)	 urges the Government to adopt and fund national measures through its Coasts and Clean Seas Program which would:
	 (i)	 remove toxic industrial waste material from the sewage stream, and
	 (ii)	 phase out completely the discharge of effluent to the marine environment.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,5,1

"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1998-11-30,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 19th ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation Conference held between 24 and 28 August inclusively in Kuala Lumpur. ASEAN, as senators would know, is an organisation with great potential to foster economic and political development in the South-East Asian region and it would be of greater benefit to those nations if indeed Australia was part of that organisation. It was my first trip overseas to attend any conference, and I was pleased that it was to attend the Inter-Parliamentary Organisation Conference in Kuala Lumpur.
This meeting was of major benefit to me because of its potential, particularly, for those nations which have suffered in the Asian meltdown—Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and others that are caught up in the recession. It also was of great interest that I was able to meet during the conference with both a group of businessmen from Malaysia and, later, an expanded group of people from the eight or so countries that form ASEAN. Just why Australia should not be a member of the organisation and, say, Burma—or Myanmar— 
should is a question that ought to be directed to some of the senior members of ASEAN. I think that the organisation would be much better served if the economic powerhouse of the region—that is, Australia—was a full member, and I look forward to the day that that happens.
I also had a valuable meeting with the Indonesian delegation. They have delegated a minister to handle applications for investment in Indonesia and that vast archipelago. Of particular concern—seeing that Australia now spends most of its mining exploration dollars outside of Australia—was the effect that that may have on the mining industry in Australia. I have contacted the umbrella organisations in Australia and alerted them to that fact. I have also exchanged correspondence and telephone calls with the minister in Indonesia responsible for that. It is an indictment of the land tenure in Australia, as it exists at the moment, that exploration dollars are spent outside of the nation.
I also had meetings with the businessmen of Kuala Lumpur and with others that comprised most of the nations that attended AIPO. I was pleased to be able to reconfirm Australia's commitment to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, particularly in light of the fact that India and Pakistan had recently exploded several nuclear devices within their respective boundaries.
By entering into a dialogue, and through the free exchange of information and ideas, our region will obviously be richer, but it will only be richer when Australia is able to take up a full and equitable membership of ASEAN. I think for this reason it is essential that Australia reaffirm its involvement and commitment to the region, even if we can only have observer status while we are at the conference. Notwithstanding all that, I think that the important role that forums such as the AIPO conference serve in this endeavour cannot be understated.
I will finish by making the point of expressing my sincere gratitude to those staff who made it possible, in particular staff at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Parliamentary Liaison Office, the Parlia 
 mentary Library and all our outposts in Kuala Lumpur and Port Moresby.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>19th ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation Conference, Kuala Lumpur</title>",Delegation Reports,22,1
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1998-11-30,"—by leave—I was also a member of this particular delegation that went to the AIPO conference in Kuala Lumpur, and I think a number of issues need to be raised. Firstly, I think it is appropriate to thank those staff members from the Parliamentary Liaison Office who organised the delegation and managed to achieve a number of very difficult tasks, including the organisation of the next leg of the delegation, a bilateral visit to Papua New Guinea which was terminated on the day that the election was called which just happened to be the day that we arrived. No doubt that delegation will take place in the near future—I am not sure what the arrangement will be.
I thank those members of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who came down here to brief the various members of the delegation. I thank the High Commissioner and his staff in KL for their assistance to the delegation and for also hosting a very important meeting there with Australian trade and business representatives. I found it particularly useful. It provided me with a great deal of information about what was going on in Malaysia at that time, and it gave me a pretty good insight into the economy of Malaysia.
I have had a look at this report. The only real deficiency—and I guess I should have picked this out somewhat earlier—is that, if I were an observer reading this report, I would want to know if our representatives actually said anything about East Timor. One of our delegates—I think it might have been Mr Nugent—made the comment to the Indonesian delegates that East Timor was the cancer—I think was the word he used in the meeting we had with them—that was causing all sorts of problems with the relationship between Australia and Indonesia. In fact, I can confirm that our delegates and the Indonesian delegates had a fairly frank and open discussion about the problems associated with East Timor. I made the point myself that we were the only country, I believe, in the world that had recognised the inclusion of East Timor into the Indonesian republic and, as 
 such, we had a special interest in ensuring that, at least where East Timor is concerned, some of the problems which have emerged, particularly the recent movements there, are allowed to continue so that in fact we can see a lasting peace in that part of the world.
When I look through the report, I do not see a lot of talk of East Timor. That is something which I should have drawn to the attention of staff earlier in the piece because I think it would be wrong for anybody reading this report to come away with the conclusion that we had not addressed East Timor. In fact, we had. I would suggest it was one of the centrepieces of the discussions that we had with the Indonesian delegates—a position, I would say, which they understood quite clearly. They came back to us and made clear that they also harboured a desire for peace in East Timor, a just peace on a basis with which the East Timorese would be happy.
The rest of the conference came at a very interesting time in Malaysia. The media that week were being hyped up with a whole series of raids and things like that on friends of Anwar Ibrahim. It was not hard to see—and we picked up the intelligence as a group—that Anwar was on the ropes. In fact, quite clearly on the Monday when Anwar, as Deputy Prime Minister, opened the conference he read out a speech which, I presume, was the product of Dr Mahathir, or somebody close to him in that regime. That speech basically blamed the Jews for the problems of Malaysia—and I do not think we should walk away from that; that is exactly the proposition that was put to us—and said that Malaysia's problems were not of its own making, that they were everyone else's fault except their own. Anwar Ibrahim read that speech out quite dutifully. I do not know whether he agreed with it, but that is the nature of that particular regime. I want to make a few comments about that this afternoon because I think the events of the next 10 days leading to the arrest of Anwar Ibrahim were rather interesting.
Indeed, it was not hard to see why Malaysia had got itself into economic problems. I do not think it had much to do with international money lenders, only that maybe some of them 
 had been the instruments of providing free and loose cash to fund a property development the likes of which I could only see on television. If I were to turn on the Buck Rogers program and see the new Chicago four centuries from now, I would see the sorts of buildings that were being put up in Kuala Lumpur. In fact, commercial real estate in KL would obviously be well beyond the means of First World countries to develop. Quite frankly, in the last 10 to 12 years, KL has become addicted to large amounts of foreign money that has come in and bid up a commercial real estate market in that country which is just unsustainable.
From where the IPO proceedings were held, you could see some of the most expensive buildings in the world, some of which were unfinished—it would have been nice if they had been finished. The Hyatt Hotel was a clear example of that. The shell of the building was not even complete. On one day, one person would be walking around kicking the tyres on a truck; on another day there would be 200 blokes walking around kicking tyres on however many trucks were there, but not much was happening. It was obvious that it had come to a standstill.
A great amount of expenditure had been spent in KL in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games, which happened two to three weeks after we were there. A great deal of public infrastructure was built and when you see this I guess you can say that there will be some benefits to the Malaysian community through that infrastructure. But at the end of the day, there was a lot of expenditure on things there which did nothing more than just bid up to an unsustainably high level the price of commercial real estate in that country. I would suggest that a very large part of the problem that Malaysia finds itself in is exactly the same as that in Thailand, that is, there has been a binge on commercial real estate bid up by easy amounts of money that have flowed into that country but have suddenly terminated and, as they terminated, have caused all sorts of readjustment problems and all the rest of it.
Finally, I want to make a few remarks about the Mahathir regime. I think it has been 
 too long in this country that politicians and political parties have treated this regime with anything more than the most basic or base appeasement. That quite clearly shows through. This is a vicious and brutal regime and the way it is dealing with the former Deputy Prime Minister there, who had outlived his usefulness to Dr Mahathir, is a clear example of what we are dealing with. Australia will only hold its head up in this end of the world, not as my colleague Senator Lightfoot says when we get into ASEAN—I do not know whether or not that is a good idea;  I acknowledge that that was an issue he pushed over in KL—but when we call a spade a spade, sort out a few of these problems and make clear our displeasure at some of the antics of the Mahathir regime, which, make no bones about it, are aimed directly at us and through us to the rest of the Western word.
Our relationship with the ordinary Malay authorities and the Malay government is pretty good. I met a large number of people over there who were educated in Australian institutions. We had a lot in common. I believe 159,000 Malaysians were educated in Australia and the strength of the relationship at that level shows through. Unfortunately, at the top end it certainly does not.",SENATE,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,"<title>19th ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation Conference, Kuala Lumpur</title>",Delegation Reports,22,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-11-30,"—I seek leave to move a motion in respect of the second report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The second report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on contracting out of government services is particularly important for the Senate to take note of, and indeed for the government to take note of, not only because of the growing concern with the detrimental effects of contracting out—we know what some of the good 
 effects are—but because of the recent problems emerging in the New South Wales parliament which are essentially a contest between the executive and the sovereign parliament over the right of the sovereign parliament to demand accountability.
The Democrats are not alone in this chamber in wishing to enforce appropriate accountability standards in the use by governments of private sector bodies and, in fact, in wishing to know as much about those matters as possible. With regard to that, the committee came up with a large number of very sound recommendations which I hope the government will not only take on board but respond to relatively quickly.
In general, the committee recommended a phased introduction of contracting out to allow government agencies to draw on their own and others' experience. It was recognised that initial contracts carry the highest degree of risk and that time for progressive improvement through experience must be allowed. I think we are starting to see signs in government of ministers who early on were a bit afraid of criticism and took a fairly brittle line on these matters starting to accept that there are opportunities for progressive improvement.
Given the amount of public money at stake in the contracting out of services, the efficient and accountable conduct of the same should take clear priority over zeal to contract out as much as possible as quickly as possible. Further, we note that government agencies should seek information on the experience of other government agencies with a view to deciding not merely whether it could be done better but if it should be done at all. That is, substantial attention should be given to the question of whether contracting out is the most desirable option available in the light of the positives and the negatives of other agencies' experiences.
The committee focused on the tendering process which is absolutely core to proper accountability in contracting out. The committee recognised three objectives of the tendering process. Those were: continuing measurable benefits in value for money obtained on a whole of life basis, benefits in industry 
 development and in support of other specified policy objectives, and satisfaction in the supplier community with the operation of the Commonwealth's procurement system overall. The committee generally supported the use of in-house bids, provided that a successful in-house bidder is subject to the same accountability requirements as other bidders and, indeed, the same opportunities as other bidders.
The Australian Democrats agreed with the committee's recommendations, as did all other parties. They were unanimous. We advocate standard clauses in government procurement contracts ensuring contractors comply with good Australian government standards and policies regarding, for example, the promotion of Australian business, protecting the Australian environment, advancing the cause of indigenous peoples, affirmative action where appropriate, and general trade, foreign policy and Commonwealth-state priorities. Those provisions should, we believe, be incorporated in a government procurement act establishing and ensuring compliance by government agencies with process standards for the tendering stage.
In terms of the World Trade Organisation's agreement on government procurement, the Democrats felt that we should advocate Australia becoming a party to the agreement and/or bringing Australian government procurement practices into line with international agreement. But that implementation should be codified via a government procurement act laying out standards and requirements.
The Finance and Public Administration References Committee also focused on managing contracts. The committee recognised that the success or otherwise of a contract will depend on its efficient and effective management. That may seem an ordinary thing to say but, really, unless there is focus on the enforceability of contracts, the capacity of the Public Service to manage contracts effectively and the need to recognise the importance of process as well as outcomes, then contracting out will be fatally flawed and fatally harmed.
The Democrats agree that we should advocate standard contract clauses providing for liquidated damages or structured payments 
 linked to performance. Standard clauses tailored to a particular contract should specify certain targets which have to be met by the contractor before the government agency is obliged to make any payment. The Democrats also emphasise the necessity for training the staff of government agencies in contract management, for the recruitment of new, experienced staff, and we believe that there should be adequate funding with government to ensure effective training and/or recruitment.
In terms of accountability, the committee recommended that portfolio agencies on behalf of the minister should monitor the operations of the outsourced services so that all reasonable parliamentary questions on process or outcomes can be handled. In the early stages of this government's tenure in the last parliament, it was occasionally the case that government ministers were very defensive about their outsourced services without acknowledging that the Senate as a whole has a right—indeed, a duty—to pursue accountability in these matters. The Finance and Public Administration References Committee also recommended the use of probity auditors and/or acquisition councils for contracts over a certain monetary figure so that the process is fully documented and responsibility for the decision is unequivocal.
The committee emphasised that reporting by government agencies is vital and that current annual reporting requirements may need to be modified to ensure that reporting of contracted out services to ministers provides sufficient information to the parliament as well.
The committee noted that no provision has been made in the Auditor-General Act 1997 for access to the records of contractors by the Auditor-General, and recommended that standard contract clauses be used to provide audit access to relevant third party information and records. That is a particularly important recommendation because, unless the Auditor-General is actively involved in contracting out agreements, he or she cannot appropriately fulfil the accountability duty that is laid upon him or her by this parliament. The Auditor-General's office is our watchdog in these matters.
The Finance and Public Administration References Committee recommended that, as an interim measure, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's jurisdiction should be extended to private sector contracts on a case by case basis for sensitive areas of service delivery. The committee asserted that the Freedom of Information Act 1982 should not be weakened in an outsourced environment. Service recipients should be able to access sufficient information to ascertain whether contractors were acting within the terms of their contract in dealing with them, or to obtain evidence of service delivery problems. The committee recommended that there be an amendment to the FOI Act deeming documents in the possession of the contractor, that relate directly to the performance of the contractor's contractual operations, to be in the possession of a government agency and hence FOIable, if that is not too strange a word—able to be accessed under the Freedom of Information regime.
The committee also recommended that, if parliament insisted on a right to know legitimately commercially confidential information, the most appropriate course to achieve this would be the appointment of an independent arbiter, such as the Auditor-General, to look on its behalf. This means that, where the government is saying material is commercially in confidence, the Auditor-General would at least have access in cases where ministers were able to prove that it was legitimate for them to withhold the material from the Senate. At the moment, there is no such right by the Senate or the Auditor-General.
The Democrats believe that a government procurement act, such as we outlined earlier, should require government agencies to report to parliament about contracted out services. Current reporting requirements need to be made more onerous to ensure that parliament has the information it requires to satisfy itself that public money has been properly expended. The Democrats recognise that contracting out distances the parliament from oversight of the service to be provided by government. The task of this Senate, in relation to the contracting out of government services, should be to neither oppose nor advocate the practice, but to ensure that each proposal is 
 subject to an adequate accountability regime and is evaluated for its positives and its negatives relative to the particular contract concerned. This will require government agencies to properly justify any decision to contract out a service and govern the fundamental terms upon which contractual relations are entered into.

The committee also recommended that, if parliament insisted on a right to know legitimately commercially confidential information, the most appropriate course to achieve this would be the appointment of an independent arbiter, such as the Auditor-General, to look on its behalf. This means that, where the government is saying material is commercially in confidence, the Auditor-General would at least have access in cases where ministers were able to prove that it was legitimate for them to withhold the material from the Senate. At the moment, there is no such right by the Senate or the Auditor-General.
The Democrats believe that a government procurement act, such as we outlined earlier, should require government agencies to report to parliament about contracted out services. Current reporting requirements need to be made more onerous to ensure that parliament has the information it requires to satisfy itself that public money has been properly expended. The Democrats recognise that contracting out distances the parliament from oversight of the service to be provided by government. The task of this Senate, in relation to the contracting out of government services, should be to neither oppose nor advocate the practice, but to ensure that each proposal is 
 subject to an adequate accountability regime and is evaluated for its positives and its negatives relative to the particular contract concerned. This will require government agencies to properly justify any decision to contract out a service and govern the fundamental terms upon which contractual relations are entered into.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—I indicate to the Senate that those bills which have just been announced are being introduced together. After debate on the motion for the second reading has been adjourned, I will be moving a motion to have two of the bills listed separately on the Notice Paper . I move:

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—When progress was reported prior to question time, I was discussing Democrat amendment No. 6 that dealt with clause 48 on insurance requirements. My particular concern, firstly, was the amount of information that we put into delegated legislation—the amount of information we leave out of legislation and put into regulations. I note that this is an increasing practice before the Senate. The Democrats do not believe it is necessarily an appropriate practice. We believe that legislation should be considered as a whole. We are debating the complete package, including some essential elements which are to be set aside and put into regulations. I gave an example before question time of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority amendment bills, to name just one legislation package. But I think there are a couple of others, even this morning, Senator Margetts, that we have been made aware of in a committee hearing.
More importantly, it is the consequences of this practice which my colleagues and I find most unsatisfactory. Legislation before the Senate in the form of a bill can be debated and amended. We can seek clarification and, in many instances, resolve and improve the bills. Regulations, on the other hand, are before us for 15 days, and we only have the opportunity to accept or reject the whole package. Where the regulations deal with incidental issues in the executive, this is appropriate. However, when they deal with 
 substantive issues this is not appropriate. We should not be forced to either accept or reject the package—and in many instances our review function is being undermined.
Having said this, I do not consider this bill a major offender, although I do believe a number of provisions referring are not entirely satisfactory. In the provisions we are now considering, I would like to have known how the maximum probable loss was to be calculated. In clause 46, I would like to have known what sorts of factors the minister was taking into account when issuing exemption certificates for launches, launch facilities and returns. In clause 18, which deals with the grant of space licences covering a particular facility and launch vehicle, I would like to have known what the criteria are in the minister's determination. In both these clauses, those criteria which are left to regulations are central to our review of whether the minister is in fact taking relevant matters into account. For example, will the ministers seek appropriate consultation with relevant industry and community groups? Without a complete package before us, we are not fulfilling our function of review as best we might.
Finally, I understand some of this insurance information may be considered to be commercial-in-confidence. I do accept this argument in a number of cases. However, where there is  need to be accountable to the parliament, in the remote possibility of an accident and even the even more remote possibility of damage, I think we as a parliament have responsibility to make sure that the insurance coverage is adequate. This is particularly important here, because the consequences of the minister's decision will otherwise be unaccountable until there has been a terrible accident. And we do not consider that good enough.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—I rise to support the amendment moved by Senator Stott Despoja—that is, amendment No. 6. I agree that there is a growing list of legislation, the majority of which is being handled by delegated legislation—that is, there is no real means of parliamentary scrutiny. The Senate has the chance of an all-or-nothing approach. I guess we are 
 well aware of that, having been in a public hearing this morning where the very same thing is happening in relation to the ARPANSA proposed legislation. We have seen it happen in this chamber with child-care legislation. We have seen it happen with the common youth allowance. We have seen it happen with a number of major and important pieces of legislation—that the guts of the legislation is actually coming through by way of unaccountable delegated legislation. That is not a good sign. It means that the government and its departments are gradually looking for ways of hiding from parliamentary scrutiny—and in that sense hiding from public scrutiny. I will be supporting the amendment as moved.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—The government cannot accept this amendment. I point out that the bill already covers the question of insurance in two respects. In relation to the granting of a launch permit, the minister can do so only if satisfied that the insurance financial requirements in division 7 will be satisfied for the launch or launcher and any connected return. Clause 29 says that standard launch permit conditions include that `the holder of the permit must satisfy the insurance/financial requirements in division 7 for each launch and each return, conducted under the permit.' This amendment would require the minister at the end of each financial year to cause a report to be prepared setting out details of insurance cover for each launch conducted during that financial year.
What you are really asking is that the detailed insurance contract between the insurance company and the launcher be required to be tabled in the parliament—that is for every instance of a launch in the previous financial year. As far as I can tell, that is an absolutely unprecedented imposition on industry. I do not know of any instance where any other industry in this country is required to have tabled in this parliament what would otherwise be commercial arrangements between an insurance company and a private company. 
I do not see the basis on which such an unprecedented action should be taken or why this industry should be singled out for such extraordinary behaviour. I am not aware that, for example, we require the tabling in this parliament of insurance arrangements entered into by Qantas or Ansett in relation to their coverage of the millions of people they fly around this country every year; therefore, to impose such a requirement in this first attempt by this nation to set up a framework for a commercial space industry seems to me quite unnecessary, quite unreasonable, and unprecedented.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—The opposition opposes this amendment, very much for the reasons that the minister has outlined. But I will take this opportunity, Minister, to ask you about a broader issue rather than specifically this clause. In my time as minister responsible for space activities—you might want to say they were non-existent, but we tried hard—I went to a conference for people interested in space-related activities. One of the most activist people there was from the insurance industry, who saw an opportunity for the development of space insurance as a general commercial business to cover launches not only in Australia but generally.
I ask you as industry minister to take on board the opportunities to discuss with the industry, because it is a skill that comes with the industry—actuarially judging losses, et cetera; it is obviously going to be a very big, expanding industry—whether we can establish a financial centre for insurance in space-related activities in Australia. That will actually bring jobs. Not only will it bring the capacity to insure, but also I suspect the skill level will grow in our financial institutions in one form or another to actually be willing to invest in Australian companies that may be wanting to get involved in space-related activities.
I cannot remember the name of the person or the organisation, but they said the opportunities were considerable. I ask you to take that on board and maybe when we come to the estimates committee next year, when you are at the desk and we get to the space pro 
 gram, you will be able to show how more interventionist you are in your new cap of encouraging the development of the space insurance industry with a base in Australia.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—I take note of Senator Schacht's comments. The insurance industry does not actually come within my portfolio, but obviously I am very keen to encourage and promote an outward-looking, successful Australian insurance industry.
The Australian insurance industry has had international success in Asia and the subcontinent. I am advised that GIO has developed some expertise in the international space launch industry in relation to insurance and has achieved a level of business of around $150 million per annum, which is just terrific. I think that is one of the spin-offs. This is the whole point: if you get an industry like the space industry going, there are spin-offs you are not even conscious of before you start. So I think that is a terrific side benefit for ordinary Australian workers of developing such an industry. I would be pleased to take that matter further.
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—I move Greens amendment No 7:
(7)	 Clause 53, page 35 (line 30), omit ""100 penalty units"", substitute ""2000 penalty units"".
This amendment relates to the penalty units associated with a breach of a requirement from a launch safety officer. The penalties that apply in the bill for failure to comply with the instructions of the launch safety officer are quite inadequate for the range of possible adverse affects of failure to comply. They do not actually fill us with confidence that the government is serious about giving the community confidence that it is serious about what it is doing.
For example, if you have instructions relating to the storage of fuel—and I can think of quite substantial examples that we have seen in the oil industry in Australia, where instructions have to be followed to the letter because they are just so important—the 
 potential for enormous worker safety issues and environmental damage exists out of proportion to the available fine. The instructions relating to access to computer programs on hypothetical accident scenarios, for instance, are that at present the launch safety officer has to ask permission to get access to a launch facility. There is no capacity for the launch safety officer to get a warrant if access is refused.
The LSO can always call off a launch, but this is a drastic measure, with enormous pressure involved. Imagine the minister giving instructions to proceed when the launch safety officer's only reason for holding up the launch is not having had access to a computer program. If the launch safety officer's direction to the licence holder carries the weight of a substantial penalty, that problem may be averted. So we are hogtying the launch safety officer. We are saying that if the company—that is, the individual—decide they are going to thumb their nose at the instructions of the launch safety officer, the penalty will be $1,100. We have heard a lot from the minister in relation to the money the government hopes to make in relation to launches, but it is not going to help as much if the companies, the individuals, involved can thumb their nose at instructions and be prepared simply to cop the fine at the end, leaving the community with little or no confidence in the process.
As I say, 100 penalty units equal $1,100. That is a relatively small amount for a corporation to pay for an offence that could have serious consequences. We would like it to be a more serious figure for a more serious offence—that is, $220,000—because it more accurately reflects the sorts of risks involved in a refusal or failure to comply with the instructions of a launch safety officer. Suppose the launch safety officer ordered an additional safety measure to be taken and was ignored and the launch went ahead. The potential for injury and damage to property is enormous. You should not be leaving a community with just the necessity to take civil action; it should be built in.
Remember, we are dealing with dangerous fuels, mixed payloads, high-technology equipment and stuff that hurtles through the 
 sky at a great speed. We have to create a culture of safety around this industry. The government has to be seen to be serious and not to have a gung-ho approach to making money as fast as it can. Anyone guilty of an offence should be aware that the penalties will fit the offence. That $1,100 is only a rap over the knuckles for people who have put that much money into it and want things to go their way rather than, perhaps, in a safer way. That might be appropriate for minor matters but, where major safety issues are concerned, it needs to be much more realistic. I urge the Senate to support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—I respect Senator Margetts's skills in economics, but I am advised that 100 penalty units is 100 times $110, which is $11,000, not $1,100.
—Plus a rocket blown up in your face!
—True! That is only the penalty for individuals. The penalty for corporations is five times that amount—$55,000. You are proposing to increase the penalty for failing to comply with the direction of a safety officer from $11,000 to $220,000 for a person, and from $55,000 to $1.1 million for a corporation. That is completely out of proportion. What is prescribed is a criminal not a civil offence—you are guilty of a criminal offence if you fail to comply. Those penalties are at the top end of criminal penalties in Commonwealth legislation. They are way in excess of what is provided for in other legislation relating to public safety.
For example, if you do not assist an authorised officer in relation to the Imported Food Control Act—and that is a pretty serious act—the penalty is $3,000. If you do not obey the directions of a superintendent relating to vessels under the Control of Naval Waters Act 1918—and that is pretty important stuff—the penalty is $1,000. Under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, if you fail to comply with the power of an inspector to give directions, it is only 10 penalty units compared with the 100 we are prescribing here.
You may say that we should be increasing the penalties across the board, but my point is that these penalties are at the very top end of the penalties prescribed under Commonwealth legislation. You were out by a factor of 10 in what you thought they were. I hope that, now that you are aware of what is involved and that we are talking about criminal penalties, you will be inclined to support the government's bill as it is.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—The Democrats support this amendment which increases the penalty units for failure to comply with directions. I was advised, I believe by Senator Margetts's office, that the effect of her amendment was to bring these penalties into line with similar penalties.
—In line with similar penalties for what?
—Let us take the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in terms of killing an employee. The minimum penalty is, as I understand it, $110,000. Senator Schacht has raised an interesting point on comparable laws. Why is a corporation looking at around $55,000 in penalties under this act, when we know that under some other acts, like the one I just cited, if you were responsible for the death of an employee you would be looking at a $110,000 penalty? Perhaps the minister could outline what he considers comparable penalty units in law. I am assuming that this is not just an arbitrary figure that has been plucked out of the air for the purposes of this act.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—I am advised that these penalties were determined, in consultation with the Criminal Law Division of the Attorney-General's Department, in accordance with Commonwealth criminal law policy. We are not talking about killing people; we are talking about failing to comply with the directions of a launch safety officer. While it may be appropriate when people have been killed to have significant penalties of the kind you are talking about, that is not what we are dealing with here.
As I said, in the example that we gave we have drawn out what we believe to be comparable instances of offences for failure to comply with directions of relevant officers under a variety of acts of the Commonwealth parliament. Those penalties are considerably less than the penalty we have prescribed, but you want to multiply that by 20. We think that is a little over the top and inappropriate. We believe these penalties are appropriate.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—I hate to be the one to remind the minister, but not long ago we had a debate about how the government and the opposition think it is appropriate for space vehicles to carry fissionable material and be nuclear powered. We are talking about a maximum penalty, and we could be in a situation where failure to comply with a specific direction from a launch safety officer may not kill people directly, but may put at risk the lives and future health of a great number of people in the wider community.
These are very important issues. The issues and the importance relate to the danger that might occur as a result of the seriousness of an action in ignoring the directions of a safety officer. For instance, we know from this legislation that there could be a major issue in relation to weapons systems, as weapons systems will not be banned from these; or it could be dealing with fissionable material, because we know that that can be carried if the minister has given it a tick.
If we do not have maximum penalty units, we are saying that the worst that can happen to a person—and that can also be a company—is that they will get 100 penalty units, even if their actions were to involve, for instance, fissionable material that has been given a tick by the minister. That is not good enough. It is certainly not showing that either the government or the opposition is aware of or is putting together all the information we have talked about in relation to what could take place at these launches.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—The opposition does not support this amendment. I want to ask for information for the record, which the minister perhaps can 
 supply from his advisers. The rate of the penalty units at the moment is what?
—It is $110.
—Who determines the rate per penalty unit? Is that in A-G's, and can it be adjusted from time to time by regulation?",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—My advisers are not entirely sure where the decision making process occurs. We think it is administrative. But the fee is indexed. The $110 is certainly indexed, so it increases.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—I thought that was the case, and this is nothing unusual, to use penalty units as such. The thing that I cannot agree with the Democrats and the Greens about is confusing this issue about an approval, that failing to comply with the direction of a launch safety officer for a licence is equated with actually killing somebody.
—No, it is a maximum unit. Over time, it could do.
—We have a penalty here where a person who fails to comply with a direction that the launch safety officer or licensed launch facility gives under paragraph 52(2)(c) is guilty of an offence. A person who fails to comply, even if the launch is still perfectly okay and it all works out okay, is still guilty of an offence because they have not complied. I want to ask the minister about what happens if the rocket goes wrong or something happens and something catastrophic does occur. Is remedy open to the government under the Crimes Act or other general legislation to take action against the person? Where people not only broke this rule but consciously took decisions that put people at risk, could the government take action under the laws relating to manslaughter? I would have thought that somewhere else in the Commonwealth law you would be subject to some prosecution, or at least the Director of Public Prosecutions would say, `You are not just being fined 100 penalty units here. You actually took part in a series of activities that led to serious loss of life or property and 
 therefore, under either the Crimes Act or something else, we're going to charge you with manslaughter or some other serious offence.' Then, after something terrible has happened, they will suffer some heavier penalty under that legislation rather than under this. I also have to say that, if the minister had approved of it, he has got a political problem on his hands.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—Obviously that is correct. What we are talking about here is a specific penalty in this act for failing to comply with the direction of a launch safety officer. Obviously the general criminal law, whether at state or federal level, would apply to everything that goes on. There is no immunity; there is no line drawn around a space facility to say that no other laws apply. All other laws apply and, if a criminal action takes place, they will be prosecuted for it. That is an important point to note.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—One of the questions that Senator Schacht shot across the chamber to the minister was on what exists now. We do not have the Space Activities Bill as law at the moment but we do have some potential space launches that are going to occur in the absence of the Space Activities Act. What I would like to ask the minister is this: in the absence of this legislation coming into effect, what is the current situation? For instance, who would be overseeing a Christmas Island launch and is there anyone to give safety instructions in relation to a Christmas Island launch, if that facility gets the go-ahead? What would be the penalties for an individual failing to comply with a safety instruction if the approval for the Christmas Island launch facility goes ahead, which obviously does not need this legislation?",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—I point out that we have specifically provided in clause 104 that nothing in this act limits or excludes the operation of other laws of the Commonwealth to the extent, if any, that they are inconsistent with this act, so obviously the criminal code of the 
 Commonwealth applies, as would any state laws. In relation to any prospective launches, as we said at the outset, one of the reasons for bringing this bill on now and trying to get it passed in this session is so that it will operate to regulate prospective launches. We want this legislation in place for the launch at Woomera and for any launch that may take place at Christmas Island. We can reach contractual arrangements with prospective launchers, but there is no power to impose criminal penalties, except by legislative fiat, except to the extent that the general criminal law applies. If you want to put in specific criminal penalties then you need specific legislation to do so. That is one of the reasons we want this bill passed.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—Can I clarify that. I was under the impression, when we got briefings, that this legislation would not apply to prospective launch facilities at Christmas Island simply because the arrangements were made prior to that. Is it the case that this legislation will apply if the Christmas Island launch facility goes ahead?",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—There is no agreement in relation to any launch at Christmas Island. There is speculation that that may be a potential launch site. The only agreement the Commonwealth has entered into with relation to launches is with Kistler for the use of the Woomera rocket range. We have said from the outset, and quite openly, that, while that agreement covers all the commercial arrangements, insurance and things like that, we want this legislation in place and Kistler want this legislation in place so that there is a proper regulatory framework to cover matters that cannot be covered by the agreement. But we did not want to hold up proceeding to get Kistler to the point they are in the absence of any legislation, so agreements have been entered into.
We need this legislation to ensure that there is a full regulatory framework in place and so that, for example, there can be criminal penalties for such things as failing to comply with the directions of a launch safety officer. 
 You are under a misapprehension if you think there is any agreement in relation to Christmas Island. The potential for Christmas Island to develop will be enhanced if we get this regulatory framework in place. But there is no agreement outside this legislation.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—I move Greens (WA) amendment (8):
(8)	 Clause 55, page 36 (after line 17), at the end of the clause, add:
(3)	 Within 15 sitting days of giving an instruction to a Launch Safety Officer the Minister must cause a copy of the instruction to be tabled in each House of the Parliament.
This amendment relates to the instructions by the launch safety officers. We believe that it is important that any instructions to a launch safety officer from the minister be tabled in Parliament. We need to know what happens if an instruction from a launch safety officer is ignored. It is also important know what they have actually been told or if any instructions have been given to them by a minister. We are assuming that the launch safety officer is the expert in launch safety matters. If their decisions are overruled by the minister there must be, in our opinion, some serious reason for doing so. It is not the kind of thing we are going to get easily from freedom of information—or freedom from information, as some people unkindly put it.
In order to ensure that the decision is not one that will compromise launch safety, we believe it must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. It is similar to the requirements of other parts of the legislation relating to matters of which the minister must give notice. If the minister has to notify over some action taken in relation to other matters, then he or she should have to also notify parliament when giving instructions to the launch safety officer. It is very important. We believe it should be transparent in the process.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—The Democrats support the amendment, which adds a reporting requirement for instructions given to a launch safety officer. We are happy to support

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—We are prepared to accept this amendment on the basis that it is not a disallowable instrument. That would make the thing unworkable. But if it is on the basis of the thing being made public, and in the interests of transparency, we have no objection. We would not have thought that instructions from the minister would occur very often, but it may be that a minister has access to information not available to a launch safety officer which could lead the minister to instruct the launch safety officer to hold the launch, for some reason. It is very important to have this power in clause 55. On the basis that it is not proposed it be disallowable, we have no objection to the amendment.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—I understand that the government is willing to accept this amendment with a suggested further minor amendment. In the first line it says, `If the Minister varies, revokes, suspends or transfers . . . ' The amendment is as follows: after the word `suspends' put a comma and the word `reinstates'. It then goes on to read `or transfers'. I understand that in discussions with the shadow minister that agreement has been reached. Therefore, I move the amendment in the amended form. I move opposition amendment (4):
(4)	 Page 39 (after line 20), at the end of Division 9, add:
	 61A  Notice of decisions

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—As indicated, the government is prepared to accept this amendment with that qualification. Because we are potentially dealing with major corporations whose public 
 reputations could be affected by these matters, it is important that, where a reinstatement occurs, it should also be published. If we are going to make public any information in relation to a suspension, then it is also important that we do so for any reinstatement. On that basis we are happy to accept the amendment.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—I move Democrats amendment (7):
(7)	 Clause 72, page 45 (line 9), omit ""one year"", substitute ""6 years"".
The clause provides for a limit on the period within which an action for damages may be brought. This provision limits that period to one year and one day from when the damage occurred. We find this a surprising provision, as limitations periods in Australia are well characterised beyond one year and one day. I am advised that the usual term of a limitations period is six years, so the amendment proposes to insert the period of six years.
In response to my questions to the minister, I am informed that the 12-month rule reflects the terms of the liability convention. This is not consistent with our national laws and we believe that it is a significant undermining of the rights of individuals in Australia who may seek to make claims under the bill or take other actions.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—We have had various elements of this debate during the entire committee stage of this bill. The government and the opposition seem to be quite keen to restrict the liability. We have given plenty of examples where the potential harm from what you have put into the atmosphere by way a space launch may be there for perhaps a long time. I have spoken about potentially hundreds of thousands of items floating around.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—The government does not support this amendment. A lot of thought has gone into setting the period. As indicated by the Australian Democrats, the period does reflect the provision in the Convention on the International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects. That is an international convention. The parties to that convention clearly think that one year is an appropriate period and so does the government.
I would point out that clause 72 of the bill makes it clear that if a third party was unaware that damage had occurred, the period of one year would commence on the day the person `became aware of the damage' or `would have become aware of the damage' if due diligence had been exercised. On that basis and on the basis of the established convention, we think that one year is appropriate.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—by leave—I move:
Clause 75, page 47 (line 6), omit ""may"", substitute ""must"".
Clause 75, page 47 (line 7), after ""beyond"", insert ""under an authorisation provided under this Act"".
These amendment relates to clause 75 which sets out the requirements for a register the minister must keep. This register is a requirement of the United Nations Registration Convention and in this bill sets out particulars about the vehicle launched into space.
Firstly, I would like to point out that there is a conflict in terminology. This clause refers to `Earth orbit and beyond' in reference to the term `launch', which is defined in clause 8 to mean `outer space'. This reflects the hazy nature of the term `space' and the inability of the international agreements to decide what this term means. The hesitation that I have here is that there is the possibility for confusion where a vehicle is launched but returns to Earth before entering an Earth orbit. This may seem pedantic.
—Is it like trying to define a black hole or something?
—Oh?
—Mr Temporary Chairman, you missed the earlier debates when there were so many Star Wars  references waiting to be made in this debate.
—A black hole is a scientific term these days.
—It is pedantic, but it does impact on the role of regulation in this area and may have consequences for objects which are launched outside the atmosphere and within the range of Earth orbits; for example, an object fired to a height of a thousand kilometres which does not enter an orbit. The point is that international agreements which form the basis of this bill do not necessarily have clear guides as to what space is and where it starts.
Secondly, and taking this concern into consideration, the Democrats believe the requirement set out in clause 75 should be obligatory. The term `may' in subclause 75(2) should be replaced by the term `shall'. The effect of this amendment will make the information contained in the register a complete record of our space ventures. This is a measure of accountability and disclosure.
I understand that the minister's office has discussed this with our office and has pointed out a problem with the amendment because it could be interpreted to mean that every launch anywhere must be registered. To overcome this, it is perhaps appropriate to add the words `under an authorisation provided under this act' after the words `Earth orbit or beyond'.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—On the basis of the caveat by Senator Stott Despoja—that is, the addition of those extra words in subclause 75(2) so that we are talking only about space objects launched under this act—we are happy to accept the amendment.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—by leave—I move government amendments Nos 1 to 3:
(1)	 Clause 90, page 53 (line 24), omit `or gives a thing'.
(2)	 Clause 90, page 53 (line 25), omit `or thing' (first occurring).
(3)	 Clause 90, page 53 (after line 28), after subclause (5), insert:
(5A)	 If a person gives a thing in accordance with subsection (1), the thing, and any information or thing obtained directly or indirectly as a result, is not admissible in evidence against the person in a criminal proceeding or in a proceeding for the recovery of a penalty.
At present, no information or thing given to an investigator of an accident by a person under clause 90(1) is admissible as evidence in proceedings of any kind. The purpose of these provisions is to encourage cooperation with the investigator by persons who may possess information or material items relevant to an investigation. Ensuring that such persons bring forward information or items, rather than withhold them through fear of implication in legal proceedings, has assisted investigators of aircraft accidents in determining their causes and in developing strategies for their future prevention.
The object of the amendments is to provide that anything given to the investigator of an accident may be admitted as evidence in civil proceedings which do not involve the recovery of a penalty. For example, in the unlikely event that there was a civil proceeding in which it was necessary to establish liability for damage caused by the launch or return of a space object, anything relevant to the determination of liability—for example, a piece of space object which might be used to determine the cause of mechanical failure—could be tendered in evidence. The proposed amendments do not prejudice the intention of the act to protect persons who give information, documentation or an object to an investigator from penalty through legal proceedings.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—The Democrats will be supporting these amendments. I thank the 
 minister's office for their explanations as to the purpose of these amendments. On balance, they seem quite reasonable, even if my colleagues have been coming into the chamber, looking at one particular amendment and saying, `What is this ""thing"" amendment?'
—Wasn't there something in a movie called `Thing'?
—That's it. We had to have a reference to The Addams Family , didn't we? So we have the `thing' amendment. The amendments extend the operation of the investigations powers to protect any person who assists in the conduct of the investigation. There is always a balance between making sure that those at fault accept responsibility and, of course, gathering enough information to make sure the investigation is fruitful. The Democrats believe that the balance in these circumstances appears to be reasonable. For that reason we will be supporting the `thing' amendment and the others.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—I have a couple of questions to ask about things. Australia is credited with having six items, or six things, of payload objects in orbit and two debris items.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—I am lost. Where are we?
—You have been asked a question about the six things.
—What? Six things in space?
—We've had six things in space and we're now down to the black hole and the blob.
—We request a determination about the six things and clarification as to what they are.
—I am advised that six things have been launched into space from Australia, but I am not sure what the context is or what the question is exactly seeking to find out. I gather that we have moved off the 
 particular amendment onto a general discussion. Is that so?
—No, Minister. Senator Margetts might like to re-ask her question.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—Certainly, and perhaps the minister could pay attention this time. Australia is credited with having six items of payload objects in orbit and two debris items.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—My advisers inform me that these are communications satellites that have been launched here for the benefit of all Australians, so that we can communicate and can talk to each other.
—Optus satellites A and B.
—Yes, that's right. To the extent that any such satellite becomes unserviceable or is past its life expectancy, it becomes `debris' once it is no longer usable. I am not aware of any difficulty or concern being caused to anybody by their presence in space, but I am happy to seek further information on the matter.
Amendments agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—I really think what we have seen, especially in this last response, would indicate that the minister is not taking a lot of these concerns terribly seriously. Australia is already involved in the space industry. We have indicated that there is actually a growing amount of debris and objects within space. It would not be the first time space debris has hit space objects with someone on board. Apparently in 1988 the Russian Mir  space station was damaged by a high velocity particle. Collisions are accepted as inevitable.
—That's the risk you take in having a space station up there.
—I do not really know why Senator Schacht has seen in this whole debate the necessity to try to poke fun 
 at or to put nonsense on those people from the Greens and the Democrats who are seeking to express real concerns. These things are real, they are not just in our imagination. There are space objects there. We have liabilities. Australia should be operating as a responsible international citizen. The only kind of response Senator Schacht can come up with is to make silly jokes and to support and act like the minister.
This is your responsibility, Senator Schacht, not just the government's. You think those things that the community is concerned about are a joke. Fine! But this is not really a joke, it is serious. The liabilities are serious. The community health concerns are serious. Putting this kind of stuff, including fissionable material, into space and accepting no real liability or implementing no real checks and balances is not funny. We have to not just follow on the tails of those people who want to make lots of money in the United States; we have to, on one thing in this universe, act as responsible international citizens. But, no, it is a joke according to Senator Schacht. That is the way he has conducted this debate. Unfortunately, the consequences are no joke. He is playing with people's lives and with people's futures. As long as someone can make money out of that, that is fine by him.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—On one of the issues we were debating before—penalty units—I made an off the cuff reference to a safety and rehabilitation act. I also wanted to draw the committee's attention to the occupational health and safety act which states, in reference to the duty of an employer in relation to third parties, that an employer must take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure that persons at or near a workplace under the employer's control who are not the employer's employees or contractors are not exposed to risk to their health or safety arising from the conduct of an employer's undertaking. The penalty in that case is $100,000.
Even though I mentioned in the debate some of the minimum penalties in relation to death in a workplace, as well as the penalty 
 that would be faced by that corporation or workplace or employer, in the case of the occupational health and safety act it is $100,000 for a government business enterprise if it fails to ensure that third parties are free from risk. I think that is perhaps comparable to some of the penalty units to which we referred in the debate.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—Senator Margetts has said that I have treated this debate with levity and without seriousness. Since I was elected to this place in 1987, I have been involved in the issue of Australia's involvement in space related activities as a minister, as a backbencher and as a member of various committees, including Senate committees going right back to 1987. I will plead guilty to the fact that I am a dedicated supporter of Australia having a space industry, because not only is it in our national interest to have it but it will also provide good jobs and add to the wealth of this country in the long term. I do not think we can be a modern society, a First World country, in the next century without having a viable opportunity to be involved in space related activities.
It is true that I made some asides and interjections about black holes and Star Wars and so on. I have always thought in this place that occasionally, even though we oppose each other, interjections of some humour often do not go amiss. We may philosophically disagree with being involved in space related activities, but I am extremely serious about why Australia should have a space industry and undertake space related activities. I always will be. I have argued for that since I came to this place in 1987 and I will continue to do so. If you say that I acted like the minister, it is only because I am committed to having a space industry in Australia. As a South Australian I will be delighted to see rockets launched from Woomera in the near future.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1998-11-30,"—Just before we close, can I point out that the Commonwealth Crimes Act, on this question of penalty points, sets out the amount of a penalty unit. It is for the parlia 
 ment to amend that act to revise the value of the penalty. By government initiative it is amended at regular intervals to keep it current. I conclude by acknowledging and thanking the opposition, Senator Schacht in particular, for their support for our taking up their good work in ensuring that Australia can develop a good space industry and be part of the space industry. I think it is very appropriate as we enter a new millennium that we do.
I acknowledge where Senator Margetts is coming from and acknowledge the concerns she has, but this is an industry which essentially is developing in rural and regional Australia, in areas of low employment opportunities, and I think it gives people in some very remote parts of Australia considerable hope. I point out in relation to the Kistler project at Woomera that very satisfactory and amicable agreements have been reached with the local Aboriginal people which do provide them with jobs and training and some future. They welcome this development.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-11-30,"—I thank the minister for his reference to how penalty acts and points are determined. I think it is necessary for the record to point out that while the minister does thank the opposition for their assistance in facilitating this bill—and I echo some of the comments of Senator Margetts—there is a difference between commending people for their role and their work in a committee stage of a bill such as this and the implication that the people who do not necessarily support amendments moved by government—or the bill in its entirety—are somehow Luddites or do not support initiatives in space.
Senator Schacht is smiling yet again. I acknowledge that there is room for levity in the debate, Senator Schacht, but I do resent the inference, because people down this end of the chamber have sought to value add to this bill. When I say value add I mean do some of the things that I would have anticipated to be the role not only of an opposition but of the government, such as looking through this bill to ensure that things like liability and health and safety concerns are 
 covered; that we are not sending weaponry into space; and that we are giving due consideration not to whether or not radioactive substances go into space but to whether a risk and hazard assessment, for example, is prepared and tabled in the parliament beforehand.
I think many people at this end of the chamber are very much committed to space related activities and certainly advances in technology. In fact, I suggest that we down this end have probably discussed industry and science policy more in the course of the last parliament than just about anyone else in this place. For that reason I resent any implication that we were not furthering the cause. We were just doing what we thought would have been the role of a responsible government, that is, to make sure that it was done appropriately and with health and safety considerations at the fore.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-11-30,"—I want to take the opportunity to ask the minister whether the government has considered the Californian alternative to the approach to custodianship of children, that the first effort and the aim predicating the whole resolution of child support and therefore child guardianship—and I am talking about general law here not just child support, but the child support comes out of custodianship—must be that both parents be given equal custodian rights when these matters are being determined. This is quite different from the Australian approach, which is that one parent be given the primary custodian role and the other one be a supporter with access rights and so on.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-11-30,"—I do not know whether the senator is aware that reforms to the Family Court were introduced in 1996 along the lines he is talking about. That meant that the court was to encourage couples to try to reach an agreement that both parents would remain intimately involved in the child's life, in making the important decisions in the child's life and in sharing the care. I personally am very keen to see that happen for the good of Australia's children. That is part of the portfolio of the Attorney-General and I do not know whether I can take you usefully down that path much further, Senator. We believe that some of the amendments that have been moved in this child support legislation do go to ensuring that both parents have a greater involvement in their child's life. It certainly supports parents who wish to achieve greater sharing of the care and sharing of the decision making—I hope you would agree with that—and that is my purpose in anything that I do in this area.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1998-11-30,"—I will not delay the committee beyond one more submission, and I thank the minister for that. The difference between the Californian system, as I understand it, and the Australian system is that we encourage the court, with the parents, to come to a dual custodian arrangement, whereas Californian law directs 
 the court to make every effort to see that that is the outcome.
I did speak with the Attorney-General last week about this matter, and I want to take this opportunity to draw the difference to the minister's attention. Would the minister be good enough to ascertain the difference between the Californian situation and the Australian situation, as far as outcomes are concerned, since Australia moved to the encouragement model in 1996? I would be very pleased to know what the difference is, because it is a situation where there is always grounds for improvement. I think it would be excellent for the government to consider the Californian situation if it could be seen that it is working well there and is leading to an arrangement where, more often than in the Australian circumstance, both parents have a joint and equal role in the upbringing of their children.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-11-30,"—I will certainly follow up the suggestion. Although it is perhaps not kindly towards my own profession, I would also suggest that, at least in this country, the administration of the Family Law Act has become so legalistic, so adversarial in many cases—which it was not intended to be—that I think it makes it harder for parents, at a time of emotional turmoil, to come to the best decisions about their children's future. They are not always getting advice which goes to the long-term good of all the parties, and particularly the children. That may be a harsh judgment on my profession, but I fear that it has become very, very far away from what was originally intended by the government of Gough Whitlam. As I said, I will follow up what you have suggested.

(1)	 This section applies if one or more fringe benefits are provided in relation to a year of tax in respect of the employment by an employer of an employee who is a liable parent.
(2)	 The liable parent must notify the Registrar, in accordance with the regulations. of the reportable fringe benefits total of the liable parent for the year of income ending on the first 30 June after the end of the year of tax.
(3)	 The  reportable fringe benefits total  of the liable parent for the year of income is the amount worked out in accordance with the regulations taking account of the value (worked out in accordance with the regulations) of the fringe benefit or fringe benefits (other than a fringe benefit of a kind that is prescribed by the regulations).
(4)	 An expression used in this section and in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986  has the same meaning in this section as it has in that Act.
(5)	 This section applies in relation to a liable parent who is an employee of the Commonwealth, or of an authority of the Commonwealth described in paragraph (e) of the definition of employer  in subsection 136(1) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 , as if the Commonwealth or the authority were an employer for the purposes of that Act.
(6)	 This section applies in relation to a benefit that is an exempt benefit because of section 57A or 58 of the Fringe Benefit Tax Assessment Act 1986  and would be a fringe benefit apart from those Sections as if it were a fringe benefit for the purposes of that Act.

158B Penalty for failure to notify reportable fringe benefits total accurately
(1)	 A person must pay the Registrar a penalty of the amount worked out under subsection (2) if:
	 (a)	 section 158A requires the person to notify the Registrar of the person's reportable fringe benefits total for a year of income; and
	 (b)	 the person's reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income is at least 10 per cent greater than the amount that the person notified the Registrar under section 158A was the person's reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income.  

(2)	 The amount of the penalty is 10 per cent of the difference between:
	 (a)	 the administrative assessment of child support based on the person's reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income; and
	 (b)	 the amount that was or would have been the administrative assessment of child support based on the amount that the person notified the Registrar under Section 158A was the person's reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income.
(3)	 if a person is required by section 158A to notify the Registrar of the person's reportable fringe benefits total for a year of income and docs not do so as required by that section, this section operates as if the person had notified the Registrar under that section that the person's reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income was a nil amount.
(4)	 The penalty is a debt due to the Commonwealths payable when the administrative assessment mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) is made.
(5)	 The Registrar may make an administrative assessment of child support for the purposes of this section at any time.
(6)	 The Registrar may remit penalty payable under this section if he or she thinks it is fair and reasonable to do so.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that we will be supporting these amendments. For those who followed the debate, they would realise that they were the result of a discussion that evolved from the opposition moving amendments to seek to insert fringe benefits as part of assessable income for both custodial and non-custodial parents into the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 .
We had some resistance from the government initially on the grounds that they sought to deal with that matter as part of the tax package and did not want it inserted in the child support legislation at this stage. But, following a debate around the chamber, there seemed to be a deal of support for our legislative thrust, which was to include fringe benefits for both custodial and non-custodial parents in their assessable income.
I am pleased to say that, as a result of that debate being adjourned, the government has gone away and drafted the amendments before us today, which reflect the view that emerged around the chamber. It was our hope that fringe benefits would be included in the assessable income from next year, but the government has maintained that for a range of administrative reasons it would be better that it not occur until 1 July 2000. While I still have some doubts about that issue, the opposition is prepared, in the spirit of compromise 
 and a good public policy outcome, to accept that approach. So we think, and we hope, that the government's amendments accurately reflect the expressed objective of including fringe benefits in the child support legislation for the purposes of defining income. We are pleased to support them.
I might also say that we are very pleased to see that it might be possible to choose which aspects of the tax package we wish to support and which aspects we cannot. We hope this is a precedent for when we deal with the tax package later on, because the opposition will wish to support some aspects of it and to oppose other aspects—the GST being the primary one. We are pleased with and we appreciate the minister's efforts to better draft the amendments that reflect the legislative intent we are seeking and we will be supporting those amendments.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-11-30,"—I presume then from the senator's words that we shall expect to see the opposition supporting the GST on the grounds that it is going to the premiers, all of whom are very keen to receive their money under the GST. So presumably the opposition will be having some second thoughts.
I thank the Senate for the support for these amendments. As the committee would know, the government was always keen to see that the true financial position of both parents was included in any calculation of the child support formula and the implications for any particular family. We were concerned, however, that the amendments put up by the opposition would have been somewhat difficult to implement as drafted and would certainly have made for an administrative burden on the parents and also made it difficult for the agency to ensure that it had a good compliance system as part of the administration.
I do not want to take the time of the committee any longer except to say that this is something which clearly all parties around the chamber want to see happen so that nobody evades their proper responsibility in support 
 ing their children. It is an example of the Senate at its best, working together to achieve a good outcome. I thank those who have been involved in that process.",SENATE,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,29,1

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1998-11-30,"—In discussing the Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Licensed Investment Company) Bill 1998 , I wish to address the current status of the Australian film industry, the government's approaches in recent times, reservations expressed by the ALP in the lower house and several of the matters raised in the recent Senate report as tabled last week in this chamber.
Turning to the Australian film industry, it is clear there has been significant growth and great strength in this industry in recent years. Investment over the last 30 years appears to be bearing fruit in a number of states. Growth is apparent in New South Wales, as evidenced by Fox Studios investment and the location of 
 major work into that state. I am advised that studios recently built and expanded in New South Wales are booked out until the year 2002. There has been ongoing investment in Queensland in major films with large budgets using the many facilities also built in recent times in that state.
A number of Australian films are having both critical and commercial success in offshore markets, to mention but a few topical films of recent days: LA Confidential, Shine, and Babe. More importantly for our own purposes, a lot of the higher value work is being sourced these days in Australia: technicians, animators, trades persons, computer operators, graphic and design people, script writers, directors and producers. These are all pleasing developments. When one looks at the bare statistics, they show a similar story or confirm the anecdotal reports from industry and press reports. The ABS shows audiovisual production worth $1.3 billion in the last financial year. Employment figures show over 40,000 persons are employed in the industry.
Films and allied entertainment are industries of the future, based on intellectual property and creativity, requiring education, training and the ongoing development of skills, industries that are developing, which we welcome, and offer long-term and rewarding career prospects to those persons who choose to enter the relevant areas. The government's attitude in recent times has been, not to appear too churlish, somewhat disappointing. In light of the above growth and success, it is difficult to understand the government's actions in recent years. Last year's budget reduced government assistance from $97 million to $70 million. A 30 per cent cut in the outyear forecasts shows no improvement. There have been massive cuts in government support for the ABC, a critical institution for innovation, creativity and training in Australia. It has always been an important source of film and TV production and the capacity to continue that incubator role is restricted by more recent budget cuts.
When this bill was being discussed in the lower house, the ALP mentioned a number of reservations. In particular, the member for Denison expressed reservations. Basically, he 
 criticised the government for withdrawing a substantial amount of support for the film industry in recent years. Mr Kerr went on to make a number of points. Firstly, he sought an ongoing commitment to the Film Finance Corporation which, forward estimates show, is not funded past the current triennium. We repeat our support on the basis that it is a trial supplement to current funding arrangements which should remain undisturbed. We will ask the minister to formally respond to that issue in due course.
Secondly, Mr Kerr entered a caveat concerning the Senate's report. The Senate report has been down for some days now and fundamentally addresses three issues: the adequacy of the level of the proposed tax deduction, whether the capital gains tax provisions could act as a disincentive to investment and whether the scheme would be effective in attracting more investment in Australian films.
Turning to the adequacy of the level of the proposed tax deduction, most submissions to the Senate inquiry made the following points. The Gonski recommendation was for a tax deduction of 120 per cent and anything less than that was not adequate because of the high risk nature of this industry. Doubts were expressed about investment being attracted if the figure was set at no more than 100 per cent. In this context, the submission was repeated on a number of occasions that the changes being introduced by this bill were not an improvement in that context.
In respect of the capital gains tax, most submissions argued that a zero cost base of 100 per cent of sale price of shares which would be subject to CGT would also be a disincentive to investors. Many industries, one should note in passing, make the same point. In the recent industry policy inquiry conducted by the Senate Economics References Committee, many investors made the point that the capital gains tax regime in Australia appeared to inhibit investment and needed review.
The Senate report addressed whether the scheme would be effective in attracting more investment. Submissions argued that the cap of $20 million tax concession per year limited the potential for the film industry to expand. 
 FACTS argued against clause 25 of the bill which prevents FLIC from investing in a film developed or produced by commercial broadcasters. Both these objections were discussed by the Senate committee at pages 5 and 6.
I have two minor points to make in concluding. The first point I wish to address concerns clause 3.33—extending the end date of the scheme from 30 June 2002 to 30 June 2003. It is not necessarily a bad thing, and it is probably caused by delay in the passage of the bill occasioned by the recent election. This, however, should not necessarily extend the time before the scheme can be reviewed. It would be beneficial to all parties, particularly industry participants and investors, to understand the progress of the trial scheme and any potential problems or abuses foreseen or unforeseen. So we would commend to the government an earlier assessment of the scheme at 30 June 2002.
The second point I wish to address is that when the bill was first introduced in May 1998 it was thought necessary to allow up to two years to raise the total amount of concession or capital. Apparently, that is not the case now. To significantly reduce the time in which capital may be raised could have two consequences. Firstly, the failure to raise a target amount could save the government some tax concessions and moneys otherwise allocated. Secondly, there could be a rush by investors to throw money at projects without proper consideration. Either development would be unwelcome and would  defeat the purpose of the bill and the government's stated intention. If the pilot scheme opportunity to trial is based upon a more diverse set of investors, a higher level of investment and a broader base of private investment in this film industry, narrow time lines should not get in the way of its eventual success.
In summary, in the lower house the opposition did not oppose the legislation. We cooperated with the Senate inquiry process and, now that the Senate report is delivered, we voice no objection of any great substance, subject to my earlier comments about dates and time lines. The opposition will watch the progress of this trial scheme with interest and look forward to the review documents in due 
 course. As this industry appears to be developing well, we support this scheme as a vehicle to raise additional finance, to develop new projects and to expand the horizon of this influential industry in Australia. The opposition does not oppose passage of this bill.",SENATE,<title>FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT COMPANY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-11-30,"—The Democrats welcome the FLIC Scheme, albeit with some reservations. There are, I think, many unanswered questions about how it will operate. It is, I am told, without precedent. The Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 1998  falls well short of the recommendations of the Gonski report, and I think that raises concerns about the scheme's viability.
The Democrats are committed to the idea of numerous doors to funding, and we concur with the organisations which made submissions to the committee on this issue. FLIC should not replace either direct funding through the Film Corporation or 10BA. Twenty-seven million dollars has been cut from the industry over the last three years and our industry would, I think, be in dire trouble if this occurred. The last thing we need is an industry which is even more beholden than it currently is to the bean counters.
We are particularly concerned that the number of licences to be awarded is not stipulated in the legislation. We are extremely wary of one player dominating the scheme. Cultural diversity and risk taking are never served by a monopoly. We also believe that putting all our eggs in one basket will give a distorted picture of the success or lack thereof of the scheme. The Democrats will urge the minister to allocate more than one FLIC should there be a number of companies each demonstrating an ability to fulfil the criteria. We are aware that the viability of the scheme is reduced as the number of licences increases. The $40 million cap has been a major impediment to what we would see as a primary aim of ensuring diversity.
Industry groups are worried about a vertically integrated company or companies dominating the process to the point that independent and emerging film makers are locked out. So FLIC, as the legislation cur 
 rently stands, looks like an improbable vehicle if we have that goal of diversity in mind.
The exclusion of projects developed or produced by the television networks is, the Democrats think, a good start. However, this does not mean that independents and new film makers will get a look-in. At present, we do not see how the government intends to address this issue, and we eagerly await raising this during the committee stage. As usual, the government has hidden in regulations the most important information about what it intends to do.
If this means we see the same old actors and the same old formulas, then I think it will have failed. We need to see more films like Shine, Head On, Priscilla and The Boys—films that buck the complacent myths about ourselves as Australians.
As I said, we support the bill, but with some reservations, and we will seek to amend it during the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT COMPANY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—The Film Licensed Investment Company Bill 1998 , together with the Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Licensed Investment Company) Bill 1998 , essentially provide a trial mechanism to encourage investment in the Australian film industry by providing tax deductions as an incentive. The bills authorise the minister to approve film licence investment companies that will be able to offer tax deductions for investors who acquire shares in film licence investment companies or FLIC. The scheme is to run for two years until 30 June 2000. This initiative sprang from the Gonski report that reviewed funding to the film industry and which was released in January 1997.
I guess we can only wonder what would happen if we did sign up to the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. Maybe it would mean that the same tax deduction cannot distinguish between Australian films and films made overseas.
The Greens position is to support the general thrust of the initiative. As the Gonski report recognised, there are significant benefits that can be gained. They include: administrative simplicity; providing a foundation for 
 funding by moving away from project-oriented funding; certainty as to the amount of loss of revenue; the amalgamation of film production experts and experts in risk capital management; and transparency in monitoring outcomes and abuse minimisation.
The Greens are supportive of trialling creative initiatives to provide additional financial support to this vibrant industry. Film and television have become an integral part of Australian life at the end of this century. As the Gonski report noted, film and television are probably the most accessible of all cultural activities for all types of people in all parts of the world.
The film industry makes a significant economic contribution to the economy of around $1.2 billion a year, as well as employing around 40,000 people. But all Australians are winners when the film industry is on a high. Making films in Australia is not just an excellent way of showcasing the country to the world; it has a vast array of spin off benefits for our film industry, our tourism industry and for all Australians. Home-grown films make a huge contribution to expressing Australia's diverse cultural identity and engendering debate around cultural issues and current issues. It is an accessible medium for exploring diversity and promoting a more imaginative, inquiring and thoughtful society. Aussie films carry these diverse messages both domestically and internationally, and often provide springboards for young aspiring actors to break into the international scene. And, of course, there is a sense of pride generated when our films and actors win international awards.
Let us look at the elements of the Greens (WA) position on this bill. First, we are supportive of trialling initiatives. We note that the government has taken on board concerns expressed in the industry, and fashioned this initiative as a trial running parallel with current tax concessions provided for in divisions 1OBA and lOB of part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This is a positive measure that will ensure this initiative achieves desired outcomes without undercutting current funding processes
Secondly, the Greens (WA) are supportive of additional funding support for the film industry. We do not support a shift in funding responsibility from the public to the private purse. We recognise that there is significant scope for private funding in this industry. However, it is crucial to be mindful of the importance of retaining a mix of both public and private funding sources for the purposes of diversity.
The Gonski review made this point very clearly. Gonski was unambiguously in favour of continuing direct government assistance to provide a solid production slate and to counteract the capricious nature of the industry. The Gonski report stated:
The Review believes that the Commonwealth assistance has been critical to the building and development of the industry to this current level of expertise and quality.
The Gonski review quite clearly did not advocate replacement of direct government funding with indirect assistance available through tax concessions. In fact, the Gonski report quite specifically advocated direct funding to continue to be the principal mechanism for funding. One of the Gonski recommendations was:
that the Government recognise that to achieve its cultural objectives within a commercially driven Australian film and television industry, there will be a continuing need for Government assistance and non-commercial rates of return.
This view has been echoed in the submissions by Southern Star Entertainment to the Senate standing committee on environment, recreation and the arts.
The Greens (WA) have some significant concerns about the government's long-term intentions for public funding in this industry. The record of the last term in government shows that the coalitions commitment to properly funding the film industry is questionable. It is consistent with the governments short-term slash and burn budgetary behaviour that they have withdrawn substantial support from the Australian film industry.
The government provides substantial assistance to the industry through the Australian Film Finance Corporation Limited. The FFC has made a substantial contribution to the 
 industry. Although it has not had a 100 per cent success rate, it has invested in many successful productions. The government has not shown a very serious commitment to the continuing success of this dynamic industry. Since coming to office, the coalition has made budget cuts of $27 million. Funding has gone from $97 million to just $70 million. That is a huge chunk of funding that the government has retracted from the industry—nearly 30 per cent. And that is only the money directly allocated to the film industry.
Of course, there have also been enormous cuts to the ABC. The ABC has proved to be a creative birthplace for innovative and informative film and television production. However, their ability to continue the volume and quality has been seriously undermined by the government pulling on the purse strings.
In light of these slashes in funding, the Greens (WA) share the concerns of the Australian Writers Guild that this initiative may give the impression that large additional benefits have been bestowed on the film industry. Clearly this is not the case. The estimated cost of this trial is around $20 million, which does not even replace the money ripped directly out of the film budget.
While the Greens (WA) will be supporting this bill, there have been a number of concerns expressed by the industry and I would like to put them on the record. The first concern relates to the adequacy of the measure. Amongst others, the Screen Producers Association, the Australian Writers Guild, the New South Wales Film and Television Office, Southern Star Entertainment and the Australian Screen Directors Association have questioned whether the FLIC proposal is sufficiently attractive to be a viable basis for private funding. There is concern the initiative falls too far short of the original Gonski proposal that gave allowances and consideration for the inherently risky and volatile nature of the investment in the film industry.
Firstly, the 100 per cent tax concession falls short of the suggested l20 per cent in the Gonksi report. The Gonski report specifically envisaged that the deduction would be over 100 per cent to provide appropriate incentives; and secondly, the capital gains tax 
 treatment of the resale of shares is significantly more harsh than that recommended by Mr Gonski. He recommended that there be an adjustment on capital gains so that the gains are not taxed from the first dollar.
There are also important concerns expressed that the measure would not be of benefit to film-makers outside Sydney and Melbourne and, in particular, small independent film-makers. The aim is that FLIC would benefit investors by enabling investors to invest in a FLIC and minimise their risks, as they would be spread over a number of projects rather than a single investment.
However, this enables the FLIC to control the investment in films, and there is an anxiety that they would favour the large established film makers in Sydney and Melbourne who have an advantage in attracting investors—they are obviously making a number of films all together.
Government or targeted funding is even more important in South Australia, Queensland and my own state of Western Australia, because the bulk of production is centralised in Victoria and New South Wales. More funding in these other areas would give a lot more film makers opportunities they would not normally get unless they are moved to Sydney or Melbourne. Good films do come out of these areas. Shine is an obvious example—its production was based in Adelaide.
So the possible reduction in diversity is a huge concern, and I hope this is one which the government has a clear eye on when the two-year trial is up for evaluation. Certainly, the Greens will keep an eye on the government budgetary allocation, along with the other valid concerns expressed by the industry, to ensure that this initiative is not a mere smokescreen to reduce further public spending for the film industry in the future.",SENATE,<title>FILM LICENSED INVESTMENT COMPANY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1998-11-30,"—I thank all honourable senators who have contributed to this debate. Even though I was not able to pay full attention to Senator Margetts's contribution, because we were working out how to deal with some amend 
 ments that may come up in the committee stage—I apologise to Senator Margetts for that—I understand from the bits I heard of Senator Bishop's and Senator Allison's speeches that they were in support of the legislation. I welcome that support and commend the bill to the Senate.

"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1998-11-30,"—The wheels of government move inexorably slowly, and this bill that we are debating now, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 , is a classic example of how slowly things do move in this legislature. On 20 March last year, 1997, with great fanfare, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, announced a range of what he called significant changes that government would make to refugee and immigration decision making and the review systems. Here we are tonight, some 18 months later, dealing with what was then described as urgent legislation. 
With the fanfare that accompanied the minister's legislation at the time, an uninformed person in the community would have thought that the wheels of government were standing still in order for this legislation to pass. Of course, they did not. The legislation 
 was hastily prepared and the government itself had to make some very significant changes to its own legislation. The bill, introduced as No. 4 of 1997, contained a privative clause that we, the Labor Party, in opposition bitterly opposed and will continue to oppose. The minister, in his wisdom—one has to commend him for this—accepted that that opposition was in existence and agreed to remove that particular clause from No. 4 bill and put it in a separate bill, No. 5, so that No. 4 bill could proceed.
No. 4 bill, dealing with the amalgamation of the various review tribunals, the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Migration Internal Review Office, was referred by the Senate Standing Committee on the Selection of Bills on 4 September 1997 to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 20 October 1997. A very short reporting period was given to the committee to conduct its inquiry, but the committee did proceed with its inquiry and held hearings in Melbourne on 16 September 1997 and on 9 October 1997. The committee also received some 20 submissions from organisations and members of the community.
The majority of the committee put in a report on the bill with conclusions that the bill essentially should be passed in its current form. I may be misrepresenting the committee slightly. They did have some conclusions, but the recommendation that the majority of the committee put forward was that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5) be passed without amendments. Earlier in the report there was also a recommendation about bill No. 4. It was exactly the same recommendation on bill No. 4 that I have just read out dealing with bill No. 5.
The bill did not pass. The legislation actually sat on the Senate Notice Paper all through the first half of this year. It was in the government's control to press the bill forward should it choose to do so, but the government chose not to do so. Part of the reason that the government chose not to proceed with its own bill was the minority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, a minority report that was put in by 
 Senator Bolkus and me on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and Senator Andrew Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats.
May I take the opportunity to praise the processes of the Senate committee system. We are witnessing here, as we debate this bill, the merits of such a committee system. Despite the very short period of time that the committee had to scrutinise the bill and take evidence from the community, from the public, the minority of the committee did come up with very reasoned and very considered recommendations. I am very pleased to report that the government has taken these into account. It has taken them into account in the new bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998, that is before the chamber tonight. That is a classic example of how a committee can contribute to good legislation in this country. It is a credit to the minister and to the department that that should happen. Indeed, some credit has to be given on this side of the parliament as well, that we in turn put in the effort in a very considered way to arrive where we are today. I am dealing with bill No. 4 and not what was bill No. 5.
The changes that are proposed in the merging of MIRO with the Immigration Review Tribunal were not something that we in the opposition, in the Labor Party, supported, but we did recognise that the government had a brief for this particular merger. We are not convinced at this time that merging them into the Migration Review Tribunal will better serve the community than the current system does. There are some problems, admittedly, with the current system as MIRO stands and as it moves on to the Immigration Review Tribunal, but they are not insurmountable. But I do not want to go back and revisit that debate and the informal dialogue that took place between the parties on this matter. It is the will of the government that the merger take place and the MRT be established, and we will now go along with that, but we will be watching its progress very carefully as it pans through.
The new structure, the new system, might serve the minister's ideals, though we have 
 some doubts that it will meet all of the ideals. But the more important question that one has to ask oneself in this matter is: will it serve the community interest? That is what we will be particularly watching as the new system comes into play.
I put on the record the gratitude of those on this side of the Senate to the minister for the fruitful negotiations that have led to a more reasoned starting time for the new tribunal. There are persons currently holding office on the present Immigration Review Tribunal who, if the new tribunal had been set up in the time frame that the minister first announced last year, would have found themselves in some difficult circumstances because the life plan they had knocked out for themselves had taken into account their appointment period. That could have been thrown into some jeopardy. With the flexibility in the start-up time of this Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) that problem will be alleviated in the main for those members, most of whom have given long and very dedicated service to the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Migration Internal Review Office. It is less of a problem for the officers of the MIRO than it is for the officers of the Immigration Review Tribunal.
We still have some concerns about where the offices of the new MRT will be located. During the committee hearings the difficulties for somebody living in Perth, for example, on the other side of the continent, were stressed. The concern was over how available the tribunal would be to them were they wishing to have a personal hearing in front of the tribunal. There is a fear, and it is probably going to be confirmed during the committee stage of this bill, that the IRT office in Perth will not be continued under the new regime of the MRT. And that is probably the case with some of the other MRT offices—if those decisions have yet been made. They had not been made at the time the department appeared before the committee at its first hearing in Melbourne last year. One would hope that those decisions have now been made and the community can be informed.
We are aware that it is not always necessary to have a tribunal member placed in the 
 capital cities. As travel has become more accessible and widespread and even cheaper there is a flexibility for tribunal members, as is the case with the Refugee Review Tribunal, which has offices only in Sydney and Melbourne. They quite frequently travel to Perth and further afield—even as far as Port Headland from time to time—to hold their hearings. So we do understand that a certain degree of flexibility is available.
In the minority report, we expressed some concerns about the matter of videoconferencing. I am pleased to see that the minister has read that minority report. In a number of speeches he has given since the report was delivered he has made reference to the fact that we are seen to be in opposition to video conferencing. It is something that is much more widespread than it used to be. We still have some concerns about video conferencing. There will be cases before the tribunal where it will not be appropriate for a whole host of reasons, be they cultural or the personality of the individual. With a camera put in front of them, a person may not necessarily be able to respond during a video conference. One would hope that the department and the tribunal, when this matter is put to them, will treat it with a great deal of caution and will make decisions that will be to the ease of the applicant who is appearing before the tribunal.
Although the IRT in its present form tries to be as user-friendly as possible—and I commend the tribunal members for that effort—there is, nevertheless, and has to be, a certain degree of formality about tribunal proceedings. That can be and is daunting to many of the applicants before it. However, individuals are as relaxed as they can be when they appear before the tribunal. But it is not going to be so easy to bring about that relaxation while a television camera is pointed at them and their voice is being recorded. So whilst we do not have an outright objection to the use of videoconferencing in these matters, we do have some concerns that it should be taken into account.
I have been very guarded in my comments tonight on this particular bill, after the events of last week. I digress very briefly from the bill. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will 
 recall that, together with my colleagues Senator Schacht and the previous speaker, Senator Cooney, I made impassioned pleas that a visa ought to be granted to Mr Gerry Adams MP so he could visit Australia. My speech was made on the Wednesday afternoon and within 48 hours the minister, Mr Ruddock, granted that visa. I do not want to take all the credit for that. I would like to give some of the credit to Senator Patterson, who was sitting in the minister's chair when other senators and I made the plea.
In her response in the second reading debate she said that she would make representations to the minister. So we have to give Senator Patterson some credit for bringing this matter to a very speedy and sensible conclusion. I am grateful. I am also grateful to the minister himself. He was the one who signed the visa. For that reason we are all grateful. It is a good decision and I do not have a problem, standing here in opposition, commending good decisions when they are made. It is not the first time—I am not breaking the ice in doing this—and hopefully it will not be the last time. This may be in one particular portfolio area. I do not see it happening in other portfolio areas. Certainly with some of the speeches that I am currently preparing I cannot see it happening. But that is a digression from the particular bill before us at the moment.
I now return to it and conclude with comments about credit being given to the scrutiny that bills are subjected to by the Senate committee system. Again we see in this particular set of legislation the merits of such a scrutiny. One of the drawbacks in this instance was that the committee had a very short reporting date, an unrealistic reporting date, with something like six weeks from the initial reference to reporting back. With the passage of time and the benefit of hindsight, it seems the committee could have been allowed a lot more time to undertake its inquiry and perhaps even taken evidence in parts of Australia other than Sydney and Melbourne. That might have helped the process even more than the short, sharp inquiry that the bill was subjected to.
The second creditable thing is the fact that a report and a minority report were submitted to the parliament, because the minority report has proved to be of value. It has only been of value to the government because the government, in turn, has studied the content of the minority report, seen sense, and taken account of the objections raised by the minority when drafting and preparing the new bill that is before us tonight. With those words I commend the processes that I have spoken about. I again express my gratitude to my colleagues, Senator Patterson and the minister, for the very good decision to grant a visa to Mr Gerry Adams.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-11-30,"—The Senate is addressing the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  which follows through on the government's decision of early 1997 to merge the Immigration Review Tribunal and the Migration Internal Review Office, within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, to form a new tribunal. This legislation is, as Senator McKiernan said, a slightly improved version of what was known as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) from the previous parliament. It is probably worth noting, from my perspective, that that bill has actually been around in this chamber longer than I have. That gives some indication of how long it has languished.
A Senate committee reported on the bill on 20 October last year, a few days before my entry into this chamber. It is probably worth mentioning the frequent problem that Senate legislation committees have with the very tight time frames that they have to operate within. If we are having to rush through inquiries into legislation and then those bills hang around for 12 months or more, that does make one wonder whether or not it might be appropriate to enable the Senate committees to have a little bit more time to look into legislation. This is particularly so, given that this case is an example where some of the suggestions from the minority report and some of the evidence that came forth during the course of the inquiry have been taken on board by the government and have produced improved legislation, which—as Senator 
 McKiernan quite rightly said—is one of the major benefits of the Senate performing its role as a mechanism for parliamentary scrutiny of legislation proposed by the government.
The Democrats recognise the improvements made to this bill compared with the original version. The concerns that we had with the original, the then No. 4 amendment bill, were outlined in the minority report from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which was done by my colleague Senator Andrew Murray on behalf of the Democrats. One of the concerns which we highlighted in that minority report is an ongoing issue. It does not impact one way or the other, in a sense, on the content of this bill but it impacts on the implementation of, and the operation of, the new tribunal in the same way as it is a concern in relation to existing tribunals and courts.
I refer to the ongoing attacks and expressions of concern by the government and the minister, which can certainly be perceived as trying to influence the independence of these tribunals. There was another piece in the Australian today, by Fiona Carruthers and Bernard Lane, reporting an attack by the immigration minister on judges for `allowing their personal views to interfere with legal decisions on migration matters'. I know that similar concerns and annoyance have been expressed by the immigration minister in relation to the actions and the decisions of various tribunal members.
There have been concerns from the point of view of people dealing with tribunals—from the consumer end—that the independence of those tribunal members who are appointed through the minister can be impacted if they feel that they need to bring down decisions that are more in favour with what the minister believes is appropriate. That is an ongoing concern which applies to all tribunals and to the courts, to a lesser extent in general, and the Democrats will be keeping an eye on it. We highlighted that concern in the minority report.
The crucial aspect of tribunals such as these is their ability to deliver justice and a fair outcome to the Australian public and to the 
 people that appeal to these tribunals. Other issues involved are accessibility, which is another concern that was raised by Senator McKiernan, particularly in terms of whether people outside the major capital cities will be able to access tribunal services readily. There are also the cost of appealing to tribunals, which is another ongoing concern, and the speediness of decisions.
For elaboration, I will highlight a little of the actual work of the existing Immigration Review Tribunal which will be merged with the MIRO into the new Migration Review Tribunal. Its most recent annual report highlights the importance of the work of the tribunal. The amount of government appropriations that went into the tribunal last year was over $6 million. Nearly 2,700 separate cases were lodged in the last financial year.
The major issue, which is one that needs ongoing examination, is the age of the various cases and the amount of time that it takes for cases to be finalised. The annual report from last year highlights 16 per cent of cases that were more than one year old. There are a range of other statistics in there, which I will not go into in detail, but certainly getting those times down is an issue of great importance whether you are speaking from the point of view of the people who are applying to the tribunal or who are appealing, or from the point of view of the government in terms of ensuring that determinations are made one way or the other as speedily as possible.
Whilst it is not specifically in this bill, it is also worth mentioning, as the previous speaker outlined, that in the early stages of the initial No. 4 legislation the government's proposal was to restrict access of people to appeal to the courts via a privative clause. This was also considered by the Senate legislation committee over 12 months ago in what was known as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5). Thankfully that was not brought on by the government, although in some ways it might have been better if it had because they would have seen it voted down and given the fate it deserved.
It is a matter of great concern to the Democrats that the Prime Minister has again raised his intention to reintroduce this legislation. I 
 cannot understand why the government seems to want to continue to pursue that measure. The Senate committee of inquiry not only showed that this was an unfair measure, which may or may not be of concern to the government, but it also showed it was quite clearly unworkable and quite probably unconstitutional. It seems a strange thing for the government to put any effort at all into trying to reintroduce such completely unacceptable legislation on all of those grounds. Whilst I guess it is always a very dangerous practice to predict Senate decisions on particular legislation, I would be extremely surprised if that one were to be passed by this chamber. I would suggest it would be highly irresponsible of the Senate to do so.
I note the Prime Minister's remarks when he did formally announce that he was planning to reintroduce legislation to restrict access to the judicial review in all but `exceptional circumstances', which was part of his keynote address to the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia, held in Brisbane on 20 November this year. It does seem puzzling why the Prime Minister (1) is still going down this path and (2) why he seemed to think it would be helpful to announce that at a Federation of Ethnic Community Councils conference, given the outcome of the federal election and the clear rejection by the Australian electorate of the unfair and discriminatory policies put forward by parties such as One Nation. Why the Prime Minister still feels the need to highlight legislation which can really only be seen as an unfair attack on potential migrants is puzzling to me. I do wonder what the motivation is behind it.
I also note that, when the Prime Minister made those remarks, he talked about reintroducing this legislation and said that it had been `delayed in the Senate'. I think this is part of an ongoing campaign, and quite a dishonest one, on the part of at least some in the government to try to paint the Senate as a house of obstruction—as something that holds up legislation and that unnecessarily obstructs and obfuscates just for the hell of it. Clearly, in this case, this is a piece of legislation that was not delayed by the Senate; it 
 was delayed by the government, for what reasons I do not know. It was clearly most misleading on the part of the Prime Minister in that speech to accuse the Senate of being the body responsible for this legislation taking so long to pass.
As we can see from the speeches already made, this legislation will not be opposed by this chamber. It will not be opposed by the ALP and it will not be opposed by the Democrats. When there is such a widespread degree of support or at least a willingness to pass this legislation, it is completely unacceptable to try to blame the Senate for holding up this legislation.
In conclusion I would like to reinforce the remarks of the previous speaker by indicating how pleasing it is to see a minister who is willing to take on board concerns that arise from Senate inquiry processes and concerns expressed by various parties when they are considering legislation. I hope it is something that is taken on board by a larger number of ministers. Nonetheless, the Democrats will be watching the operations of the new Migration Review Tribunal with interest to make sure that it does deliver more fully on those key issues of providing a fair mechanism to people who are appealing to the tribunal, as well as an inexpensive, an accessible and a quick mechanism for providing determinations. It is on those key issues that the success or otherwise of this particular government initiative will be judged.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-11-30,"—I rise on behalf of the opposition. As has already been indicated by the previous speaker, my colleague Senator McKiernan, the opposition supports this Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 . I want to pay tribute to Senator McKiernan and to my colleague Senator Bolkus for the work they put in on the Senate committee when it dealt with this in the last parliament. Also, my colleague Senator Barney Cooney, who will speak shortly, has always had a very strong interest in what you would call the human rights arrangement issues relating to anything to do with the right of people to appeal in the judicial process. Senator Cooney's views on this matter are 
 extremely consistent and have been for all the time he has been in this parliament.
The opposition has no objection to this bill as it is now proposed although we would point out that we did have some objections which were indicated in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report of October last year, now 13 months ago. The issues we raised in there, we are pleased to say, generally have been picked up by the government in the amendments they have now accepted in the bill they have introduced back into the parliament since the election.
There are three areas in which the bill has been changed and which the opposition finds acceptable, and as a result we will support the bill. The first change the government has adopted will allow the Migration Review Tribunal to commence operation at a time to be set by proclamation. This will allow time for administrative arrangements to be put in place. The government indicates that, nevertheless, the new tribunal will be in operation within six months of the bill receiving royal assent. The second change provides that the migration refugee review tribunals are to formally hand down the decisions in cases where there has not been an oral decision and the applicant is not in immigration detention. Finally, there are further changes for certainty in relation to the dispatch of documents from the tribunals.
The thrust of the government's proposal is that the present two-tiered structure of review is cumbersome, time consuming and expensive. I have to say from the evidence before the committee and in the government's own second reading speech that by any normal judgment of commonsense by ordinary citizens the delay in the handling of these review matters—it can be up to nearly two years—is too great. The cost, as indicated in the committee's report on evidence from the department, I think was $15 million for the Refugee Review Tribunal per annum and the Migration Independent Review Tribunal was running at around $3 million or $4 million. Whichever way you look at it that is a large whack of money.
The cost of justice is high but, as one who has argued that the cost of justice in Australia 
 has been far too high for far too long, I do accept that that argument cannot be ignored, and $15 million for the Refugee Review Tribunal is a very large amount of money. So I do accept that is a legitimate reason for the government to look at this. I can imagine the finance minister driving Mr Ruddock, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, mad at what are called the preliminary discussions in the ERC and the face to face discussions—and I can imagine there is some bureaucrat in the finance department saying $15 million is too much and we are going to slash $3 million or $4 million off it. I will bet you that was put on the document somewhere. The officials are smiling—they should not smile, I know—but I suspect that is somewhere close to the mark. I have had some experience of that myself.
Finance says it is expensive but, on the humanitarian side, we have to be very careful for the sake of our international reputation as well as for ethical reasons and the international arrangements we have to handle refugees. In one sense we might say $15 million is cheap at the price if we get it right about people having the right to come to Australia as refugees and having their appeals heard because, as we all know, if we get the decision wrong and send someone back who told us at the appeal that they had a justifiable fear of persecution if they returned home, if we reject that and they do go home and are persecuted, detained, beaten up, tortured or, in extreme cases, lose their lives, that is a decision that weighs heavily in any of these matters. No-one wants to see that happen to any citizen, particularly from a country like ours where we hold the issues of democracy and human rights so very highly.
I have to say that on this matter I give the present minister top marks for being a consistent proponent of human rights in this parliament since I have been here—and he has been here a lot longer than I have. I accept that he is genuine in his support for human rights. As a backbencher, long before he was a minister, he was consistently arguing those cases as an active member of Amnesty International. I have to say I suspect that on a number of occasions he was out of step with the majority 
 view of his own coalition parties. But he has always held those views. As the first person to invite me to go to Cambodia, way back in 1988, I accept that Phil Ruddock is genuine about this. On balance, I do not think he would be moving these proposals without weighing up his own experience, not to say that he would not have been under some pressure from the finance department, Treasury and a few other recalcitrants who do not want anything to do with migrants or refugees in Australia.
The issue that he raises is whether the new proposals—and this is the centre of the debate—do afford protection under the review arrangements for somebody to claim they are being harshly treated and should be allowed to stay in Australia, particularly in the refugee case. I think that the proposals here—and the opposition has this view—on balance seem to be able to work. However, as I said only last week on another bill, no-one is ever going to get it 100 per cent perfectly correct about the review procedures in immigration or tribunal matters. They are dealing with so many different cases there will always be arguments about someone who has been harshly dealt with.
The balance here again between the right of the individual and the collective right of society to establish its own rules to ensure that it is protected as well and is not open to abuse by individuals using legal devices to get around the collective view of the society is always a fine balance. We give the benefit of the doubt here. We believe the amendments the government has accepted from the opposition as a result of the committee's work have meant that we can support this bill. It will be a different matter when the next the bill, which in the old parliament was called Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 5), comes up. I suppose in this parliament it will be called Migration Legislation Amendment Bill No. 2.
—Or No. 10.
—Or No. 10. Whenever it does, under whatever chronological number it is given, there will be a different view expressed by the opposition at that time. But we will support this bill and we have no 
 amendments to move. We believe the bill, after all the work done by my colleagues over 13 months or more, is a reasonable bill that overwhelmingly the parliament can support.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-11-30,"—I am pleased to follow Senator Schacht, who talks about the cost adjusters. Years ago, he was the person that suggested that the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee undertake that task of looking at the cost adjusters, and I think much has flowed from that, not only through the Senate but generally throughout the law. As was said in the second reading speech and indeed in the explanatory memorandum, the idea is to get justice at as reasonable a price as possible. That is an important matter that has been weighed in the balance now for quite some time, going back to those times when Senator Schacht suggested we undertake an examination of this area.
The opposition supports this  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 , but there are some problems with it which I want to talk about—not so much about the bill but more about the attitude that is adopted by those presenting the bill. Under `Financial impact statement', paragraph 5 of the overview of the explanatory memorandum illustrates what I mean. It says:
The primary aim of the changes being introduced to the RRT is to produce faster decision making.
That sends out a message that what this is all about is to expeditiously get some sort of decision. I am sure the parliamentary secretary, who is in the chamber, would not go along with what might follow from that because she is a person who is dedicated—as indeed is the minister—to the issue of justice, but the message that comes out from that statement is a worrying one. I will repeat it:
The primary aim of the changes being introduced to the RRT is to produce faster decision making.
I would have hoped that the primary aim of the changes was to ensure that—
—Justice was done.
—That justice was done, as the shadow minister said. There are some other signs that the approach taken by those preparing this legislation is not so much concerned with giving people a fair hearing 
 but concerned more with saving money or having some sort of hearing—whether that hearing has substance or not being an irrelevant issue. In other words, you can have a situation where you have an illusion of justice, where what is applied is a form rather than a substance, with the person presiding over the hearing being directed and being under all sorts of restraints and not able, therefore, to bring forth justice in the way that is needed. The second reading speech says:
Taken together, these changes mean that people with bona fide review applications will be given a decision more quickly and a better decision if the initial decision is wrong. Those persons intent on fraud, deception or delay will not have the benefits of a delayed decision.
What is the point of saying that? What is the point of making that sort of statement about a process? If a person has a reason for delay—and courts are delayed at times—that is legitimate, why should that person be a person who is intent on fraud or deception? Why does it follow? Where is the evidence for making what is quite a vicious statement, without the evidence being put forward in the second reading speech?
Another statement in the second reading speech says:
Migration Review Tribunal members will be independent decision makers, able to reach their own conclusions on a decision under review, in accordance with the law. However, this independence does not amount to non-accountability.
What does that mean, and how does that fit with the sorts of things that the Chief Justice of the High Court says? At a colloquium about courts in the future, held at Surfers Paradise on 8 November, the Chief Justice gave a talk called `The future state of the judicature'. He said:
The development and enforcement of standards of competence and diligence is a difficult issue with which courts and legislatures have to grapple. The requirements of independence and accountability are not mutually inconsistent but they can, in some circumstances, conflict. The resolution of such conflict will be a pre-occupation of those concerned with the governance of the courts over the next decade.
You have the Chief Justice of the High Court struggling with this concept of measuring accountability against the issue of the way the 
 courts ought to go about their business, yet the people who wrote this second reading speech seem to have had no difficulty in saying that that is a fairly simple issue to resolve. The other thing that worries me about this second reading speech is that in the paragraph immediately above the one I have just read, it has this to say:
The Tribunal's Principal Member will have clear authority to apply efficient processing practices. This may include the introduction of a case management system where much of the preliminary research and investigative work would be undertaken by administrative staff of the Tribunal. Tribunal members would be responsible for directing any further investigation be undertaken, and for the final decision.
You have people who are not even legally qualified, but are administrative people, doing preliminary research. What is going to be the quality of the decision if we are going to have people who have no general idea of how the law should run making decisions that determine people's lives. These are big decisions that are being made in this matter. His Honour, in that speech I was talking about, also has this to say:
Litigants are frequently unrepresented by lawyers and conduct their cases in person, and an over enthusiastic or unthinking application of some of the principles of modern case management to disputes of this kind can be counter productive.
This second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum seem to have been written without taking into account these high principles of justice. What the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum seem to be intent upon is getting the form of a hearing despatched with as cheaply as possible. That is the language that is used, compared with the language that the Chief Justice is talking about. Again, the thrust of what is put forward in the second reading speech and in the explanatory memorandum is that there has to be efficiency—indeed, I think the act talks about efficiency—and the need to get things done—the language of the economist, the language of the economic theorist who says that the big thing is to produce decisions as quickly as possible and as cheaply as possible. What about a bit of justice in there? Again in this speech, His Honour says:
It is impossible to measure the effectiveness of the judiciary as an institution, or to attempt to predict the extent to which such effectiveness may, in the future, wax or wane, without having a reasonably clear idea of the functions historically, and currently, performed by the judiciary as an institution.
But in the way this bill has been presented to this chamber, there is no flavour of the historical background to the judiciary as an institution. Indeed, one of the great problems about this legislation—of course, it is not confined to this legislation; it is a problem which more and more legislation has—is this: people are appointed for a limited time. Under this legislation you can have part-time people and you can have full-time people who are appointed on a time basis, and that provides a very dangerous basis upon which these people can make decisions against government.
One of the flaws in more and more legislation coming before more and more parliaments is the fact that these tribunals are set up to decide issues between people and governments and the decision makers are in a very precarious position. It would be interesting to go through—perhaps the minister at the table can do this—the number of people who have not been reappointed over the years, to see what sort of decisions they made in the terms of the act that they administered. Again in this context, I will quote what His Honour Justice Gleeson has to say about that:
In this area also, the way in which the courts go about their business reflects, and affects, society's values. For example, the amenability of governments to civil process, the capacity of the courts to intervene in disputes between citizens and governments, the power of judges to make orders binding governments, and the way in which courts handle cases involving claims against government, reflect an ideal of equality before the law which is relatively modern, and which is certainly not universal. It is not an ideal which is likely to be displaced in the foreseeable future. Governments will continue to be active litigants, frequently as defendants. The functions of the courts in dealing with complaints against governments is likely to expand rather than contract, and that function, in turn, will constantly remind the public of the need for an independent judiciary. The expectations and assumptions made by the public that a citizen engaged in a civil or criminal dispute with the government will receive even-handed justice constitute a vital, but often neglected test of what is sometimes called satisfac 
 tion with the performance of the courts. In fact, I can think of no more important test.
I ask: was that test applied when this legislation was being drawn up? It certainly does not appear from the second reading speech or from the explanatory memorandum that it was. Perhaps that is an illustration of where we should stop having tribunals that are appointed for a limited time and go to a magistracy.
I know one of the things the present Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Williams, has been advocating is that we have a federal magistracy that can handle matters like this and that will be protected from the onslaughts that governments might make upon it by two things: firstly, the magistracy would have tenure—they would have their positions until they are 70—and, secondly, the magistracy would have a pension. The present situation where decisions in the migration area are reviewed by people who have not got permanency of position, who have insecurity of tenure, is a real problem. It is a problem that is growing, and it is a problem that we ought to do something about.
The issue is this: is this legislation and the legislation which came before it—this idea of a tribunal of limited tenure is not new—sufficient to give justice to people who come before this new tribunal? Will it be sufficient to stand up against government and give the decisions it ought to, particularly when you look at the sorts of words that have been written in the explanatory memorandum and the sorts of words that have been used in the second reading speech? Will it be able to stand up against government when we have a department whose disposition is to treat people that appeal its decisions as suspect or as fraudulent? The words used are very interesting: `Intent upon fraud, deception or delay'.
This is not the right sort of attitude, you would have thought, to bring to legislation like this. This is a department which thinks in terms of economy rather than in terms of justice, fairness and full hearings. It wants to get this thing up and away rather than allow the culture of the judiciary, the culture of the fair go, to carry the day. Rather, the culture 
 of the economy, the culture of getting things done quickly, is what prevails here.
This is a piece of legislation that will go through—it has been agreed upon—but it comes to this chamber in a context which is in many respects unattractive. Perhaps it is not so much that the legislation ought to change, but that the people who will administer it ought to realise that not only are they enforcing legislation, not only are they regulators, but also they should be facilitators, in the proper circumstances. The people they deal with—migrants and people who have, say, made claims for refugee status which have been refused—are nevertheless people with the sorts of feelings and emotions that we all have.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-11-30,"—To start with, I would like to point out the fact that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  is amongst those that should not necessarily be on the list for debate right now. It is not one of the ones on the list that was asterisked; that is, it is not one of the bills the government said was urgent in this session of parliament. Perhaps the government wants to keep talking about recalcitrants in the Senate and, at the same time, bring on bills that have not been notified to the Senate but are urgent for this session. We had a debate this morning about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill (No. 2) 1998. It looks like that bill is going to be rushed on as well. Perhaps the general idea is that you bring on a bill so that the rest of the chamber is not able to give its full attention to it because you have not told them it is coming on in this particular session of parliament.
Essentially, the  Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  does two major things. Firstly, the bill merges the two-tier review process for non-refugee visa decisions—departmental review and review by the independent Immigration Review Tribunal—into a single review by the newly created external review body, the Migration Review Tribunal. Secondly, it provides a range of new procedures for the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal, including empowering the principal member of the 
 Refugee Review Tribunal to issue general directions to tribunal members granting both principal members the power to reconstitute a tribunal during a hearing in specific circumstances.
Let us look at the background and ideology of this bill. The bill was introduced in May 1997 as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997 by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Philip Ruddock. That bill, as it was introduced, reflected the majority of the provisions of the current bill. However, it also provided for a privative clause in relation to immigration decisions aimed at narrowing the possibility of judicial review of relevant tribunal decisions by the Federal Court and the High Court.
We have seen that part of this has been split off. The ideology behind this privative clause was that there was a huge number of rorts in the immigration sector. The Bills Digest outlines the immense flaws in this argument. While considerable media and other attention is given to people who arrive in Australia in boats without any authorisation—that is, boat people—the actual effects such people have on overall programs is relatively minor. Between the start of 1989-90 and the end of 1995-96, 2,508 boat people arrived in Australia without authorisation. Of these, 1,755 have been removed from Australia—and you can only wonder with what justice all of them were removed. During 1995-96, 589 boat people arrived in 14 boats. Of these, 413 have been removed—once again, with what justice?—with an average time before removal of 17 days. In 1997-98, 13 boats carrying 159 people arrived in Australia without authorisation.
In this ideological context, we can see that we are blaming refugees for just about everything. This bill is problematic and represents further erosions for refugees. We can only wonder whether it is another attempt to appeal to the populist scapegoating mentality, that is, there are lots of things happening, the government and the opposition have been involved in quite a lot of them, but let us draw attention away from the real issues in Australia—economic rationalism and the impacts of 
 massive economic and social changes—concentrate on refugees and see if we can get some populist support for doing so, perhaps through talkback radio and so on.
The Greens have some serious concerns about this Bill. Primarily, we share the concerns that were identified during the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee consideration of this bill. Unfortunately, these issues have not been adequately addressed by the government's amendments, and the Greens are extremely disappointed that the ALP are not moving amendments to deal with the substantive issues that they themselves have raised. I notice Senator Cooney mentioned a number of them.
These concerns include: the erosion of the independence of the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal and the lack of requirements to provide adverse information to applicants—that is, the concern that adverse information is to be based on the individual alone and not the group. Often the situational plight faced by the group is crucial information and it is often impossible to appreciate the risk without taking into account evidence that relates to the group—but here we have left it to the individual.
Personal appearances before the Refugee Review Tribunal by telephone or television are possibly the thin edge of the wedge—the beginning of an `efficiency dividend' to actually reduce the number of tribunals and problems. There was evidence that there are problems here in relation to legal representation and language, if this results in people not getting equal access under the law.
There are also concerns with the changed discretion regarding the publication of decisions—that is, it may lead to problems in transparency, in general development of jurisprudence in this area and in scrutiny of decisions, especially those which may be criticised. You may have a situation where controversial decisions are not publicised.
We had a situation where two Refugee Review Tribunal members were subjected to pressure by the principal member to not consider specific refugee cases dealing with East Timorese asylum seekers. Consequently, we have a minister's office requesting a halt 
 on such cases, pending formulation of government policy. We can but wonder whether or not this is one of the driving forces in that area. Also, in December 1996, the minister publicly criticised members of a tribunal that granted refugee status to a woman on the ground of domestic violence. This may be seen by some to be another ideological reason in relation to refugee status.
In relation to the adverse information, it may well be, as Mr Robert Gotterson QC said, in his submission to the committee, that:
information before the tribunal about an association's or group's conduct, practices etc. is slanted, biased or quite wrong in fact. If the exception in paragraph (a) stands—
there will not be a balance, if I can paraphrase the end of the sentence. There are situations where people are judged on the activities of a group and they should also be able to give evidence on their own behalf.
In relation to personal appearances, I am certainly one of those in favour of the ability to attend hearings by telephone—although I have to say there is a lot of work still to be done in Parliament House to get a decent reception from the telephone. We often get a better reception in a country hall in Northern Queensland than we do in Parliament House.
But in the case of the law and equality before the law, it may be that the chase for the lowest dollars means that there is not equal representation before the law. Trying to deal with applications by telephone—given the court system and a difficult and emotional situation—may mean that people who are subject to that situation may not receive equal justice. It is considered by Mr Robyn Creyke, a lecturer in law at the Australian National University, to be:
not ideal when veracity is at issue, where there are language difficulties, or interpreters need to be employed.
That is obviously an issue that needs to be taken into consideration before cost cutting considerations come to the fore.
In relation to the ability of the principal member to publish a decision, it could well be that publication of all decisions is the right thing to do, unless there is a specific, very good reason under law why something does 
 not get published. But equality under the law would indicate that all decisions should be published so that people know the basis upon which decisions were made.
There was a minority report issued by Senators Bolkus, McKiernan and Murray with five key concerns. As far as we can see, those concerns have not necessarily been taken up. Evidence in the minority report also stated that the proposals to cancel visas in relation to possible non-compliance with specifications on a previous visa may be harsh and unwarranted, because non-intentional errors by third parties were not taken into proper consideration.
There is a lot that is problematic in this bill. The rush to put it through to fill the gap in the legislation program is likely to result in people's rights unavoidably and, I think, unfairly being cut—simply by dint of rush, and that is not the way we should be pursuing a legislation program.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1998-11-30,"—I would like to thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. Before turning to some of the specific issues raised, I would like to remind all senators of the government's policy objectives for this bill. Maybe I should say, before I actually get on to those comments, that we really ought to be looking at this bill in the context of it being a bill which amends a whole Act. I will speak about that in a moment when I talk about Senator Cooney's contribution.
The bill continues the government's work in restoring community credibility in the management of immigration matters. The major change is a streamlining of the current two-tier review process for non-refugee visa decisions into a single review by the Migration Review Tribunal. The new Migration Review Tribunal will be an independent review agency. It will provide fair, impartial, expeditious and efficient review of migration.
This will be done through the introduction of more streamlined and flexible review decision making processes. The bill provides enhanced powers for principal members of 
 both the Migration Review Tribunal and the Refugee Review Tribunal to apply efficient review processing practices. I want to discuss that in more detail later too. The changes provided for by this bill will give principal members the power to ensure that the tribunals meet their statutory obligations, and these obligations are to provide review processes which are fair, just, informal, economical and quick. Again, I will refer to that later.
Principal members will not, however, be able to influence other members on the merits of particular cases, and these enhanced powers relate only—and I emphasis only—to review procedures. The principal members will be the chief executive officers of the tribunals and will be responsible to the parliament through the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Again, I would like to point out to all senators that the bill is a part of the continuing process adopted by this government to ensure the integrity of the migration program. This and others—the one that has just been before the parliament and others before the parliament—are designed to restore community confidence in immigration decision making.
I wish to now comment on a couple of the comments made by various senators who have contributed to the debate. I regret that sometimes these debates are not the sorts of debates that are on television, that we have question time on television and that the general public cannot see the sorts of comments that were made by honourable senators in the opposition about the minister, about his commitment to human rights over a very long period of time, and also about his integrity in those issues. If we said those sorts of things about each other from time to time—maybe more often than time to time—the general public would not have such a poor opinion of us. I appreciate the generosity of spirit that was shown tonight by members of the opposition in making those comments, because I think the minister has made a very great attempt to address those issues and has had a history of doing that.
I would also like to say that maybe we ought to exercise our minds a little about why this bill is able to go through the Senate a 
 little faster than might otherwise have been the case. The committee addressed issues in this bill and in the one we heard the other night, but then an election intervened, so the minister was able to take into account the comments of the committee and to address those in the bill. Amendments are often made on the run—sometimes by an opposition that has very limited resources and with assistance from clerks who are equally under stress. Maybe that is not the best way to make law. Honourable senators should address the issue of why this has been an opportunity for the bill to be amended, given the contribution made by all members of the committee, and think about ways and means that that could be replicated to assist the procedures of this house.
I want to also address the issue of concern about the location of offices. That of course will be the decision of the minister, and he will no doubt take into account the issues that people raised. One of the reasons for having a provision to allow for teleconferencing is to try to address that issue. I know some honourable senators raised concerns about it, but for as many concerns that can be raised there are positive points—that people in rural or remote areas will have more easy access, or it may be the case that some members may specialise. Currently, we have members dealing with approximately 30 visa classes. It means that they have to be on top of all of that. If some members were able to specialise, you may in fact get a more consistent decision making process within a visa class and across the country. Also, you may get a more timely response because the person is more familiar. There are advantages in that process of videoconferencing. I am sure the minister, in deciding where those offices will be located, will take into account the need for people to have access but also the need for decisions to be as uniform as possible, and as consistent and speedy as possible.
Senator Bartlett mentioned the non-reviewability of conclusive certificates. The government of Australia has the right and responsibility to exclude or remove from Australia persons whose presence would be prejudicial to Australia's security, defence or 
 international relations. In some circumstances, merits review may need to be excluded for the same reasons. The Migration Act currently provides the minister with the power to exclude merits review by the IRT, RRT and AAT to safeguard Australia's security, defence and international obligations.
This power has been rarely used. I have been advised that you can count on one hand the decisions made by ministers of both sides of politics using this power. But it remains an essential power. The proposed section 339 merely recognises that this power should continue to be available if needed in relation to MRT reviews. The circumstances in which the power is available are very specific and limited. In such circumstances, Australia's national interest must be placed above the merits review rights of one person. From the evidence I have just given about how rarely it has been used, I think that that speaks for itself.
Senator Schacht again tonight mentioned the fine balance between the rights of the individual and rights of the collective view of society. I think that there is also an issue of balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of individuals who are in the legitimate stream waiting to be processed as refugees. If somebody is not playing the game, if somebody is using means which are less than legitimate, they are denying the rights of those individuals who are waiting to be processed in the correct way in the normal course of events.	So it is not only a balance between the right of the individual and the right of society, it is also the rights of different individuals to be considered for refugee status in Australia.
Senator Cooney commented that the EM took primarily an economic approach. He mentioned that at No. 5 in the overview of the EM the primary aim of the changes being introduced to the RRT is to produce faster decision making. In all fairness, that was in the financial impact statement section. Also in all fairness, as I mentioned earlier, it should be taken in the context of the whole act. Section 353 (1) of the act states:
The Tribunal shall, in carrying out its functions under this Act, pursue the objective of providing a 
 mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick.
We need to take in context that what we are looking at with this bill in particular is the emphasis on the `economical' and the `quick'. That is not to downplay or disregard the aspect of the act that refers to being `fair' and `just'. I think Senator Cooney was a little harsh in saying that the EM and the bill were emphasising that particular aspect. In fact if there are delays associated with the administration and delays based on members not making decisions, that is not fair and just. So, again, there is a balance in making sure that people do not have to wait for decisions to be made.
Senator Cooney also raised the question of the independence of tribunals. The new provisions in relation to the MRT and RRT do not alter the independence of the tribunals in any way. All existing review rights for applicants are preserved. The changes are about reducing the time taken to finalise review applications. Migration is one of the few areas of administrative law where there is a positive advantage to applicants delaying proceedings as long as possible. The delays allow some applicants to prolong their stay in Australia, regardless of the merits of their case.
The new provisions provide a statutory obligation that reviews conducted by the tribunals be, as I said before, fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Speedier decision making will benefit all genuine applicants and discourage those who do not have any legitimate claims. The new Migration Review Tribunal is expected to be able to complete most reviews in at least half the time of that currently taken in the existing two-tier system. The average processing time will be cut from 16 months in 1996-97 to something like six to eight months.
The bill demonstrates a clear intention that the enhanced powers of principal members are not to be used to attempt to issue directions on merit related issues. Senator Cooney referred to the role of the principal member. I again reiterate that the principal member cannot direct the members, but some of the delay has been associated with administrative 
 issues, and the principal member is able to direct staff. That is why it is appropriate that some of these administrative matters be dealt with by staff so that they can be facilitated and expedited more efficiently. Anything that can actually speed up that process and reduce delay is important. I think that needed to be clarified.
Senator Margetts talked about the boat people. I think there was an implication in what she said that all of these people are legitimate refugees. We all know that is not the case, that there are some people who arrive who are not legitimate refugees. There is a process for assessing whether these people are refugees. If they are refused, they have access to the current process. I think that was an important point that should have been made. I feel that Senator Margetts did not hit the spot with her comment.
I would like to thank all honourable senators for their contributions. The debate has taken place over a long period of time. I commend the work of the committee and the suggestions they have made. I also thank honourable senators for their positive comments about the minister.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1998-11-30,"—I might have been better able to make this last part of my contribution if I had had time to go to my office to get my copious notes. If the Senate will give me some leeway—which I am sure it will—I would like to pick up on the point I was making the last time I was speaking in the address-in-reply. I was highlighting the problems confronting the Australian community with the total fiasco of the Job Network. I think I was at the point of reminding people that the government fails to publicly admit that the Job Network is a disaster.
It is curious that if it is not a disaster you would bother finding $50 million in the weeks just before an election to fix it. You said, `It's just to help; it's just to assist people to get out of difficulty.' Fifty million dollars is a fairly large chunk of money to find at short notice to assist with something that is not problematic.
It is important for the government to face up to the significant difficulties in the Job Network. As I have already said, the mistakes in the tendering process, the way Centrelink failed for some eight weeks to pass across any referrals to many of the network providers, and the fact that the Employment Network was charging employers $250 for people coming to find work in their organisations were disastrous things which were a very big negative. 
If we are serious about helping the unemployed, firstly, we will not do it by creating a situation where half the providers—dedicated and wonderful people working in the community, many with long years of experience—have gone to the wall. Some are going to close and some have already closed. What kind of situation is that? Secondly, you do not help unemployed people by having Job Network provisions which require them to register with Centrelink but then front up to a Job Network organisation.
They can nominate some, but many people who came before our committee of inquiry into regional unemployment pointed out that the Job Network office available to them was nowhere near where they lived. Having registered with Centrelink, they then had the cost of travel, which for many was almost a make or break problem. If you are trying to manage on unemployment benefits or a pension, it is very difficult to find $7 each way for transport costs—as we were told at a number of hearings. Finally, when employers have to pay for a service that was previously free, they are not amused. As I pointed out, a lot of people were putting signs in their windows saying `Vacancy: inquire within'. Many had also advertised jobs, and that was one of the contributing factors to the large increase in the number of advertisements of job vacancies.
It will be interesting to see what the new ministerial duo do with Job Network. I understand that Mr Reith and Mr Abbott are working away assiduously to come up with some way to address the monstrous failure that is Job Network. It has let down employers, providers and, in particular, the unemployed. It has to be rearranged. It has already been allocated a $50 million bonus issue in the run-up to the election. It will be interesting to see how that is spent. I believe that with better arrangements in the tendering process, a lot of that extra money would not have been necessary and a lot of the organisations that are going to the wall would not have gone to the wall.
My closing remarks on the Job Network are that I am very concerned that much of this is now regarded as commercial-in-confidence 
 and we are therefore denied a lot of access to the data through the estimates process. I have sought information and advice from the clerks and from previous Senate inquiries as to what constitutes commercial-in-confidence. I think it is very important to note that much of what is sometimes claimed as commercial-in-confidence—`we can say no more'—is not justified. It is necessary, I believe, for the Senate to make it clear to people who want to give that sort of answer that they are going to have to justify which, if any, parts of the answer are able to be legitimately restrained under commercial-in-confidence, and the rest must be provided to the parliament. These are, after all, precious taxpayers' dollars, and it is proper that the parliament follows exactly where they go and how they are spent.
I do believe that, if we are not going to see that made clear in the committees, that kind of argument and debate will have to be brought into this place. A thorough clarification of what is allowed to be withheld under commercial-in-confidence needs to put this beyond doubt for the whole parliament. We cannot have the process that we have had up to this point in some of the committees. In our own committee at the last estimates we had a farcical answer from the head of Employment National, who refused to say what his salary was with the response, `I'm not going to tell you. I don't have to tell you, and anyway it will be made public in the annual report that is coming out in a month's time.' What an absolute farce. Of course he should have told the committee; he had no right not to tell the committee.
—When we were trying to find out the relationship between Mr Keating and the Commonwealth Bank, they wouldn't tell us either.
—I don't know about that at all, Senator. I don't know what relevance it has but I am very pleased to note that Senator Calvert actually agrees with Senator Crowley that the Director of Employment National should have given the answer. I did not hear the content of your interjection, Senator, but from the smile on your face I think you are feeling satisfied, so it is probably just as well I did not hear it all.
In the few minutes remaining to me, I would like to turn to the debate currently raging about the best way to assist with health in this country and the cost of private health insurance. We have had some very strange contributions to the health debate. I think it is absolutely critical, in the address-in-reply, to say that this government plans to legislate for a 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance for those people above $70,000 income because that is the cut-off for the means test. As this 30 per cent rebate, as I understand it, builds on the previous rebate, which was means tested, what this new allocation of some $1.4 billion means is that the people at the top end of town will be getting a full 30 per cent of their $2,000 or $3,000 a year health premiums. For some families that will be a $1,000 rebate on their health insurance premium, while people on low incomes will be getting only a top up. They will be getting $50 to $150, not up to $1,000. That is the first injustice, that the people who are at the lower end of the scale will get much less out of this than the people on the top incomes.
Secondly, if any government had $1.4 billion to spend in health, you would not spend it by giving a tax rebate to people whose health premiums are only going to rise as a result of this handout, precisely as has happened before with the first round of rebate handouts. It has done absolutely nothing to restrain health costs, it has done absolutely nothing to provide increased services and it has done absolutely nothing to reduce the health bills that people get when they finally make a claim against their private health insurance. If the government were serious about the best way to spend that money and to assist people in this community with their health costs, that money would be allocated directly to the provision of services, in particular through our public hospitals.
One of my staff had occasion, on behalf of a constituent, just the other day to discover that there are, I think, 98,000 people waiting for acute dental services in South Australia through the dental hospital there. Many of them will wait up to two years. The government had money to assist with the rebate for dental insurance premiums, that is, under 
 extras. It was prepared to spend $200 million assisting with the premiums for extras to help people at the top end of town cope. But why wouldn't it, instead of that, spend only $100 million to restore the dental services to what they were before and dramatically reduce the waiting times for the provision of urgent services for those people, particularly those on low incomes, who have to queue up at the dental health services? It is an extraordinary argument from the so-called whiz-kid economists opposite that you would want to chase $200 million, after pushing up the cost of dental health services, rather than spending $100 million, a restrained cost amount, to dramatically reduce the waiting lists and the waiting times for very necessary dental services.
In both employment services and health services we have got a government which have got it completely wrong. They are not here to help strengthen community, they are not here to assist the people across the income scale—they are here to make sure that people who are very well off get even more assistance. People who don't need it are being assisted, and the cost of that is that people across the community pay, particularly people on the low income end of the scale. Costs of services and waiting times go up and the provision of those services goes down, and the people who suffer most are those people on low incomes. How anyone could justify this rebate for private health insurance, I do not know. It is a joke. It is very bad economics and it is very bad health care.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1998-11-30,"—I rise to speak tonight in the address-in-reply and seek to put on the public record my response to a number of issues that were raised in the Governor-General's speech. I want to highlight the implications for the federal government from the result of the recent election as seen from the Northern Territory's point of view. One thing is evident about the result on 3 October, and that is that the people of the Northern Territory have clearly rejected the policies of the Liberal and National parties. Voters returned the Northern Territory electorate to the Australian Labor 
 Party representative. For those who may not know, Northern Territory voters had the opportunity in the recent election to elect two senators and one member for the House of Representatives. Out of three parliamentary representatives, Territory voters have sent two ALP members, one senator and one House of Representatives member, to represent their interests.
So let me place on record that I am very pleased that my ALP colleague Warren Snowdon has once again been returned to Canberra. Voters for both houses realised that the coalition policies offered nothing for people living in the Northern Territory. My colleagues opposite stand up and talk about having won back the heart of rural and regional Australia. They did not win back people in the Northern Territory. They could not convince people in the Northern Territory that what they had to offer was going to provide them with any substantial benefits. The outcome proves that people living in rural and remote Australia have little faith in the policies of this government.
It has to be said that the Northern Territory is an expensive place to live. Voters rejected the coalition's proposed GST. They know that the high prices they already pay for essentials will increase. There was nothing offered by the coalition during the election campaign which was going to reassure them. For example, we know that in the last quarter the cost of an average basket of goods in the Northern Territory, particularly in places like Darwin and Alice Springs, was 40 per cent higher than what you would pay for a similar shopping basket of goods if you shopped in Melbourne or Sydney.
When you consider the 40 per cent higher cost of goods in the rural and remote Territory, people did not have any of their concerns allayed by coalition counterparts campaigning in the Territory that Territorians were going to be better off under these policies. A lot of people, many of whom would probably have normally been supporters of the coalition's policies, indicated that while they may well have voted for the coalition in the House of Representatives they certainly were not going to vote that way in the Senate, 
 because they wanted to ensure that the Senate conducted an inquiry into the impact of the GST, particularly as it affected them.
In the last seven days we have seen the GST Senate committees established. In the coming weeks we will develop their itinerary to travel around this country to talk to, consult with and hear from people. I have a concern, which the Labor Party will be addressing, and it is the so-called `northern line'—the line that you might draw from the top of Brisbane to the top of Perth. The Labor Party will guarantee to the people of Australia that this will not be an eastern seaboard inquiry. It will be an inquiry that endeavours to send the committees around the country, out to rural and regional Australia, so that those people can also have their voices heard and their concerns addressed.
The full privatisation of Telstra is another issue of concern to the people of the Northern Territory. It is no secret that access to reliable and affordable telecommunications services is becoming increasingly important in overcoming some of the tyrannies of distance faced by people living in remote and regional areas of Australia. This access to technology in the information age is vital for education, business and often health purposes. During the Territory's wet season many people in remote communities are cut off for weeks at a time by flood or stormwaters, making them even more reliant on telecommunications services. In places like Port Keats, there are limited telephone lines into houses. We still have places in this country where people are waiting for telephones to be put into their homes. We still have places in this country where it takes 20 minutes to download a page from the Internet. Telstra's community service obligation is essential to ensure that people in regional Australia have access to telecommunications at an affordable price.
Telstra is also an important employer in communities outside Darwin. The reduction of Telstra staff now living in small communities will have a major economic impact on those communities. People living in remote parts of Australia have already noticed a drop in the quality of service delivery. The Territory is no different. Proper provision for the 
 ongoing maintenance of telecommunications services is essential if people are to have reliable service delivery.
In referring to our future generation, the government has said that it will support a quality teacher program to improve teacher skills and lift the status of teaching in schools. In part of his speech, the Governor-General made specific reference to the quality teacher program and to improving the quality of teachers in our schools. Is the response in the Governor-General's speech finally the government's response to the inquiry into the status of the teaching profession, A Class Act? Is there finally recognition that the status of teachers needs improving, although only given a cursory mention in the address? The Northern Territory government has recently acknowledged the low morale of teachers and the need for the bureaucracy to change to support better teaching and learning.
But this commitment is just not good enough, and still does not address the crisis facing the education system in this country—the crucial shortage of teachers for our education system. This government needs to give a commitment to recognise this and to fund a national recruitment campaign designed to attract high quality applicants to the teaching profession, but more importantly to ensure that they stay there and that there are adequate incentives to keep them in the profession. The government statement does not go far enough and still implies that the low status amongst the profession is linked to the skills of these people rather than to the inadequacies of the system and its lack of recognition to address related problems.
The most important area in reply to the Governor-General's speech relates to the issue of our indigenous Australians, in particular our Aboriginal people. The election result in the Northern Territory sends an important and vital message that the coalition government needs to come to terms with and recognise. It is important that this comment is put on the public record: Aboriginal people living in remote communities in the Northern Territory overwhelmingly oppose the coalition's policies on Aboriginal issues. In the Senate, Aboriginal voters in Northern Territory 
 remote communities voted eight to one for the Australian Labor Party. Of 11,790 votes that were cast in remote communities where the population is overwhelmingly Aboriginal, 8,056 gave their first preference vote to the Australian Labor Party. The coalition received only 1,891 votes. Aboriginal people voted overwhelmingly for the Australian Labor Party.
In an article in the Australian on Wednesday, 4 November, Maria Ceresa explains:
. . . results in the seats of the Northern Territory, Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, Leichhardt on Queensland's Cape York and Grey in South Australia provide some indication of how bush Aborigines feel.
Taking in isolation the remote booths with a high percentage of indigenous voters, this is what happened:
In the Territory, successful ALP candidate Warren Snowdon won an 8 per cent swing—
this is out bush—
and 80 per cent of the vote on a two-party preferred basis.
. . .              . . .             . . .
In his new spirit of reconciliation, John Howard claims that Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron has the support of ""grassroots"" indigenous people.
. . .              . . .             . . .
However, there is little evidence to support the claim of broad-based support for the Government from ordinary Aborigines. Indeed, the election result graphically demonstrates the shallowness of such a contention.
Who can blame Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory for not trusting this federal government? The Reeves review of the land rights act is perceived by many Aboriginal people as being a means of undermining the power of the two mainland councils. The proposal to break up the land councils by establishing 18 regional land councils is seen by many to be the land councils' punishment for being too effective an opposition to the federal and territory governments on a wide range of issues of concern to their constituents. It is not unexpected that the CLP government has waged war against the land councils; they have proven themselves to be a vindictive lot.
It should be remembered that land councils are statutory authorities given their powers under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Section 23 of the act lists the functions of the land councils. Under the act, the land councils have a legal responsibility to protect the interests of Aboriginal traditional owners. They should not be punished for doing their job properly.
In fact, in the weeks leading up to the election I travelled out bush to remote communities. As you would be aware, voting started one week before 3 October, the date of the federal election. When we went to remote booths, particularly along the top of north-east Arnhem Land, we saw signs that had been put up by the Country Liberal Party that said, `If you vote for Nick Dondas, we will give you your own land council.' That was absolutely deceptive and misleading, but Aboriginal people knew that. Aboriginal people were not to be deceived; they understood exactly what this government was on about and they did not fall for it.
I should turn to the matter of reconciliation. The Prime Minister has nominated this as one of the priorities for his second term. On that Tuesday, the day of the Governor-General's speech, there was little more than two sentences on the matter and only an undertaking that the government would  work to achieve the goal of reconciliation over the next two years. Where is the apology to the stolen generation, evidence that this government has really changed? Where is that one word from the Prime Minister that would usher in an apology to the many Aboriginal people in this country who have been emotionally affected and hurt by the policies of previous governments? All the Prime Minister needs to do is apologise and move on, but it seems to be too big an ask.
It is true that David Buckingham, the Executive Director of the Business Council of Australia, has recently delivered a statement about reconciliation that goes much further than any member of the government has committed to. I refer to a summary of his article in the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday, 10 November. He said it was vital to understand what reconciliation was, that it 
 was not just a matter of granting Aborigines full citizenship rights such as adequate health, education and other services, and that, ultimately, reconciliation was about indigenous rights and issues of indigenous laws and customs. Until the community embraced the meaning and existence of indigenous rights, the reconciliation process would not be complete.
Gatjil Djerrkura, a personal friend and somebody whom I lived with on the Gove Peninsula, went on to declare that he cannot see how the government will advance the Prime Minister's agenda if it has Minister Ruddock moving around the country, talking about reconciliation, with Senator Herron travelling behind him preaching recrimination. We should remember that Senator Herron recently said that a generation of indigenous leaders `who had been around forever' should hand on leadership to people more interested in getting on with promoting the future. That is the greatest indictment I have heard coming from a minister for Aboriginal affairs.
You must understand that the traditional owners and indigenous leaders hold the knowledge and hold the power in their communities. They do not, in fact, move on when they get tired to make way for people who are more interested in getting on with promoting the future. That is not Aboriginal custom, that is not Aboriginal law, and it is a sad indictment that the federal minister for Aboriginal affairs does not understand that basic tenet of the way in which Aboriginal people operate. The Executive Director of the Kimberley Land Council, Peter Yu, called for the Prime Minister to give an indication of direction on indigenous affairs policies. He went on to say that reconciliation must be about maintaining their law and their culture.
It is clear that the election result has sent a message to the federal government that it has much work to do if reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia is to move beyond simple platitudes. Constantly trying to undermine the work of the land councils is not the way to go about the change that is needed. Nor is changing the joint management arrangements for the Kakadu and Uluru Kata Tjuta national parks 
 without the support of Aboriginal traditional owners the way to develop good relationships between the federal government and Aboriginal Territorians. The way in which the government intends to do that has yet to be announced.
Territory voters in the recent federal election made an informed choice in returning the territory to the Australian Labor Party. In doing so, they sent a very clear message to the federal government. But the statements and sentiments mentioned in the Governor-General's speech on that Tuesday show that the government has really not got it, and that very little is likely to change in the next few years.
In closing, I would like to make a few remarks about the proposed 30 per cent health rebate system. Something that I have not heard espoused by the federal government in the last week in either the House of Representatives or this chamber is a knowledge and understanding of private health in relation to people who live in rural, regional and, more particularly, remote Australia. There are 51,000 people in the Northern Territory who take out private health insurance. I do not know the figures as to how many are Aboriginal people, but I guess there would not be too many. In fact, I would say there are probably none.
If you live in any of the five regional centres outside of Darwin, there is no private hospital. There is no access to private doctors or to private services. In Darwin there is one private hospital, which offers a limited range of specialist services and a limited range of facilities. Most times you find that if you need any elective surgery or you need emergency surgery, despite the fact that you pay private health insurance, the private hospital does not provide it. So you have no choice; you end up in the public hospital anyway.
The Governor-General's speech talks about addressing the huge disparity in the health of our indigenous people and how it will continue to be a priority for the government. Where is the disparity in offering people a 30 per cent Medicare rebate? If you are an Aboriginal person living at Milingimbi, the disparity is widened. This government should 
 be looking at putting that money into providing better services in those communities and providing those people with better primary health care services at a level that is more commensurate with their high level of health need. There will be very few Aboriginal people in the Territory—probably none—who will benefit from this proposal. If the proposal were not successful and if it were not pursued by this federal government, there would be many Aboriginal people in the Territory who would benefit from an injection of over $1 billion worth of funds into the health system.
Most people in the Northern Territory that I speak to about their private health insurance say that it is not that they want more of a tax rebate; they want the problems in the system fixed up. They do not want to go to a physiotherapist and pay $40 and only get $15 back. They do not want to be told that they can only claim $600 a year back for orthodontist fees for their kids' teeth when it cost them $2,000. They want to be told that the gap is lessened and that they are not wasting their money on private health insurance. I think many people in the Territory do a few basic sums and work out that the money they could save on private health insurance would be better put in their own pocket, and they could just pay for whatever services they could not get in the public system.
There are many disadvantages in terms of a 30 per cent rebate in the tax system for people in the Northern Territory. In particular this government has failed to recognise that there is probably little access to private services in the Territory when it comes to health. There is little benefit in having private health insurance in the Northern Territory and there is little that these policies will do for people who live in the Northern Territory. 
Even though this government has been returned, people in the Northern Territory, in particular Aboriginal voters, have overwhelmingly not supported this government. The result clearly shows that. I do not think this government can stand on a mandate of having won back rural and regional Australia, certainly not when it comes to the Northern Territory. If the policies and legislation that we have seen in the last couple of weeks 
 continue to unfold in the next three years, we are certain to enjoy the return of Warren Snowdon after the next election as well.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,33,1
"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1998-11-30,"—I came down as a rather impromptu fill-in tonight, but I am rather glad that I have after listening to Senator Crossin's contribution to the address-in-reply.
—That's how you got here.
—Because I was speaking I did not hear what would normally be a very good interjection by Senator Forshaw, who I learnt quite recently was a man of letters. He studied literature at one of the universities in Australia. I always thought that English was his second language. So there you go; you can be quite mistaken about different people. I do appreciate your contribution by way of interjection, Senator Forshaw.
I was going to offer, in my contribution to the address in reply, the subject of health and those matters that are peripheral to that. Having lived in and worked in an environment very similar to what Senator Crossin spoke about, I think that I am reasonably equipped with both the experience and the theory of having lived there to reply to and rebut in the course of my delivery some of those things that she said.
Senator Crossin said that there is little benefit in having private health insurance. That may suit the Northern Territory but the fact is that the more that people take out private health insurance, the less pressure there is on public hospitals. And the less pressure there is on public hospitals, the less there are the queues that people on this other side so often speak about.
What they do not speak about on the other side is the fact that $16 billion was poured into Aboriginal health, among other things, during the 13 years of Labor. What have we seen with respect to the health of Aboriginal people? Have we seen the longevity of male or female rise? No. Have we seen the appalling child mortality rate decrease after the spending of that $16,000 million on Aboriginal people? No, the child mortality rate is 
 excessively high. Have we seen generally the health of Aboriginal people improve? No. Have we seen the rate of alcoholism and other health problems associated with Aboriginal people—they apply as well to other Australians, but I am talking specifically about Aboriginal people—reduce after the spending of that $16 billion? No, we have not seen it reduce.
The Labor Party want to play the part of the spoiler with respect to the 30 per cent rebate that was, as part of the Howard government mandate, to come in on 1 January 1999—just a few weeks away if this bill had been passed. It is not designed for wealthy people. In fact, 700,000 Australians are figured to have private health cover, yet earn $20,000 per annum or less.
—It is designed for the Aborigines, is it?
—Yes, of course it is designed for the Aborigines. What I am saying, Senator Forshaw—I do thank you for that interjection to allow me to clear that point up—is that, if you alleviate the pressure on the public system, you make the queues shorter and you have waiting times reduced whether for elective or non-elective surgery. That is the whole point about it. You should not act as the spoiler in health; health is far too important for Australian people. It is not up to you to act as the spoiler. If you had a genuine case, yes.
What we are saying is that you can reduce the queue. You do help Aboriginal people if more people take out private health cover. You would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that for every one per cent of people who drop out of the private health system there is an increase in the collective states responsibilities of $82 million. We can make a mathematical equation of this: by next year, when it is expected that our 30 per cent rebate would come in, that would be 20 per cent that have dropped out of the private health system since 1990.
Quite obviously, that cannot be allowed to continue. Anyone who uses this Senate to spoil something as beneficial to Australians that impacts upon their health deserves some sort of punishment. I am not suggesting 
 anything other than that the polls should punish them. I guess the people of Australia will remember that the people on the other side had the opportunity to reduce those waiting queues in the public sector and they chose to play the part of the spoiler, to play with the health of Australians and to put at risk the young, old, rich and poor.
Let me get back to what I intended to speak about and that is health in the state of Western Australia. Western Australia—an area of 2.6 million square kilometres or one million square miles in the old system, which is still used largely across rural Australia—has special needs with respect to health. Not only do we have a large indigenous population, or people who choose to call themselves indigenous, but we also have a large outback population that obviously has, because of its geographical isolation, special health problems. We have people in rural areas who have special health problems. You heard Senator Crossin talk about the special needs of people where there are no hospitals, where there is no first aid. They must be catered for. Every Australian, regardless of where that person lives, deserves and must have adequate health cover and a system that is allowed to serve them.
In Western Australia we do have an excellent Royal Flying Doctor service, one that was initiated I think by Flynn of the Inland, who was born at Moliagul in Victoria. I remember reading about the first operation that was conducted over the old pedalsets in the early part of this century. A jackaroo on one of the Kimberley stations where I have spent some time had a ruptured appendix. He was operated on with a pocket knife with the assistance of the RFDS over a pedalset. History records that it was not only painful for this poor devil but also unsuccessful and he died some days later.
That has gone, but what has not gone is the tyranny of distance with respect to health in Western Australia. If health is worked out on a per capita grant basis across the states, then Western Australia is left wanting, and I think unreasonably so. There must be some assistance for the Northern Territory, Western 
 Australia and the northern part of Queensland, because of the isolation.
The area where I have spent most of my life, in the eastern and northern goldfields and the southern part of the Pilbara, does not have hospitals that one could describe as general hospitals. Fairly rich towns like Leonora, Leinster, Laverton, Meekatharra, Mt Magnet, Cue, Mt Newman and many of the mining towns such as Telfer do not have general hospitals, yet, in aggregate, they have a lot of people. Very little consideration is given to those towns with respect to their health needs. Most of those towns, with very few exceptions that I mentioned, have large Aboriginal populations. They do at least have an Aboriginal health system that caters for Aboriginal people, and others use it from time to time in emergencies. They do have the RFDS that can call on them, but Western Australia has special and particular needs with respect to health.
It is not as if Western Australia does not contribute to the financial wellbeing and financial health, if I could use that term, of the rest of Australia. We are, by any measure, the greatest contributor per capita of funds of any state in the nation. It has been figured that Western Australians contribute about double the average of people in the eastern states. Last year, for instance, there was a $5 billion record sale of gold, up from under $4 billion the previous fiscal year. It is these things that make me put a special case for Western Australia. The tyranny of distance that Aeneas Gunn wrote about many years ago in her famous book We of the Never Never describes that.
Western Australians in some areas are still going through this—38 per cent of that 2.6 million square kilometres that I spoke about is, in fact, pastoral leases. Those people, and any people in areas of isolation, have special causes that I would hope everyone in this room would think about and give some consideration to when the tripartite bills on health and the 30 per cent rebate come here shortly from the other place.
There is no question that the government was re-elected on a mandate, amongst other things, for a 30 per cent rebate in private 
 health cover contributions. We know now that that will give a return to an average family of $750 a year. We also know that that will alleviate the pressure on the public hospital system. We also know that there are people on that side of the chamber who want to act as spoilers, just as they want to act as spoilers with respect to the goods and services tax that everyone who is honest knows will alleviate and make workable what is unworkable at the moment. Everyone knows that we have an unworkable tax act. Everyone knows that it is so complex that not even the most specialist of accountants will give you a clear and concise answer to some questions.
Everyone knows that the sale of Telstra would have a great social benefit to people of Australia but, once again, that side of the chamber—the Labor Party and others—are acting as spoilers and are not going to let Australian people participate in that vast social benefit.
But we have something very special with respect to health. Health and education flow on and have the effect of uplifting every other area in the state or in the nation. It is no good wanting to destroy the health system in order to rebuild it—the phoenix will not rise out of the ashes like you think it will. If this 30 per cent rebate is not passed—for which a mandate was given at the election on 3 October—you will destroy the private health system. As one of your own—the former Senator Richardson, who was a former Minister for Health—said, the private health system will not function below 30 per cent.
We know now that it is there—or beyond that. We also know that it is falling two per cent per year, and we also know that the states cannot pick up that significant area of shortfall every time one per cent of the people drop out of private health. In Western Australia we pick up nearly $9 million a year. Over 10 years that is $90 million. It does not take too much of a mathematical genius to work out that over the ensuing period it will be significantly more than that and increasing at a greater rate.
I want to read into Hansard a letter from the Australian Medical Association which, I assume, has been delivered to all members in 
 this place. The letter is over the signature of Dr Sandra Hacker, Vice President of that august body. In a salient part of the letter to me, she says on behalf of her association:
We believe the rebate will be an effective method of attracting additional people into private cover. Some 30% of lapsed health fund members said the rebate would encourage them to resume their cover and 32% of those who have never had private cover said they would be encouraged to take it out.
The Australian electorate is strongly in favour of the proposal. A Morgan Research survey showed that nearly 70% of Australians support the idea of a rebate for private health insurance.
The AMA is the peak body of doctors and general practitioners in Australia. Their figures are not manufactured, like some of those from the other side often are when quoted  in  statistics.  They  are  figures  that 
clearly support the coalition's mandate, given on 3 October, for a 30 per cent rebate in private health cover.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,33,1
