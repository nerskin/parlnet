"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-02-17,"—I rise to speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 and in doing so point out that this is, in the vernacular, a crook bill on electoral 
 matters. It is shameful of the government to bring in this bill with the measures it contains.
From 1983, the former Labor government and the former minister in charge of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, my colleague from South Australia Mick Young, established a process where the parliament would have due process over reviewing each election, dealing with issues of electoral administration in a timely and considered manner and trying to reach bipartisanship on the way in which we conduct our elections.
Australia has every right to be generally proud of the fact that, at the national level, the conduct of elections since Federation has been very good by world standards. However, as the joint committee looking at the Electoral Act in 1983-84 recommended, there should be a standing committee to review our Electoral Act and look at ways of improving it on the principle of making it easier and more timely for people to be able to vote in an election.
What we in the Labor Party are about is always ensuring that it is easy for the members of our community to exercise their democratic right—some would say that sacred privilege—to vote. That is a process that, unfortunately, many countries of the world still do not have or do not have in an open and transparent way. That was a major reform of the Hawke Labor government and due credit should be given to Mick Young, the minister, and Dick Klugman who chaired the committee which made all of those recommendations.
Since that time the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which I served on once for a term of government, from 1987 to 1990, has performed that function well. But since this government got into office it has used the process only on the basis of how it can shave the edge off improving the coalition's prospects at election time by the way the act is administered, the way it is changed. The sticky fingers of my colleague Senator Minchin, who in the last period of the government had some interest and responsibilities in this area, are all over this bill in finding ways to give an electoral advantage to the coalition.
Nick Minchin was the State Director of the Liberal Party in the 1980s while I was State Secretary of the Labor Party in South Australia. During that period we fought out a number of election campaigns. I do not think the partisanship that one brings to helping one's party win an election is the right attitude to have in this parliament—drawing up legislation to try to advantage your party at the expense of democratic principles. That is what this bill is about. It is a crook bill and in a number of areas the opposition is going to move amendments to or oppose the provisions of the bill.
I want to mention the extraordinary episode of the so-called Greenfields Foundation. If ever there were an example of how the Liberal Party will find a loophole, even a very small one, and try to drive the Queen Elizabeth ship through it to their electoral advantage, it is the Greenfields incident. Fortunately, the Electoral Commission is now finding ways to further call on the people involved with the Greenfields operation to disclose where the money came from and how it was raised and to ensure that there is proper transparency. In 1983 the then committee, chaired by Dick Klugman, a member of the other place at the time, under the terms of reference from Mick Young, inquired into two major areas of reform: public funding and disclosure.
At the time the Liberal Party opposed public funding, but when it came in they never sent the cheque back. They always took the money, though they said that ethically they disagreed with it. If they had some ethics about it, if they believed it was unethical to get public funding, why did they keep accepting the money? Even in the 1984 election Mr Peacock, the then Leader of the Opposition, campaigned to remove this provision of public funding. Of course, he lost the election. The Liberal Party still accepted the money under their entitlement. It is the height of hypocrisy for the Liberal Party to go around questioning issues of public funding but still be willing to accept the cheque.
Public funding is a very important part of our democratic process. It ensures that political parties get access to reasonable funding to 
 run their election campaigns so that the public have an opportunity to hear all views. It is not just advantaging those political parties that have access to the most money. It was and is a very important reform. But on the disclosure side, it is equally important for people to see who is putting the money up for various political parties. Of course, that was opposed by the Liberal Party. They said that all sorts of terrible things would happen, that intimidation would occur, to those who had been giving money to one party and not to the other. Not one scrap of evidence has anywhere been presented that any organisation which gave more money to one political party than the other has suffered intimidation.
I stand to be corrected—there might be a case—but I cannot recollect since 1983 or 1984, when the legislation came in, anyone being charged with intimidation or threatening somebody who made a political donation to a political party. The disclosure rules have worked very well. It is published, so that you can see who is putting the money into which party. People can make their own judgment as to whether that party's policies have been duly affected by those donations.
The Liberal Party has always been embarrassed that it has to rely solely on money from the big end of town, from the big companies, to keep them going. Four or five years ago, at the time of Alexander Downer's leadership of the Liberal Party, the big end of town, the big companies, decided that his leadership was so bad that they told the Liberal Party: `We won't be putting any more money in.' So in a sense they helped in the downfall of Alexander Downer and Mr Howard became leader again of the Liberal Party.
At that time the debts left in the Liberal Party were substantial. I think the National Australia Bank made a generous facility loan available of $4 million or $5 million to the Liberal Party. Ultimately, they wanted their money back, and how did the Liberal Party do it? They established the Greenfields Foundation whereby, by claiming it is a loan from this company, it does not have to be disclosed. It is absolutely breaking the spirit of the law that we introduced in 1983 and 
 subsequently amended through the 1980s and early 1990s.
The Liberal Party think they are very smart in finding a loophole. Fortunately, the Electoral Commission appears to be now chasing this down. We will be moving amendments to make the Greenfields example no longer available to any political party, so that the disclosure laws work very well.
I would also point out about disclosure and about funding the oddity that the Liberal Party often complains that trade unions make donations to the Labor Party but do not make them to the Liberal Party and that this is unfair. Those donations to the Labor Party have been disclosed in the annual accounts of every trade union under the industrial legislation in Australia for many years, long before public disclosure. So they are available to every union member to see where their membership fees are going.
In South Australia at the moment the Liberal government is trying to outlaw trade unions making such donations. But they are not making any suggestion that you cannot make a donation from a trade union without a specific plebiscite or vote of all the members of the union. They do not want to put that into the provision. However, they are not putting in a provision saying that publicly listed companies have to take a vote of all their shareholders to see whether they should make a donation to a political party.
BHP, Western Mining Corporation and other companies have publicly disclosed that they are making donations to both sides of politics, usually much more to the Liberal Party than to the Labor Party. I would like to see the chairman of the board at the annual general meeting of such companies move a resolution to the shareholders saying, `I hereby move that we make a donation of half a million dollars to the Liberal Party, $100,000 to the Labor Party, $5,000 to the Democrats and the Greens get nothing,' and a ballot of every one of those hundreds of thousands of shareholders of those companies—and see what happens.
If the Liberal Party in South Australia was fair dinkum about this proposal they would amend it to include the fact that every share 
 holder in every company has to be consulted before any political donation can be made to any political party. They will not do that, of course. They want to hit the trade unions around the head. The trade unions have always been open about their affiliation and payments to the Labor Party. The Liberal Party want to remove from the shareholders their opportunity to be consulted and have a vote on whether they believe the dividend money paid to them should be paid to political parties.
I think the issue of disclosure, the Greenfields operation, is a shameful one for the Liberal Party. As I said in my opening remarks, this is a crook bill. It is a disgrace to the process of bipartisanship that we have had over most issues of improvement in the Electoral Act. Many of the other provisions in this bill have only been designed by the Liberal Party because they think they will have the advantage of getting people who they think may not vote for them off the roll and stop them voting.
It is a disgraceful bill in most of its aspects. We will be moving amendments to a number of areas of the bill and rejecting others.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-02-17,"—At the outset, I thank senators from the opposition and other parties for their contributions to this debate.
There are areas of agreement in relation to this legislation. Perhaps it is easier to identify those areas where there is not agreement, and deal with the closure of the rolls. In relation to that closure, the AEC is currently embarking on a process of continually updating the rolls. In fact, this issue has been raised with me by a number of people. They say, `You are shortening the period from the issue of the writs to the closure of the rolls. People will have less chance to get on the roll.' The government says that the ideal situation is that you update the rolls continually outside an election period.
In one exercise—which is a very good one—the AEC has combined with the Victorian Department of Transport to send out notices to those young people who have just obtained a driver's licence. That is a way of 
 reminding young people that they are eligible to get on the roll.
—What about all the other states?
—Senator Conroy is perhaps jumping ahead of things, because I was coming to that. The AEC is looking at dealing with this in other states, so that young people will have a chance to get on the roll, and, combined with the updating that I have mentioned, this will ensure that people do not have to embark upon that last minute rush which has been a problem of past times. In fact, the AEC has indicated to me that over 400,000 transactions have taken place during the period of the closure of the rolls.
Another area of disagreement is the question of prisoner voting. This recommendation was made by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the government believes it is following community opinion in relation to this matter by extending the bar on voting to prisoners in general. At the moment, roughly a third of prisoners cannot vote. That, of course, will be extended by these provisions and will bring us into line with such countries as the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium and some of the states of the United States of America.
Another area of contention is the disclosure levels of donations. We believe as a government that those are important because we do not believe that parties should be reliant solely on public funding. Recently over $3 million was given to One Nation as a result of public funding and a number of Independents received funding due to the percentage of votes they received during the last election.
We believe that public funding is a good thing. However, political parties should also be given the opportunity to raise their own funds. The levels have not been addressed for seven years and the government believes that it is now time that the thresholds for disclosure should be raised. We do believe as a principle that parties should not rely solely on public funding as a source of revenue. We saw that happen recently in the last election.
There is also the question of the provisions dealing with the verification of enrolment. I 
 would put to the Senate that, when someone enrols to vote, that is an important process in the community, as important as opening a bank account—in fact, more important. Yet the requirements for verification of enrolment are less than those required for opening a bank account. The government believes that there should be some tightening of provisions in relation to that, but not so as to disfranchise people. We have provided in our regulations, which have been circulated in draft form, for a wide class of people to be able to witness the enrolment.
There are some ALP amendments that the government agrees with, and we will be coming to those in due course during the committee stage. There are, of course, others that we do not agree with.
In relation to one aspect which was raised by Senator Hogg, I did take that up with the AEC. Senator Hogg mentioned that his son had made a lodgment and then the process had taken some five days. I am advised by the AEC that, upon lodgment, processing takes place but, because the mail goes out once a week, it may be some days before someone receives notification. That notification is not the substantial registration of that person; registration occurs when the lodgment and processing takes place on the day the form is lodged. In the current situation, with the period for enrolment after the issue of writs, notification can still be received after the time for enrolment has expired.
What I am saying is that the action of lodgment is really what you have to look at, not so much the notification. Some people think they are not enrolled until they receive notification, so that is perhaps a matter which needs clarification. Other than that, I commend the bill to the Senate. In the committee stage, we can deal with those amendments and the final detail.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-02-17,"—I rise to inform the Senate that tonight in my home town of Newcastle there is a very important public meeting. It is the Drug Crisis Public Meeting. I have lent my support to this meeting because it is absolutely vital that we start to find more effective solutions to the drug crisis facing our nation. The meeting tonight will have four themes: the drug problem and its effects; remedies being used today; rehabilitation today; and efforts by governments to combat the drug problem both here and overseas, with special emphasis on the Swedish experience.
A panel of experts will address the issues. We will have Father Chris Riley from the Youth Off the Streets program who will be talking about the problem as it affects youth, and Angela Woods, the mother of Anna Woods, will discuss educating youth to avoid drugs. We will hear about rehabilitation practices here and overseas and the New South Wales shadow minister for health, Jillian Skinner, will release some of the coalition's policy for combating drugs. As yet no state ALP member has agreed to discuss their drug position, but I will get to the Carr government's record on this matter a little later.
One of the most important issues to be discussed tonight is the concept of custodial rehabilitation. Susan and Allan Forrester, who have spent seven years and $50,000 fighting the heroin addiction of their daughter, will speak tonight as advocates of custodial rehabilitation. Members and senators might recall that in the weekend press both last weekend and the one before they told their story to the whole world, so desperate are they in their fight against drugs. They have seen what drugs have done to their own family and they do not want this to happen to other families.
The drug crisis as it has spread through the families of the nation has reached epidemic proportions and it is time to consider some new measures. I know from talking to 
 mothers, fathers and families of drug addicts how hard it is for drug users to help themselves. The craving for that one hit is often too strong for any individual to overcome once they have been hooked on drugs.
I have been told, `If only there was a place where addicts could safely get medical help to overcome their addiction without being able to sign themselves out or get access to drugs.' The current problem is that addicts can leave their rehabilitation program and it only takes one hit to negate all the good work that has been done.
Custodial rehabilitation for addicts who have been convicted of criminal offences overcomes this problem. When convicted, for example, by a drug court—which has just been established in New South Wales—an arrangement can be made where, for a reduced sentence, and with an agreement to spend the last year of that sentence in custodial rehabilitation, these young people can be put into a drug free environment and get real help. Without drugs and with other support programs, we can actually help them put their lives back together again. Unlike a lot of rehabilitation programs that are currently operating, under this system they cannot sign themselves in and out, and they are not tempted back into their old way of life.
The current drug programs are not working effectively enough. I am not saying that this new approach is the be-all and end-all by any means. We need a whole range of strategies to help ameliorate the drug crisis. We need to put more resources in at both state and federal levels, and we need a greater range of programs to assist in this process. I have heard from people with personal experience that the way to really help an addict who wants to get clean is to make sure that they cannot get access to the drugs, and then they are given professional support.
This crisis must be tackled, particularly in the state of the New South Wales which has the worst record. It seems that the Carr government is very slow in moving on this. What they have said as part of their election promise is that they will hold a drug summit after the election. We have the worst record in New South Wales. This state Carr ALP 
 government has now been in power for four years and their solution is to hold a crisis meeting after the election. The crisis is actually happening now and addicts and their families have waited long enough.
In the report Drugs, money and governments, the Carr government was identified as the worst performing state government in dealing with its drug problem. The report found that in New South Wales expenditure on health related programs to deal with drug treatment and rehabilitation actually dropped in 1996-97. The report says:
It is disappointing to note the very poor performance of the New South Wales government. New South Wales is the largest state and arguably has some of the most significant drug problems, but has failed to prioritise drug problems or make a serious commitment to reducing drug related harm.
In 1996 half of Australia's heroin overdoses occurred in New South Wales, even though it only accounts for around one-third of the nation's population.
No-one from the Carr government, not even one of the local Labour MPs—and I have written to all of them—has agreed to come to tonight's meeting or to participate. I suppose we cannot be too surprised about that; they must be very embarrassed about their own government's record on this matter. Meanwhile the opposition health spokesperson, Jillian Skinner, is eager to share what the coalition will do to fight drugs. She will be there tonight and will actually announce part of the drug policy at tonight's meeting.
At a federal level the coalition government can be very proud of what it has done. It has released the biggest anti-drug strategy in Australia's history with its $290 million Tough on Drugs strategy. This is already making significant progress in fighting the drug crisis. It is a four-pronged approach over four years: firstly, protecting our borders by giving more than $50 million to protect Australia from the international drug trade; secondly, busting the dealers by providing more than $100 million to fight this type of crime; thirdly, funding for schools to educate our children about the dangers of drug abuse; and fourthly, the coalition's policy of zero tolerance of illicit drugs in our schools.
These approaches are combining to help fight this problem, but probably the most important area we really need to focus on is treatment. At the federal level, we are putting $100 million into this program to assist drug users kick the habit and to provide support for their families. This includes more than $50 million over four years for non-government treatment services.
The coalition's Tough on Drugs policy is the biggest single anti-drug initiative taken in the country. In addition, the Prime Minister recently announced funding of $60 million for a new youth homelessness early intervention program. The funding will provide almost 100 new services across the country for assistance for young people and their families. These services will be aimed at reducing youth homelessness, as well as supporting young people who may be at risk of youth suicide, drug and alcohol abuse and prolonged unemployment.
The federal government has been proactive on this issue, but I believe that all governments need to commit more resources to rehabilitation. For this reason, I look forward to tonight's public meeting in Newcastle, where real solutions to the drug crisis will be discussed. I look forward to sharing with the Senate the outcomes of tonight's public meeting.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Drugs</title>,Matters of Public Interest,5,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1999-02-17,"—My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Family and Community Services. Will the minister now retract her statement from question time yesterday when she said, `I think it is very sad that those who purport to speak for the poor and the disadvantaged frequently do so with total ignorance?' Has the minister's attention been drawn to Treasurer Costello's comments on the same Anglican Church report, when he said, `I think this is probably the strongest statement you have ever seen from a church in favour of a GST,' and wholeheartedly welcomed the report? Has the minister passed on to the Treasurer her strong view that the report he praised and welcomed is based on total ignorance? Will the minister now admit that she clearly had not familiarised herself with the contents of the report before she wandered into the Senate to bucket the Anglican Church?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Compensation</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1999-02-17,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I note your claims about these organisations not having sought any expert information, which confirms that you are not across what the witnesses have been saying to us in our hearings. I note that you also said in your answer that small businesses could be tied up in knots with compliance costs, et cetera. Why is it that you would argue against compliance costs for small business but not compliance costs for charities like Anglicare—one of the organisations that has said that this will be a great contributor to the costs of their organisation and therefore make it harder for them to deliver the very services that you say you want? Minister, are you also going to raise your points of difference with the Treasurer?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Compensation</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,question
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-02-17,"—When I was asked that question yesterday, I was particularly concerned that we constantly hear from people, who work either in the religious area or in the community welfare area, who have not done their homework before making statements on areas for which they do not have specialist expertise. This was not par 
 ticularly directed to my own church; it is frequently the case. I have seen it happen when the Labor Party was in government, and it has not stopped. I have a pretty good impression, for instance, of Anglicare in the provision of services. My portfolio pays quite a lot of money to Anglicare, as well as Centacare and other community organisations, for the provision of services to needy people in our community. It does not mean to say that they are experts on the tax system. In the announcement that was made yesterday by the Anglican media, Anglicare was arguing against a tax on food. Anglicare obviously has not done its homework, because it is crystal clear from the evidence that has been given to the Senate committees by a long list of experts in this area that taxing food is equitable, is simple and is the best way to go for Australia.
We do not want to have small business tied up in knots with great overheads, such as in Britain which has so many exemptions that small business finds it a real burden, we do not want to go that route, because we believe small business has the best chance of helping needy people in Australia get a job, get off welfare dependence and not need the support of the state. That is obviously the best outcome for everybody. I would have thought that the Anglican Church, like other churches and community organisations, would also believe that welfare dependency is not the best option. If you can help people get off welfare and into a job, you are doing them the best service you can.
If small business is tied up in knots with the exemptions to a complicated indirect tax system, we have done small business no good and we have potentially done no good for those who need jobs. We on this side of the parliament are concerned about the equity of the system too. The evidence that has been given to the Senate committees is quite clear—the expenditure by rich families and poor families is pretty much constant on such basics as food and clothing, it is reasonable to continue to use the CPI as a determinant, and across the board families are treated equally and will not be disadvantaged by the 
 measures. No, none of those families will be worse off.
The Labor Party can make a lot of noise and has continued to do so, but it is not only the government making these allegations about equity and simplicity but also the most respected tax experts in our country. I think it would be wiser of church bodies and community organisations who do not have the expertise to take careful note of what the experts have given by way of evidence.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Compensation</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1,answer
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-02-17,"—Perhaps another piece of information would help Senator Crowley. The tax office has estimated that Australia will have less than half the number of tax administrators as Britain have per capita. Australia will have one tax official per 390 businesses, while Britain has one for every 149 businesses due to the large number of exemptions in the UK especially on food. That is a pretty important piece of information, Senator Crowley, which I am sure you did not have before. It would also be interesting for organisations like Anglicare, because if Anglicare had that information then they might have a slightly different approach to the equity or otherwise of the package. I have their press release right here. It is pretty clear that they talk about reducing the heavy burden that a GST imposes on the less well-off. The experts across the community say otherwise.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,1999-02-17,"—I have answers to questions that Senator Margetts asked me yesterday. I seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The answers read as follows—
Question: Can the Minister indicate if a contract has finally been finalised with COGEMA, if so who signed it, and have all Ministerial approvals been given?
Answer: A contract was signed on 22 January 1999. It was signed by the Executive Director of ANSTO and a senior executive of Cogema. I approved ANSTO entering into the contract, in accordance with the requirements of section 31 of the ANSTO Act 1987.
Question: Will it be tabled in the Senate or at the Senate Economics References Committee Inquiry into the new ANSTO reactor and if not, why not?
Answer: The contract will not be tabled in the Senate as it is a commercial contract that is confidential to its signatories.
Question: Does the contract with COGEMA include reprocessing fuel from the new ANSTO reactor and if so, doesn't this pre-empt the outcome of the Senate Commission's inquiry and any environmental impact studies to the reactor?
Answer: The contract provides for the reprocessing of spent fuel arising from the operation of the replacement research reactor, on terms to be agreed once the reactor is selected and the fuel type is known.
The terms of reference of the Senate's reactor inquiry do not include a specific requirement for consideration of the management of spent fuel from the replacement reactor. 

The Committee's reporting date is listed for 18 February 1999 and there is a notice of motion on the Senate Notice Paper  indicating that the Committee would like to move the report date back until the 27 May 1999, therefore the contract with Cogema does not pre-empt the Committee's findings.
The Environmental Impact Statement for the replacement reactor, which ANSTO completed recently, indicated that ANSTO had an agreement that included spent fuel from the replacement reactor.
Supplementary Question
Question: Can Minister clarify whether any actual environmental impact study was part of that due process.
Answer: The overseas shipment of all the HIFAR spent fuel was subject to environmental assessment in 1997 under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974  (the EPIP Act). That assessment is now being reviewed by Environment Australia in the light of the changed destination of the non-US origin fuel In accordance with the provisions of the EPIP Act, Environment Australia will be forwarding a report to the Minister for Environment and Heritage in the near future.
Question: How much will the reprocessing contract with COGEMA cost ANSTO?
Answer: The cost of the reprocessing contract with Cogema is commercial-in-confidence.
Question: Is this in excess of the amount that should see the contract referred to the Public Works Committee?
Answer: Works covered by the PWC involve buildings and structures. The overseas shipment and reprocessing of spent fuel are outside the scope of the Public Works Committee's reference.
Question: what penalty clauses are there if either side decide to withdraw from the contract?
Answer: As is normal in commercial contracts, penalty provisions do apply. The details are commercially confidential. Legal advice from Attorney General's Department and from a French lawyer engaged to represent ANSTO in the negotiations confirmed that the terms of the contract are in accordance with accepted practice.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Nuclear Fuel: Reprocessing</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1,speech

17 February 1999",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,9,2,speech
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-02-17,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee on 
 Public Works, I present the following reports: first report of 1999—CSIRO Queensland Centre for Advanced Technologies Stage 2 Development, Pinjarra Hills, Queensland; second report of 1999—CSIRO National Centre for Petroleum and Mineral Resources Research, Bentley, Western Australia; and third report of 1999—Lavarack Barracks Redevelopment Stage 2, Townsville. I move:
That the Senate take note of the reports.
I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Madam President, the reports which I have just tabled deal with proposals referred to the Committee in the previous Parliament. The previous Committee was unable to report on them due to the intervening election. The present Committee considered the evidence assembled by the previous Committee and resolved, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act, that further public hearings on the proposed works were not necessary.
The total cost of the public works covered in the reports is close to 200 million dollars.
CSIRO Queensland Centre for Advanced Technologies Stage 2 development, Pinjarra Hills, Qld.
The first report involves the proposed construction of the CSIRO Queensland Centre for Advanced Technologies Stage 2 development at Pinjarra Hills, in Queensland.
The estimated out turn cost of the proposal when referred to the Committee was 22.3 million dollars.
The Committee has recommended that the works should proceed.
By way of background, the Queensland Centre for Advanced Technologies was established by an agreement between the Queensland Government and the CSIRO to expand and diversify research and development in the mining, energy and related manufacturing industries in Queensland and nationally. The Centre brings together resources from the State Government, universities, CSIRO divisions, Queensland and Australia-wide minerals, energy and manufacturing industries in collaborative activities.
The proposal examined by the Committee includes the construction of a research building, a technology transfer building, a number of new industrial type buildings, extensions to existing buildings such as the library and canteen, and site works, including 
 new roads, carparking and environmental rehabilitation.
The Centre was originally designed to cater for research and development projects involving 130 staff. Since the Centre was established, research activities have grown at a rapid rate and existing facilities will be inadequate to support planned increases in research personnel and projects.
As a consequence, the Committee has concluded that there is a need to provide additional facilities at the Centre to house and support planned increases in personnel and research projects.
The Committee found that master planning studies of the site, undertaken by the CSIRO, have identified areas suitable for further expansion well into the next century.
Based on the evidence, the Committee also concluded that the extent of the proposed works will provide for the planned expansion of research and development projects and provide capabilities expected to stimulate their further expansion.
CSIRO National Centre for Petroleum and Mineral Resources Research, Bentley, WA
The second report which I have tabled involves the construction of another national centre for the CSIRO. This one will be located in the Perth suburb of Bentley and will be known as the CSIRO National Centre for Petroleum and Mineral Resources Research.
The Bentley Centre will provide a focal point for research excellence and collaboration between CSIRO, Cooperative Research Centres, university researchers, Government agencies, resource companies and associated technology suppliers and providers.
The proposal examined by the Committee involves the construction of laboratories and research facilities, process bays, support and stores areas, staff amenities, public facilities, associated site works, roadworks, carparking, engineering and communication services and landscaping.
When referred to the Committee, the estimated out turn cost of the proposed work was 31.8 million dollars.
The Committee has recommended that the work proceed as proposed.
By way of background I should mention that the CSIRO, or its predecessor organisations, has had a presence in Western Australia spanning more than 80 years. It now employs more than 400 staff at six locations in the State.
The proposed work is a recognition of the fact that the mining, oil and gas industries are the mainstay of the Western Australian economy. For this 
 reason, CSIRO and the Western Australian Government have identified the need to increase substantially the State's research capability to support the sustained development of resource industries in an era of heightened international competitiveness.
The CSIRO divisions involved in the mining, oil and gas industries have established research teams and formed alliances with other research and development partners to undertake projects in Western Australia and nationally.
Based on the evidence, the Committee has concluded that returns to the community and resource companies from investment in research and technology transfer can be significant and are highly influential in the creation of new investment and employment.
The Committee also concluded that the extent of the proposed work can be justified as providing modern facilities designed to enable CSIRO Divisions and alliance partners to undertake research into minerals and petroleum research at increased levels and will overcome current unsatisfactory conditions.
Two other significant factors also emerged from the Committee's inquiry. The first is that co-location of two key CSIRO divisions, Exploration and Mining, and of Petroleum Resources will deliver cost savings and will maximise research effort in support of both oil and mining industry sectors.
Secondly, the proposed site for the Centre, adjacent to Curtin University of Technology and within Technology Park, Bentley will provide the capability to foster collaborative research between the university and private sector research and development organisations. CSIRO has developed a master plan for the site which makes provision for further expansion of facilities and staff.
Lavarack Barracks Redevelopment Stage 2, Townsville
The third report which I have tabled involves the second stage of the redevelopment of Lavarack Barracks in Townsville.There are nine major components in the proposed works. These comprise accommodation and messing, operational, logistic support and infrastructure development facilities. The main component consists of new living-in accommodation for 1,112 officers, senior non-commissioned officers and other ranks, associated mess complexes and a central food preparation facility
When referred to the Committee, the estimated out turn cost of the proposed work was $139.3 million.
The Committee has recommended that the works proceed as proposed. 

The Committee has concluded that the provision of new airconditioned living-in accommodation should improve living standards for on-base personnel and should lift the morale of personnel.
Similarly, the Committee established that there is a need for new messes, on a scale commensurate with requirements identified in Department of Defence planning studies, to be provided at Lavarack Barracks adjacent to the sites proposed for new living-in accommodation.
The Committee believes there are uncertainties about the appropriateness of the cook-chill method of food preparation based on its untested nature in the Australian Defence Force.
For this reason, the Committee recommended that the Department of Defence should report back to the Committee on the operation of the cook-chill process after it has been fully tested at Lavarack Barracks, before its wider implementation within the Australian Defence Force.
The report concludes that the remainder of the works, namely a new Communications Centre, new transport facilities, the Eastern Deployment and Assembly Area, new heavy vehicle roads, and waste collection facilities will all provide substantial improvements to the functionality and environmental management of this, one of the Army's largest bases.
I commend the reports to the Senate.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-17,"—If the Senate is willing to be gracious, given the confusion over the placing of this due to it not being listed on the red, I seek leave to return to the matter of public importance.
Leave granted.
—I have already referred to the letter that proposes that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the Senate for discussion. I call upon those senators who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.
More than the number of senators required by the standing orders having risen in their places—
—I understand that an agreement has been reached between parties as to speaking times in this debate. I shall ask the clerks to set the clock accordingly.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Regional Forests Agreements</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-17,"—I thank the Senate for their consideration. Obviously, the Senate as a whole is of a view that this is an important matter which does need highlighting.
I rise to speak on this matter of public importance because I believe that the Senate needs to devote some time to this this afternoon. It is a vital issue to the future of native forests  of this country and indeed to the future of our nation overall—our economy as well as our environment.
Australia is a unique land. Our native forests, in particular, are an ecological wonder. Our forests range from tropical to temperate, from open dry woodland to closed and wet canopy. They are host to a variety of ecosystems, encompassing many of the world's most unique animals and plants. They are found over flat, riverine or escarpment areas from the southern most part of the country to the northern tip. What is particularly extraordinary is the diverse range of forest ecosystems between and within regions. This makes it all the more crucial that we should protect and care for our forests. If properly managed, they could provide a sound economic base for a truly sustainable timber industry and a strong and permanent environmental base for our nation.
However, successive governments have sold these forests to the woodchip industry. This industry to date has shown little regard for biodiversity, little regard for the diverse range of ecosystems—animals, plants and genetic base—and little regard for the interdependence of all these. It has little regard for water 
 quality issues or other users of forest areas other than woodchippers. The woodchipping industry does have a high regard for getting the maximum amount of corporate welfare from state and federal governments and views the chopping and shredding of the maximum number of forest areas very warmly.
When the evidence about this industry started to become well known in the public arena around five years ago, the  media took a considerable amount of interest and, to their credit, published a lot of information on various forest issues, including economic and biological arguments as well as the basic environmental aspects of the issue. This certainly scared the industry and governments who, when their actions were exposed, were left able to do little more than defend the indefensible.
It was a time of full-blown crisis for the industry and, somewhere out of the public relations and damage control spin, the Regional Forest Agreement process was born. This meant that—instead of the industry each year having to face another public relations disaster as a new round of export licences were approved, instead of continual revelations about the appalling process used to determine those licences, instead of all that—we would have a Regional Forest Agreement which would be signed for each general logging area and which would allegedly meet competing demands and allegedly be ecologically sustainable.
However, the process that we have seen so far has been characterised by a lack of transparency, by bureaucratic obfuscation and by allowing much more woodchipping than previously occurred—so much so that even industry groups are alarmed by the destruction of many areas of significance and its potential impact on long-term ecological sustainability as well as environmental sustainability. Time prevents me from listing all of the problems with the Regional Forest Agreements so far. I am sure there will be other senators who will add to that body of knowledge, but I would like to highlight a few examples which go to demonstrate why this is a matter of such public importance.
In Tasmania the Regional Forest Agreement, as it currently stands, will remove 39,000 hectares of provisional coupes from the register and then add 40,000 hectares more. In other words, another 1,000 hectares will be available for logging. The state undertook to publish, by 31 October last year, a description of the methods of calculating sustainable yield. This has not occurred. They have also not published, nor made publicly available, compliance audits of the Forest Practices Act or the code of reserve management. Nor have they developed and implemented a threatened species protection strategy.
In the East Gippsland area of Victoria, certain data on wood, which it is claimed is publicly available, is not provided at all by forest agencies and there are regular attempts to make the process as difficult as possible for people seeking information. These sorts of petty impediments distract from the real tragedy and the real area of great concern—that forests along the banks of heritage-listed rivers will be decimated, leading to shocking water quality consequences.
In Western Australia the process is so bad that the environment minister has promised, after the RFA is finished, that there will be further changes. Clearly, the RFA there will not be the last word, as was promised. More than 30,000 people sent in submissions to that process, yet the environment minister will not allow the release of the audit into those submissions until after the RFA has been signed. What exactly is being hidden? Perhaps the fact that 80 per cent of people in the state of Western Australia want no native forest logging and no woodchipping. Even the National Party in that state, and some Liberal Party branches, are expressing extreme disquiet with relation to government policy on RFAs, because the Western Australia forest process is in such a mess. The department which, at state level, is in charge of the negotiations in the RFA process—the Department of Conservation and Land Management—clearly has a vested financial interest in the outcome. The department has a clear interest in ensuring the maximum area is available to loggers.
The forthcoming Regional Forest Agreement legislation that is being considered in this parliament is a small bill of only a few pages, but it represents one of the biggest environmental issues to come before the Senate. It is an issue that most Australians feel very strongly about.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: in view of the fact that this legislation is before the parliament currently and there was a reference to the committee that I chair, I believe it is outside of standing orders to be making reference to that legislation or, in fact, be dealing with any issues pertaining to anything that might come out of the committee's report. I would like a clear ruling on that at the start of this debate.
—I do not uphold your point of order for two reasons. Firstly, there is a general debate before the chair on the issue of RFAs and forests. Senator Bartlett is clearly addressing that. Secondly, I understand the President would not have approved the MPI if it had been contrary to standing orders. Her advice is that it is appropriately before the chair and, consequently, Senator Bartlett is in order.
—I therefore want to ask a question with regard to this issue. I allowed Senator Bartlett to proceed until such time as he made reference to the legislation that is currently before us. That is my question to the chair. While we can have a general debate, is it in order to be actually raising issues pertaining directly to that legislation? He made particular reference to the fact that the bill contained eight clauses.
—He can talk about the subject of the bill. He cannot anticipate the bill. I will be listening closely to Senator Bartlett's comments but so far, overwhelmingly, I think his comments have been in line with standing orders.
—I can understand why the government may be apprehensive about the reality of that legislation being brought to the attention of the Australian people, because of the impact that it will have. 
I think I just said that it was a small bill, rather than it had eight clauses—because I was not aware of that off the top of my head, and it is not in my notes—but I am willing to be credited with that knowledge, as well.
The reason why that legislation is important—without talking specifically about the content—is its oversight of the entire Regional Forest Agreement process which is happening throughout Australia at the state level, and the impact it will have on the future of our native forests. That is why it is such a major environmental issue which this parliament obviously needs to consider, and consider very deeply. It is an issue that most Australians feel very strongly about and it deserves clearer and stronger highlighting and more thorough consideration—because the bill itself, as part of the overall Regional Forest Agreement process, is an attempt by the Commonwealth to abrogate its responsibility for forests back to the states.
Forest agreements are being put together at state level in those states that have vested short-term economic dependence on woodchip royalties. We have a system where so much public money is given to the native forest industry in government subsidies that it makes the plantation industry almost untenable. That is what is at risk of being enshrined. The bill will force massive job losses to occur in the timber industry, particularly in the small sawmilling sector, and will be responsible for an unprecedented level of native forest destruction.
Important safeguards that have been put in place by this parliament over many years, such as the Australian Heritage Commission Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the World Heritage Act and export controls, will not apply to vast regions of our most important forest areas under what is being proposed by the government. That is made doubly horrifying because of the sorts of agreements that have been agreed to already at state level and those agreements that are yet to be reached in other states. Those important safeguards that this parliament has seen fit to put in place to protect our environmental heritage will be voided for 20 years. This legislation upholds a process which is fatally 
 flawed, and it will destroy rather than protect our native forest areas.
The Democrats are determined to ensure that the public are made aware of the major threats posed to the survival of our forests by the Regional Forest Agreement process as it stands at present, because it is such a crucial issue to the very survival of our forests and the survival of communities and economies that depend upon those forests and on the long-term survival of a massive amount of biodiversity and genetic diversity in species which are also dependent on those forests. Those are all at risk now in this country. The Democrats believe it is crucial that that risk is highlighted to the Australian people and as much effort brought to bear to prevent the calamity that is before us from occurring.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Regional Forests Agreements</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1,speech
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-02-17,"—I rise to speak on this matter of public importance before us to hopefully put a few myths to bed. One of the interesting things about this debate is the endeavour by those opposite to try to shift the goal posts in regard to what was determined in the national forest policy statement and subsequent regional forest agreements.
I think it is most inappropriate that we are debating this here today when the legislation is before us and a Senate inquiry will be making recommendations in a report to be tabled in this parliament. In particular, I would say to Senator Bartlett that I think he has compromised his colleague Senator Woodley to an unacceptable and unfair degree. I think he should think very hard about bringing these types of debates on when the Senate inquiry is yet to report to the parliament.
Having said that, I want to deal with some of the problems. I got in touch with the clerks to find out what I could and could not use. A quote from Mr Pearce, who gave evidence to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, sums up the position of those people who want to keep shifting the goal posts and who do not accept Australia's responsibility. In answer to a question from Senator Brown, he said:
He does not like the answer he is getting. The point is there has been a long movement over this issue 
 of sustainability. I have noticed that when people like yourselves who argued for sustainable development 20 years ago discovered that in fact you can have a sustainable development arrangement in the forests whereby the needs of the environment are looked for and the forests are harvested on a sustainable basis, you have jumped ship on sustainable development and started trying to develop other definitions which mean, in effect, sustainable ecology, that you cannot do these things. You have done that, Senator, because you have discovered over time that the sustainable development thing which you argued for 10 or 15 years ago did not produce what you want, which is no industry at all in a good many areas of Australia. Although you are here arguing that about the forests today, you will be in other committees arguing about other industries in other areas of Australia on other occasions.
My definition of these things is that you strike a balance between all of the needs of our people, and they do require large areas of untouched natural forest, on your definition and mine, put aside and safeguarded for all generations in the future. I agree with that and our industry agrees with that, and it is the striking of the balance which is important there. But our people also need jobs and our people use timber and paper and timber products. They use more than they produce.
I repeat: they use more than they produce. He goes on:
Senator, and people in Australia who argue for the proposition that we should not touch our own forests but continue to use wood and paper products in the way that we are are simply arguing for ripping off other people's forests, and that is not a position which I believe is morally sustainable.
I think that is the crux of or one of the key issues in this debate. I wish to make the point that currently Australia is using 14 million cubic metres of our own timber a year and importing seven million cubic metres. Approximately a third of the timber we use for things such as the paper I am reading from, the pads I am writing on, et cetera, is imported from another country. I find that an untenable position.
I want to make a few points. Once the RFA is signed, the forest management plan will be prepared. The plan will be released for public comment and full assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority. You hear in debate from the other side that once the RFA is signed that is the end of the matter; it is not. Why don't we get told occasionally that 
 once an RFA is signed the states have to report to the Commonwealth minister? They have to report every year. These are the facts that need to be put on the table.
Further to this assessment, the EPA will be involved in two processes to ensure sustainable wood production. First, it will participate in an expert panel to verify the level of wood yield before the RFA is signed. Second, it will be represented on a task force to assess forest management and timber harvest levels before the next forest management plan is commenced. Once again, that absolutely destroys the oft repeated lie that the process is left uncontrolled.
Moving to the regional forest agreements, there are many stages involved in this. The first and one of more important stages is the Commonwealth-state agreement on deferred forest areas. The second state is a formal Commonwealth-state scoping agreement. The third stage is a CRA, a comprehensive regional assessment. The fourth stage is public consultation. The final stage is negotiation of a formal Regional Forest Agreement to be signed by the Commonwealth and appropriate state governments.
Some of the most important evidence that was given to the committee—and we do not have time to consider it today but I refer senators to it—was from the Deputy Premier of Tasmania, Paul Lennon, when he put a few things in perspective.
Western Australia gets a lot of mentions in this matter because of the current situation. We have what I consider to be a very unfair campaign, and it is being run on emotion and not on facts from the consultation process that has gone on and the various reports that have been done. I place on the public record that 39 reports have been released to the public since it started in Western Australia. Currently, another eight reports are being prepared and are to be released, I understand, in due course. That is a total of 47. This process has been inquired into to an extent that no other industry has been—whether it be on environmental, tourist or forest aspects or on the matter of shutting up land for wilderness protection. 
You may not like the outcomes, but to claim that there has not been a process of public consultation on forest management in Western Australia is just plain dishonest. I will run through some examples of the process: 1982, EPA review of karri forest; 1987, regional forest management plans; 1990, resources assessment inquiry; 1991, review of ecologically sustainable development; 1991, National Forest Policy Statement; 1992, draft forest management plan; 1993, appeals committee review of forest management plans; 1995, deferred forest assessment process with 500 public submissions.
The list continues: 1997, eight public meetings in Perth and throughout the south-west; 1997-98, 122 meetings with organisations; 1996-98, nine meetings of Stakeholder Reference Group; 1996-97, five meetings with Noongar Action Group; 1997, nine public open days in Perth and throughout the south-west; 1997, 10 public open days in Perth and throughout the south-west; 1997, 10 community heritage workshops in Perth and throughout the south-west; 1997-98, seven indigenous workshops throughout the south-west; 1997-98, 195 meetings with organisations; 1998, the inquiry which produced 30,000 public submissions. I think that accurately puts on the table the processes that have gone on in Western Australia.
This has not been something that has been restricted to this side of politics. When Labor governments were in power in Western Australia and in other states, they were part of the process—including the governments of Brian Burke, Carmen Lawrence, Peter Dowding. Richard Court's government has been involved and, prior to all of these, so was the government of the final days of Sir Charles Court and that of Mr O'Connor when he was Premier of Western Australia. So this process has been ongoing. I think it is about time people focused on the truth when they selectively criticise the process of the RFAs. I will leave it to my colleagues to deal with the others.
In the time remaining I quote Carmen Lawrence in 1990 when she was Premier. She said: 
One of the major achievements of the final Management Plans was the identification of areas to be included in conservation reserves. While creation of all of the reserves is still continuing, all areas identified for reservation are being managed for that purpose in the interim. When the reserve system has been completed there will have been a 340 per cent increase in the conservation estate of the South west that is an increase of some 550,000 hectares. Many of the reserves, such as the Shannon river basin, have been made into national parks.
That process has been going on in Western Australia for a long time. Finally, I quote Carmen Lawrence again:
. . . it is far better to use timber from well managed Australian forests, where every tree cut is regrown, than to lock up our own forests while plundering the forests of developing countries.
I put to the Senate that Democrats Senator Bartlett's matter of public importance, if ever implemented, will result in the plundering of other nations' forests.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-02-17,"—At the outset I also want to express a concern about the fact that Senator Bartlett has raised this matter today. He may believe this is a matter of public importance, and no doubt this issue is, but Senator Bartlett is well aware, having attended at least for a short time the hearings of the Senate rural and regional affairs committee, that we have just completed three sessions of public inquiry. We have taken evidence on these very issues, and the committee is at this very time in the process of finalising its report to be tabled next week before the legislation is brought back into this Senate in the following week. I would have thought that in those circumstances Senator Bartlett may have held his fire a bit and enabled that process to be completed and then, if he wanted to address these issues, he could have done so through the debate on the legislation.
I also note that Senator Bartlett, having made his short address, has left the chamber. I have always taken the view when I have been involved in proposing a matter of public importance in this Senate that as a matter of courtesy the proposer should be prepared to sit and listen to the arguments put by other senators. I know senators have other commitments, but I believe that that course is appro 
 priate, particularly if you put forward the proposition as being one of such major public importance.
The next point I wish to make is that we do not accept the statement within the matter of public importance, namely, `the failure of the Regional Forests Agreement process to protect the remaining native forests of Australia.' Our view, which has been put on the record in the other place by the shadow minister, Mr Ferguson—and I do not want to transgress the standing orders by canvassing some of the issues that will arise when we debate the bill—is that the Regional Forest Agreement process is an appropriate process and is a process that by and large is working. That is not to say that there are not some problems. But the problems, in our view, are not necessarily problems with the rules that are set down within the process that is to be followed. Rather, it would appear from at least some of the evidence that has been presented to our committee that the problems are in the attitudes that are being adopted by various parties. It is a bit like a football game. If the teams are not playing the game properly, you do not turn around and blame the rules of the game.
In our view the Regional Forest Agreement process is the appropriate way forward. In order to appreciate the process we have to at least look at some of the background of how this process developed. Every member of this Senate—indeed, including those who were not here at the time—remembers the divisiveness, the bitterness, surrounding the forest industry debates, particularly in 1995 when this parliament was blockaded for the opening week or two of the parliament. That was the culmination of this divisiveness, this aggravation, this hostility that existed in respect of the management of Australia's forests for a number of years prior.
We had, on one hand, those who believed that native forests should never be logged. We had on the other side—I suppose, at the other end of the spectrum—some representatives of the timber industry who believed that it should be open slather and that you should be able to export as many woodchips as you liked. 
In order to overcome the impasse that existed as a result of the legitimate interests of conservationists and industry and also to overcome the myriad of constitutional problems—where, on the one hand, it is the states that own and manage the resource but it is the federal parliament, the federal government, that has increasingly used its powers to regulate forest management—we established, under the then Labor government, the RFA process. Of course the genesis of that process was the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992, a statement that ultimately was adopted by the current federal government, the Howard Liberal-National Party government. Therefore, it has bipartisan support at the federal level. It is also a statement and, subsequently, a process which has been adopted by every state government in this country. I will come back that process in the moment.
I want to take issue, particularly, with a statement Senator Bartlett made in his address that there should be no logging in native forests. What disturbs me is this approach that is adopted by Senator Bartlett and certainly by some interested groups involved in this debate that the only solution is their solution, and their solution is `no logging in native forests'. That is an attitude that is contrary to the National Forest Policy Statement and quite contrary to the RFA process, because, whilst the statement and the process recognise the fundamental importance of conservation values, of protecting of our native forests, particularly our old-growth forests, it also recognises that there is a place for forestry use on a commercial basis. Right through the statement you will see references to that because the statement is about a balance. It states:
The objectives and policy initiatives are underpinned by the following agreed approaches to forest management.
That includes:
. . . commercial uses of forests, including wood production, that are based on ecologically sustainable practises are appropriate and desirable activities.
It also states:
The governments also acknowledge that a variety of uses of public native forests is desirable, provid 
 ed those uses comply with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. The objective here is the management of public native forest so as to retain the full suite of forest values over time. The governments acknowledge, however, that some uses, including non-commercial uses, may inevitably compromise other values, such as tourism and recreation values, at least in the short term.
Further on in the statement in section 4(2), dealing with wood production and industry development, it states:
Sustainable economic use of native forests and plantations is one of the principal objectives of this statement. Wood production is a major commercial use of Australia's forests. It can be integrated with a range of other commercial and non-commercial uses, among them nature conservation, recreation, tourism and water catchment production. Ecologically sustainable management of native forests for wood production involves maintaining a permanent native forest estate while balancing these uses.
And I could go on. It is a very detailed statement, as honourable senators know. The point is that some people just do not accept that the principles that underpin the National Forest Policy Statement and the RFA process involve both recognition of conservation values and the application of resource security for the timber industry. Until they understand that, they are not going to come to this debate with clean hands, with an objective approach.
In his address, Senator Bartlett briefly canvassed some of the evidence that was put to the committee. There was, of course, evidence put to the committee which submitted that the RFA process has not been carried out appropriately in some states. That has also been put on the public record. There is currently a major debate going on within the Western Australian government about whether or not the RFA negotiated in that state is appropriate, whether or not the assessments have been properly made. There is also some debate with respect to the RFAs that have been negotiated and signed in Victoria.
I believe the central problem at the moment is the politicisation of this process by the current federal Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr Tuckey. It seems that ever since Mr Tuckey was appointed to this portfolio following the last election we have had nothing but trouble and a reversion back to the bad old days when people were at each 
 other's throats in respect of this industry. Mr Tuckey, for blatant political reasons, has attacked the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government has negotiated one of the best, most environmentally friendly agreements on regional forest management ever in this country. The New South Wales government under Bob Carr has the most enviable record in terms of protecting our national estate, our national heritage, our environment and, particularly, our native forests.
Since the Carr government came to office it has declared a total of 151 new national parks and nature reserves, exceeding its original election commitment by more than 600 per cent. It has recently announced the most comprehensive forest decision in the state's history, with some 380,000 hectares of North Coast forests reserved. At the same time, it has also delivered unprecedented security to the timber industry and its workers; a package that has been endorsed by the industry, by conservation groups and, indeed, supported by the coalition parties in the New South Wales parliament.
But what has occurred at the federal level? Mr Tuckey, for blatant political purposes, refuses to provide the funding that is required under the agreement for exit assistance because he wants to play politics. He wants to play politics even with his own ideological colleagues in Western Australia on this issue. That is not the way to deal with this very important issue. The way to deal with it is for the parties in all of the states to get back to the principles that underpin the RFA process, that is, achieving both ecologically sustainable development and resource security, hand in hand with conservation of our great national heritage. It should be done under the process that was established and supported by all state and federal governments of both political persuasions. That is the way forward. We believe the process is working. There are some issues that need to be addressed. I have got no doubt that we will be able to deal with those when the legislation comes before the parliament soon.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-17,"—I feel somewhat frustrated because there is 
 only three minutes allocated to me to speak on this matter. I am also angry because we are seeing a process in this parliament whereby, without the knowledge of most Australians, we are facing legislation within two weeks which will hand across millions of hectares of what is left of the wild forests in this great nation of ours to the woodchippers. That is called the regional forest agreement. Behind that name is the lie that it has the support of the Australian people. Every opinion poll shows that that is not the case. It has the support of the big logging corporations, in particular the export woodchip corporations, and through them I submit it has the support of the major political parties.
The problem here is that we do not have an adequate debate, with an opposition on one side and a government on the other. Both the political parties are lining up to push through this legislation in the interests of those logging corporations against the 80 per cent of Australians who do not want this continuing and unnecessary destruction of not only the great wild forests that are left in this country but also the wildlife in them.
I have in my hands a picture which you cannot see, Mr Acting Deputy President, but which I can. When we look at that picture, which is in the rainforests of the Tarkine Wilderness in Tasmania where clear-felling takes place, what we see is a whole mountainside in flames where once the rainforest stood. It has been scalped. Every blade, every leaf, every living animal, every living entity in that forest has been totally and utterly destroyed. Members come in here and say that this is ecologically sustainable.
On the committee evidence that earlier members have averred, when I have asked representatives of the logging industry—not least the Deputy Premier of Tasmania—what a natural forest ecosystem is, with one exception, they have totally failed to provide an answer. When you ask, `What does sustainable mean?' again they cannot answer—or they won't. To be honest about it, you cannot be cutting, firebombing and then poisoning these forests to kill any grazing animals that come into them after they have been destroyed and call that ecologically sustainable. 
 That is a lie. Anybody in the street can tell you that that is a fabrication. Yet that lie is going to be incorporated into action for far more extensive destruction of these forests and the wildlife that goes with them, including world heritage value forests in this great country of ours under this legislation which has had far from adequate exposure to the public.
In Western Australia in particular at the moment the debate is raging. The opinion polls show that a growing proportion of people are horrified by the potential for legislation to lock up these forests.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-02-17,"—I would like to reiterate what has been said by a couple of earlier speakers about the matter coming forward today when the bill is being debated. I am sure that both Senator Bartlett and, no doubt, Senator Brown will have plenty of opportunity to put their views on the table. I must say, although Senator Brown complains about the amount of time he has had here today, I think our chairman, Senator Crane, has been more than patient with Senator Brown at the three days of committee hearings; he has given him a lot more time than permanent members.
In any event, I do not think Senator Brown will ever agree with any process we come up with in this place. The track record goes back some 10 years. With any opportunity that has been put forward by whatever government happens to be in power federally or in the state, Senator Brown and his friends in the green movement pay lip-service initially and, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, then walk away from the process. I really query why the Democrats want to derail a process which is guaranteeing the protection of potentially vast amounts of Tasmanian wilderness and old growth forests and replace it with increased exploitation of wilderness and old growth forests in other countries.
I would be the first to admit that the issues surrounding the best conservation use of Tasmania's forests—and in this case I would like to refer to Tasmania because it has completed an RFA and, therefore, I think it is 
 appropriate to tell the chamber what has happened there—are both complex and difficult. One of the main difficulties that arises is ensuring that the economical harvesting of timber can continue to be carried out in a manner which does not threaten fragile ecosystems, particularly where they are unique; that future generations are able to continue to appreciate existing natural wilderness and that harvesting does not occur at a rate which is unsustainable in the long term. I believe the RFA process was commenced to ensure that these and other difficulties are overcome.
It is worth looking at the objectives of the RFA process. They come as a result of the national forest policy statement that the Federal Labor Party put down. They come, in Tasmania's case, after 28 or so inquiries over a period of 10 or more years, when a lot of emotional debate has gone on and a lot of small industries in Tasmania have gone to the wall. A lot of jobs have been lost, and further jobs will be lost if we cannot collectively come up with a process that meets the objectives.
The objectives of the RFA process included social, economic, environmental and heritage objectives. I will outline what they were. They were to manage the forests for a potentially expanding and value adding industry. It is very important that we have that value adding industry because it provides jobs for the people of Tasmania, and we certainly need them at the moment. They were to provide for sustainable high value species timbers, to maximise areas available for intensive management, to protect a comprehensive, adequate and representative sample of forest biodiversity, commonly known as the CAR reserves, to protect vulnerable, rare and endangered forest ecosystem biodiversity and to protect wilderness and old growth forests.
The final outcome as recommended in the agreement signed between the federal and Tasmanian governments has delivered outcomes which meet all these objectives—far beyond recognised national and international best practice reservation standards. For example, under the RFA, 40 per cent of Tasman 
 ia's land area will be classified as reserves, including 39 per cent of Tasmania's forests, 68 per cent of the old growth forests and 95 per cent of all wilderness. These percentages far exceed the JANIS guidelines set as goals at the commencement of the process.
The new Tasmanian Labor government is a very strong supporter of the RFA outcomes for Tasmania. The Deputy Premier himself came to Melbourne to give evidence and strongly support the Commonwealth RFA legislation. Since the process was started by the Keating Labor government I am surprised that some of my Tasmanian Labor colleagues have not been more vocal in their support for the process—not Senator O'Brien, I must admit, nor you, Senator Sherry. But for some reason one or two others have been rather quiet.
After all, the RFA is expected to have many benefits for Tasmania, for its people and for the protection of its forests. Those benefits include the development and launch of a widely supported forest industry growth plan, a significant increase in plantation establishment, hundreds of new jobs to be created, resource security resulting in millions of dollars being invested in Tasmania, guaranteed quality of sawlogs available to Tasmanian sawmill operators, world's best reservation standards met and exceeded, with some 95 per cent of Tasmania's high quality wilderness reserved, and social and economic outcomes given equal consideration with environmental and heritage objectives.
One of the major things that this regional forest agreement process does is to create certainty. Well, hopefully it will create certainty. The sorts of arguments we have heard and this matter being brought forward today do not provide any more certainty. It seems to me that all it will provide is more of the same argument that has gone on for the last 10 or 15 years. I guess that is what some of these people are all about, particularly in the Democrats' case. I think one of Senator Bartlett's former colleagues, Senator Bell, would  still be here in this parliament if it had not been for the ridiculous attitude the Democrats took towards some issues. Senator Bartlett may care to look at some of the 
 speeches Senator Bell made when he was in this place. I think Senator Bell, for a Democrat, was rather supportive of sustainable forestry development.
I take issue with what Senator Forshaw had to say about my colleague Mr Tuckey. Mr Tuckey, since he has come to this job—I know for a fact, from talking to some of the union representatives in Tasmania—has gained the respect of the CFMEU members. The statement on sustainable forest management in Tasmania put down by Mr Tuckey and Paul Lennon was welcomed by the industry in my state. I also believe that the action plan he intends to put in place and the commitments he has given to encourage downstream processing are all positive things that will help the industry and the people of Tasmania and create jobs. I reiterate that this motion today is inopportune. It has been put forward at the wrong time. I look forward to debating the matter further.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Regional Forests Agreements</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-02-17,"—A great deal has been said about the fact that this debate occurs at a time when the legislation committee is considering this legislation, so I do not propose to add anything further on that point; it has all been said. But certain things occurred during the committee's deliberations, many of which are on the public record, which I believe it is appropriate I refer to today.
The motion we are discussing is the failure of the regional forest agreement process to protect the remaining native forests of Australia. That is one of the more misleading statements that I have ever seen put before this chamber in terms of our being asked to discuss it. The very process that is being pursued as the Labor Party contemplates the RFA process is to lead to renewable, sustainable forests for harvesting together with reserves of forests, not the removal of the native forests, as is suggested in this proposition.
The first and most important point to be made is the Australian people should not be misled that the RFA process is about removing native forests. It is about retaining native forests either protected from logging or guaranteed to be sustained in a renewable 
 form. It also contemplates the creation of plantations so that, in the future, timber for pulping purposes, for example, will substantially come from the hardwood plantations that are grown as a result of the RFA process. My recollection of the environment movement's views on the use of forests is that it was preferable to use plantations for timber purposes. We have to get to that point somehow. The RFA process, as the Labor Party would contemplate it, will indeed lead us to that process.
Senator Bartlett's comment that he anticipates that the RFA will hurt small sawmillers flies in the face of the attitude of some of the green supporters who attended the hearings that we conducted in Melbourne. I was interested in the evidence of the Victorian Association of Forest Industries, particularly with regard to downstream processing. I asked for them to send me more information, and Mr Graeme Gooding sent me this letter and reinforced my recollection of something that took place at the hearing. A passage from his letter states:
I found the whole Senate Inquiry quite astounding with most issues raised by those submitting to your group quite irrelevant.
He is referring to the greens. He goes on:
Some seemed to think it was another RAC Timber Inquiry rather than a review about legislation. In particular I found it amazing in our session that the greens applauded the likes of Judy Clark when she essentially advocated closing down the 50 or so viable small (hardwood) businesses in Victoria and replacing them with one or two huge (softwood) corporations. They then laughed when I noted that Demby's sawmill in Toolangi had more than tripled their employment from less than 10 to 30 people. I could not stop thinking about what I thought was a bizarre event—environmental ideologues advocated big business is better than small family companies. Afterwards I recalled two points of relevance:
1.	 A media report last year noted that Auspine's relatively large pine mill in Portland had doubled its output last year and increased employment by 5 people. Gary Demby's little mill had doubled its output and increased employment by over 20 people. Gary is one of eight hardwood sawmills in the Central Highlands we surveyed who have increased direct employment in total by 160 people by value adding. 

It is my recollection that, when that sort of evidence was given, there was an attempt from the audience to belittle the witnesses. There was giggling and laughing—indeed, someone was blowing a whistle when evidence they did not like was being presented. I suppose every group can have its people who misbehave. Unfortunately, there seemed to be an organised pattern of behaviour indicating disrespect for the evidence that was being given.
Senator Calvert has given evidence of the sort of material that we received in evidence, which I also think is generally publicly known, about the outcome of the RFA in Tasmania. Having gone through numerous inquiries into its timber industry, world heritage areas and logging practices—and I am sure it will go through a number of other inquiries as it follows the RFA process and, as far as is possible, perfect the operation of the timber industry—Tasmania starts with a world-class forestry industry in many respects but will end up with an even better one. At the end of the RFA process, assuming that the Senate gives approval to the process—and that is a matter which I do not propose to comment on now—it will have an even better industry. I would hazard to suggest that, at the end of that period, even more timber will be taken not from native forests but from plantations, and I suspect that plantations will increase as a result of the RFA process.
One of the problems we have in dealing with this sort of legislation and environment issues generally is the nature of environmental politics. I have been a long-time supporter of environmental issues, and I have supported the environment movement in relation to many issues they have taken up about the forestry industry. Indeed, the forestry industry now will say that some of their past practices were horrendous, were unsustainable and ought to have been changed, and they have recognised that those practices changed, in part, through the contribution of the environment movement. I put on record today that the environment movement has played an important part in correcting some of the problems in the forestry industry and some other environmental issues.
The problem we have is the environment movement has not become an issues movement but a party political movement. To sustain itself, it needs the big issues to attract voters. It needs the icon environment issue so that it can run around and attract supporters to vote for it at the next election. Unfortunately, if the issue is not there, it has to do something, and that something is manufacture the issue. Unfortunately, there is a strong element of manufacturing issues in the complaints being made about the RFA process.
I am not saying the process is perfect and I am not saying that there is no scope for improvement. What I am saying is that we have moved from the environment movement saying that we need more and more plantation timber, that pine plantations were bad and that we should have a sustainable forestry industry, and we will get to the point where parts of the environment movement will do anything possible to sabotage the industry, irrespective of the impact that will have on jobs in regional economies in Tasmania, parts of Victoria, parts of New South Wales and parts of Western Australia. I am not saying that every RFA will necessarily be good.
—How many jobs has it created in Tasmania?
—I listened to you peacefully, Senator Brown, so give me the same courtesy. In terms of each of those RFAs, the outcome of this legislation is as yet not determined. As I said before, I cannot make any comment without anticipating the debate on that legislation, which would be out of order. That debate is yet to be had. To have said in this debate that the RFAs fail to protect the remaining native forests of Australia is blatantly arrant nonsense and, as has been suggested, it has placed Senator Woodley, who is part of our committee, in a difficult position in relation to his position on the committee's report to the Senate. However, I noted that there was a difference of opinion between the Democrats earlier today on one of the votes. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Regional Forests Agreements</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-02-17,"—I will take up directly what Senator O'Brien just alluded to. Senator Bartlett chose to speak for the Democrats today. He stated 
 that their policy was that the Democrats stand against the RFAs in total, which has totally compromised Senator Woodley. We on the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee know only too well that Senator Woodley would be quite split with Senator Bartlett on this issue. As far as I can gauge to this point, Senator Woodley has agreed with the processes and principles of the RFAs. But now we have to assume that the Democrats are against the processes and outcomes of all RFAs.
Senator Bartlett failed to put any alternative before the Senate. The Democrats have no policy, other than to be against the RFAs. We can only assume that Senator Bartlett and the Democrats want to take us back to the old system, which was no system at all. It was just a system of confrontation, and it was the very reason the RFA process and outcomes were produced. Prior to that, we had terrible confrontations. Senators would remember only too well the logging trucks that surrounded Parliament House. That was one of the most dramatic demonstrations. The greens who invaded the East Gippsland area created another dramatic confrontation. All of those confrontations bring instability and uncertainty to the industry. All of them produce great social unrest and conflict for the 6 o'clock news, but that, it seems, is what the Democrats want to take us back to. The truth is they now join the extreme greens. Many of them, if not most of them, came before the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee to give evidence. They also wanted the total abolition of the RFA. That is the bottom line.
The truth is that they really do not want any logging at all. That is the stance of Senator Brown, which does not surprise any of us, but it does surprise us when the Democrats want to take up that position. They seem to be taking the side of the environmental movement, which wants the total abolition of the industry regardless of the $2 billion trade deficit we have at the moment. Senator O'Brien and Senator Forshaw, who surprisingly made some good contributions to this MPI— 
—They are usually excellent. This time they were good.
—Senator Forshaw, you spoilt your contribution when you politicised it by attacking the minister. You felt you had to do that, but that was nothing compared to the submissions we received from the environmental movement when they came before the committee, particularly when we were in Melbourne. Never have I seen a movement marginalise themselves so much before a Senate committee. They were intransigent. They were exhibitionists. They exaggerated their case. They were unresearched and fanatical.
Senator Brown interjecting—
—They were all those things, Senator Brown. I will give just one example. One group before us was Environment Victoria Inc., as they call themselves. They were involved in the early part of the RFA process and negotiations in East Gippsland. They went to the point of comparing the process of the RFA to Nazism, but they just could not get their point through. Their point was ridiculous. That was the type of language they used and it totally marginalised them in the debate.
The truth is that they objected to the outcomes of the RFA, not the processes of it. If the processes fell completely their way, they would not be against RFAs. They objected to the outcome—an outcome that is based on some pretty sound principles, which it looks like they will never agree to. There are 11 national principles stated in the RFA as well as broad criteria for biodiversity. No criteria are broader than these: the protection of 90 per cent or more of high quality wilderness, and East Gippsland meets that criteria; a retention in reserves of at least 60 per cent of existing old growth, and East Gippsland meets that criteria; and a benchmark of 15 per cent of the pre-1750s distribution of each of the forest communities to be protected, and we meet that criteria and better it.
The truth is that, without the RFA process, without the RFA outcomes, we are going to go back to the bad old days of confrontation. That is what the Democrats want. Of course, 
 that is what Senator Brown wants. He loves to see himself on the 6 o'clock news. But it will bring down the industry and it will cause great social disharmony.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Regional Forests Agreements</title>,Matters of Public Importance,16,1,speech

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-17,"—A little earlier in the day, when in 
 debate on item 19 of schedule 1, we spoke about some of the issues that arise in relation to the enrolment form, prescribed persons and the regulations that now, today, in draft form have at least been provided to the opposition and other interested senators. And, in relation to debate on this matter, I do stress that these particular regulations are very much in just a draft form.
For example, now that I have had an opportunity to look at them, I note the following in part 4 of the regulations dealing with electors who can attest a claim for enrolment:
11 For paragraph 98(2)(c) of the act:
(a) an elector is a prescribed class of electors if the elector is a person mentioned in schedule 3; and
(b) if no person mentioned in schedule 3 is available for the person making the claim, an elector is in a prescribed class of electors if the elector:
(1)	 is not related to the person making the claim by birth or marriage; and
(2)	 is approved by an Australian Electoral Officer or the DRO.
After that draft regulation appears a comment—one assumes, an AEC comment—and let me quote it:
The notion of a prescribed class involves the presumption that the membership is fixed by the regulations. There is an element of subdelegation in the provision that an officer can approve membership of the class. It would be better for this power to be given by the act.
Then we go on to `verification of identity', also in part 4. Let me quote from the draft regulations:
12(1) For subsection 98(2)(a) of the act, the identity of a person making a claim must be verified by at least one of the following original documents:
(a)	 documentary evidence of the applicant's identity.
Let me interpolate what is in the document as a comment in respect of the draft regulation `(a) documentary evidence of the applicant's identity'. The comment reads:
Your instructions refer to section 202B of the Tax Act. That section simply says that an application must be accompanied by documentary evidence of the applicant's identity. There is no definition of what may or may not be acceptable evidence, nothing is added here by referring to the Tax Act.
And so it goes on. Then we get down to `verification of Australian citizenship' in part 
 13 of the regulations, which I will quote. Part 13(2) states:
The person's Australian citizenship must be verified by any of the following:
(a)	 provision of:
	 (1)	 an Australian citizenship certificate; or
	 (2)	 an Australian passport; or
	 (3)	 an Electoral Commission enrolment application form given to the person by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs . . . 
Again, there is a comment in the document which reads:
I am not sure if this is what you want here. The form was not attached to the instructions. Is this a document with evidence of the person's citizenship given to the person when citizenship is granted?
We are being asked to agree with draft regulations that are in this form. What about schedule 3 of the draft regulations on electors who can attest claim for enrolment? There the comment reads:
There is a similar list in the statutory declarations regulations. Could that be adopted? A statutory declaration may well be needed with some urgency while an electoral enrolment is a more routine activity that is prescribed persons for statutory declaration should be more than enough for electoral enrolments.
This is the form that currently the draft regulations are in. I am not necessarily critical. I appreciate that obviously they have to go through this phase in terms of their development. But the point I made earlier today is that we had this legislation first introduced into the parliament in May of last year. We have had a long time, almost a year, for these regulations to be worked up and developed and, I think, provided in a more complete form than the form that was just received this morning from the minister. I do believe, Mr Temporary Chairman, that is a very substantive point for us to make as well as having to deal here with the substance of the issue.
There are major problems in relation to item 20—the proposals to insert parts 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D after subsection 98(2) of the act. There are difficulties in some cases with very genuine people with the verification of Australian citizenship. I really think in the circumstances, even with the AEC and the government having finally worked this matter 
 through in draft regulation form, that we do not have a position where this committee ought to be expected to sign on to these regulations. This is totally unacceptable. I think it would be a grave mistake for the committee to just blindly accept the government's proposal in relation to these quite significant changes to the Electoral Act.
I have said before that what is motivating this is simply paranoia on the part of the government—and I stress that. The government's view, belief, claims, if you like, that there is widespread electoral fraud have never been able to be justified. This is motivated by paranoia on the part of the government; it is not motivated by a desire to ensure that we have maximum integrity in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. That is the problem.
As I have said before, this is going to cost an enormous amount of money for what is, at this stage still, a dog's breakfast of a proposal that is before the committee. Why should the committee be so courageous as to bite this one off? Why should we, given the stage of development of the regulations, accept what the government is proposing?
I question very seriously the government's motivation. I question very seriously the process that has got us up to this stage. I question very seriously the state of development of these regulations, even in their current draft form. I strongly advise the committee not to embrace them at this point. It is for that reason that the opposition will be opposing item 20.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-02-17,"—The regulations can only be put forward in draft form. As I have said previously, it is not normal when you have legislation being debated in the form of a bill to have the proposed regulations also before the Senate or the House. In fact, this is a bit like putting the cart before the horse, but we have done this in the interests of making available to the opposition and the other parties a full disclosure of what we are proposing. The reason we cannot have it in final form is that we still have to negotiate with the states, because we have a joint role situation.
—You could have had it in a more developed form than this. And you could have provided it a bit earlier, and you know it.
—We have just had a comment that you could not have it in a more developed form, and we have just had criticism from the opposition that this is in such a draft form that they do not want to sign off on it. You cannot have it both ways.
—I said it could be in a more developed form than this, and we could have had it a lot earlier than you have provided it.
—It is in as advanced a form as we could possibly have it for this debate. If we did have to put it off to get the consultation to the states and those agencies for which we are talking about where you can lodge an enrolment, then you would be waiting for another year.
—We have been waiting for a year already.
—We know why there was a delay, because the bill was not debated because an election came along. Then we had a new parliament, and then we had the Christmas break. There is no great shakes in saying that there has been this inordinate delay. We have had an election, a new parliament and the Christmas break. That is a substantial reason for any delay.
I would suggest these regulations are in sufficient form for the committee to make an informed decision. Once this bill is dealt with and this provision is passed, we will then go to the states and deal with the states in relation to the joint role provisions and those agencies to ensure that there is no problem; that you can, for instance, go to Centrelink or Australia Post to lodge your enrolment to vote. It is as simple as that. That is the situation, and nothing could be clearer.
What we have here is a proposal by the government that there should be some verification of identity for those people enrolling for the first time. What we are saying is that it is quite curious—in fact, more than curious; it is inappropriate—that you have a stricter requirement to open a bank account than you 
 do to get on the roll to vote. Gaining the right to vote is a very important right indeed, and we believe as a government there should be some scrutiny in that process. It is as simple as that. What I am saying is that there are adequate provisions in these regulations for the committee to form a very informed view. In any event, these regulations could be subject to disallowance. At the end of the day, the government has a sound proposal as to the scrutiny for the enrolment of new voters.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-17,"—I was making the point a little earlier in relation to item 24 that the real concern is the reference to prescribed person. It is not, perhaps, as much a threshold issue as some of the others, but we have indicated very clearly our concerns there. I am disappointed that the committee does not share the opposition's concern in relation to the prescribed persons. I would suggest that it is worth all committee members apprising themselves of schedule 3 of the draft regulations: the electors who can 
 attest claim for enrolment. It is very limited, and I think it is going to cause a great deal of logistical difficulties in the real world.
This is the point that I particularly made to Senator Harradine, through the chair. This is going to cause problems for people, whether they be house-bound or whether they live in rural areas—where there are a whole range of reasons why they cannot easily access someone who fits one of the categories here. This is unnecessarily causing grief and difficulty to people who genuinely want to participate in the democratic process. I would say again to Senator Harradine, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that I hope he has cast his eye over this list that has now been made available in draft form. I hope he makes a close examination of it and, as I say, the logistical difficulties it is going to cause so many in the community.
That is the reason that the opposition has opposed item 19 and item 20, and now item 24. It is a serious issue, but one I think we have probably debated now at significant length. I do not want to delay the committee, but I also want to impress upon the committee and reinforce the strong arguments that I think we have mounted in relation to our concerns about prescribed persons.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-02-17,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, the government has proposed that, while you would have an increased requirement for identification, you would afford persons seeking to enrol to vote a greater opportunity to lodge their enrolment form. So you would have more outlets or more venues at which you could go to lodge your enrolment.
In the draft regulations which we circulated, we indicated that places that could take these enrolment form applications are approved agencies of the government of the states or territories. That could be quite wide. It could be the electoral commission offices in relation to those states or territories; ATSIC—which would cover the indigenous sector of the community; Australia Post; an Australian embassy or consulate overseas—which would cover people travelling overseas; Centrelink—which is widely distributed through the 
 country; any court of petty sessions, district courts, the Supreme Court; the electoral authority of a state or territory; a local government authority or a local shire office; or a migrant resource centre—for those people newly arrived in Australia.
We have opened up the places where you can lodge your application to enrol to vote. We think this is a very good move, notwithstanding that our previous proposal to strengthen the identification of the person enrolling to vote was lost. We believe that this is a good move because it increases the opportunity and the availability of places where a person can enrol to vote. The current situation is that you do that through the AEC.
The fate of the former provision—which I mentioned might have to be revisited—remains to be seen. But, for the present, the government maintains its proposal in relation to this matter and commends it to the committee.

Increasingly members of parliament are liable to fall into this situation. It is one that can be fixed.

—Senator Brown, I will convey your request to the President.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-17,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, I think you would be aware that the opposition has consistently taken a view in relation to senators missing divisions, who are almost always coalition senators, I might add—and I think that is a fair statement, given the record—that we have time and again recommitted votes taken in committee and in the Senate. The problem is simple: I feel we have now reached the point where the goodwill of the opposition is being taken advantage of by the government.
I do not direct this directly at Senator Lightfoot. It just so happens that the Senator Lightfoot incident is the third one since the Senate has resumed this week. We had a senator missing a division earlier in the week in relation to a vote to extend a committee reference, and we have had two instances of senators missing divisions in the committee stage of this bill—Senator Lightfoot on this occasion, Senator Ian Macdonald on the previous occasion, and the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Campbell, in the first instance I referred to.
There is no doubt that if Senator Lightfoot had attended the division the outcome of the vote would have been different. I accept that. The point I make is this: time and again the 
 opposition demonstrates its goodwill by recommitting votes and ensuring that the will of the electorate is reflected on the floor of the Senate as votes are taken. I make this as a very serious point to the government: at some point there has to be an effort made by the government to  lift its game.
The government cannot slack off on its whip arrangements or on ensuring discipline amongst coalition senators, knowing full well that it really does not matter because the good old opposition on this side of the chamber, because it takes a principled and proper approach to these sorts of issues, will always play ball and agree to recommit votes. That does appear to be a trend that is developing. I hope the minister at the table would agree that that is simply not on. You just cannot depend all the time on the opposition to dig the government out of a hole of its own creation.
I do not direct this particularly to Senator Lightfoot. I make that point. This is the most recent incident in a long line of failures on the part of the government to get its act into gear. That is not to say that on the very rare occasion opposition senators have not missed divisions and been in similar circumstances. But I tell you what: the numbers on missing divisions are overwhelmingly in favour of the government. There have literally been only a couple of instances since Labor lost government in 1996 when a vote has needed to be recommitted—only two that I can recall—because of an error by an opposition senator.
Government senators are doing this time and time again. If the government simply takes advantage of this by saying, `If we miss a key vote, what the hell does it matter, because the opposition will recommit the matter and we will get on with it,' that is not good enough. I think it is about time the government recognised that it is not good enough.
The government should also recognise the appalling example Senator Alston has set in this regard as the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. I suspect that is one of the reasons this has occurred. Senator Alston has made an absolute art form of missing divisions over the last couple of 
 years. As deputy leader, he is in a position in which he ought to be setting an example. If that is the example that is set, we have too many other senators following it, including recently another senior government office holder in the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I make that point very seriously. I think it is a reasonable point that the opposition is entitled to see the government take a little more effort in ensuring discipline in relation to votes in this chamber.
The arguments that are presented in relation to the courtyard might be right. Maybe the bells do not ring in the courtyards, but there are lights in the courtyards. Senators are supposed to be wearing pagers. There are a range of mechanisms to ensure that we do not have this circumstance occur. I stress: I do not blame Senator Lightfoot, because he is the last in a great long line of government senators who have failed the test of coming to divisions, and it is senior government senators who have set such a bad example.
Of course, we have also nailed our colours to the mast on this, because we have said that we will do the honourable and proper thing. We will continue to do the honourable and proper thing, but I will tell you what: we are entitled to revisit this if our goodwill is just going to be continually exploited by the government in the way it has. Just because the opposition—and, for that matter, minor party senators and Senator Harradine—agree to recommitting votes it does not means that the processes and procedures of this place can be taken for granted. I hope that is a message that Senator Ellison as the responsible minister in the chamber at the moment and the Government Whip, who is on duty in the chamber at the moment, take on board seriously. I am now saying that the opposition will agree to recommit a vote that yet again has meant that a very important provision that is going to very significantly impact on the electoral processes in this country is going to be changed as a result of opposition goodwill. But we have set the benchmark in this. Do not take advantage of it. Do not exploit it, and do not take us for granted.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-02-17,"—I can assure Senator Faulkner that I do 
 take this matter very seriously. I point out that this is the first time we have asked for a recommittal on a bill this session.
—This session, which is three days old.
—I am not going to make excuses for the other two people who missed divisions. It does so happen that I have taken this up with the Prime Minister's office, and the bells do not ring in his office either, which is where Senator Macdonald was when he missed a division. The beepers do not work there either. That is something we did not know before. So if you are having a visit to the Prime Minister's office some time, Senator Faulkner, and your beeper does not go off and you do not hear the bells, you will understand why.
—That will be a red-letter day—
—It is not likely to happen soon.
—I can assure you that the government takes this matter very seriously. In Senator Campbell's case it is the first division he has ever missed since he has been coming to this place. I also remind you, Senator Faulkner, that we have recommitted votes in the same manner as you have, notwithstanding the fact—
—How many?
—I will check. I know there were at least two occasions last year when there were serious matters—
—Two, as opposed to 22.
—That is not the point. The point I am making is that I hear what you say. I take the matter very seriously, as do all senators on this side.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-02-17,"—I rise to indicate that, in response to Senator Brown's comments, Senator Faulkner made some comments about pagers. I have been in the courtyard and I have heard pagers go off. I have also heard bells from inside the building. But the fact of the matter is that 
 every senator is issued with a pager. I know that my office and Senator Calvert's office page senators for divisions. If the senator chooses not to carry the pager and as a result of that this chamber is then asked to recommit a vote, then we should understand that the basis for the recommittal is that the senator has refused to carry a pager.  	 I do accept that sometimes pagers do not go off. In fact I was at a meeting where mine did not work, and I had it checked. But that is the responsibility of the individual senator, because it is their lifeline with this chamber when they are conducting their affairs and performing their duties around this very large building.
I want to emphasise that I do not accept that being in the courtyard and not hearing the bells is a reasonable excuse. I would not accept that from one of my colleagues as a reasonable excuse, because I know that they are issued with a pager and I know that, barring a technical difficulty, they should be aware that there is a division, be able to read a message on their pager and attend the chamber in good time to vote. In response to some of the comments made and Senator Calvert's comments, I am sure that he has emphasised to his senators that they must wear their pagers, even in the Prime Minister's office.

I know that Senator Harradine has mentioned that in some remote areas you may have difficulty finding someone who might be able to fulfil that role of witnessing an enrolment. I am conscious of that, especially coming from a state like Western Australia which has vast remote areas.
The government put this forward as a draft regulation. There is an understanding that where you have a situation which might not be accommodated by the list here, that has to be rectified. After all, we are not about to disadvantage people in remote areas or areas where there is no access to the people listed.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-17,"—by leave—I move Democrats amendments Nos 5 and 7 on sheet 1227:
(5)	 Schedule 1, after item 29, page 8 (after line 5), insert:
29A  After paragraph 133(1)(a)
	 Insert:
		 (aa)	 certify a copy of the party's constitution and make it available for public inspection under section 139; 

[section 133—party constitution to be publicly available]
(7)	 Schedule 1, page 9 (after line 27), after item 44, insert:
44A  At the end of section 314AB
	 Add:
	 (3)	 The first return under paragraph (1)(a) or (1)(b) after each election must include a copy of the registered political party's constitution that is current at the date of the return.

[section 314AB—party constitution to be provided after each election]
These are related amendments which my colleague and fellow traveller on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, Senator Murray, moved when the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill went through this chamber, albeit in a slightly modified version. The purpose of these amendments is to place an onus upon political parties when lodging their annual returns immediately following elections to also lodge an up-to-date copy of their constitution, which would then be available for public inspection.
Political parties remain fairly nebulous institutions in our community and derive their chief source of legality from this Electoral Act that we are discussing today. As the rise and fall of the One Nation party has illustrated, the customs of political parties do not necessarily insulate against improper use being made of those parties or, as we have recently seen, the privileges that attach to such a status. Even getting a clear indication of the structure and manner of operation of some political parties is fairly difficult. Nowadays incorporated associations and trade unions must all lodge constitutions which generally are available for public scrutiny.
This amendment seeks to make political parties and their organisational structure more transparent. Given, as has also been widely publicised, some of those parties at least are able to potentially be the recipient of a significant amount of public funds, the Democrats believe that it is all the more appropriate that this fairly small measure should be incorporated as part of the act.
Already when political parties apply for registration under section 126(2)(f) of the act, 
 they have to provide a copy of the constitution of the party. But that is not made publicly available and there is no requirement to provide any updated version at any stage after the party has initially been registered. These amendments seek ensure that when or if the Electoral Commission determines that a political party's application for registration should be accepted and the party should be registered, the commissioner would certify a copy of the party's constitution and make it available for public inspection under section 139 of the act, which deals with inspection of the register of political parties.
To ensure that that is updated, the related amendment requires the party to put in an up-to-date version of their constitution with their first return to the commission after each federal election to ensure that the public is able to have access to an up-to-date version of that party's constitution in case they try to radically change their structure in the interim. It is basically about ensuring a bit more transparency in the organisational structure of Australia's political parties. The Democrats believe that that is something, particularly in light of recent public debate on this issue, that would be a positive move.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-17,"—There may be an element of merit in this proposal that the Democrats have moved by way of amendments. I think we do understand what the Democrats are trying to achieve here. I am not convinced about the proposal. I am not convinced that the administration of this would not be very cumbersome. I do not how it would work in practice.
I would say to Senator Bartlett that it seems to me that it would be worth looking at the merits of this proposal through the processes of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. If there is a case to be made in relation to it, then as part of the deliberations on the current reference to the committee of the 1998 federal election, we could look at it through that forum. I would be interested to hear the case as it might be mounted.
I am trying to say something positive about amendments that, at this stage, the opposition cannot see its way clear to support. I do say, 
 even though we will be opposing it, that it might have some merit.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-17,"—The Greens support the Democrat amendments here. If you turn it around the other way, why should the constitutions of political parties, particularly political parties which are in receipt of public funding or potentially in receipt of public funding as a result of elections, not be open to scrutiny? One political party, One Nation, recently has had a lot of heartache over its own party constitution, with members publicly feeling aggrieved about it. It would be a healthy thing for the political parties involved to know that at each election the returns after the election will involve them lodging a copy of the party constitution, as it may have been amended in the intervening years, so that it is there for all to see—a good piece of public accountability and transparency.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-02-17,"—I seek some clarification from the mover. On revised sheet 1227, are we dealing with amendments Nos 5 and 7 or are we only dealing with amendment No. 7?
—Numbers 5 and 7.
—If we are dealing with amendment No. 5, that, in effect, is to retain section 96A of the act.
—The main difference will be making it available for public inspection.
—I am sorry. The Democrats amendment No. 5 says, `Schedule 1, item 18, page 5 (lines 24 and 25), to be opposed.' My version—that is the government's proposal—says `Schedule 1, lines 24 and 25, item 18, section 96A, repeal the section.' Am I missing the point?
—No. I suspect you have sheet 1227, revised 2, or is it revised 1? It is probably an earlier version of the amendment sheet, I suspect.
—This doesn't have `revised 1' on it. So we have `revised 2', do we? Thank you.
—The old goalposts have gone walkabout.
—Yes, the goalposts have shifted a bit. I see that it is relevant to the point that was made. I might just mention, apropos of Senator Faulkner's comments, that this matter has been around for a while, as I recall. So far as I am concerned, I have had sufficient time to chew it over. I see no reason why this should be opposed. What is wrong with requiring a political party to lodge a copy of its constitution at the time it is going to make the returns seeking taxpayers' funding? I intend without further ado to support this amendment. I do hope the major parties, the Labor Party and the coalition—the Liberal Party and the National Party—see fit to support this or, if not, to give us a pretty good reason as to why this shouldn't be supported.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-02-17,"—The government has a view which is not dissimilar to that of the opposition. Might I say at the outset that I know from my own state that the Incorporation of Associations Act requires that any body which is incorporated under that act should have a constitution and that it has to be lodged with what was formerly the corporate affairs office. It is lodged there for public scrutiny and is available for inspection. I am hazarding a guess here, but I would assume that in all other states the situation would be much the same. Political parties are incorporated under such legislation. So there is, I would submit, in state legislation already a situation where a constitution of a political party is lodged with an agency and that it is subject to public scrutiny.
However, having said that, I don't take anything away from the spirit of the proposal 
 put forward by the Democrats. There would be some administrative burden to the AEC in this, although, I would concede, it would not be overly burdensome. But the suggestion of Senator Faulkner's is not a bad one. Perhaps the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters could have a look at this. It is something which we cannot see our way clear to support today but perhaps the committee could have a look at it and include it in its report. It has current terms of reference looking into the 1998 election, and this is something it could take up. But I do not think at this stage the government can see its way clear to supporting either of these proposals.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-17,"—I will not delay the Senate greatly. I realise the situation with the numbers, and I do welcome at least the indication of interest, if you like, from both the coalition and the ALP and the possibility of exploring this in the upcoming inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Nonetheless, I do think it is worth highlighting that, as Senator Harradine said, it is not that difficult a measure. The constitution is already provided to the Electoral Commission when a registration is first put in, so really the only extra work would be adding that to all the other details that are already required on the register, such as the name of the party and the name and address of the registered officer, et cetera.
I do not think that is overly onerous. I do not think that having one extra piece of paper added to the returns, that have to be put in every year in any case, would generate particularly enormous amounts of administrative work for the Electoral Commission, given the amount it is already required to do in assessing returns of political parties. So I do not believe it would be a major measure.
On Senator Ellison's point about the availability already of the constitutions in some states under incorporated associations law, I am not an expert on the political structure of every political party registered in the country partly because you cannot see where their constitutions are so you do not know, but I would hazard a guess that a number of parties are not incorporated in various states and I am 
 not sure they would be necessarily available in that regard. In any case, we will pursue this through the joint select committee. In the meantime, anyone who actually wants to see the Democrats' constitution at any stage should look on our web site.

—We now move to schedule 1, items 44 and 45.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-17,"—This is a very important part of this particular bill, and one which does deserve some close attention from the committee. Items 44 and 45 really represent another attempt by the coalition parties to weaken disclosure. Weakening disclosure and the disclosure provisions of the act are something that the coalition has consistently pursued now for at least 15 years.
We believe that these increases in electoral funding disclosure thresholds would allow for significant sums of money to go through without being disclosed, and we cannot support that. Even the AEC does not support these measures. I think they have been driven along here by the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party. In the AEC's submission to the Senate inquiry into this legislation, it said in respect of thresholds for reporting donations:
The AEC advised against such changes in a submission to the JSCEM inquiry into the conduct of the 1996 election. 

That is very important to note. During the Senate inquiry into this legislation, the head of funding and disclosure of the AEC conceded the following:
The way that a donor can make such a large donation without being disclosed is by donating up to the threshold to each state and territory branch of a political party. So, for a party that is organised nationally in every state and territory plus with a national secretariat, you are looking at nine separate identified parties, in effect, for disclosure purposes.
A donor can make separate donations to each of those parties. Because they are not aggregated across the party across Australia, only within each state and territory, they will not be disclosed. So . . . they could donate $4,999 a year to each state and territory branch of a political party and go undisclosed. That would add up to just short of $45,000.
He is right. That is what it is all about, and that is what could happen.
—Except when you've got only one branch.
—Senator Harradine, there is one of you, but I would ask that, in relation to these particular items—that is, items 44 and 45—you look at the possibility of manipulation by perhaps a major political party. I would not want to name one, but the obvious one would be the Liberal Party of Australia. I appreciate Senator Harradine's unique circumstances in relation to that, but this is a very important principle.
It is important to note also that the AEC conceded that there were a number of other ways in which donors could split their donations so they would not be disclosed. For example, each member of a family could donate separately or a family and a company could donate up to the disclosure limit.
The problem here is that the coalition parties simply do not like political disclosure. It is as simple as that. They have never supported it. Their use of the Greenfields Foundation rort does nothing to inspire any confidence at all in the arguments they have brought to bear in relation to these particular clauses. We are going to be pursuing further amendments in the Senate to try to close once and for all that Greenfields Foundation rort.
As far as the Labor Party is concerned, we have always advocated tight and transparent 
 funding and disclosure provisions. We are not going to allow items 44 and 45 to see the Liberal Party national secretariat fundamentally and very significantly undermine the integrity of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, because that is what these items do. These items are key provisions in this bill, and the Senate really has to stand up and be counted on this issue. We need to retain the integrity of the Electoral Act and ensure that those who donate to and support political parties have those donations disclosed. That is in this parliament's interest, and I would suggest to the committee that it is very much in the public interest.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-02-17,"—I too am opposed to the proposed increase from $1,500 to $10,000 in subsection 305B(1) and from $1,500 to $5,000 in subsection 314AC(1). The matter has been canvassed by Senator Faulkner, but we all know that even the $1,500 can be circumvented. For example, an organisation could pay its members certain funds which are then to be paid to the particular political party, whether it be the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or any other party. For example, porn merchants could be organising their video outlets and individuals to pay certain moneys to a particular political party, each of those donations being $1,499. Eleven organisations or individuals could pay that and be reimbursed, and there is no way that could be tracked by the AEC.
This is the sort of situation that can arise even under the current provisions. You are never going to have complete transparency, and that is the point I am making. In particular, you will never have complete transparency in a situation where the party—whether it be the Labor Party, the Liberal Party or any individual party—does not want to be seen to be receiving donations from particular sources. What can be done about that, I do not know. Possibly nothing can be done about it, but let us at least keep the lower threshold that is currently in the legislation.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-17,"—I agree with both the previous speakers. It is difficult to prevent people from usurping the spirit of the current laws which state that, if 
 you donate $1,500 or more, it must be disclosed. To raise that to $10,000 is to raise by six or eight times the ability of large amounts of money to be transferred by way of donations to the political parties without it being traced. It is when people go to some length to hide the fact that the donation is coming that I suspect political leverage is most wanted as an outcome by those donors. Therefore, there is the greatest need for those people to be under scrutiny.
I do not know why the government wants this change. I would be interested to hear in succinct terms from the minister why the government thinks keeping a longer list of donors who contributed $1,500 or more is more difficult than keeping a shorter list of those who contributed $10,000 or more. One cannot help but suspect that the government sees a very clear advantage in having more of its donors shielded from the glare of public scrutiny. If that is the case, that is not a good thing. If that is not the case, then why bring these amendments forward? It does not add up. They are not a good thing; they are going in the wrong direction. The Greens, like the previous speakers, totally oppose the government amendments.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-02-17,"—In relation to that last comment, these amounts have not been altered since, I believe, the 1992-93 financial year, so I would submit the effluxion of time has some relevance here. When these amounts were set, it was thought that there were obvious levels below which there should not be any disclosure and that, over time, those levels naturally would increase with the CPI, inflation and other things.
In relation to private donations to political parties, it is quite important because the government does not see that political parties should be entirely dependent on public funding. There are some who would say, `Let's rub out private funding entirely and just have it on public funding.' But if that were the case, you would then have parties, as I mentioned before, that would simply run in an election, have a percentage of the vote and collect their cheque. Other parties wanting to 
 do more would want to not only rely on public funding but also rely on their own resources in obtaining donations and donations in kind.
I think that all political parties have received private donations—quite properly so. There is perhaps a perception that this question of donation to a political party has some cloud over it. The legislation recognises that donations to political parties are a way of life. The question is the level at which you draw the line for disclosure purposes.
The government believes that, in view of the effluxion of time and the fact that there is a question of the amount by which you might deter people from making a donation if it were to be disclosed—for instance, $500 to $1,500 for an individual, and $1,500 to $10,000 and $1,500 to $5,000 for the organisations—that could well deter people from making a donation because they do not want to have the disclosure. Obviously, some people do not want to make their political allegiances public. I think that is a part of our system which is important. We have a secret ballot—no-one questions that. The country led the way in that.
But the situation is that the support of political parties is not something that everyone would wear on their sleeves, for obvious reasons. I would expect there would be supporters of the opposition who would not want to be readily identified as supporters of the opposition, for personal reasons or other reasons—and I respect that. But it is a question of the line you draw in relation to disclosure.
I can foreshadow that the opposition has some amendments which the government will be supporting, the ones dealing with associated entities. We support those because we do not want to see the system circumvented. We have indicated to the opposition that we will be supporting these amendments. There are some that we have a difficulty with due to technicalities, but that is purely the definition of a loan and a credit card. We will deal with them later. But, right now, the government would commend these amendments to the committee.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-17,"—This section of the legislation is of great concern to the Democrats. I don't think it would be blowing our own trumpet too much to say that the issue of disclosure of donations and openness in relation to transparency of funding and donations to political parties is something that the Democrats have pursued with some vigour for many years. Our concern goes back to my predecessor from Queensland, Senator Michael Macklin, who pursued these sorts of issues with great diligence over many years.
It is important to emphasise what we are discussing here in this part of the bill: we are not talking about rubbing out private donations or the ability for political parties to receive funds from private sources—not at all—in fact, I would quite like the Democrats to receive a lot more funds and donations than we do from private sources. I am quite happy to be open about that.
Why the Democrats have concerns with this part of the bill is that it is not about rubbing out private donations—far from it—it is about rubbing out an appropriate level of transparency and openness about private donations. That is something that I am quite sure all of us would agree is of great concern to the Australian public: that people have some ability to be aware of who is donating and who is providing funding—as long as the transparency is there. It is similar to senators and members having to individually declare our assets and have that publicly available or tabled. It is not a way of saying that we cannot have assets; it is a way of being open and upfront about what they are so that there is transparency in the system and some opportunity for public faith in the system.
As I have said a number of times in this debate, public faith in the system is seriously stretched in Australia at the moment. As a parliament, we do not want to be supporting measures that will further increase public cynicism or will lead to a decrease in public faith in the political and parliamentary process. The Democrats are opposed to the two sections of the bill that we are debating at the moment—again, just to make it clear to those multitudes listening to the debate. In parts of 
 the legislation currently, if a person in any one financial year makes gifts totalling $1,500 or more to any registered political party or the same state branch of a political party, they have to put in a return to the Electoral Commission.
What this measure seeks to do is change that to $10,000; that is, for a person now to be able to make a gift totalling $10,000 to the same registered political party or the same state branch. Of course, all of us here know that you can donate underneath the threshold to more than one branch of a political party and not be required to put in a return. So it is a significant leap. Whilst I take Senator Ellison's point about the effects of the CPI since these figures were first put in, we also have to look at the state of the world as it is now and the appropriate level of public expectation about what level of donations should be declared. I suggest that $10,000 is well and truly over and above that.
Similarly, the bill before us seeks to amend the act so that, instead of a party having to include particulars of where a sum amounting to more than $1,500 has come from, that amount will now move up to $5,000. Again, if this were to go through, once you factor in that a person or an organisation can donate to a number of different state branches of the one party plus the national level, you would have the ability to donate just under $5,000 to each state and territory branch plus, possibly, the national level. This would put you up around $40,000-odd. Over the course of an electoral cycle, a three-year period, you get up into well over $100,000 that can be donated to a political party as a whole, without there being any opportunity or requirement for that to be declared. In the view of the Democrats, that is well and truly over and above the level of transparency we should have in our Electoral Act.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-17,"—The Democrats oppose schedule 1, item 46. We are here talking about a similar issue of principle. Item 46 of the legislation again relates to reporting thresholds, and it is another section of the bill that the Democrats oppose. Just to clarify again what this one particularly deals with, the section above section 314AC(2) of the act currently states that, if the sum of all the amounts received by or on behalf of the party from a person or organisation during a financial year is $1,500 or more, the return must include the particulars of that sum. But currently in the act, in calculating that sum, any amount less than $500 does not need to be counted.
What this part of the bill seeks to do is raise that amount of $500 to $1,500. So, basically, any amount less than $1,500 does not need to be counted in determining whether or not a contribution for a financial year is $1,500 or more. Again, from the Democrats point of view, this looks like an inappropriate weakening of transparency requirements of the legislation. Again, this is a measure that, for reasons similar to those that I have just outlined, the Senate should oppose.

This is obviously a very important issue. It is an issue that has arisen from a lot of public concern and many concerns raised in the parliament, particularly by me on behalf of the opposition in relation to what I believe has been a mechanism used by the government to subvert the disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act.
What our amendments are about—the first three that have been accepted by the committee and these three—is simply this: we want 
 to end once and for all what we believe is the vehicle by which the Liberal Party has exploited any real or apparent loopholes in the Electoral Act. The vehicle that is being used, the Greenfields Foundation, has meant that one of the major political parties in this country, the  majority party in this coalition government, has been able to dodge full and transparent disclosure. I want to say this, being as generous as I can in the circumstances: the government did take some steps to address recommendation 10 of the March 1998 report of the AEC into funding and disclosure by broadening the investigative powers of the AEC in dealing with and determining whether or not an organisation is an associated entity.
We found out, as senators would know, during questioning of the Australian Electoral Commission at Senate estimates hearings last week, that the AEC recently utilised these powers for the first time to serve notice on the Greenfields Foundation on 15 January 1999. While those particular government amendments were sufficient for the purpose of broadening the investigative powers of the AEC in pursuing suspected associated entities, they have not gone far enough in relation to the crucial issue of closing the loophole in the legislation. That is what the opposition wants to do.
Let me explain to the committee what our amendments here are about. Firstly, they tighten the definition of `associated entity'. Secondly, they close the loophole in the event of the loan being given ultimately becoming a gift. Thirdly, they prevent loans from being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution unless certain information, such as terms and conditions of the loan, are disclosed. I might continue arguing this very strong case tomorrow.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-02-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document. 

This is the final report of the Safety Review Committee which has the responsibility to ensure the safety of the operations at Lucas Heights. It is the final report because its responsibilities are being taken over by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency and its councils and committees. The responsibility of this committee cannot be underestimated. Nuclear safety is an issue of paramount concern, and I have no reason to doubt the integrity or the qualifications or the commitment to safety or even the effectiveness of the committee in ensuring safety. But this report gives me no reason to have a lot of confidence either. One of the problems is the superficiality of much of the report. Whenever there is something of potential concern, it gets a glancing mention which raises more questions than answers. I will come to some of those concerns and the questions that come to mind in a moment.
The other problem is that the committee considered there were no matters arising in regard to the committee's functions B, C and D during the period of the report. These are the functions involving investigating and advising on matters which may have adverse consequences or safety implications. Even from the relative superficiality of the report, it is clear that there were matters that could well have been investigated. For example, there is the matter of the granting of temporary exemption from certain operating limits and conditions.
The report gives us no indication of which operating limits or conditions. Perhaps the minister could throw some light on this. Were these exemptions related to allowed levels of radiation exposure? What were the causes of the events which led to exemptions? Were the causes age related and do they have implications for the reactor surviving to the year 2005? Following these exemptions, the report tells us, the Nuclear Safety Bureau required ANSTO to provide data on the state of the reactor 24 hours after start-up. It would be nice to know that what that data said was okay.
Another issue worthy of investigation is the advice from the Nuclear Safety Bureau that, with foreseeable resource demands for the 
 replacement reactor project, the potential exists for resources to be diverted from HIFAR to the detriment of current high standards of reactor operations. When the Nuclear Safety Bureau starts flagging concerns like this, it is time to take notice. They draw attention to the loss of two senior staff, which they say represents a significant loss of managerial and technical expertise.
What this highlights is the issue of the skills base in Australia and the potential for difficulties in staffing the new reactor and the various monitoring bodies, especially when the new reactor might be running alongside the existing one for a period of time. It is good to see the Nuclear Safety Bureau being proactive in drawing attention to this problem, and I wonder if they have expanded on those concerns in the environmental impact statement on the new reactor.
Another issue arises in relation to the intermediate level liquid wastes. We are told liquid waste will be treated in a hot cell by a process of evaporation, de-ammoniation and solidification. We have been told this before. The question is: when will the process start? We are told the solid product may be suitable for processing into a ceramic form similar to synroc. May? This is typical of attitudes throughout the nuclear industry: create any amount of waste and work out what to do about it eventually. This is really not good enough.
Then there is the problem of the water in the spent fuel storage tubes. Again, it gets a mention in the report, but again the interesting thing is what is not said. How did the water get there? If it is rain water, then it must have been there for more than 10 years. What does that say about monitoring? How often are they checked and how? What about some genuinely independent monitoring? The International Atomic Energy Agency's monitoring is only to see if the seal is still in place. That is not safety monitoring. Is there any chance that corroded fuel elements will corrode further now that they are back in the ground? If water can get in through a faulty seal, one must wonder what can get out.
One area in which the Safety Review Committee seems to have been doing some 
 good work is in putting pressure on the industry in relation to worker safety. It is disappointing to note that there are still three radiation related injuries and five occasions on which radioactive materials were an accident factor. Thankfully, the doses involved were relatively small, but the fact is that any radiation accident is a serious worry. In the same way as we must work towards zero accidents, we must also work towards zero waste emissions. What guarantees can the minister give that the budget for capital works upgrade of waste management will be sufficient to achieve that end?
Finally, it is worth noting that what I see as deficiencies in the comprehensiveness of this report may be addressed to some extent by the strengthened community representation and reporting requirements which we achieved through amendments to the ARPANSA legislation.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-02-17,"—I too rise to make some comments with respect to the annual report of the Safety Review Committee for 1997-98. As Senator Margetts has noted, this is the final report of the Safety Review Committee. That body has now been superseded by the establishment of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, colloquially referred to as ARPANSA. The establishment of ARPANSA is noted in the report, but for the period that this report covered the legislation had gone through the House of Representatives but was awaiting approval by the Senate. That is noted at pages 5 to 7 of the report.
I wish to make some comments about the establishment of ARPANSA. Like many, I was looking forward to the establishment of ARPANSA as setting the scene for an increased level of scrutiny and regulation of Australia's nuclear industry. As honourable senators are aware, I have a particular interest and involvement in this issue because I happen to reside in the Sutherland Shire, not far from the Lucas Heights reactor and, like all honourable members of parliament, what is close to home is often an issue that is dear to our hearts. Of course, the issues involved here are ones which affect all Australians. 
 Consequently, it is absolutely essential that any body established to oversee the operations of our nuclear industry, particularly the operations of ANSTO, is totally independent.
My initial enthusiasm for the establishment of ARPANSA, which filled in many of the gaps that existed in the regulatory system within Australia, has waned somewhat. It has waned, firstly, because the legislation, when it was brought to this Senate, was grossly inadequate. It was only because of the amendments that were put forward by the opposition parties and the Greens in this chamber that we ended up with an act which goes a long way to ensuring that improved system of regulation and improved system of scrutiny. Since then, however, I have become rather concerned about what the future holds.
At the recent Senate estimates committee on 8 February—the Community Affairs Legislation Committee estimates—representatives of ARPANSA and the Department of Health and Family Services appeared before the committee. In evidence to that committee it was indicated that the chief executive officer's position at ARPANSA has still not been filled on a permanent basis. A Dr John Loy is in an acting capacity.
What was more disturbing was that—following questions from myself to the departmental officer—it was revealed in evidence that a selection committee had been established within the department to draw up a short list of applicants to go to the minister, from which he would make a choice as to who the new chief executive would be. The most disturbing feature of all is that one of the three members of that committee drawing up that short list of applicants is the current head of ANSTO, Professor Helen Garnett.
I make no personal reflection upon Professor Helen Garnett's professionalism or qualifications but, as is said in the law, justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done. If ARPANSA is to be an independent regulatory authority charged with the responsibility of overseeing the operations of ANSTO—in particular, the Lucas Heights reactor—then the head of ANSTO, the body to be regulated and scrutinised, should not be on the selection committee determining who should head up 
 this independent regulatory authority. I am amazed by that and I would urge the government to rethink its approach to filling this position. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1999-02-17,"—In a well ordered world, the role of the state is to protect the individual. The role of the state is to ensure that mechanisms exist so that the weak and the vulnerable do not fall prey to others in society who would wish to take advantage of them. To this end, we have established in this country—and elsewhere in the Western world—elaborate mechanisms to protect the weak and vulnerable. The problem arises, however, that sometimes those systems become corrupted. Sometimes, organs of the state, instead of being a protection for the weak and the vulnerable, become instead mechanisms of oppression.
Tonight, in the first of two planned contributions in this chamber, I want to outline the circumstances by which one of those organs of the state, instead of protecting the weak and vulnerable people—as the intention was when it was established—became a mechanism to continue the oppression of the weak and the vulnerable. The organ to which I refer was the then Australian Securities Commission. The matter in question arose out of a failed fraudulent investment scheme in Queensland called Aust-Home Investments. It was a scheme which, at its height, conned hundreds of people into investing their funds, never to see them again. To this day, the promoters of this scheme have not been prosecuted. They have been allowed to go unscathed by the law, notwithstanding the fact that what they did constituted a criminal fraud.
I will outline how that situation arose. It was because of the manner in which investi 
 gators in the Australian Securities Commission handled, or mishandled, the investigation of the case. The circumstances were these. On 24 April 1991, the Australian Securities Commission commenced an investigation, under section 13 of the Australian Securities Commission Act, into the affairs of Aust-Home Investments Ltd. On 27 and 30 May of that same year, they attended the premises of Aust-Home Investments and served statutory notices on 13 scheme companies—that is, companies associated with the principal entity, including all core entities. Certain documents were obtained as a result of those notices being served, but the ASC came to believe that other documents were not produced which should have been produced under those notices. Consequently, from 30 June until October 1991, the ASC conducted examinations of 21 persons related to that scheme. Some of the people who were examined were, in fact, scheme promoters, but many others who were examined were innocent victims of the fraud.
On 30 and 31 July 1991, and also on 6 August 1991, search warrants, pursuant to section 10 of the Crimes Act, were executed on offices which belonged to Aust-Home Investments at Astor Terrace in Brisbane and on 9 August warrants were executed on the residence of a scheme promoter. An enormous amount of information was obtained. How, then, can it be that, in spite of a substantial investigation, in spite of the fact that millions of dollars had disappeared, and in spite of the fact that millions of dollars of incorrect tax deductions had been claimed—innocently by the victims of the fraud but as a deliberate consequence on the part of the promoters—nobody has been prosecuted? The answer to this question lies in something called the derivative use immunity.
The problem was that the examinations were conducted under provisions of the Australian Securities Commission law contained in section 19 of its act, which enabled the investigators to compel people to answer questions. The problem was that evidence obtained under compulsion could not be used in a prosecution against the people who were the subject of the examination. So all of the 
 evidence obtained by the investigators in their examinations of the promoters was tainted evidence. It was flawed from the start. So, notwithstanding the fact that all of the information was available to the investigators of the Australian Securities Commission, once they had obtained all that information that showed what had happened to the money no prosecutions arose.
Over the years I have detailed some of the activities of the promoters of this scheme. I do not intend in this place at this time to rehash that, but honourable senators who are interested can find it easily in the Hansard. They will find, for example, that these promoters tried on subsequent dates in different places to perpetuate the same schemes in other states to con other innocent investors. One of the claims that the promoters used when they went to these other states and set up similar schemes was that it could not have been illegal to do what they had done because otherwise they would have been prosecuted by the Australian Securities Commission. A glib line, a line that tellingly assisted them in conning other innocent people.
But it was not just the promoters who were examined under section 19. Some innocent investors, for example, Mrs Margot Bunt in Queensland, were also examined. The emotional toll that this took on Mrs Bunt and others is incalculable. Many investors had their private assets frozen for years whilst the Australian Securities Commission continued with the fiction that they were ultimately going to prosecute the scheme promoters. However, no prosecutions arose. Eventually, a condensed report was prepared by the Australian Securities Commission, dated 19 October 1995. This report sought to explain why no prosecutions took place. Section 17 of that report at clause 8.1.5 says:
In the immediate case, it was believed that the immunity unavoidably affected the admissibility against the principal scheme promoter of all evidence obtained by the ASC on execution on 9 August 1991 of search warrants at 35 Astor Terrace office of the scheme and the promoter's residential address. This was because the sworn information relied upon by the ASC to support the granting of the subject warrants made a general reference to answers given during ASC examination pursuant to Section 19 of the ASC law on 6 August 1991 
 during the course of which privilege against self incrimination was claimed.
The report goes on to say:
In late January 1995, following consideration of advice received from DPP, it became apparent that all evidence obtained by the ASC subsequent to execution of the warrants, but which in any way was sought by the ASC in whole or partial reliance on the search warrant evidence may be inadmissible. In practical terms, it is believed that the immunity would also impact upon the admissibility on all other evidence obtained subsequent to the examination.
But the fact is that in 1991 the ASC knew of the impact of the derivative use immunity and in fact mention was made of it on 13 August 1991 in a submission to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, in which the ASC said that care had to be taken in framing an investigation to ensure that derivative use immunity did not allow criminals to get off the hook. Yet this is what happened, and the ASC continued with this fiction for four years to cover up what could at best be described as its own negligence. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  an opinion from Hunt & Hunt Lawyers and an attachment thereto.
Leave granted.

OPINION RE:  MRS MARGOT BUNT
Mrs Bunt has consulted us over many months in relation to matters relating to Aust-Home Investments Limited and the investigation by the Australian Securities Commission (as it then was) of the affairs into that company in the early 1990s.
We have previously prepared a memorandum setting out a chronology of the events that occurred in that matter and append a copy of it.
What was clear at the time the memorandum was prepared and what remains clear today is that practices and procedures of the Australian Securities Commission (as it was then) were either not followed in the course of the investigation in relation to Aust-Home Investments Limited and associated companies and its directors or were disregarded. The consequence of the failure to follow the directions or of the disregarding of them is that the Australian Securities Commission was unable to bring any proceedings against the perpe 
 trator of the scheme which solicited millions of dollars of investor's funds which were lost.
That the Australian Securities Commission was aware of the relevant procedures is clear from the references to it in the attachment.
In clause 9.0.6 of the Condensed Report by the Australian Securities Commission under section 17 of the ASC Law dated 19 October 1995 said ""notwithstanding the achievement of civil remedies, it is a fact that further ASC investigation did not culminate in criminal prosecution action. It is an unfortunate feature of this investigation that the impact of derivative use immunity was not fully identified until enquiries had reached a well advanced stage"".
The Report went on to say, in 9.0.7:
""Whilst the immunity, since the amendment of subsection 68(3) of the ASC Law, currently does not affect evidence collected by the ASC, the experience nevertheless provides a salutary lesson to the ASC of the need to ensure the early identification of thresholds issues in relation to the immiscibility of evidence, prior continuing in investigation with an attendant expenditure of time resources and inconvenience to both witnesses and persons themselves the subject of investigation"".
In 9.0.9, the report stated ""whilst nevertheless conceding that the officers' subsequent actions had inadvertently attracted the derivative use immunity, it is not altogether certain that the officers could have acted differently and still ensure the efficient and expeditious procurement of evidence necessary to support the ASC's civil application"".
Mrs Bunt is offended by the reference to the actions ""inadvertently"" attracting derivative use immunity. ASC was well aware of the matters at exactly the same time as the officers were carrying out the raids (see attachment for chronology).
Mrs Bunt's life has been devastated by the events surrounding the investigation, the freezing of assets, subsequent delays, the impact of the ASC's examination into the life of herself and her husband. As a result, her marriage has broken down and she is greatly concerned that she has lost not only the assets of herself and her husband but her marriage.
She believes she is strongly aggrieved and, upon consideration of the sequence of events, the attempted justification by the Commission of its actions as mere ""inadvertence"" does nothing to satisfy Mrs Bunt's anger or pain in the matters that have affected her life.
In the circumstances, an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the investigation and the subsequent report would appear to be justified.

Mrs Bunt's concern is based upon the treatment she received from the investigators under ASC and the difficulties which ASC suffered in pursuing a criminal prosecution because of the way they carried out their investigations.
Mrs Bunt's concern is that the purported explanation of ASC does not accord with what one ought expect the ASC to say if it was acting consistently with a submission made jointly with DPP to the Joint Committee on Corporations & Securities and dated 13 August 1991.
The chronology is as follows:-
April 24 1991:
ASC intervened and commenced an investigation under Section 13 of the ASC law into the affairs of Aust-Home Investments Limited (""AHI"").
May 27 & 30 1991
ASC officers attend AHI premises and served statutory notices on 13 Scheme Companies including all core entities. Certain documents were obtained as a result of those notices being served that ASC believed that there had been a failure to produce documents which should have been produced under those notices.
June 30—October 1991
ASC conducted examinations of 21 persons relative to the scheme.
July 30 and 31 1991 and August 6 1991
Search warrants pursuant to Section 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth) were executed on office premises of AHI at 35 Astor Terrace, Brisbane and on August 9, 1991 upon the residence of a scheme promoter.
Subsequently no prosecutions were launched against the scheme promoter in respect of what appears to be breaches of the Corporations Law. The Section 17 Report of ASC dated 19 October 1995 said, at clause 8.1.5:-
""In the immediate case, it was believed that the immunity unavoidably affected the admissibility against the principal scheme promoter of all evidence obtained by the ASC on execution on 9 August 1991 of search warrants at 35 Astor Terrace office of the scheme and the promoter's residential address. This was because the sworn Information relied upon by the ASC to support the granting of the subject warrants made a general reference to answers given during ASC examination pursuant to Section 19 of the ASC law on 6 August 1991 during the course of which privilege against self incrimination was claimed.""
In clause 8.1.6 of the Report, it claimed:-
""In late January 1995, following consideration of advice received from DPP, it became apparent that 
 all evidence obtained by the ASC subsequent to execution of the warrants, but which in any way was sought by the ASC in whole or partial reliance on the search warrant evidence may be inadmissible. In practical terms, it is believed that the immunity would also impact upon the admissibility on all other evidence obtained subsequent to the examination. . . ..""
This attributes to the ASC a lack of knowledge, appreciation or understanding of the effect of what had been done in executing the warrants in August 1991 until DPP advice was received in January 1995.
And at Clause 9.0.7 it says:
""Whilst the immunity, since the amendment of Section 68(3) of the ASC law, currently does not affect evidence collected by the ASC, the experience nevertheless provides a salutary lesson to the ASC of the need to ensure the early identification of threshold issues in relation to the admissibility of evidence, prior to continuing an investigation with an attendant expenditure of time and resources and inconvenience to both witnesses and persons themselves the subject of investigation.""
In clause 9.0.9 it further says:
""Whilst nevertheless conceding that the officers' subsequent actions had inadvertently attracted the derivative use immunity it is not altogether certain that the officers could have acted differently to ensure the efficient and expeditious procurement of evidence necessary to support the ASC's application."".
The question Mrs Bunt asks, in our opinion reasonably, is why the term ""inadvertently"" is used. The term implies accidental or unintended consequences. However, in the 13 August 1991 Submission to the Joint Committee on Corporations & Securities, it discusses in paragraph 2 the ""practical and substantive difficulties arising out of the derivative use immunity."" In clause 2.1 the Submission states:-
"". . . .if an investigation is to proceed, a plan is prepared having regard to the means available to the ASC to gather information as evidence.""
In Clause 2.2.2, the submission states:-"". . . when the investigation plan is being prepared, the ASC cannot know whether it will pursue civil remedies or criminal prosecutions or both, nor will it be in a position to remedy the specific remedies or charges which will arise for consideration of a possible or likely defendant. The strategy which must be adopted, therefore, is that the Commission must have regard to the derivative use of immunity so as to minimise any prejudice to the possibility of either civil or criminal proceedings.""
Why, then would the ASC be surprised by the advice in January 1995 of DPP as to the impact of 
 the derivative use immunity rule on the evidence obtained as a result of the execution of the warrants in the same month as the ASC was submitting it concern as to the impact of those warrants in its submission to the Joint Committee? It is perfectly clear that the ASC understood the problems involved. In this case, did the ASC proceed knowing the possible consequences and notwithstanding those consequences? Simply put, the statements made in paragraph 2 of the submission make it clear ASC knew in August 1991 the difficulties that existed by reason of the derivative use immunity rule and that, in recognition of the difficulty, it had put a procedure in place within ASC to take that into consideration. If it was aware of the consequences, why did it state in its Report to the Minister in clause 8.1.6 line 2 that ""it became apparent. . . ."", which conveys to the reader that this was a position which ASC did not appreciate or understand before that time? This would mean that the practice referred to in the Submission was not on this occasion followed. If that was true, Mrs Bunt is entitled to know why that was not done.
See Girvan Report 1.1 where demonstrates the existence of procedures which, when followed, avoided a scenario by which the persons suspected of offences were not orally examined.
Our client finds no adequate explanation has been given to her. We believe our client is entitled to a proper explanation and a reason as to why prosecutions have not been launched against the scheme promoter and the reasons for the ASC's actions in taking the steps it did.
Could you please obtain an adequate response for our client on this issue.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Aust-Home Investments Scheme</title>,Adjournment,23,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-02-17," asked the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, upon notice, 23 June 1998:
(1) Does the Government agree that retention rates for isolated and remote students at 51 per cent and for boys at 44 per cent in Year 12 are unacceptably low.
(2) What are the social and economic implications of such low rates for these young people and the families and communities from which they come.
(3) Will the Government consider increasing the basic boarding allowance (BBA) of the Assistance for Isolated Children (AIC) scheme to its original intent of 55 per cent of the average boarding fee; if not, why not.
(4) Is the Government aware that the average boarding fee in 1997 was $6 783.
(5) Will the Government consider increasing the second home allowance of the AIC scheme to achieve parity with the BBA; if not, why not.
(6) Will the Government consider tapering the means tested additional boarding allowance of the AIC scheme up to the average boarding fee when the parents have nil or negative income with small increases applying as family incomes rise, as proposed by the Isolated Children's Parents' Association (ICPA); if not, why not.
(7) When will the Government adopt the recommendations of the ICPA to:
(a) recognise that families subject to an asset test for AUSTUDY should not also be subject to an assets test on their income earning assets;
(b) subject to appropriate substantiation, treat wages paid to students from their family's company, partnership or trust in the same way as earnings from an outside employer or sole trader partner; and
(c) provide adequately trained staff to assist people with queries surrounding the complexity of the AUSTUDY application form.
(8) Will the Government honour its 1996 election promise to raise the discount on farms and small business income earning assets from 50 per cent to 75 per cent; if not why not. 

(9) Will the government consider introducing a geographically-isolated tertiary students scheme, as proposed by ICPA; if not why not.
(10) (a) Will the Government consider providing an allowance to isolated parents who educate some 3 300 children at home; and
(b) how much do these parents save State and federal governments by virtue of their supervisory role.
(11) Will the Government consider the proposal by ICPA to provide recurrent funding of $1 000 for each isolated student enrolled in government and non-government boarding schools.
(12) (a) What is the low fee regional boarding schools and school term hostels which have been closed in the past twelve months; and
(b) how many places have been lost to these closures.
(13) What are the implications for isolated and remote students of these closures.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Isolated and Remote Students: Retention Rates</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,25,1,question
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-02-17,"—The answers to the honourable senator's questions are as follows:
(1) The figures quoted are not rates of retention of secondary students to Year 12, but estimated Year 12 completion rates for remote students in respect of 1996. They appear in the National Report on Schooling in Australia 1996. Completion rates express the number of Year 12 completions (that is, Year 12 certificates issued by State education authorities) as a proportion of the estimated population that could attend Year 12 in a particular calendar year.
It is true that completion rates for remote students are lower than students from both urban areas and non-remote rural areas, and that rates for boys are lower than for girls. The Government agrees that it is desirable for more students to complete Year 12.
(2) The Government acknowledges that there are established links between educational achievement and employment outcomes. The Commonwealth's concern for the education of students living in rural and remote areas of Australia is based on a need to ensure their equitable access to quality education which will assist them to achieve outcomes and participation rates at least equal to students in urban areas. To assist these students, the Government provides a number of programs that offer additional support and help. For example, the Commonwealth provides $17.7 million to State and 
 Territory government and non government education authorities annually to help schools and students in rural and remote areas of Australia. The Country Areas Program assist parents, administrators, teachers and other members of the community to work cooperatively to improve the delivery of primary and secondary school educational services in rural and geographically isolated areas.
(3) The Government increased the basic boarding allowance from $2,500 to $2,900 in the 1996-97 Budget. This brought the basic boarding allowance up to 55% of the average boarding fee. The Government has undertaken to further increase the basic boarding allowance from $2,900 to $3,500 and index this amount in future years. It also undertook to increase the maximum amount that can be received under a combination of the basic boarding allowance and additional boarding allowance to $4,347.
(4) The Isolated Children's Parents' Association's (ICPA) method of deriving an average boarding fee is a simple average of fees charged by all boarding institutions and gives undue weight to the level of fees at expensive boarding schools which have relatively few AIC beneficiaries. The Department's calculations are derived from the fees charged by boarding institutions at which AIC recipients are actually enrolled and weighted accordingly.
(5) There is not necessarily a connection between the second home allowance and basic boarding allowance. The basic boarding allowance was increased in the 1996 Budget from $2 500 per year to $2 900 per year per student in line with the Government's specific 1996 election commitment to increase the basic boarding allowance to 55% of the average boarding allowance. No evidence has been presented of increased costs faced by recipients of the second home allowance. While the value of the basic boarding allowance and the second home allowance may previously have been aligned, the government's initial concern was to provide additional help to those families who needed to board their children in a non-family environment.
(6) Firstly, no family should receive more than their actual boarding fee outlay. Secondly, the ICPA proposal does not acknowledge that low income families have access to a higher level of Family Payment which may be used by families to meet boarding costs.
(7) (a) AUSTUDY was replaced on 1 July by the Youth Allowance for students under 25 years of age and AUSTUDY payment for those aged 25 and over. Both programs are the responsibility of the Minister for Family and Community Services. Means test rules remain in general the same, with the exception that students classed as independent are no longer subject to an actual means test. The ICPA proposes that families applying for student 
 assistance should not be subject to an assets test on their income earning assets. As with AUSTUDY, only fifty per cent of the net value of income earning assets that are also business assets is taken into account under the Youth Allowance family assets test. The assets test is complemented by the Family Actual Means Test (FAMT), which is a test of expenditure and savings. Expenditure that was tax deductible in the previous financial year because it was necessarily incurred in carrying on a business is excluded from the FAMT.
(7) (b) Under the Youth Allowance Family Actual Means Test up to $6,000 of income earned from independent employment by students in a family aged 16 and over may be excluded. ""Independent employment"" is employment engaged in by a person that is not provided by a member of the person's family or by a proprietary company, an unlisted public company, a partnership or trust in which the person, or a member of the person's family, has an interest.
The exclusion relates to income from independent employment because the Government is concerned to ensure that only bona fide income earning activities are recognised. The Government considered that, to maintain the integrity of the FAMT, income earned should be restricted to employment outside family business structures.
(7) (c) The matter of providing Centrelink staff to assist people to complete student assistance claim forms on a question by question basis is one that should be taken up with Centrelink. Centrelink staff are trained in all aspects of Youth Allowance administration including, of course, the Family Actual Means Test.
(8) Prior to the 1996 election the Coalition made an undertaking to consider raising the AUSTUDY assets test discount for farm and other business assets to 75%. Given the high cost of implementing this measure (estimated at some $18.5 million in a full year) and the fiscal restraints faced after the election, the Government was unable proceed with this undertaking. The Government was concerned also about making AUSTUDY and more recently Youth Allowance available to families with unencumbered business assets of up to $1.63 million, at a time when public expenditure is under close scrutiny.
The value of the family residence and up to two hectares of surrounding land is exempt from the Youth Allowance assets test. A 50% discount is available on the value of farm and other business assets, which means that in 1998, children become ineligible for Youth Allowance under the assets test only when the family has unencumbered assets of the value of $814,500 or more.
Since 1 July 1998, when the main form of financial assistance to full time students became the 
 Youth Allowance for students between the ages of 16 and 24 and the new Austudy payment for students 25 and over, policy responsibility for these schemes has rested with the Minister for Social Security. The Youth Allowance and the Austudy payment have retained the range of concessions available to rural students under AUSTUDY, including the concessions for farming families suffering drought or other exceptional circumstances, and those for families with two or more tertiary students living away from home to study.
(9) These issues were considered in the development of the Youth Allowance. The Government considered that access to post-secondary education, even for students living in non-isolated areas, often involves living away from home. Under the Youth Allowance eligible students who have to live away from home may be entitled to rent assistance.
(10) Introduction of an allowance to isolated parents would have considerable cost implications and need to be considered by the Government in the Budget context.
While State and Territory governments have the primary role in the provision of education to school aged children, the Commonwealth assists geographically isolated families with students studying by distance education through the payment of the AIC distance education allowance. This allowance is intended to contribute toward incidental costs associated with distance education study. In the 1996 Budget, the Government announced a substantial increase to the Correspondence Allowance from 1997 and specific funding to State and Territory Governments for the purposes of extending services to rural and remote schools, as well as for technological innovations in distance education delivery. These initiatives are viewed as the fairest and most efficient means of addressing the educational needs of geographically isolated students.
The Commonwealth provides general recurrent funding for government school systems and non-government schools and systems. Non-government schools are funded on a needs basis and placed in one of 12 funding categories. Given these differential rates of funding, and as it is not possible to identify which schools the students schooled at home could attend, it is not possible to determine the saving to the Commonwealth where students are supervised and schooled at home by their parents.
(11) Consideration of this proposal would need to be in the Budget context. It should be noted that hostels which provide accommodation for government and non-government students are eligible, under the Commonwealth Capital Grants Program, for grants from the Government Component and Non-Government Component respectively of the Program.  

Through its Schools Programs the Commonwealth provides recurrent funding for schools. Where boarding facilities are part of the school (ie. it is a boarding school) the assessment of the school's funding category through the Education Resources Index (ERI) takes boarding school costs into account. However, no ongoing recurrent funding is available for private hostels or other boarding arrangements.
The Commonwealth, through its General Recurrent Grants Program for schools, provides per capita assistance for government and non-government schools in respect of students attending those schools. This per capita funding assists schools with the recurrent costs of schooling like teaching and ancillary staff salaries, professional development of teachers, curriculum development, and school maintenance and general operation provisions. The current legislation governing the General Recurrent Grants Program does not envisage per capita payments to assist particular students with the costs of their schooling.
(12) The Department is aware of one non-government school approved for Commonwealth general recurrent grant funding that provided boarding facilities and which was located in a regional area outside the capital cities and other metropolitan centres, which closed in 1997. That school, which attracted funding at the category 9 level, reported 23 boarding students as at the 1997 schools census day. The Department does not maintain a specific, regular data collection in relation to low fee regional school term hostel closures and the number of places lost to these closures in the past twelve months.
(13) There are a number of schools offering boarding facilities in the area in which the closed school operated. These schools attract a comparable level of Commonwealth recurrent funding to that of the closed school. It would therefore be possible for students requiring boarding facilities to transfer to a similar environment. In line with its election commitment, the Government is providing short-term emergency funding to particular school term hostels in serious financial difficulty, while the Commonwealth sits down with the States to agree upon a significant long-term sustainable package for this sector.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Isolated and Remote Students: Retention Rates</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,25,1,answer
