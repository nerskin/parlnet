"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—I might put in a word about the way we are debating this social security legislation. Earlier we had a debate in relation to the Senate being in agreement about the injustice of making a demarcation between living at home and living away from home for over-25s. It would seem logical that we deal with Greens (WA) amendment No. 4, which is the other side of that. It does not fit in with the numbering on the running sheet but I just want to signal that if the Senate wished to deal with those matters now that would be wonderful because it would follow on from the debate we have had already in relation to the maximum rate of Austudy payment. The next debate logically from that would be on rent assistance and the implications of the differences between them. I wonder whether there is any agreement that we deal with that at this stage, rather than waiting till later? It 
 would not make any difference to the outcome but it just seems logical.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1998-05-25,"—I take it we are debating the clause at the bottom of the first page of the running sheet concerning the length of time for study. I might be on the wrong question, but I have had raised with me by some students their concerns about this allowable time for study and the effect some of the interpretations are having on their applications for Austudy. Some people are saying they are being allowed 3½ years of Austudy allowance to study a three-year degree, but they may change their degree course in the process if they find that the course of study they were initially doing is not what they want to do, that it is not a course they are satisfied with. Yet they are being allowed only 3½ years of access to Austudy.
I also know of students who have married in the third year of their course. They will be having to do four years because they changed after the first year of university and were previously not able to access Austudy because of their parents' income and asset level. Now the female finds that because she is married to another student she fits within the independent rate criteria very clearly but she will not be able to access Austudy for the last six months of her course. Her husband is in a similar situation. He had done two years of study previously and will be able to access only 3½ years of Austudy although he has now undertaken a four-year course. They will have a period of six months, before the female of the couple is able to get out into the work force and earn income, when they will have no access to Austudy and limited access to loans and things like that. That is of grave concern.
I have also had students complaining about the loan situation, in that the female students who apply are treated differently from the 
 male students who apply. There is a situation where twins—a male and a female—are studying. The male proceeded to seek a loan and it was granted overnight with no questions asked and with no major problems. These two people have identical economic set-ups, but when the female applied for a loan it took three weeks to be approved.
It is of grave concern to everybody, I think, that this sort of thing is happening. Certainly the students are very worried that they are only able to access Austudy for 3½ years. It is possible that they do not have some of the information terribly straight, but I doubt it: these students are involved in student representative council type activities and know their rights, their entitlements. They were most surprised to discover when they got married that the female was only eligible for another 12 months of Austudy, which will not take her through to the end of her degree. For a period of six months neither of them will be eligible for Austudy and neither of them will be able to have another source of income. It is of major concern to them, Minister.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-25,—This Democrat amendment is supported by the opposition. It deals in particular with the difficulty of reduced student assistance when they can extend the study period by up to four times. It allows a discretion by the secretary in order to allow them to do this. There seems to be a mismatch between the capacity of a student to extend their course and the period over which a person in that situation can receive Austudy. Obviously a number of people are affected by this change.

These changes relate to the notification provisions for the youth allowance. Members of the Senate might recall that during the debate on the previous youth allowance bill 
 there was some concern about how people were notified and what penalties they suffered if there was a failure to comply with that notification. As a result, some changes were made to ensure that there was fairness and that natural justice applied in relation to notification.
To ensure there is consistency in the notification provisions, these amendments are proposed by the opposition to relate to those people who are presently called recipients of Austudy. This will ensure that their notification provisions are the same as for those people who receive the youth allowance who were not previously called Austudy recipients. This now relates to students who receive youth allowance. I think it will be advantageous ultimately not only for the students themselves who will know what to expect but also for the department which will have one system. Certainly I would hope it would make it easier for the department, and it will be administratively less expensive.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-25,"—Having arranged all my affairs on the basis of the previous running sheet and having been given a running sheet as I walked through the door, it is very difficult. I know it might be amusing to some people, but it is making it extraordinarily difficult to make sure I have them in the correct place.
—It is still in the same order, Senator Neal. You can work on the other one if you want to.
—It relates to the higher rate for long-term income support.
—I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
Schedule 1, item 7, page 91 (lines 1 to 9), omit point 1067L-B3 and the note, substitute:
Long term income support student
1067L-B3	 If the person is a long term income support student (see section 1067K), the person's maximum basic rate is $322.40.
					 Note:	 The rate provided for in this point is indexed annually in line with CPI increases (see sections 1191 to 1194). 

Under the proposed 1067L-B3 the maximum rate of Austudy payment for a long-term income support student living at home is $214.60 per fortnight, whereas the maximum rate for such a student not living at home is $322.40 per fortnight. Under our proposed amendment, the maximum rate for all long-term income support students would be $322.40. That removes a situation where older students who have been on that higher level would not suddenly have their payments reduced quite substantially by about $100. It will ensure that they retain their present income level.
I am always very concerned when I see a bill—particularly one with the sorts of intricacies that this bill has—through which, because of an administrative change, small groups who previously relied on one level of income have to cope with a substantially reduced income. In light of applying proper fairness to these people—and they are generally between the ages of 21 and 25—we believe they should not have their payment reduced as is proposed in the bill. The effect of our amendment is to allow them to retain the higher rate, which is the away from home rate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—I would like some clarification. On the running sheet it says `NB identical', and I am assuming that relates to the Democrat and Greens (WA) amendments under the `or'. We are talking about point 1067L-B2 and so on. It is hard for me to work out what the impact would be if we support the opposition's request. Will it still be necessary to move the Greens' and Democrats' amendments which are part of the same section?

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—What we were hoping to do with our amendments was to remove the distinction between living at home or living away from home for the purposes of determining the maximum rate of payment for a
person over the age of 25 and to achieve this for the new Austudy payment for those aged 25 and over. Given that that is what the opposition's amendments will do but in a slightly different way, obviously the Greens (WA) will be supporting them.

(11)	 Schedule 1, item 7, page 90 (line 7), omit ""Table BB"", substitute ""point 1067L-B3"".
Amendment 11 is of an administrative nature. Having just carried the amendment which allows those over the age of 25 to retain the higher rate of living away from home allowance, it is necessary to restructure some of the tables contained in the bill. This amendment omits table BB which previously contained the differential rates between away from home and at home. Because we have now removed that distinction, there is no necessity to have that table, and this amendment has the effect of removing it.

Rent assistance
1067L-CA1	 Subject to point 1067L-CA3, an amount to help cover the cost of rent is to be added to the maximum basic rate of a person for a period if:
		 (a)	 the person lives away from home; and
		 (b)	 the person is not an aged care resident; and 

		 (c)	 the person is not an ineligible homeowner; and
		 (d)	 the person pays, or is liable to pay, rent (other than Government rent) in respect of the period; and
		 (e)	 the rent is payable at a rate of more than the rent threshold rate under point 1067L-CA2; and
		 (f)	 the person is in Australia throughout the period; and
		 (g)	 the person does not have a partner with a rent increased pension (see point 1067L-CA3); and
		 (h)	 where the person or the person's partner is receiving family payment in respect of a dependent child who is an  
					 FP child—the standard family payment rate of the person or partner does not exceed the minimum family payment rate of the person or partner, as the case may be.
Note:	 For  aged care resident, ineligible homeowner, rent  and  Government rent  see section 13.
Rent threshold rate

These amendments, with several others including amendments 1 and 2 on sheet 975, apply the rent assistance provisions available to youth allowance recipients to those students over the age of 25 in receipt of the new Austudy payment. It should be noted that under these amendments rent assistance will be available only to those students over the age of 25 who are living away from their parents' home.
Under the changes to payments made to students under the youth allowance bill debated early this year, the big carrot was the long-overdue payment of rent assistance to full-time students. The Greens did not agree with many of the regressive changes which were traded off for the provision of student rent assistance, which we did welcome.
Predictably, the government trumpeted the introduction of student rent assistance as reflective of their commitment to students and delivery of their promises made in opposition. We were chided for any criticisms that were made by Senator Newman in relation to this, but there were many people within the com 
 munity who had very good reasons for not swallowing what the government was trying to do as a package. We are trying here to redress the ridiculous position where a person who begins study when aged 24 years and 11 months and therefore receives youth allowance will be entitled to rent assistance, whereas someone who begins study at 25 years and one month and therefore receives the new Austudy payment contained in the consequential bill will not be entitled to rent assistance. All in all, there will be about 35,000 people around Australia who will be discriminated against by virtue of the fact that they have been unable to begin study until the age of 25. That is absolutely ridiculous and utterly insensitive.
It is highly ironic that some of the strongest statements about the importance of providing rent assistance to all students are from Senator Newman herself. On 18 June 1997, Senator Newman declared:
We are treating students and unemployed people on a fair and consistent basis. Payments to students will now be brought up to the level of unemployment payments and students will be eligible for rent assistance. This is long overdue, as Senator Payne mentioned, and desperately needed . . . 
In answer to a question without notice from Senator Abetz, Senator Newman boasted:
The previous government paid not one cent of rent assistance to students. We are the first government to offer students up to $100 a fortnight to help pay their rent. Their housing costs will fall, not rise.
In answer to a question from Senator O'Chee on 28 August 1997, Senator Newman predicted that rent assistance would:
. . . make a massive difference to the living standards of young people who have to go away to study . . . 
During her second reading speech on 2 March 1998, Senator Newman, somewhat dramatically, said:
How wrong it has been that young unemployed people have had access to that allowance while students have not. We are bringing the students up to the same level. Is that unfair? Is it unfair to anybody? I think not. I cannot understand how you could possibly be criticising it.
I hope Senator Newman heeds her own words and finds it impossible to criticise the Greens (WA) for proposing that all students, not just 
 those who the government wishes to win over with a flawed youth allowance package, be entitled to rent assistance. I assure all senators in this place that this issue will haunt those who do not support such a basic point of equity. I assure you that a situation in which students of the same age, studying the same course, and in exactly the same financial situation receive payments which differ up to $75 per fortnight will be an ongoing source of justifiable anger, frustration and disillusionment. I urge senators to support the Greens (WA) amendment to allow all students access to rent assistance.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-25,"—The Democrats have identical amendments to the Greens (WA) amendment and also some consequential amendments, similarly identical, subsequent on how the vote goes on this particular issue and this particular request dealing with the issue of rent assistance. As Senator Margetts has outlined, this is, among other things, an issue of consistency across the entire act, and that is something the Democrats have often voiced support for.
We would like to get a little information on the record in relation to rent assistance, and I would like to ask either the minister or Senator Neal if they have information about how much it would cost to implement rent assistance for students in receipt of Austudy payments over the course of each year and why it was not included in the original package, given the importance of consistency for this group of people.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-05-25,"—The government does not believe there is anything unfair in what we are doing with Austudy payment. Despite the quotations that Senator Margetts used from what I have said previously in this chamber, she was referring to what I have said about treating young people under the age of 25 consistently. Of course that is on the youth allowance and that is exactly what we have done.
In this amendment we are now talking about people who are studying, who are of any age over the age of 25 and in different 
 circumstances in their lives. We are not talking here about encouraging young people under 25 to be students rather than be unemployed; we are talking about adults who have been financially independent for some time.
Our primary purpose when we put together the youth allowance package was to standardise as much as possible the various payments going to young people aged between 16 and 25—as Senator Margetts would know very well—to get rid of those disincentives to study and, of course, to stop young people falling between the cracks.
So a fundamental part of those reforms had to be providing rent assistance to students for the very first time, and providing pharmaceutical and remote area allowances. Then, when looking at those who were older, the intention was that we would be bringing in the new Austudy payment as a social security payment, but otherwise it would be as similar as possible to the existing Austudy. The intention was that those over the age of 25 would, in the main, neither be winners nor losers from the Austudy payment. So we have maintained the status quo.
I have not heard Senator Margetts in this chamber in the years she has been here—and she can correct me if I am wrong—claim that those students should be receiving rent assistance. It is suddenly a new-found interest.
Students over 25 are not losing a cent as a result of the changes to Austudy payment. There is no imperative to pay rent assistance in those cases. Senator Bartlett quite sensibly asked: what is the cost? I do not think Senator Margetts bothers about the cost, but perhaps Senator Bartlett is more concerned. I am advised that the outlay would be $25 million in the first year and then $11 million over each of the following years. So the Greens amendment would cost $60 million over four years, giving older students a benefit they do not currently receive.
We have maintained a view that the status quo for older students should remain and that is what we have largely delivered here.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—Senator Newman said I could correct her if she was wrong: she is wrong. 
 Consistently the Greens (WA) have been calling for rent assistance for students based on need. To draw an artificial line and say, `These students under a certain age somehow or other should get it, and these students who happen to start their course at a different age should not get it,' has never been the position of Greens (WA).
If Senator Newman can find a press release or anything that I have put out asking for there to be a distinction based simply on age I would happy to see it. Basically, I do not know too many people who have been as consistent in calling for rent assistance for students who need it; we have been asking for that for years.
Senator Newman invented the youth allowance and our calls for rent assistance for students have been going on for certainly as long as I have been a senator. Our call has never been to distinguish between one group of students who need it and another group of students who still need it but who were simply born in a different month.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-25,"—I want to say something briefly, not so much in relation to what the Greens have said here in the chamber as to a press release issued during the last week or so in which it was alleged that the non-availability of rental assistance to those over 25 was in fact a reduction in the benefit they presently received. I think the term used was `cut'.
This is not a change to a benefit that currently exists for students over the age of 25. They do not presently receive rent assistance. Certainly, if it were the cutting of a benefit that students presently receive, the opposition would be strongly opposing it. But that is not the case. The amendment moved by the Greens does not preserve a benefit that is currently received by that group of people. That really puts the situation in a very different light.
I am always sympathetic to the plight of students in terms of their income levels. It is often a very difficult time financially although it may be a pleasant time in other ways. The opposition feels that we are not able at this time to substantially extend benefits through this bill. Any decisions about extension of 
 benefits would be made in the context of our overall policy objectives and would be announced as a total education policy package as part of the opposition's bill, and not in this ad hoc way.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—The problem of course has been that the way the whole issue of the student youth allowance and student rent assistance was packaged was in fact a trade-off. The benefit, or the carrot at the end of the stick, was the rent assistance, but we all knew that there were other trade-offs.
We had this debate. We looked at the impact for younger people and saw that the government was arguing that as long as it provided this rent assistance then the other things that were happening in terms of the program itself—including the cuts to education funding, the extra costs involved in education and so on—would be compensated. The increasing education costs, such as user pays, extra fees and so on, still exist for students over that age.
In reality we all know that the government have been arguing that to compensate for all these other things that they have done to reduce their bottom line—and not just this year, but in previous years—the big trade-off or the great, magnificent and magnanimous gesture, was student rent assistance. If you are an older student you are still going to be hit with a lot of user-pays charges.
Honourable senators will remember the arguments last year that these things had to happen because of the budget black hole. I think Labor should get up and argue now that, because of all those other cuts and increases in expenses for students, the reality is that it makes no logical sense not to extend that benefit to older students. Nobody has given them extra to assist them with the extra fees that they have to pay like anyone else.
The reality is that those budget cuts were the ones that have taken place over the last few years and this was going to be the reward; this was going to make up for all those other cuts to the education budget that have occurred and that have enabled the big tax give-back that is likely to occur. But no: instead of dealing with the actual justice of 
 the situation—of what is fair and what is not and what people are actually going to have to live on in that situation—they are making artificial distinctions, and that position from the ALP is disappointing. I believe that there were a number of people who contacted the ALP in relation to this—and so they should, because it is a matter one should judge on justice. I believe that $60 million over four years is the very least the government can do to redress some of the problems that have occurred in education. There are very good reasons for that if there are that many people above the age of 25 who are in higher education—and remember that education is a benefit and not a cost to the community.
I find it quite extraordinary what is being said here. A lot of the arguments that we give here are numbers benefits: `There are only this many,' or `There are too many.' One would think that what we should be dealing with in terms of the effectiveness of spending the community's money—public money; it is not money that belongs to the government—is how we effectively use the resources that are available to reduce the burdens that have been placed on them over time, especially over the last couple of years. So I think the logic is lost. In reality it means that that group of people do not have that sweetener, that carrot, to make up for all those other things that have occurred to them over the last couple of years.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-25,"—I want to ask the minister a question in order to get the information on the record and to flesh out some of the details we have been talking about. We have had a dollar figure for the cost; perhaps we could transform the dollars into actual people. How many students are expected to be in this Austudy payment category next year and in subsequent years? How many students were cut off Austudy or had reduced benefits as a result of the raising of the age of independence to 25—that is, what was the overall amount of money that this cut from the Austudy budget?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-05-25,"—While I am waiting on information from the officials on 
 the first question, I can say to Senator Bartlett that I am not able to give him the answer to his second question because it relates to a couple of years ago when the age limit for Austudy was changed. I was not the minister responsible for Austudy then; it has only now come into my portfolio, as you would know. So we do not have that here.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-25,"—I would like to make one further point. I would expect to get that information at some time. Part of the issue relates to raising the age of independence and to some of the other aspects that Senator Margetts has been talking about. We have had a lot of cuts from the budget funds available to students, and it would not be inappropriate for some of that money to come back towards providing equal treatment for people. I am not sure what the precise change in circumstances is when people turn 25 so that those issues of having a disincentive to study which the minister has rightly addressed in terms of younger people should not also be applicable to people once they turn 25. There has been a lot of commentary these days about the importance of people being able to re-skill themselves. I think that that is an issue that applies to people of any age, not just in the earlier stages of their life.
It is also important to emphasise that it is not simply a matter of consistency for the sake of consistency or of throwing $60 million at a certain group of people over four years because it looks nice. It is an issue of a basic amount for people to live on. It is probably appropriate to remind senators of the figures in relation to the poverty line. As my colleague Senator Stott Despoja has mentioned already in this debate, the Melbourne Economic and Social Research Institute set the poverty line, as at December last year, for a single person, including housing, at a little over $200 a week. At that time the unemployment benefit was $160.75 a week. Average rent assistance available to these people was $37 a week and that brought the total benefits available to an unemployed adult to a couple of dollars below the poverty line.
However, those students who are in the situation that these amendments relate to will 
 not have access to rent assistance; we will be leaving them in a situation where they will be significantly below the poverty line. And that is the basic issue here. That is a benchmark that we should continually refer to when looking at what people have available to them to enable them to live. We are trying to encourage people to access education and increase their skills to be able to make a more effective economic and social contribution to our community, but we are putting them in a situation where they are significantly below the poverty line. That is a situation that the Democrats believe is far from acceptable. We urge other parties to examine that in the context of these amendments proposed by the Greens (WA) and the Democrats.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—The figures that I have received, and the minister may correct me if I am wrong, indicate that something like 43,000 students are likely to be impacted by this level of discrimination. The minister is shaking her head so perhaps she might like to enlighten us as to what the figure will be.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1998-05-25,"—I understand that the 43,000 figure that you might have is because there are people who may have been included in that figure who would be getting rent assistance through family payments and suchlike, so it is not as clear-cut as you had.
I am advised that the answer to Senator Bartlett is that the cost of extending rent assistance to students over 25 would be about $25 million in the first year, as I said, that is, 28,600 customers, declining to about $11 million in outgoing years as the Austudy population decreases. You have then got 10,400 customers per year because the youth allowance students who subsequently turn 25 will remain on youth allowance entitlements until they finish their course. I would not want it to be misread as somehow there are a whole lot of people who are going to drop out. It is a question of people who were on youth allowance at the age of 25 who will remain on youth allowance. The financial position of those who are currently getting Austudy and are over 25 will not change, and that means 28,600 would be the people who 
 would cause a $25 million extra cost in the first year.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—Could the minister explain this to me: if recipients of student allowance and rent assistance or not are customers, especially the ones who miss out, what are they actually customers of in terms of government services here? Is this just another ridiculous piece of jargon that has been thrown in, or is there some note that says that every time you talk about people who do not have anything else to live on you call them customers to make it seem as if they are actually able to purchase this service?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-25,"—I want to clarify what the minister was trying to explain there in relation to the question I asked. I guess it is pleasing to see that the number of students affected will be fewer than the 43,000 that Senator Margetts was suggesting, and also that the number affected will be reduced beyond the first year. Minister, from the way you explained it there, and it was my understanding, that would therefore mean that students who do turn 25 while still completing their course would remain on that youth allowance rate. So you will actually have two groups of people of the same age in the same circumstances studying the same course and, depending on whether they started at over 25 or under 25, they will be receiving different rates of pay. Is that right?",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

—Yes.
—Would there be a situation where one person who started their course at a different age but is in fact the same age as someone else is likely to be 
 receiving a different rate of Austudy? It is now a yes shake. Perhaps a little more detail would be good.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—The next item on the running sheet was in relation to schedule 1, item 7, and that was our request No. 4 on sheet 979. 
 This is the one I referred to earlier on, both in my presentation during the second reading debate and at the beginning, as my `break glass in case of emergency' amendment. It related to another alternative in case there was no support for the maximum basic rate of Austudy payments. Given that there was support for our preferred position, which was the preferred position of the majority of the Senate, I will not be proceeding with request No. 4.
—We move on to requests Nos 6 and 7.
—I seek leave to move requests Nos 6 and 7 together.
Leave granted.
—I move:
(6)	 Schedule 1, item 7, page 105 (line 7), omit ""zero"", substitute ""$3,000"".

51A  Point 1067G-J3 (Step 1 of the Method Statement)
Omit ""zero"", substitute ""$3,000"".
Greens (WA) requests Nos 6 and 7 on sheet 979 seek to address the situation of some students being worse off under the student income bank than they are under existing Austudy additional earning provisions. In particular, the amendments seek to address the situation where a person earns a significant proportion of their allowable $6,000 additional earnings in the period before their student income bank, which currently begins with a balance of zero. Considering the amount of uncertainty there is for students, of course students have to take whatever opportunities present themselves and that obviously includes the gap between when they are working and when they are studying, or from when they have left school or whatever. It does not make any sense for students not to be able to support themselves, especially when it might be difficult to find means of support during that time.
If a person earns a significant proportion of their allowable $6,000 additional earnings in the period before their student income bank, which currently begins at a balance of zero, 
 they have to wait for it to build to a sufficient level so as not to affect their payments. This does not relate much to the real world. At present the student income bank actually acts as a disincentive to students taking up work in the period before their student income bank has accrued sufficient credit. Of specific concern are those students who will be taking up work in the upcoming vacation period, this July, who may unknowingly jeopardise their payments by earning more than has accrued in their student income bank but far less than the $6,000 they are currently allowed.
I would think that most people would think that this would be a good thing, students getting some experience in the world and students being able to provide a little bit in case of emergency, because we all know that the emergencies that occur in life are not necessarily ones that can be dealt with with $100 or $150. Some of them, if they are means of transport or something that happens at home or even some health issues that are not covered by health insurance and so on—and heaven knows how few students can afford health insurance—can result in a situation which is very problematical.
The Greens (WA) amendment seeks to remedy this problem by starting the student income bank at $3,000 for all those who come onto the youth allowance or Austudy payments. I believe every senator could think of a situation where this should apply. It is reasonable for students to be able to work during vacations and average that out over a year, but to suggest also that they have to start from an assumed balance of zero does not make any sense whatsoever. The reality is that a lot of the income earning opportunities are very lumpy.
I know from my own experience—when I was putting myself through university—work could be three hours an evening pulling beer in an English pub. I am sure there must be those in Australia who can understand that waitressing or doing other kinds of jobs accessible to students is not necessarily going to provide you with the income you need for, for example, technical equipment or just things necessary for living. I have mentioned the situation where you might get pulled over 
 by the constabulary who measure your tyres and say, `Look, only one of your tyres actually has the right amount of tread on it. You are going to have to get three new tyres,' and so on. These are not extraordinary kinds of expenses. It might be that someone has purchased an old car—if they have not got public transport—and suddenly the engine goes, or something else, and a major overhaul is needed.
It is not reasonable to suggest that you can accept the need for students to be able to use their vacation opportunities, where they have them, to earn that little bit of fall-back income to be able to provide some of the needs that will not be covered by the student income which the government provides to—as the government calls them—customers. Those people absolutely need that assistance but may need other things from time to time. This is the normal way of life.
We are not talking about large amounts of money. We are not talking about millionaires. We are not talking about people who can throw $50,000 around at the drop of a hat. We are talking about the ability of a person to be able to average out $3,000 as a starting balance. They are not cheating. They are not doing anything wrong, I argue. Simply by allowing some commonsense to prevail, you can assume that they can have up to half of the student income bank already in the bank when they start their year. I cannot understand why this would not be acceptable.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-25,"—This is a problem that the opposition also recognises. With the changeover, students under 25 who were previously receiving Austudy go onto the youth allowance and those who are over 25 go onto the new form of Austudy. As part of this package of changes, there has been a transfer from a means test that previously was based on annual income to one based on a fortnightly income test. That puts it in line with many other social security payments. We have had the discussion before about the consequence of that and some of the benefits and some of the adverse effects. I will not canvass those again.
But a difficulty has been created, particularly with the introduction of the income bank 
 in the middle of the year and when many students are in the middle of a holiday period. There may well be situations in which students, because they happen to be working full-time during the holiday period, may find that they lose their Austudy or youth allowance payment for a number of weeks. Certainly we would not want to see that happen.
But the remedy being proposed by the Greens is a bit of a blunt instrument. In fact, it far exceeds what is necessary to remedy this particular problem. The effect of doing what is set out in the Greens' request would be to give the capacity for students to earn virtually any sort of income for about a six-month period, and we do not believe that is appropriate in the circumstances. We are moving our own request for amendment, which I think is the last item—request No. 1—listed on sheet 986. This will have the effect of giving a credit of $3,000 only to those people who were previously on Austudy and are now either transferring to the youth allowance or the new Austudy. This remedies the existing problem while at the same time not exceeding what is required to remedy the problem of that group of people. The opposition will be opposing this request proposed by the Greens, but we will putting forward our own request in similar terms later in the debate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-25,"—I indicate the Democrats' support for this amendment which probably will not get up. At least the issues that are addressed in relation to ensuring that the student income bank operates equitably are going to be addressed in a different format down the track, if with slightly less impact.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—What has been described by Senator Neal obviously is a reasonable transition proposal. There would be an incredible problem if people who already have certain understandings about their ability to average out their income over a year are not told that they will miss out on any means of support for several weeks until they run whatever they have in the bank down to the level that the government says is now acceptable. That obviously is a problem—it is a problem that 
 will not be solved even by announcing over loudspeakers or on television that it is no longer reasonable or that there is no longer any expectation that students can earn income over the Christmas holidays and so on. There is going to be a problem because not everybody will know. You will get a whole lot of very angry people lining up, assuming that they are entitled to some kind of student assistance, and not getting it.
I do not think it is the answer. I think it is unjust, and it is not actually reasonable. I agree it is unjust that you should suddenly pull out the rug from under those people who come under the current scheme. But I am suggesting that for all students it is not unreasonable; it is not a blunt instrument. It does not mean, as Senator Neal suggested, that we are saying people can earn whatever they like in six months. That is not true. The rules in relation to income bank still apply.
However, we are suggesting that they not be cut off from receiving student benefits simply because they have earned up to half of that student income bank before they start to study. That is the reality. Whatever scheme they come under, the problem will be that students are going to be in an extremely difficult position actually knowing that whatever they earn before they get their student assistance is going to be simply eaten up by a greedy government, in this case maybe supported by a greedy opposition, that cannot see the injustice of what has been proposed.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-25,"—I am disappointed because I think that Senator Margetts really did not listen to or understand at all what I was saying. Our amendment will deal exactly with that position. The difficulty is that there was an income bank previously but, because the means test was based on your annual income, you could earn a lot during holiday periods—up to $3,000—and it did not affect your capacity to receive Austudy. The means test is now based on your fortnightly income. So, if you happen to look at the most recent fortnightly period when you, as a student, may have been working full time during the holidays, you might have found that you 
 exceeded the means test and would not receive Austudy.
To remedy that unnecessary or unfair imposition, the government allowed the provision of an income bank so that, if you earned less than the income level, you could get a credit so that when you made up for that lost income—and maybe over a holiday period—you would not lose out. Because this bill is to take effect in the middle of the year—and in fact in the middle of a holiday period—most people will be starting their fortnightly income test during a period when they may well be earning quite substantial amounts of money, as students tend to do when they work full time during holiday periods. Our amendment is aimed at ensuring that students on very low incomes who had been studying earlier in the year and who, if the scheme had started on 1 January, would in fact have earned some sorts of credits, are not adversely affected just because this scheme has come into effect in the middle of the year and in the middle of a holiday period.
The opposition's amendment clearly deals with that problem. Any statement by Senator Margetts that the opposition is not dealing with this problem or is acting inequitably is completely unfounded. Frankly, as a member of the opposition, I find it quite offensive that, despite my attempt to explain the position to Senator Margetts, she feels the need to state that our position is otherwise. Our view is that those students in that position should not be adversely affected and our amendment is directed to remedying it. We do not support an unfair position which gives credit to those who have not been living in circumstances where they would have otherwise received a credit.
Senator Margetts is putting forward the proposal that those people who, if the scheme had started on 1 January, would not have earned any credits at all should just receive this windfall of credits notwithstanding. We will not go that far. We do not believe that Senator Margetts's amendment fairly remedies the unfair position that has been created by the government by bringing this bill into effect in the middle of the year.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—We are not talking about governments giving people $3,000; we are talking about people who engage in various forms of holiday employment. It could have been working on a crayboat, it could have been picking grapes, it could have been picking strawberries. I can tell you that I have picked strawberries and it is very hard work to raise $3,000 in picking of various sorts—
—Apples are a lot heavier.
—Right. We have all done those kinds of jobs over time. We are not talking about people who suddenly looked up to the heavens and got $3,000 necessarily dumped in their hands. We are talking about people who have paid tax, who have done the work and who have actually put together a small amount. Three thousand dollars is not a large amount of money. We are talking about a small amount of money which, as a matter of commonsense I would have thought, students put in the bank at the start of a university year in order to be able to cover any of the contingencies that may occur—and do occur.
We are not talking about people being given anything—not a windfall or anything. We are talking about the injustice of having a $6,000 income bank, but having people having to draw down their savings—even if they are not up to $6,000; they are only $3,000—and being excluded from receiving assistance no matter what they were doing before that. We are talking about the ability of people to live as students. What we are trying to address here is whether or not what is being done is unfair for those people having to survive on the income that they receive, and whether or not we are creating a very silly situation—artificially silly.
The student income bank is a relatively good idea. I do not think there is anyone who does not think that a student income bank is 
 a good idea. But we are talking about whether or not it is silly to have a starting balance of zero. We are not talking about anyone giving anything—a windfall. We are talking about the ability to access the basic means of existence and the ability to average that starting from $3,000, which I believe does not mean that the person can earn over $6,000 in the year. We are saying that perhaps $3,000 of that $6,000 might already be there, which still only gives them the chance to earn $3,000 during that year.

That will mean that for half a year—if they are only studying for half a year—they still have that $3,000 which will be averaged over that half year. There is no difference there. It just means commonsense about whether or not you make the starting balance zero, or assume that people are going to need to have that income to survive at some stage—to have to draw on their savings for something at some stage during the year.

On the outskirts of this debate that we have had, the Senate was in agreement on the injustice of making a demarcation between living at home and living away from home for over-25s for determining the maximum rate 
 of payment for Austudy. The rationale for agreeing to remove that injustice was consistency. Of course, that was most welcome and not only because it removed the injustice for about 1,000 people waking up to $90 less per fortnight from 1 July, but also because it recognised how ridiculous it was for those over 25 to receive a reduced amount of income because they happen to live in their elderly parents' home.
Greens (WA) amendment No. 4 extends the logic of the amendments which have already been agreed to. The ALP and others have correctly argued—and the government has accepted—that, if you are 25 or over, it should make no difference whether you live at home or not. That was done for the argument of consistency. However, the amendments that have been agreed to do not address that, in the future, many students over 25 will be in receipt of youth allowance—though I always thought that was a bit odd. I do believe that perhaps an over-25-year-old is not a youth in any legal sense, but they still receive the youth allowance, not the new Austudy payment.
The Senate would be aware that, if you begin study when 23 or 24, you stay on the youth allowance until you finish your course, which could be when you are 27 or 28. If the Senate wishes to be consistent—and this is what the youth allowance is supposed to be about—then those students 25 years or older who happen to be on youth allowance, should not be subject to a reduced living at home rate either. If this Senate is going to say to Austudy payment recipients, `Okay, you're 25; it doesn't matter whether you live at home or not.' it should logically and fairly extend the same argument to those over 25 who happen to be on youth allowance. 
As the rent assistance issue has shown, there has been far too much inconsistency with these measures. The inconsistency is usually argued on the basis of bottom line and, where it happens to be cheaper to be consistent, funnily enough, it is argued on the basis of consistency. One group of students is being granted a benefit which other students are denied, and we argue on an arbitrary basis. Let us not compound the problem on 
 this issue. I urge all senators to support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1998-05-25,—I indicate the Democrats' support for this amendment on the grounds outlined by Senator Margetts in relation to consistency in removing the distinction between living at home and living away from home for students over the age of 25.,SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-25,"—This is a similar position to one raised earlier. As I have said, in a situation which gives students an increase in payment when they reach the age of 25 years, the opposition will be dealing with our policy position in relation to Austudy as a whole rather than on this sort of ad hoc basis in the context of the government's program of legislation, and any increase in payments will be dealt with as part of the opposition's entire package and will be announced in the campaign context.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—To the many people who are unable to listen to this debate today, I would suggest they read the Hansard . But as for those student groups and representatives who are listening, I am sure that they will not swallow what has just been said by Senator Neal.
The reality is that this is still grossly unfair; it is inconsistent and illogical. If there are angry people as a result of this debate, then I guess that the Labor Party has brought it on their own head. For them to suggest or pretend they are promising that at some later date, after they are elected, they might do something and that that is the time they should act fairly does not seem to ring true. It tends to ring more of pork-barrelling than showing a commitment to fairness and equity.
If there is something wrong with this bill—and we believe there is—this is the time to deal with it rather than to suggest that at some later date there might be an announcement which might deal with the issue. If it is unfair now, it should be dealt with now. This is the opportunity to deal with it.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-25,"—It might well be the approach of the minor parties—the Greens, the Democrats and 
 others—to deal with matters on an ad hoc basis, I suppose, having little stabs at legislation as it passes through the Senate. But the opposition, being a party of government, has to look at things in a different way; we have to decide our priorities in an entire program. You would understand that your position is vastly different from ours.
There have been a number of places in this bill where payments have been reduced, and we have opposed it because it is unfair. But certainly we cannot, just on an ad hoc basis, give additional payments or increased payments without looking at it in the whole context.
There probably will be a short period between 1 July, when this bill comes into effect, and the election, but I suspect it will be a very, very short period—less than six weeks. I believe that a better public policy position is to announce the program for Austudy and education as a whole rather than doing it this way.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—What an advantage not to have such a thin hide. I find it interesting that the same argument is being used on this inconsistency as has been used on a number of the gay and lesbian issues that have been brought up in terms of actual rationality and fairness. Any time we have chosen to amend a bill on the basis of commonsense and what potentially is, I would think, the policies of the Labor Party—that is, to provide for reasonable education opportunities, equity and fairness, and so on—somehow or another, amending a bill, in context, is ad hoc. That is a very interesting argument. I would think suggesting that some time later in the future there might be a pork barrel offered is an ad hoc approach to education.
This is amending a bill in context, based on what the community is saying to you, what the student groups are saying to you. If that is ad hoc, that is a very odd idea of what is out of context. It seems to me that simply throwing around promises at election is a very ad hoc way of approaching education fairness. It is something either you believe in or you do not believe in. You have to worry about 
 what is likely to happen if Labor get back into power—that they suggest they can only change that policy if they happen to get back into power.
I am very concerned about that whole issue. It seems that that excuse will be used again and again—`Look, we might be fair at some stage,' and `Maybe if we get into government,' and `Some other time, some other generation.' That seems to me to be an ad hoc approach. Either one believes in fairness and equity or one does not—and it seems to me that in the Labor Party's case the answer is not.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-25,"—I have to say that I would love to cooperate with the minister but, in light of the provocation I have received from Senator Margetts, I feel it is necessary to say something. This sort of view that, if you announce your education policy as a whole, somehow it is pork-barrelling is quite an extraordinary proposition. It may well be that a minor party can deal with matters in this way because they do not have to look at the entire context; they are in a much easier position. But, as a potential government, the opposition has to look at it as a whole plan.
Senator Faulkner interjecting—
—Exactly. Our education policy will be announced as a whole, and we will have costed it. We will not get out there and just irresponsibly promise anything, because we cannot do that. We have to make it add up in the long run. You may be able to do that, but certainly we cannot allow that situation to come about.
We will be announcing a total education policy. It will be costed. It will contain detailed expenditure promises. And it will be balanced against all the other areas we have 
 an interest in—health, child care, family services, employment. All those things will be taken into account.

I think it is important for future reference that, when we get back to this bill—and given that the Democrats obviously will be moving many amendments—Senator Neal, representing the Labor Party on social security issues, give us a little clearer definition of what exactly is `ad hoc'. Perhaps she could also explain how it is that, when we actually move amendments to try to ensure consistency in a piece of legislation that addresses people throughout the country, somehow or other that is an ad hoc thing. Perhaps she could elaborate on that for us. I am sure that, the next time you want to move amendments in an attempt to improve the situation for somebody, you will need to know whether or not those amendments from your perspective also are ad hoc.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

I think the reality is: what has been ad hoc in recent times are vague statements in relation to tax handbacks for middle and low income people—those people who have deserved it or earned it supposedly by working; and one can only read from that, as opposed to those people who have not deserved or earned some special benefits or assistance. It seems to me what we are hearing is saving money for some sort of tax handout.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1998-05-25,"—On 12 May Senator Harradine asked me, in my capacity as Minister representing the Attorney-General, some questions about legal aid for asylum seekers. I indicated that, if the Attorney had more to add, we would provide an answer. I have that answer and I seek leave incorporate it in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Senator VANSTONE : On 12 May 1998 Senator Harradine asked me, in my capacity as Minister representing the Attorney-General, the following questions about legal aid for asylum seekers:
(1) Will there be a guarantee that there will be no diminution in the amount of finds available to those asylum seekers who, on the face of it, have genuine claims and who have suffered persecution and require that sort of advice in order to negotiate the 
 complex legal system that Australia has adopted; and
(2) Is it a fact that legal aid has provided thus far 75 per cent of the subsidised advice given to those asylum seekers.
Senator VANSTONE : I am advised that the answers to the honourable senator's questions are as follows:
(1) The Government is committed to ensuring that all asylum seekers found to be refugees are treated in accordance with Australia's international obligations under the Refugees Convention and Protocol. It is not accepted that meeting this commitment requires lawyers to assist asylum seekers with their applications.
Every asylum seeker in detention will have access to assistance at Government expense to help them make an application for a protection visa. Assistance will also be provided to those protection visa applicants in the community who, due to financial hardship and other factors such as being from a non English speaking background, cultural differences, illiteracy or due to a physical or psychological disability, are unable to obtain assistance themselves. This assistance is provided under contract by registered migration agents and some legal aid commissions.
The service provided is immigration advice and assistance for applications at the primary stage and the review stage. Legal aid however, continues to be available for matters where there are differences of judicial opinion which have not been settled by the Full Court of the Federal Court or the High Court, or where proceedings seek to challenge the lawfulness of detention.
The changes made to the guidelines for legal aid funding in refugee matters recognises that Australia has a world class system for determining claims for Australia' s protection and that genuine refugees need only be able to relate their story to officers of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs or to the Refugee Review Tribunal. This is not ""a complex legal system"" and legal expertise is not necessary in order for applicants to present their claims for protection.
(2) The figures available to us do not support Senator Harradine' s estimate. I am advised that legal aid commissions spent an estimated $1.35m on refugee matters in 1995/96. This is in addition to the $1.89m available annually to assist visa applicants eligible under the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme administered by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.
The Government' s intention in introducing the new legal aid guideline is to ensure that legal aid funds are not spent on the unnecessary duplication of services already provided through the Department 
 of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. We accept that the new guidelines may result in legal aid commissions doing less work on refugee matters. However it is too soon to conclude that the effect will be to reduce the availability of advice services for asylum seekers.
The intention of the new guideline is to enable the redistribution of scarce legal aid resources so that, from the Attorney's point of view, more legal assistance can be directed to matters of priority to the Commonwealth arising under Commonwealth law.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Legal Aid: Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1998-05-25,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer), to a question without notice asked by Senator O'Brien today, relating to the pork industry.
In relation to Senator Parer's answer, I noted that he said that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) had been advised by AQIS that it had no intention of conducting a risk assessment into the importation of pork from other countries. I have in my possession a copy of an animal quarantine policy memorandum, under AQIS's letterhead, dated 18 May and under the signature of Dr Sarah Kahn, Assistant Director, Animal Quarantine Policy Branch, in which AQIS was seeking comments on a proposed approach to a review of quarantine policy on the importation of pig meat. Amongst other things, that document says:
AQIS intends to conduct a quarantine import risk analysis (IRA) which will consider the importation of pig meat from any source, ie a generic IRA.
The IRA will include assessment of all potential disease agents that may be introduced to Australia via the importation of pig meat, including human and animal pathogens.
AQIS was seeking comment on the proposal. It is interesting that the return date for comment on that proposal was 18 June, and I am given to understand that the intention was to 
 proceed. Senator Parer did not say that the minister had asked AQIS not to proceed, and certainly the memorandum that I have was not directed to the minister but to members of the industry, the National Farmers Federation, the EU delegation, state and territory veterinary officers, et cetera. So what we have now is that either AQIS has, prior to the closing deadline for its own memorandum, made a decision and conveyed it to the minister or it has made a quick political decision and decided that it was not politic for this matter to be in the public domain at the moment.
It is of concern to the Labor Party that everyone except the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) appreciates the gravity of the situation currently facing the pork industry. The Senate does because it supported my motion on 7 April to investigate the impact of the flood of imports on domestic prices. State ministers for agriculture certainly do. They have been pressuring Mr Anderson to move quickly to protect the interests of pork producers and those who depend on that industry for their livelihoods. The Liberal and National Party backbench certainly appreciates the gravity of the situation. Members and senators know first-hand just how bad the situation is because of the pressure that is being applied in their own electorates. They had in excess of 40 people at their committee meeting a couple of weeks ago interested to hear pork producers. Even the personal staff of the Prime Minister do because they have been ringing producers direct to find out what is going on.
The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy needs to understand that government action in support of the pork industry is time sensitive. Mr Anderson does not have the luxury of directing agencies to inquire into this matter at their leisure. He does not have the luxury of having the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council travelling around looking at the state of the industry and then spending weeks preparing a report that is handed to him for consideration and to then spend weeks looking at that. The intensive nature of the industry means that Mr Anderson must act, and must act now.
—What would you do? Break the protocol?
—Producers have no choice but to feed their pigs and once they reach a certain weight the pigs must be sold, and you know that, Senator Ferguson. If the current prices mean that the average producers are losing, then lose they will: I am told that producers are losing around $1,200 a week. It is not like waiting for rains before you plant a crop, or holding your cattle until the price picks up, or storing your woolclip until the prices improve. I think the Senate has taken action to get the minister to do something. Unfortunately, the minister has chosen to act in a rather slow fashion; so slow that he has infuriated this industry Australia wide. My office has had a lot of calls about the problems this industry is facing. No doubt coalition senators are receiving the same sorts of calls and hence the concern of some of the coalition backbenchers because there will be pressure from their electorates. Pork producers are seeing this government as a government of inaction; a government that will not do what is necessary to give them some temporary relief, as is permitted under the GATT rules.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Pork Industry</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1998-05-25,"—I think the Senate just heard a very well-prepared speech but one that was very poorly delivered by Senator O'Brien.
Yes, we on the government side are receiving representations about the difficulties currently being faced by the pig industry. But you have to ask the questions: how come? And why are these difficulties being experienced? It should be remembered that, prior to 1990, Australia's quarantine protocols prohibited imports of live pigs and fresh or processed pig meat except for canned hams and some imports of fresh pork. Imports of uncooked, frozen Canadian pig meat have been permitted since July 1990.
—Who allowed it in?
—Senator Ferguson asks, rhetorically: who allowed this to occur? It was the Labor Party whilst in government. It was before your time, Senator O'Brien, and so you might not have realised that what you were stumbling into was in fact a very harsh 
 criticism of the way your former Labor government did business in relation to these matters. The problems that we are experiencing today relate quite clearly to the changes that were made during the previous regime.
A lot has been said about the Canadian pig imports, and import levels are small in absolute terms. For 1996-97, for example, they represented 5.36 per cent of domestic consumption, albeit that the high value leg market represented some 27.14 per cent. So there are clearly some difficulties.
Yet in recent months import levels have decreased substantially from an average of 1,065.85 tonnes per month for the December 1997 quarter to an average of 604.48 tonnes per month for the March 1998 quarter. This suggests that the current drop in pig meat prices may well be attributable to a range of factors and not solely caused by pig meat imports.
Indeed, if we have a look at the other side of the equation, it is very interesting to see that, in dollar terms, pig meat exports seem to be outweighing pig meat imports. The value of exports to Japan, for example, rose from $1.7 million in 1996 to $15.2 million in 1997. But this, of course, reflected the difficulties that Taiwan was having.
Further, Woolworths has recently announced that it has contracted to supply a Japanese customer with pork valued at $20 million per year; and exports to the Russian Federation have also been increasing steadily. What is more, Mr Fischer has just led a trade delegation to the Russian Federation, and representatives of the industry joined with that delegation with a view to increasing sales to the Russian Federation.
In the period July 1997 to February 1998, Australian pork exports, including wild pig, were valued at $40.3 million, still in excess of the rising value of imports for the same period of $28.9 million. For the benefit of Senator O'Brien, they are figures sourced from the Australian Pork Corporation. So there are a number of issues.
One issue that is of real importance in this whole debate is product labelling—something that the Labor government never got together, 
 but which we have. We are now pursuing truth in labelling, under the Trade Practices Act, to clarify claims of product of Australia. I am sure that the Australian consumer will benefit from that legislation and, more importantly, so will the pig producers in this country.
The real difficulty that Labor faces in this debate is that they are trying to make cheap political capital out of a situation which has been occasioned by the Labor Party's embrace of protocols which were entered into prior to this government coming into office.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Pork Industry</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1998-05-25,"—I listened very carefully to Senator Abetz, and I guess the pig council listened very carefully too—and I am sure that they are convinced there is no problem. I am sure that now they will all go away and be quite happy; they will tell their bank managers, `Look, really, you think that we're going down the tube, but Senator Abetz in the Senate has convinced us all that there's really no problem.' So there are no pig producers who are going out of production; there are no pig producers who are down on their uppers; there are no problems in Queensland or South Australia or Western Australia!
However, unfortunately, the pig industry itself does not have the same view as you, Senator Abetz. I have here from the Pork Council of Australia a document which talks about the pig industry being `an industry in crisis'.
Government senators interjecting—
—Let me put a few things on the record, over and against all the interjections I am getting from the other side—because they are very nervous about this debate; they are really hurting.
—When was the last time were you in a piggery?
—Just a few months ago, as a matter of fact. Let me put on the record what the pork industry itself says, over and against all the good news we are getting from the other side which I am afraid nobody in the pork industry believes. You might believe it; and, Senator Ferguson, you had better go and visit the pork producers in 
 South Australia. From what they say here in their letters to me—which I am sure you have received, Senator Ferguson—they certainly do not have the kind of confidence which is being expressed by your side.
—Senator Woodley, would you like to address the chair, please?
—Certainly, Madam Deputy President, and I accept your rebuke. I did get carried away. I will watch myself.
—Thank you. Ignore the interjections, they are unruly, and address the chair.
—Yes, they are, as a matter of fact; you are dead right. But I understand them, because I understand how nervous people on the other side are.
Let me tell you about a phone call I had from Russell Henis. He is one of a number of pig producers who ring me and visit my office regularly. He is very angry, particularly with Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister. He is insulted by the claim made by Tim Fischer that `Imports aren't the problem,' and the comment that Mr Fischer made that `The industry had 20 years to adjust; what are they whingeing about?' That kind of response from a Deputy Prime Minister who is the Leader of the National Party is not appreciated by farmers, I can assure you.
Another problem relates to one of the issues that was addressed by Senator Abetz—and the Democrats will be very keen to see the legislation on labelling when it comes into the Senate because, having had a look at it, I am quite sure that it will need an awful lot of amendment to make it of any use whatsoever. This problem is the issue of unpackaged pork, and that will not be covered by labelling laws—even though Senator O'Chee has said that it will be covered by the middle of 1998. Of course, the problem is that we have to get the Liberals and the members of the National Party to talk together, because Trish Worth has said that unpackaged pork is not a problem, that we do not have to cover it with our labelling laws.
—When did she say that?
—I am quoting Russell Henis; you will have to ring him up and ask him. You should talk to the pork producers in Queensland, Senator Boswell, and they would tell you. The West Australian Pork Producers Association states:
Pig farmers are angry that no reciprocal rights to trade have been made with the importing countries. Our trade negotiators seem hell bent to show the world the advantages of free trade between countries, when every country we deal with has some form of protection, whether it be subsidy on their grain they feed to their pigs, or tariffs on over quota pigmeat.
Profarm Trading Propriety Limited in South Australia says:
I have been astounded by the current government policies and attitude towards the pig industry, especially in relation to the importation of pig meat products.

"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1998-05-25,"—Could I just make a comment on the contribution by Senator Woodley to the debate and say to Senator Woodley through you, Madam Deputy President, that that is one of the most misleading, disgraceful explanations I have ever heard in this place. I feel very sad because I have found you a very balanced, sensible person on most of the issues.
Government senators interjecting—
—I have gone too far, I accept that, but that was absolutely, totally misleading. We need to look at this in its total context and in terms of the source of the problem we have today. The problem comes from the inadequate completion of the job that was started back in 1990 by the previous government. That is where the fundamental problem lies today in terms of the importation of pork into this country.
There is another aspect we need to look at very carefully when we deal with this. I am sure Senator O'Brien, although his adviser may not be up to it in terms of that, is sensible enough to realise that the collapse in the beef market and the collapse of the lamb market are having a far greater impact on the 
 price of pork today than any import into this country at this particular time.
While we continue to have the current situation in Indonesia and a huge surplus of cattle in the north of this country, the pressure on all prices, whether lamb, pork or anything else, is going to be extreme for a considerable period of time. But can I deal with a couple of the issues here. It was certainly believed in terms of the GATT round and what occurred then that it was important to put some rules around agriculture. That was sought right across this country by all major political parties—I will not include some of the minor political parties in this, because they were not part of it. But the previous government fell down in three major areas. One was the emergency WTO safeguards. They can talk all they like about it, but in that process when they negotiated it, they never put in any mechanisms by which Australia could deal with these aspects.
—They bound them.
—Yes, that is absolutely right, Senator Boswell. They never put in any mechanism, nor did they put in place any arrangements by which imports could be phased into this country as you opened up the trade.
In particular, I want to deal with Canada. It must be recognised that, in total world terms, we export five times the amount of food we import and, with Canada, four times more meat than we import from them. Where Senator Woodley was very misleading in terms of his comments is that there is no tariff or any barriers against pork into Canada. You could export pork into Canada tomorrow, if you wanted to put things together and go and do it. Whether or not you would make any money doing it is another question. But that can be done tomorrow.
The full range of the products that we are exporting to Canada through the NAFTA arrangements must also be recognised. The recent announcements on wool, for example, have been very beneficial and will be very beneficial in the future. When we look at other aspects in terms of beef, we see we have an oversupply on the domestic market in Australia right now. If we were to move to 
 restrict pork, what do you think the Canadians would do? They would immediately restrict our beef going into Canada. What would happen from that? You would have even more beef on the domestic market and even more depression of the prices than we have now. So there has to be a bit of commonsense and rationality on this.
We have to resist taking a political swipe when a much more commonsense approach to the problem needs to be adopted by everybody in this chamber. Senator O'Brien, we supported your motion in a sensible and proper manner. You need to work on solutions to the problem. Let me deal with three of them. We are activating immediately these exceptional circumstances, and that is being fast tracked through the process. Right now, as has already been mentioned, we have moved on the implementation of truth in labelling. Why haven't you people on the other side of the chamber done something since 1990 on truth in labelling?
—We did.
—You did not. Let us go a bit further. We have brought in—and it is before this place right now—countervailing and anti-dumping legislation. That is being done right now by this government. You should have been dealing with these issues, as a walk through, when you negotiated the changes. You have left half the job undone. We have had to pick that up. That is the fundamental problem we have in terms of this today, combined with the collapse in the other areas of the meat market. If you do not believe it has collapsed, just go to a lamb sale and see how the price of lamb has gone down; go into a butcher shop or to one of the major retailers and see what the pricing structure is today. Beef is meeting the market. Beef has gone under the price of pork. What are consumers doing? They are buying beef in preference to pork. That is a major problem, combined with a major increase in production.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1998-05-25,"—We are taking note of the answer to the question asked by Senator O'Brien with regard to why AQIS is commencing import 
 risk analysis at this time, given the circumstances confronting the pork industry.
—It isn't.
—It is, Senator Boswell, exactly what we are talking about. What obligation is AQIS under, given the current circumstances? I suggest they are not under any obligation; they are probably being directed by this minister, a minister from the National Party, who is supposed to represent all interests in rural Australia and is simply not doing the job. He is being criticised not only by the pig industry but also by a whole range of other people  within the agricultural sector. Senator Abetz wanted us to believe that, somehow, because we are improving our exports of pork, everything is okay. But that is not the case.
The other adage that this government seems to use because it does not really want to accept its responsibility as being a government is, `Don't blame us, blame them. They didn't do anything for 13 years.' With regard to the pig industry and the labelling issue on which they say we did nothing, I say we did do something. We had an agreed set of rules—something the industry supported. We would have had them implemented but we had an election. You won government and you would not front up to your responsibilities—and you scratched them.
Two years on they say, `Oh, we've done something. We're about to introduce into the parliament a new bill on labelling laws.' Two years! Likewise, anti-dumping and countervailing. What have you done as a government? We have had to drag you up to the line on every occasion on industry policy. It does not matter whether it is the car industry, the textiles, clothing and footwear industry or in this case the pig industry, we have had to keep dragging you up to the line.
—Order! Senator Murphy, would you please address the chair and not the government members. Thank you.
—Yes, Madam Deputy President. As I said, we have had to keep dragging this government up to the line to get them to take some action rather than constant 
 ly carping, `Well, blame them over there.' The fact of the matter is that they have to realise that they are in government. They are responsible for taking decisions. I think it was Senator Abetz who said, `There's not a problem in the pig industry.' At least John Anderson, the minister, recognises there is a problem. He put out a press release saying:
MINISTER ACTS ON PORK COUNCIL REQUESTS
There are a number of factors which have affected pigmeat prices during the last six months, and I am acutely aware of the difficulties currently facing the pork industry.
That is recognition of the fact that there are difficulties. Some strategic thinking is needed within the government—which is currently lacking—about what sort of policy, what sort of direction, is required to provide some benefits to this industry and how the government might ensure that the pig industry in this country continues to survive. That is what this is about.
The government cannot achieve that by directing the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service to go off and conduct a free-for-all risk analysis of pork to be imported from anywhere in the world. If the government does not have in place a strategy for its own industry, it should not do that. We have not only seen the government doing this to the pork industry; it has occurred in other industries. It has occurred in the salmon industry and it has occurred in the chicken industry, and yet this government has not taken any steps toward getting in place a proper industry strategy for any of these agricultural industries. Nothing the government has done will secure for these industries a long-term future.
—They are a failure.
—I will respond to the interjection by Senator Faulkner: they have failed. They are a failure. We have had to drag them up to the line on every occasion to get some sort of policy for industry development in this country and we are going to do it again with regard to the pig industry.
Senator Ferguson, I am sure the people within the pork industry will be very pleased to know that you laughed about that. I would have thought you would be one of the people 
 on their side. I notice your colleague Senator Boswell from the National Party has now vacated the premises. As he does so, he vacates his responsibility to the agriculture industry, in particular the pork industry of this country.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Pork Industry</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1998-05-25,"—Senator Murphy has just given a bit of truth to that old saying: an empty vessel makes the most noise. In Senator Murphy's case, he has been rattling around on issues that he knows nothing about, and certainly he is not inclined to support the position of the previous government—his government—on all these issues.
One of the sad things about this debate is the way in which Senator O'Brien and others have continued to use this chamber to build up some false hopes for the pig producers of Australia. They have led the pork producers of Australia to think that they can fix the problems when in fact they cannot do anything at all because all the things that we are trying to fix are things that they put in place when they negotiated the protocols that are currently in place.
—And you voted for it.
—I have never denied that we voted for it, Senator Margetts. The point I am making is that the Labor Party who are now crying wolf are the ones who are responsible for putting those protocols in place.
Senator O'Brien has raised this issue on a number of occasions. The information that Senator O'Brien is getting is well sourced because he has a staffer who was involved in primary industry prior to this. But the information that he is getting is information that we are all well aware of.
I was really amazed to see Senator Woodley make a fleeting visit to the chamber—and it was not much more than a fleeting visit. He came in and told us that he has received a number of letters from the pork producers of Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland—I am sure Senator O'Brien has exactly the same letters, and we have exactly the same letters—and he then told us he is so knowledgeable about the 
 industry because several months ago he visited a piggery. Senator Woodley really ought to know that pigs need to be fed seven days a week and usually twice a day. If Senator Woodley only makes fleeting visits to piggeries as often as that it is not surprising how little he knows when it comes to the issues that confront the pork industry today.
Senator O'Brien mentioned a backbench committee meeting that some 40 members of the coalition attended because they were so concerned about the situation in the pork industry. Senator O'Brien, Senator Crane happens to chair that committee. It is always a very well attended committee. One of the reasons that 40 people attend every week is that we happen to hold 42 out of the 45 rural and regional seats, and a number of other senators attend on top of that. So it is no wonder that in excess of 40 people attend the backbench primary industries meeting. That is what happens every week.
All the members of that committee are particularly interested in primary industry matters and any other matters that relate to rural and regional affairs. They attend regularly and service their electorates and their communities so well because they are aware of exactly what is happening. They are doing everything in their power under the protocols that the previous government put in place to make sure that we as a government can deliver some relief for those people in the pig industry in Australia who are suffering—we acknowledge the fact, and I did so the other night in a speech, Senator O'Brien—as badly as I can ever remember.
As Senator Crane so rightly mentioned in his contribution, many of these problems are associated with factors that are outside the control of pig meat producers. They are due to a downturn in the market for beef and lamb and all meat production. All meat products are currently much cheaper than they have been for a long time.
In conjunction with all these matters that we have to contend with, a particular issue is affecting the pig industry at this time. The minister concerned, the minister for primary industries, has put his mind to it, as have all his staff, because they realise the urgency that 
 is confronting the pig industry. We know and you know as well, Senator O'Brien, that in this industry the costs are far greater on a week by week basis than they are for all those other industries like the beef industry and the lamb industry where, unless the animals are fed in a feedlot, the expenses are not as great as they are for this particular industry.
When it comes to supporting the industry, I can promise you, Senator O'Brien, that all those rural electorates which are currently represented by coalition members will, after an election, continue to be represented by coalition members because you proved during 13 years of government that you were not prepared to do anything at all for these people. You were not prepared to do anything at all for them to make sure that their future was secure under the protocols, negotiations and agreements you made while you were in government. (Time expired)

Ordered that the report be printed.

That the Senate take note of the report.
I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The report I am tabling today is a record of the proceedings of a Seminar conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in March this year. This seminar assembled some of the most authoritative speakers from across Australian government departments, business and academic fields, to share their views on the origins, the regional economic and political ramifications and the likely effects on Australia of the so called `Asian Currency Crisis'.
It is well known that since the floating of the Thai baht in July 1997, a number of regional economies have seen the value of their currency plummet by record amounts. The reactions of Governments as they sought to meet the effects of the financial crisis have seen marked political turmoil, and in some cases social unrest with dramatic consequences, as we have witnessed over the last week. The crisis is set against a seven year period of stagnation in the region's largest economy, Japan. With Japan as Australia's largest trading partner and 20 per cent of our GDP derived from trade with the embattled South East Asian countries, many had speculated on what might be the effects on Australia? Whilst the Government and a variety of analysts had forecast a down turn in the Australian growth rate, the Committee felt it was appropriate to consider the wider ramifications for Australia. Hence this seminar sought to inform the Parliament, and the wider public through open discussion of the impact of the crisis in Asia on Australia
The Deputy Prime Minister, in opening the seminar, commented upon the Australian Government's response to the situation, highlighting the contribution to the IMF assistance packages for Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia—an action that has received bipartisan support. There is little doubt 
 that there would be an impact on the Australian export performance, but Australia remains committed to Asia as more than just a fair-weather friend. The recovery period will not be without some pain for Australia, but in the end should provide opportunity and gain.
It is interesting to note that the prospects for Indonesia were covered in three of the presentations and whilst the possible scenarios included the essence of what we have all witnessed over the last two weeks, it is fair to say that no one was able to predict the rapid fall of President Suharto.
From the initial discussion of the countries most effected by the crisis—Thailand, The Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia—it became apparent that each had its own set of unique challenges to contend with. A `standard' remedy was therefore probably not appropriate. The various responses, under the auspices the IMF, subsequently came under critical analysis. Why did a package that called for profound macro economic reform appear to work in one country, whilst in another it was considered too insistent and extending too far into the sovereign rights of the effected country? Was there a distinct east-west discord developing? These issues were addressed by a number of the seminar presentations.
Similarly, the effectiveness of the role of the regional forums, such as ASEAN and APEC, was carefully considered during the seminar. On examination of the prospects for China, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore it is evident that regionally, nations are divided in their views as to what to do. Subsequently, ASEAN and APEC were seen as unlikely fora for addressing the core problems of the crisis. Whilst it can be argued, in APECs case, that it not designed to address financial issues, it was determined during the seminar to have the best prospects of any regional organisation to address politics in the region. That it failed to exert any real influence during this crisis should not preclude its use in the future to provide coordination, by various regional agencies, to assist countries in the region to set circumstances to avoid the same situation reoccuring.
Acknowledging that the direct impact of the crisis on Australia is an unfolding situation, a number of broad points of consensus were discussed. These ranged from the current state of the domestic economy, impacts on specific export sectors, effects at State and Territory level and the prospects for employment growth. These issues, together with the presentation on the prospects for Australian business, provide a number of interesting viewpoints on which to reflect as the real effects become apparent over the next financial year or so.
The Committee, in reporting its views of the seminar, chose to keep its remarks brief. In so doing, the words of the individual speakers have 
 been allowed to stand by themselves. While individually noteworthy, these presentations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the social, economic and political impact of the crisis, not just on Australia, but also for other regional nations.
In conclusion, I would like to thank the many members of the foreign affairs, academic, business and diplomatic communities who participated in the seminar, and particularly the talented group of speakers who generously contributed their time to ensure its success through the quality of their presentations. I believe their efforts have contributed to the creation of a valuable reference source on the initial effects of the Asian Currency crisis on Australia. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—I think the issue really is about the existing policies of parties—not whether or not they are going to promise something at elections—in this case the major parties in this chamber, the dinosaur parties. It is about what they actually say and whether or not such policies say that they are in favour of hiving off a particular group of people and making their conditions such that it is harder for them to achieve equity than others. That is what we come down to. It is not a matter of revealing in advance; we are talking about a situation where we are being asked to vote, now, on basic equity principles in relation to rent assistance. The issues are absolutely current. Those people who are involved need not to find out whether or not parties like the Labor Party may think about becoming fair and equitable in the future but whether or not they are operating as if they are an equitable party now. If they are not now, what makes anybody think that they would change their mind in the future?
The issue, as Senator Neal has suggested, is that it would cost too much.
—I didn't ever say that.
—Senator Neal has indicated that it is all right for the minor parties to say this but they are the party in waiting to be government and therefore they cannot simply make—what was the terminology?—ad hoc decisions outside of the context of their entire package. What are they saying? 
 Are they saying they are not going to try to hive off money to fund a glitzy tax giveaway? Or are they actually going make up for some of the inequities that have existed in the education system over the last few years? That is not very obvious here.
It is not a matter of ad hoc decisions, it is about whether or not you can suggest that a party who may not be operating along a line of principles now will suddenly become principled, supposedly leading up to an election, or whether or not what we are being told is intended to take the pressure off now because afterwards it will be too late. We will not know later but of course, at the moment, when we are being asked to make a decision, we are being told that it is the wrong time, the wrong question, out of context, ad hoc—let us find another excuse.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-05-25,"—I would like to agree with the comments made by Senator Margetts on behalf of the Greens (WA) and add the Democrats's concerns to this debate. I would also like to read, for the benefit of certainly the government but also the opposition, a last-minute plea issued by the National Union of Students today, saying:
NUS calls on the Opposition to support minor party amendments to the Bill which give students aged over 25 the same incentives to study as those available to younger Australians.
That is the final paragraph of a media release by the education officer of the National Union of Students, Katrina Curry, who, like many other students, is concerned about the abnormal situation that is being created through this legislation in relation to the discrimination against full-time students over the age of 25 in respect of these payments. The Democrats have long called on the ALP to explain why they are allowing this anomaly, this bizarre distinction, between those aged 25 and under and those aged 25 and over. I think it is important to put on record that the peak national representative body of students in Australia are calling on the opposition to change their position in this debate.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-25,"—I wish to move an amended request for amendment which is on sheet 995 and which will replace the request for amendment which is contained on the original sheet 995 that has been circulated. I move:
That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:
(1)	 Schedule 2, page 119 (after line 28), after item 24, insert: 

24A	 At the end of section 1067B (but before the Note)
	 Add:
	 ;and (f)	 is not a person who:
			 (i)	 qualified for the independent living allowance under the AUSTUDY scheme, as in force immediately before the commencement of Schedule 11 to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Act 1998 , only under AUSTUDY Regulation 68, as in force at that time; and
			 (ii)	 had not, at that time, turned 25.
The effect of this request for an amendment is that people between the ages of 22 and 24, who became independent when the opposition reduced the age of independence from 25 to 22 under what used to be the old Austudy, and have not yet reached the age of 25, will receive slightly more than they do at present. Without this amendment that particular group of people would have been adversely affected in that their income would have dropped to $174. Under the effect of this request for amendment, upon reaching 25 they will receive either $265 or $322 per fortnight, which is an improvement on what their position would have been before this bill was dealt with by this chamber. I would commend it to senators.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1998-05-25,"—My understanding of the amendment before us, which has been moved by the opposition, is that it preserves the independent status of approximately 950 students who are currently on Austudy and who qualify for the independent age rate by virtue of being over 22 years of age when this government raised the age of independence to 25 years.
The Democrats support this amendment. Senator Neal commended it to the chamber and we commend it, but we should note that this amendment would not be necessary—and, Senator Neal, there is no point in hanging your head in shame on this one—
—I am not hanging it in shame. I am just exhausted.
—The fact is this amendment would not be necessary if the opposition decided not to support the government's position in relation to what constitutes the age of independence. We know that the common youth allowance determines an independent age for unemployed people at 21 and for students at 25 years. All through this debate on this consequential bill and on the bill before it, the Democrats have raised our objections to defining a student as being a child until independent at the age of 25. It is ridiculous. It is a ludicrous, shameful, concocted notion of independence that determines that people until the age of 25, if they are full-time students, should therefore be financially and otherwise dependent on their families. All through this debate the Democrats have said that that is inappropriate.
For that reason we will support this measure as a measure that alleviates for at least 950 students the potential pain or economic hardship that this legislation would otherwise impose. We will support this amendment so as to alleviate the worst aspects of this bill, but we will not let it go past without acknowledging and putting on record the fact that this amendment would not be necessary in the first place if the opposition actually had the guts to stand up to the government and say, look, 25 is a ridiculous notion. It is a ridiculous age at which to define independence for full-time students. It is ridiculous to assume that 25 is the age of independence when in nearly every other area of law, certainly where governments can save money, it is convenient to determine independence at the age of 16, 17 or, usually, 18. Whether it is the Child Support Act or the tax rebates for families, we notice that they do not define the age of independence as over 18 or indeed over 20, let alone 25.
Again, I put our very strong objections on record and I draw to the attention of the opposition a press release that I read from earlier from the President of the National Union of Students, Rose Tracey, and its education officer, Katrina Curry, who plead with the opposition to reverse its stance so that people are treated fairly and treated as independents at a rightful and appropriate age, 
 as opposed to 25. I find it ridiculous that we are even referring to people theoretically as children—and they are 25 years of age!
So a commendation to the ALP for this particular amendment that alleviates one nasty, but shame on them for not actually going the whole hog and ensuring that students are treated as independent ideally at 18, less preferably at 21 but definitely not at 25.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—I back what Senator Stott Despoja was saying on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The Greens (WA) have seen some extraordinary arguments used during this whole process. We heard today that we can have 28-year-old youth in Australia who can still be treated as children by this government with the support of the opposition. So, yes, this is better than not having this particular measure but, no, it is certainly not good enough. Funnily enough, those young people—the 28-year-old youth—can vote and I think they will do as result of what will be happening today.

	 (iii)	 up front course fees; and
	 (iv)	 HECS payments; and
	 (v)	 union fees; and
	 (vi)	 costs of text books; and
	 (vii)	 costs of any tools or equipment required to undertake the course, including computer software; and

(6)	 Schedule 9, item 17, page 213 (lines 14 to 17), omit the note.
Greens (WA) amendments 5 and 6 relate to the liquid assets test. They seek to clarify, specify and allow scope for the expansion of the deductions which students can make from their assessable assets under the liquid assets test. We have heard today some explanation— 
although that explanation largely fell on deaf ears with both the government and the opposition—in relation to what students can reasonably expect to spend or need to spend. This impacts of course on things like their income bank and their assessable income.
We have asked that we add to the end of paragraph (e) at schedule 9, item 17, page 213, line 13 that it includes up-front course fees; HECS payments; union fees; costs of text books; costs of any tools or equipment required to undertake the course, including computer software; expenses directly related to any field trips undertaken for the purposes of the course; and such other expenses as are approved by the Secretary.

"Neal, Sen Belinda",ALP,1998-05-25,"—I indicate that the opposition will not be opposing this amendment, but we do have some concerns about amendment No. 5 and amendment No. 6 which facilitates amendment 5. Obviously the intention of the Greens is to clarify the issue and to ensure that the scope of the provision is as wide as possible. But, because of the way our statutory interpretation goes, by having a list of inclusions you effectively narrow the general statement. I think it is a very important issue but I think the effect of the amendment is to narrow the scope of the provision of those liquid assets, and it would concern me very much if that were the case. As I said, we will not be opposing it, but I suspect that you should seek some clarification from someone with some expertise in statutory interpretation.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1

Other than that, I think it leaves people unsure about what is reasonable and what is unreasonable. At least with clarification people know where they stand.

We did not see it as a narrowing of the criteria but rather as just more clarification. I now seek clarification from the government as to whether they see it as having that effect—that is, narrowing in some way.

	 (2)	 If an AUSTUDY living allowance was payable, or is to be taken to have been payable, immediately before 1 July 1998, to or in respect of a person who is of AUSTUDY age on that day, then Step 1 of the Method Statement in point 1067L-E2 applies to the person as if the reference in that Step to zero were a reference to $3,000.
This request relates to the provisions of the income bank. This matter was discussed at 
 some length previously, so I do not wish to go over it at length again. Essentially, it covers the difficulty that arises from the provisions of this bill coming into effect in the middle of the year and most probably during a period when students are not studying. This gives students a credit so that, when they actually earn that initial income, they will not lose eligibility for Austudy. In fact, it directly relates to people who were already either on youth allowance or Austudy and who would therefore be adversely affected by this change.
This remedies the situation. It does not go as far as the Greens did, but it certainly remedies the situation created by the changes contained in this bill. I recommend this request to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1998-05-25,"—We are continuing debate on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which deals with the issues relating to choice of superannuation—or the deregulation of the retail delivery of superannuation. I would like to 
 comment on the experiences in the United Kingdom and Chile in respect of the introduction of choice, because we do have two case studies of what occurred with those two systems.
In the United Kingdom, in the 1980s, the then Thatcher government decided to allow employees to opt out of their company pension fund and, instead, to set up a personal pension arrangement. Many employees were persuaded to give up a generous employer financed benefit and move into a personal pension vehicle, where the only contributions were their own. Employees in many cases were inappropriately lured into these products by life insurance salesmen using unrealistic projections of expected retirement benefits.	So many people were disadvantaged by this system that the Thatcher government was forced to introduce a complex system under which those disadvantaged could claim compensation and/or be reinstated in their former scheme. The whole affair is now universally acknowledged to be a total debacle, and the mess is still being sorted out.
Although the circumstances differ slightly, similar risks apply in Australia under a proposed choice of fund regime. There is a danger that members of well run and generous enterprise based funds or industry funds will be persuaded by aggressive sales techniques to give up existing entitlements and rights to future benefit accruals for other arrangements that are less attuned to their needs.
Just an update on the United Kingdom pension problems: the misselling scandal losses to consumers were recently revised upwards from £4 billion to £11 billion. Ninety per cent of the 560,000 people who transferred out of their occupational products were literally ripped off and, interestingly, the then Thatcher  conservative  government  launched 
 its initiative, wrapped in the rhetoric of freedom and, of course, the words `choice for the individual'.
Briefly, to Chile. Chile operates a compulsory accumulation style private sector superannuation system. Most of the population is in one of 15 private sector funds, all of which compete actively for members. The Institutional Investor magazine reported in its June 1997 edition that 29 per cent of members switched funds in the previous 12 months. Much of the switching is triggered by sales people working for the funds being paid for each switch. Some 38 per cent of the entire cost of managing the Chilean superannuation system is related to switching between funds. Members are convinced, cajoled, induced and even seduced by a wide range of offers to switch to a new fund, with gifts such as mobile phones, mountain bikes, and many other initiatives. Such practices are illegal in Chile but widespread, nonetheless.
I seek leave to table two documents: one on choice in Chile, and the other on lessons from the United Kingdom that were presented to the recent conference of major superannuation funds. These documents are very informative.
Leave granted.
—The last issue I want to deal with is what I think is likely to happen under choice in Australia, in addition to the comments that I have made earlier about Chile and the United Kingdom. I seek leave to incorporate a document headed `The benefits generated by an industry fund compared with leading master trust providers', prepared by Industry Fund Services, dated 22 May 1998.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—

—This document, prepared by Industry Fund Services, shows the benefits generated by an industry fund compared with those by a trio of leading master trust providers. They are not selected because they are the worst performers; they are, in fact, among the better ones. Under most 
 master trust structures, small-scale employer based members and personal direct-paying members are treated identically. The old distinction between the two styles of product have largely disappeared. So the worst excesses of the personal superannuation products are behind us in respect of high front-end loading 
 commission. There are still a few small operators selling this form of product—and, frankly, this form of product is largely rubbish.
The real issue with master trusts is not the additional administration fees; the impact they have on end benefits is only a fraction of that of the management fee levied by the promoters in addition to the investment managed fees levied by the fund managers. Typically, fund managers charge between 0.5 and 0.6 per cent for wholesale funds, and up to 1.2 per cent for retail fund management. Master trust providers charge an additional one to two per cent. So it is not unusual for two per cent of the actual fund accumulated by the member to be levied each and every year, especially as many fund managers charge their retail, rather than their wholesale, rates in master trust investment funds.
What is the outcome of this? The document that I have had incorporated, as I have said, is a comparison between industry funds on average and three leading master trust providers—and the three leading master trust providers are Colonial, AMP balanced and Mercantile Mutual balanced. The comparison shows that a person earning $32,000 a year, contributing over a period of 41 years, with a declared return of six per cent under an industry fund would end up with a total balance of some $376,000. With Colonial balanced, the final balance would be $285,000; AMP, $295,000; and Mercantile Mutual, $287,000.
In other words, the comparison shows that in three what are reasonable, by any private industry standards, balanced	funds, with Colonial you would be $90,000 worse off at retirement, with AMP balanced you would be $80,000 worse off and with Mercantile Mutual you would be $87,000 worse off. That is, approximately one-quarter of your final retirement income is reduced as a consequence of being in what are not, frankly, unreasonable products, compared with what is the best product on the market—and that is an average industry fund.
This highlights the most significant problem that will emerge as a result of the govern 
 ment's so-called choice of superannuation model: it is deregulation of superannuation at the retail end of the market; it is deregulation in an environment where people will simply not have the product knowledge in order to make an informed choice. Competition, per se, is good, but competition is based on individuals having product knowledge. As I have already said in this debate, how on earth do the, at the very least, 2½ million people in this country who are either certainly illiterate but also functionally illiterate develop the product knowledge in order to make an informed choice and be better off? Labor disagrees with this government's proposed choice of fund model and I hope the amendments we put forward will be supported.(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1998-05-25,"—I rise in this debate on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998  to look at a number of issues. Before so doing I just want to look at the background against which this issue of choice is set. I think it is summed up very well in the evidence that was given before the Select Committee on Superannuation's inquiry on Thursday, 19 February 1998, in Sydney by two witnesses: Mr Rankin, the Executive Director of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia; and Mr Kenneth Lockery, Principal of Towers Perrin. Dealing firstly with Mr Rankin's evidence: he said:
. . . if choice is not properly exercised, there will be no net benefit to the individuals trying to accumulate savings for their retirement, and no benefit to the nation. If choice is poorly exercised, individuals and the nation will both be the losers. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that, without the capacity to make informed choices—that is, without addressing this asymmetry of information problem—people are likely to make poor choices. They will make choices which are either too conservative for their personal circumstances or too risky for their personal circumstances.
That is the very point that Senator Sherry has been making in this debate. The problem that we are confronted with is people making proper choices, not poorly exercised choices, choices that are either too conservative or too risky, but choices that will provide them with a net benefit. Clearly, the evidence of Mr Rankin throws real doubts upon this whole issue of choice. One could look further, at 
 what Mr Lockery of Towers Perrin said in response to the view that the government has taken on the issue of choice. This is what he said the government believes this will lead to:
. . . greater competition leading to improved investment returns and lower administrative costs.
Indeed, some members of smaller funds may achieve these benefits. On the other hand, we submit that such economic benefits will not be achieved for the vast majority of employees in large employer based or industry funds. Instead, in aggregate such employees are likely to suffer a net economic loss as a result of greater individual choice of superannuation funds.
Whilst they are two opinions, I believe those two opinions do sum up the problems facing this issue of choice of fund, because we see that choice not properly exercised will have no net benefit, and we find that—and this was reasonably well supported by evidence before the committee—greater competition will not provide improved returns, will not lower administration costs and, whilst some in smaller funds may benefit, the vast majority of people will have no net benefit whatsoever.
One must remember that superannuation is a retirement benefit and as such it must be worked to maximise the benefit for the employee. There is a misconception around that superannuation money is the employer's money, the insurance company's money, the bank's money or the fund manager's money, but it is by no stretch of the imagination any of theirs whatsoever. It is purely and simply the funds of the member and it should be maximised so that person can have a reasonable expectation of a reasonable retirement. There is an overriding moral obligation, I would put to you, for those entrusted with the money of the members of a fund to maximise that return and not to be frittering it away in the useless exercises which seem to be giving people, or pretend to be giving people, additional retirement benefits.
Choice is not, or should not be, about lining the pockets of some individuals or corporate entities. Choice must be informed. That was the key thing in the evidence that was presented to the committee at all stages: choice must be informed. Otherwise, we are going to end up with the British or Chilean experience, as outlined by Senator Sherry. I have real 
 doubts about, firstly, many people's ability to make an informed choice—I will come to that in a few moments—and, secondly, whether many people want to make an informed or real choice at all.
The ability to make an informed choice, as my colleague Senator Sherry alluded to, is very much governed by their capacity to interpret the data on the various funds that will be put before them in key feature statements. To that end I want to refer as well to the ABS survey, `Aspects of Literacy: Assessed Skill Levels Australia 1996', where there was a ranking of levels 1 to 5. That particular survey showed that some 2.6 million Australians were at level 1—that is, of very poor skills in terms of literacy and numeracy—and 47 per cent were at levels 1 and 2. That meant that there were some or considerable difficulties in using many of the printed materials encountered in daily life. If that is the case, one must have real doubts that many Australians will be able to make an informed choice.
It is interesting to look at opinion on the issue of the social costs of adequate literacy by looking at an article by Robyn Hartley on that very issue: `The Social Costs of Inadequate Literacy'—a report to an international literacy year symposium in 1989. On social costs, she says:
Even highly literate people have trouble understanding some documents and forms. Those with inadequate literacy skills have no chance of understanding them. Documents which are based on legislation often tend to be particularly obscure.
She goes on to say:
However, much still remains to be done. Re-design of forms may well help the majority of people, but those who cannot read will still be unable to cope without assistance.
That is the problem being confronted in this issue of choice of fund. Many of the people who will be called upon to make a choice of fund do not have the requisite skills to be able to read the literature to make an informed choice, so we have a major problem with the proposition that is being put forward in this legislation. Many people will not be so disposed to make a properly informed decision such that there will be a net benefit to them in the longer term, because we are not 
 just dealing with `choice' but with `informed choice'.
Whilst we have the international experience in the UK and Chile on the issue of choice of funds, we have no similar experience in Australia. But it is interesting to look at the issue of choice of investment where there is an opportunity under Australian law for members of superannuation funds—where a choice is made available to them—to so make a choice. I looked in particular at one company in Melbourne which had 1,400 to 1,500 employees. Over a five-month period they put their employees through sessions of up to one hour at a time. The employees were presented with very sophisticated communications techniques on the issue of choice of investment as opposed to choice of fund. At the end of a rather protracted period of time—as I said, five months—where there had been considerable employer cooperation and sponsorship, less than 25 per cent of employees made a choice of investment.
The reason that they made a choice of investment was that the older members at that particular site wanted to see their money invested in a more conservative investment—to be put into cash—whilst younger members went very much for more equity in their mix of investment. The remainder, 75 per cent, opted for the default fund because in that they saw there was a reasonable return for them.
Mrs Birkensleigh of Coopers and Lybrand gave evidence to the committee of choice of investment in a number of other funds. For example, in 1995 in the Hesta fund, a very substantial fund indeed, only 54 people out of 125 exercised choice. In First State Super, 10 per cent made a choice, according to Mrs Birkensleigh's evidence, while 90 per cent did not. In BOC Gases, 12 out of 2,000 made a choice of investment. Coca-Cola Amatil won the prize for the best communication program for employees on choice of investment. Coca-Cola Amatil's experience was that, even with a prize-winning communication program, only 64 per cent made a choice, so 36 per cent chose to remain with the default option in terms of investment. In Telstra, a more recent example, only two per cent out of 72,000 made a choice of investment, whilst in 1996 
 Optus ran an intensive campaign which saw some 75 to 80 per cent make a choice of investment.
In the limited experience with choice of investment, there seems to be no clamouring on the part of those people who are participating in funds out there now to want to make even a choice of investment, let alone be devilled with the option of having to choose a fund. On the contrary, the evidence that the inquiry received showed that 70 per cent of people would not want to make a choice at all, which is contrary to the belief that people are clamouring to make a choice of superannuation fund in which to invest their money.
If this legislation is to proceed there needs to be some  substantial amendments to take cognisance of the fact that, firstly, there is a literacy and numeracy problem and, secondly, there is not an overwhelming demand for choice of fund. Choice of fund cannot, of course, rely on a default fund which is simply low risk and low return; that ignores the moral obligation of the trustees of the fund to maximise the return because it is a retirement benefit for those people who are members of the fund.
Likewise, it cannot be a high risk product. So the quality of a default fund becomes most important in the issue of choice of fund. It seems to me that there needs to be some mechanism by which a middle of the road fund which meets the aspirations of most people is somehow the default fund, and in many instances that is the existing industry fund.
In the brief time that I have left I want to mention the issue of education. It seems to me that, if choice of fund is to proceed, education will be paramount. There is no doubt in my mind from the evidence that came before a select committee of the Senate that it cannot be a one-off, glossy campaign. It is not a hit and miss issue. If informed choice is to be made, then the material that is used needs to be appropriate to the varying educational needs of those targeted by the campaign. There is a general lack of awareness of superannuation in the marketplace. So any campaign needs to be not a flash in the pan, one-off campaign but an ongoing con 
 certed campaign. It needs to be directed not only at employees but also employers, particularly small business employers for whom I believe this will pose a number of concerns. They have enough on their plate trying to run their business.
The other group that we heard from during the inquiry could be broadly described as community employers, the likes of P&Cs at schools and some community organisations such as child-care centres, where the people serving on these P&Cs and community organisations serve for only a relatively short period of time and are not across the minutiae of superannuation legislation. There would need to be a specially constructed campaign to meet their needs. Whilst they are not a large group, they are nonetheless an important group. If the legislation is to be complied with, their needs must be met.
Without a proper program, I believe we will see misinformation flourishing. As misinformation flourishes, any purpose that may have been there in giving people the right to exercise choice will be defeated completely. Choice is about one thing: that is, providing people with a better benefit. It is not about a reduction in benefit. As I have already stated, there seems to be a degree of scepticism about the ability of choice of fund as opposed to choice of investment to provide people with a better return for their retirement.
The government should not proceed with choice, in my view, and in the view of those who participated in the inquiry, until it can be satisfied that, as per the non-government senators' report at page 93 on choice of fund, there is a substantial recognition of what choice of fund means and how it applies. This is a challenge in itself, because it means overcoming the literacy and numeracy problems that seem to be so deep and profound in the community. If this is not done properly, we will not have informed choice. The words that kept ringing in my ears throughout the whole of the inquiry was that people had to make an informed choice—not just choice but an informed choice.
If choice is not properly exercised, it will not be of benefit to anyone. The education 
 program needs to be well tested to allow an informed choice. Otherwise we will see people making a choice that is too conservative or too risky. There seems to be no real demand for choice, and that must be a mitigating factor in the final package that is delivered if choice is to be made available to people. There is not a clamouring out there in the community by a large number of people to be able to make a choice. The majority are not going to benefit, in my opinion, from the option of making a choice of fund. They are likely in many instances to face a net economic loss. The bill needs to be modified to protect the interests of the owners of superannuation money—that is, the fund members. Fund members are entitled to have an expectation that there will be a maximisation of the return on their investment for their retirement. They are entitled to a retirement in dignity.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,1998-05-25,"—The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998 —or the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 7 1997, as it was titled before it went before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee—includes a large number of unrelated taxation matters. Whilst, like others, I might be tempted to focus on the very important issue of choice of funds in superannuation, I am leaving those issues to my colleagues because I think it is equally important in the brief time I have in my speech during the second debate to deal with some of the other measures covered by this bill. In my speech I will be focusing on the restriction of choices in relation to anti-avoidance measures included in amendments to schedules 8 and 9 and the savings rebate scheme.
These tax measures beg the question of why are we proceeding with this bill in the climate of anticipation of the government's tax plan for the election; why are we proceeding now with these measures? It was put to the committee that it was a priority of the government to proceed with the issues relating to superannuation, but there were other options than to try to rush, as this government did—or, in Senator Murray's words, to squeeze—this process through the parliamentary process.
The other big question I will be focusing on in this speech is how effective will these anti-avoidance measures and the savings rebate scheme be, given the limited consideration that has occurred of the proposals in the bill. In fact, we have considered various amendments also, as it became obvious that the original framing was inadequate. If in our consideration there are still areas of serious concern, why proceed now? Why not wait until these measures can be incorporated into the wonderful tax plan that we are all anticipating will come from the government in the next few weeks?
I would like to refer to comments made by Labor members of the Economics Legislation Committee in their report on these issues. We said quite clearly that Labor senators considered that the whole process adopted regarding this bill reflected poorly on the government and, regrettably, on the Senate process. The report was brief because we had very limited opportunities to consider concerns raised by various parties. Labor senators noted in the report:
The government has engaged in an appalling process which involved rushed hearings and inadequate public consultation. The Assistant Treasurer released 49 amendments to the legislation at 4 p.m. on Friday, 27 March, in the full knowledge that the hearings on the legislation were scheduled for the following Monday morning. Not surprisingly, the witnesses were not adequately able to deal with the legislation and the amendments and the quality of evidence was compromised.
To attempt to overcome this disgraceful performance by the government, the Labor senators proposed to the Senate that the committee report in May. This motion was amended, by the government and the Democrats, to the current inadequate reporting schedule. However, this action by Labor at least ensured another day of hearings was facilitated on 3 April 1998. Incredibly, when this further hearing was held, witnesses to the committee still did not have the complete bill to provide evidence about. In addition, the witnesses had to deal with the untenable situation where the government had introduced further legislation, Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1998 , earlier in the week, which impacts on the operation of the 
 bill before the committee. Why is the government pushing through these initiatives when we are waiting for that very broad plan?
I reiterate that it reflects the management by the government of these tax bills, but it also reflects the management that the government is going to put in relation to the overall tax debate. Adopting Senator Murray's phrase, I think we will be looking at a squeeze on the GST, where it will be impossible to have a rational assessment of the overall proposals in an attempt to squeeze through an alternative measure. The government does not want to line up some of these measures before us now with the GST, so it is trying to push them through now.
Let me start with schedule 8, with respect to dividend streaming. Senator Cook, in his speech during this debate, has already addressed this issue and applied what I will call the Parer test of efficacy. Again, the big question is: how effective will these measures be? Senator Cook and I are awaiting the minister's response about whether these anti-avoidance measures will void the behaviour of the likes of Senator Parer in avoiding their obligations.
With respect to schedule 9, there are two areas I would like to comment on. The relevant amendments look at distributions from private companies. This area covers measures directed at $110 million over three years, according to the Treasurer, Peter Costello, in what he is calling tax rorts.
Senator Cook briefly touched on a concept called notional dividends, which are declared as shares not yet issued but disguised as non-taxable loans. Again, we have another Parer test. The really concerning thing about this Parer test arose in questioning before the Australian Taxation Office during the estimates process. The tax office indicated that they do not even understand the concept of notional dividends. If this is the case, the tax office has a fair bit of work to do in order to bring themselves up to speed if they are going to enforce this legislation and deal with practices in relation to these sorts of avoidance rorts. If these fairly blatant ones, which have become public through Senator Parer's behav 
 iour, cannot be dealt with, what are they going to do with the more complex cases?
I would appreciate the minister's views on the arrangement masterminded by Senator Parer on whether notional dividends disguised as shareholder loans will be caught by this legislation. If the minister is unable to provide an appropriate answer in his speech at the conclusion of the second reading debate, then I suggest that he should be prepared for the committee stage, where we will be seeking—in the more detailed discussions of the bill—an explanation as to how they would apply. We will not have very effective anti-avoidance measures if we are not able to pick up this sort of behaviour, but that also does not seem to concern the government greatly.
Another area in relation to schedule 9 that Senator Murray touched on was that of employee ownership schemes. Senator Murray had a concern—and it was raised in discussions in relation to the bill—that such schemes might be caught up in schedule 9. Whilst the Labor Party supports employee ownership schemes and incentives towards such schemes, we do not do so with respect to schemes that would operate at the expense of revenue. In other words, not all schemes are appropriate as employee ownership schemes. Again, the Parer test highlights the issue that, in some cases, employee ownership is really a fraud because it is not open to employees—it is only open to some very select employees who get a massive tax advantage.
Let us look at the QCMM (ESP) scheme and highlight the problem there. The employee share plan was, in essence, an executive remuneration scheme for Senator Parer and his fellow directors. Ralph Willis described such schemes—in response to Peter Costello's announcement that the then opposition would oppose a crackdown on such arrangements—as schemes designed to convert salary into shares or share rights in order to take advantage of the open-ended tax deferral opportunities.
As in the Parer case, three associated companies—QCMM Pty Ltd, AQRM Pty Ltd and Tremell Pty Ltd—collectively contributed $2.7 million to QCMM (ESP) Pty Ltd in 
 consideration of the issue of UNC employer class shares. However, the purchase of these shares was tax deductible, yet, in essence, no economic loss was borne by the companies involved. Parer and his fellow directors, in turn, subscribed for employee class shares—Senator Parer, employee class shares! QCMM (ESP) Pty Ltd paid to the value of 1c each. They then became entitled to the pool of $2.7 million, through the creation of employee contribution accounts, in proportion to the number of shares they had subscribed for. In Senator Parer's case, it was a total of 44 one cent shares.
The tax lurk is that the companies can immediately claim $2.7 million in tax deductions yet no tax is payable by any of the holders of the employee class shares until they redeem them with QCMM (ESP) Pty Ltd. This is where the unlimited tax deferral opportunity arose, and I am interested in how the minister will respond in relation to whether the proposed amendments will effectively deal with this sort of rort.
Lastly, I would like to look at the government's discredited savings rebate. This measure is so important to the government that we are only now debating it, one year after it was announced, and it is within a mixture of unrelated tax measures. The fact that we are debating it after the 1998-99 budget has been announced shows how important the government thinks it is. What we know, though, is that, far from making a contribution to national savings, it will actually lead to dissavings, thus Senator Cook's suggestion that it should be called the dissavings rebate.
When announced last year, it carried with it a $3.8 billion cost to revenue over three years. So before we see any contribution to national savings—again, the efficacy test—this $3.8 billion has to be made up through increased private sector savings. The cat was let out of the bag—although we had been saying it for some time—that to qualify for the savings rebate all you had to do was receive income outside of the PAYE system. As Annamaria Carey of the Taxation Institute stated:
The savings rebate in reality is a tax cut because income—not savings—is the sole criteria for the rebate.
So we have a tax cut before the government's income tax cuts that are meant to be coming. Why are we dealing with this now if this is meant to fit in with an overall tax reform? The answer is obviously that it is not genuine.
It is also significant that 74.5 per cent of all income generated in Australia is from salary and wages and therefore will not qualify for the rebate, as opposed to trusts and partnerships which comprise 7.4 per cent of all income and gross rent at 3.4 per cent. This means that the two top sources of income in Australia after salary and wages, which only comprise 10.8 per cent of all income generated in Australia, will qualify amongst other sources for the savings rebate. And, as we know, there are not too many battlers out there with partnerships and trusts, unless we are talking to the battlers from Brighton or the struggling families from Toorak.
But, as we know, this government—particularly half of its front bench—has put its trust in trusts. Who is at the epicentre of the trust owning members of the coalition? It is none other than Senator Parer. Who stands to gain from the savings rebate? Again, it is the Parer test. We have Parer, a battler, a struggler—he has remained in the ministry—and the very type of person that this government intends to benefit from the savings rebate! After all, there are hundreds of thousands of struggling Australian families out there with $60,000 just sitting in the bank earning five per cent interest, or $3,000, in order to qualify for the maximum rebate!
But the best part is that every beneficiary of the Parer family coal trust who receives $3,000 by way of suspect trust distribution—the things we are trying to avoid—will receive the full $450 rebate and, what is more, they do not even have to save it. Not a bad lurk, one might say. But, for Senator Parer and his like, this is par for the course or probably a bit at the low end of the tax minimisation scale. For some, paying tax has become an optional exercise and this government now subscribes to the Parer principle: 
 don't pay what you don't have to and, importantly, don't get caught.
We will continue to highlight the hypocrisy of this  government: it wants to impose a GST on battling Australian families yet is quite happy to allow or, I should say, assist the likes of Senator Parer to milk the system for what it is worth, regardless of the public cost. I therefore seek an explanation, again related to the Parer test, from the minister on how the mere distribution of moneys from a trust such as Senator Parer's contributes to national savings when the money is received by beneficiaries who do not even have to save it.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I have sat and listened with interest to Senator Collins's contribution but she continually addresses our colleague by his incorrect title. He is a senator and she is making some assertions that I do not believe are correct. Nevertheless, I am not going to take her up on that, but perhaps you might draw to her attention her inconsistencies in the way in which she addresses Senator Parer.
—On the point of order, I was not aware that Senator Collins was at any point directly addressing the minister, so I think it is a point of order that you should rule out of order.
—I do not think there is a point of order, but it is proper that the senator's proper title be used whenever it is appropriate. Senator Collins, I did hear you, on a couple of occasions, refer to the `Parer family trust', which I understand is the proper title of the trust, but I would remind you that if it is appropriate you should use the senator's full title.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Perhaps that gives me the note on which to conclude my remarks. I had indeed intended to be very careful when referring to Senator or Mr Parer to use his title, but, of course, I was counter-indicating that with what I have characterised as the Parer test. I will perhaps conclude my remarks with what was the final Parer test. I will be seeking an explanation from the 
 minister as to how the mere distribution of moneys from a trust such as Senator Parer's contributes to the national savings when the moneys received by the beneficiaries do not even have to be saved. I look forward to this explanation.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1998-05-25,"—In this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998 , I rise to speak mainly about the choice of fund question but also about the savings rebate—and possibly Senator Parer may also get a mention.
—Don't forget Mr Keating: he didn't send in two tax returns.
—He did not owe any money, Senator Calvert—he was owed money by the tax office. But let us stick to the topic, which is to do with superannuation. The context of the whole debate on choice of fund is: why was compulsory superannuation introduced in the early 1990s by the Labor government? It was introduced because this country had a national savings problem and it had a potential problem down the track of coping with the aging baby boomer generation. Those were the twin objectives; that is what superannuation was about. Probably the most malicious policies that have been followed by this government since it came to office have been in superannuation and they have been put in place on the surface to improve national savings and deal with these issues. But when you strip them down and actually have a look at them, you find that each of these proposals has actually sabotaged those aims and objectives.
First we saw RSAs—retirement savings accounts. If ever there was a crock, it is an RSA. If ever there was a payback to their mates who financed them in the last campaign—the  banks—it is RSAs. They are a low return product guaranteed to leave you hundreds and thousands of dollars worse off if you are a young worker and you are put into an RSA and you stick with it. There was no attempt to give what was known as a `health warning' to try to cap it so that if your RSA got to $10,000 you would be given real information by the supplier of that product. No, you could just sit there for your working 
 life and at the end of the day find yourself hundreds of thousands of dollars worse off.
—That even had visions on the pension.
—That is exactly right, Senator Campbell. Then we have as part of this bill today the savings rebate. This is a reverse Robin Hood mechanism; this is $4 billion of moneys that was going to go into ordinary workers' superannuation accounts. What did this government do? It came up with the savings rebate—it called it its `alternative vehicle' of delivery. That was its election promise: `we reserve the right—
—It was its debt truck.
—Exactly.
—Maybe it's the same vehicle.
—It could be the same vehicle, Senator Campbell. You saw $2 billion go immediately into consolidated revenue—back into the pocket of the government—and $2 billion to be given to the rich—those who already have the money; those who already have the savings. They do not need to save any extra. They can actually dissave and receive the savings rebate.
We saw the surcharge. Ordinary workers' superannuation funds paying; their returns reduced because of the extra administrative costs introduced by this government—reducing the returns to funds and the retirement incomes of ordinary working Australians. Again, coming up soon to the Senate we have superannuation to be taken out as an industrial matter—an attempt by the government to again reduce the impact on national savings. As shown in information given to the Senate Committee on Superannuation by the Institute of Actuaries, if you move from the award obligation of monthly payments to the minimum SGC requirement of annual payments you are, on average, three to four per cent worse off just by the stroke of a pen—that is $20,000 to $30,000 worse off at the end of your working life just because the government have a fixation. That is less national savings yet again.
And now we have choice of fund. After all this time you might begin to ponder why the government is actually pursuing this policy. Mr Miles, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, when introducing the first of the backgrounds on this bill, which was the implementation date, said, and I am quoting from Hansard:
It is clear that the opposition amendments are all about denying Australian workers the choice of superannuation funds. This really is the Labor Party's agenda, similar to what the agenda was many years ago when these other funds—
other funds—
which the Labor Party set up came in.
That is what this really is about. This is about a mean spirited, ignorant understanding and an attack on industry funds.
What sort of national policy premise is the vindictive approach of this coalition—an approach to undermine and destroy industry funds? That is what it is all about. Mr Miles is the one who has finally let the cat out of the bag. We all knew it in here. We have talked about it before. That is what it is about: the Labor Party's other agenda. I would like to talk about that other agenda item, industry funds. Since their inception in the early 1980s, industry funds have provided for rapid and sustained reductions in costs to their membership. In that time weekly admin fees have fallen from an average of $4 to less than $1 today. These charges compare most favourably with those imposed by banks on, for example, their business transactions. According to Christopher Butler, managing director of Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, in the Financial Review dated 9 January 1998, page 19, the average charges for non-profit industry and corporate funds are half the average of those funds that are in the market for profit—half of the profit. I plead guilty to that agenda. We have halved the costs in that area alone in the few years since industry funds were created. I plead guilty to that agenda any day of the week.
The most significant improvements in service delivery are the adoption of member protection of small account balances, the administration of the extremely complex `surcharge' arrangements and the implementa 
 tion of member investment choice within the one fund. That is right; industry funds are at the cutting edge of member investment—not holding back, trying to keep members' funds. Fund asset management charges have been halved, from 0.6 per cent of assets under management to about 0.3 per cent today. Industry funds have introduced bulk death and invalidity insurance, and they have also provided these at about half the cost of the same retail insurance product. Half the management fees gone and half those on death and disability gone. I will plead guilty to that any day of the week, because that is what industry funds have done.
Before Senator Kemp comes into the chamber and says, `But, Senator Conroy, you have not mentioned where you used to work,' I proudly state that I used to work for an industry fund, the TWU superannuation fund. I am absolutely proud to declare that I have been a part of reducing those charges. `What about returns?' you might say. `Those industry funds run by unions must be not delivering to their members in terms of investment returns.' At the same time industry funds have credited members with investment returns in excess of 10 per cent on average each year since their inception. This demonstrates that industry funds have delivered superior returns to their membership by comparison to other super vehicles. The AMPs and the National Mutuals have not been able to deliver that sort of return. National Mutual practically went broke and gave $100 million to John Elliott to go and play with in a little frolic with Elders.
—AMP is too busy turning itself into a bank.
—Exactly, Senator Campbell—a bank. So what we have seen is a vicious attack by this government on workers' retirement incomes because it is paranoid about industry funds. It does not matter that these funds have improved national savings; it does not matter that they pay out hundreds of thousands of dollars back into retirement incomes; it does not matter that they have introduced competition—what the government says it is about here today. 
 Industry funds are the competition in this issue.
But who has asked for choice? Have employees asked for choice? Have employers asked for choice? The answer is no. There is no demand for choice, except from one sector. No prizes: banks and life insurance offices.
—The finance sector.
—The finance sector. Exactly. No prizes for guessing. That is who has been after them. This legislation about choice is not employee choice. It is not the choice of the person who owns the money. This legislation gives employer choice. You may think, because it is called choice of fund, that in actual fact employees are going to get to choose their fund. Well, they are not; they are quite specifically not. It is their money but, despite the deception of the name of this bill, they are still not going to get choice of fund.
Probably the most vital question, though, that has to be dealt with by the chamber and by the government is the question of an informed choice. There was not one witness, not even the government itself, that was prepared to say, `We don't want informed choice.' That is the nub of the argument if this legislation gets passed in its current form: informed choice. We have got a situation where this choice is going to have onerous administrative costs and possible legal action down the track. It has attempted to take away some of the liability. Whether that is able to be achieved is still a matter of some discussion. There was plenty of evidence before the committee that it was not going to be able to take away the liability. Even the government admitted that there is still the common law. There are legal aspects that cannot be legislated away.
The government have failed on all counts on this bill to deliver to Australian workers. Choice will not lower the costs. Probably the biggest furphy in this debate is a claim that choice, through their competitive process, will lower the costs to ordinary Australian workers. We had the Commonwealth Bank come before us and I asked them, `After choice has been introduced, the winds of competition, 
 can you guarantee me that your RSA product will be one cent cheaper in one year's time than it is today?' They had to say that no, they could not. The banks could not even promise that an RSA would be cheaper after the winds of competition have swept through.
Who is benefiting, then? It is certainly not the workers. It is the competition that we introduced that has forced down the costs—not the bogus competition that this government are introducing.
—Real competition.
—Real competition. We introduced it into this area, not the government. Many of the submissions illustrated to us the increased costs, especially in marketing. There is no question that marketing is going to have to massively increase. One industry fund said to me that they are going to have to double their admin budget just to cope with the possible marketing extras. They are going to be up against the AMPs and the National Mutuals and all the TV advertising, and they are still going to be competing. I have got a prediction for the government and their narrow-minded agenda here: not only will industry funds survive choice but they will prosper. Down the track, when the government sits back and thinks, `How much damage have we done to industry funds?', they are going to say, `We have failed.' Industry funds will grow under this legislation. Industry funds are not afraid of this legislation. Industry funds are happy with choice, but they want employee choice, not employer choice.
The government's model increases costs. It sees employees possibly forced into expensive entry management and exit fee regimes. That is what the choice is here. You could see employees forced into funds, especially new employees, that in actual fact are far more expensive with lower returns. And they do not have to be in RSA. We have already had Senator Sherry give us some excellent examples, tabled in the chamber, of how much more expensive, with poorer returns, master trusts can be. One example that I have, based on an eight per cent return and a range of other figures, is that you can be, over your 
 working life, $30,000 worse off again by being forced into a master super trust instead of your industry fund. Another $30,000 of national savings gone, of a worker's retirement income gone, just because the government want to be narrow-minded.
We will be asking Senator Kemp or Senator Ellison, if he is here for the committee stage, some questions about the education campaign. If the government is really fair dinkum about this bill, they will tell us what sort of budget they are looking at—what sort of education campaign. We introduced what at the time was the biggest change in superannuation in years, in the early 1990s, and we spent about $14 million on the money tree campaigns. There were a couple of them. Most people would remember them nowadays—the little growing money tree you saw on telly. That was a national campaign, on prime-time television, just to educate people that compulsory superannuation was coming. It was the most basic of concepts. But this shake-up we are seeing is even bigger. If you looked at our campaign in the early 1990s, which in today's dollars was probably about $16 million or $17 million, you would think that this was a bigger change and that you would therefore need a bigger campaign. What have we seen so far from this government? Four million dollars. You could not run any decent sort of advertising campaign anywhere with $4 million on even the simplest of concepts.
This government is not fair dinkum about this issue. Key feature statements are probably the most critical part. Where is the government at on key feature statements? We had all sorts of evidence, some of which has been referred to—the literacy question, for example. Forty per cent of people cannot even read a bus timetable.
—Thirty.
—They are going to be handed, by their employer, up to six pages of a key feature statement from four different funds.
Senator Calvert interjecting—
—Those are the facts, Senator Calvert. It is horrifying but true. And you are going to give them six pages times 
 four of detailed financial information to compare. These are ABS statistics. These are not made up, these are the facts. These are what you do not want to look at.
You have a situation where, with calling number display, you are prepared to say, `If 75 per cent of the community do not understand the implications of calling number display, then we will not do it.' Are you fair dinkum about this education campaign? If you go out there and test your education campaign, and still 50 or 60 per cent of the people do not understand the choice they are going to have to make, are you prepared to not introduce choice until enough people understand so that they cannot do themselves long-term damage? Are you prepared to do that? Those are the questions you are going to have to answer when we get to the committee stage.
I could go on extensively but I am running out of time and I did want to get to the savings rebate. As has already been mentioned, the great lie of the savings rebate is that it will improve national savings. It will not. Why do I say it will not? Because Ted Evans, the Secretary to the Treasury, has admitted it will not. He has admitted that it is possible to obtain the full rebate if you have not only not increased your savings but also if you have decreased your savings. You still get the rebate. How can you justify, on equity grounds or even economic efficiency grounds, a rebate that is completely contrary to your policy, on the admission of your senior bureaucrat?
In my last minute I would like to turn to an article in the `Smart Money' section of the Financial Review on 2 May 1998. The heading is `Rebate can be milked for more'. The report is by Alison Kahler and it reads:
At first glance, $225 seems a trifling amount but the new savings rebate can be milked for much more. Conceivably, a family of four with a sufficient income flow could receive a total rebate of $900—without saving a cent.
Income—not savings—is the sole criteria for the rebate, according to Annamaria Carey of the Taxation Institute of Australia.
`In reality, the savings rebate is a tax cut for any income generated outside of wages and salary. If you receive rental income, for example, you qualify 
 for the rebate. The income does not have to be saved, just received,' she says.
Carey says the income can come from just about any source, including bank accounts, share dividends, trust distributions, partnerships or business interests and contract or consulting work.
After-tax superannuation contributions also count towards the rebate, as do some pensions . . .
(Time expired) ",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1998-05-25,"—The  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) has a number of components, and I would primarily like to comment on the choice of superannuation fund and the savings rebate provisions in the bill. There has been a continual call from the Greens to ensure a greater level of choice in obligatory retirement savings schemes. The Greens WA believe that choice, in principle, is a worthy goal that allows consumers to identify and promote their individual interest. It allows them to have control and ownership of their investments and to choose to support investment companies that are in line with their own financial or ethical interests.
Choice gives credence to different values, priorities and ideas. Choice is a great concept in theory. In reality, the choice scheme presented by the government comes with a whole lot of problems for consumers, employers and fund providers. In reality, the problems are so significant that it is dubious that there will be an overall positive outcome for this regime.
Before I launch into a discussion of the bill at hand, I would like to make a point that I have made many times before. There has been a call from the Greens to recognise that obligatory investment programs, such as compulsory superannuation or RSAs, are not necessarily the best investment vehicle for workers. We have continually pointed out that investment in such things as a small business or a home may provide more substantial and far reaching benefits. This goes beyond the direct benefits as financial investments and recognises that there may be substantial or ongoing human benefits in terms of use value of such investments and, in the case of investment in small business, ensuring the capacity of older people to continue working.
Getting back to the bill, there is a plethora of extremely worrying issues in relation to the issue of choice in superannuation funds. The government's approach is haphazard, inconsistent and ideological, and it fails to recognise the realities of the superannuation marketplace. The government has been claiming it has been doing a wondrous thing for Australia's citizens by providing them with choice in their superannuation funds. The reality is less than wondrous.
Firstly, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation received a substantial amount of evidence indicating that employees were not especially interested in choice, nor were they equipped to handle it. The government's push for choice seemed largely based on an ideology that sees liberty as paramount in all circumstances, rather than on a genuine pragmatic interest in responding to community desires.
Secondly, the regime provided is significantly substandard. What they have really provided is a regime that offers employers choice. Employers are the ones that choose what range of choice they will offer their employees. Employers will benevolently decide to offer unlimited choice, and employers will still have the power of veto over their employees' choices. To rub salt in the wound, there is no independent arbiter to whom the employee can appeal.
It is a regime that leaves underinformed consumers with an uphill battle to understand the differences in funds. It is a regime that diminishes the longstanding union involvement that has protected union rights. It is a regime that gives consumers few opportunities to gain redress if funds are sold for the wrong reasons. It is a regime that increases compliance for employers, and marketing costs for fund holders. It is interesting that this government, which calls welfare beneficiaries `customers', seems to think that the customers of superannuation do not have the right to have some accountability in what has been happening.
It is a regime that may not actually usher in real investment choice. A choice of four different funds does not necessarily translate into four substantially different investment 
 choices. The focus of choice is not on which financial institutions can make similar investments but on the choice of investment targets. It is a regime that does not consider or accommodate people who may want to invest ethically or locally. Despite all these problems, it is a system that, until a short time ago, the government was attempting to rush through parliament before 1 July 1998.
Let us look at real choice. The crux of offering real choice, we believe, could be seen as threefold. Firstly, real choice offers the ability for employees to choose substantially different funds. The funds must provide the ability to choose the level of risk and growth, the locality of the investment—it could be off-shore or in Australia, and it could be regional—or the type of investment, ethical or otherwise.
The Greens WA have continued to call for options that support the Australian economy and employment within an ethical context. We have frequently pursued options within superannuation funds for investment in locally or regionally owned small or medium business; ecologically sustainable investment; non-military oriented, peaceful investment; investment that does not exploit people from developing nations; or options which do not force individuals to invest in industries that they believe are unethical—because my ethics may not be the same as everybody else's, and in fact I am sure they will not be.
Secondly, real choice requires comprehensive education so that each individual can determine what their interests are and which fund matches those interests most closely. Thirdly, real choice involves uniform disclosure among competing funds. Consumers must be able to accurately and confidently distinguish between the products offered. Associated with education and disclosure is the notion that real choice involves the absence of unrelated influencing factors. The lure of a kickback for an employer or the promise of a get-rich-quick scheme by rascally commission agents should not be considerations. It is broadly agreed that education and uniform disclosure standards are crucial.
These suggestions have been coming from a whole range of participants in the industry. 
 Yet the government plans to make this change without ensuring or providing the resources for education, as Senator Conroy has mentioned. The resources are downright inadequate to provide clear and easily accessible information on which to base decisions. The Australian Consumers Association has estimated, by looking at the budget of the Australian Taxation Office, that the government has allocated the hearty sum of $1.60 per fund member, to be spent over four years. Whoopee!
The decision about which super fund to invest in is, for many people, perhaps the most significant investment in their lives, and the government gives them that princely sum to find out what they are doing. Without adequate resources, even the most creative education campaign cannot operate effectively. The government's pledge of $12 million over four years is judged to be hopelessly deficient on all fronts.
The Greens WA applaud the deferral of the operation of the choice provisions in the bill. The deferral was ostensibly necessary for a proper education campaign to occur. The government, however, did not indicate that they would defer the starting date for such substantive reasons. Their commitment to proper education, therefore, is questionable. The deferral was actually out of necessity, because the legislation was slow in moving through the parliament.
The other fundamental prerequisite for real consumer choice is the establishment of uniform and comparable disclosure requirements. The committee report extensively outlines the need for clear information that is easily digestible and allows consumers to make accurate comparisons between different options. Simple and meaningful key features need to be in a standard format to enable rational and accurate comparisons. The Greens acknowledge that the government is working on this aspect, and we will be keen to scrutinise the regulations.
Let us go to the default fund. The government's treatment of the default fund shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the superannuation marketplace. There is a fundamental refusal to accept the realities of the willing 
 ness, or lack thereof, of the community to take an interest in superannuation. The government has provided that the default fund can be any fund that the employer chooses. There is a fundamental refusal to accept that there are risks involved in leaving this choice to employers. Those people who do not think that coercion exists in the workplace are naive in the extreme.
Let us look for a moment at the inconsistent reasoning behind this whole issue. Let us look at the reason that Australia has decided to have a compulsory superannuation scheme in the first place. The very first point that comes to mind is demographics. It raises a good question: why did this happen? I guess partly it was because Labor did not want to look at what was necessary to provide properly funded pensions, but one fundamental reason is possibly that they thought it was impossible to rely on all Australians to make long-term financial decisions in their own interests.
Of course, on a deeper, structural level, compulsory superannuation was introduced to ensure that government could reduce its obligation in respect of older people on a per capita basis. It is a crucial step on the road to dismantling and stigmatising the universal pension. It fits very neatly with the economic fundamentalist philosophy of absolving governments from all responsibility to maintain equitable living standards for all Australians throughout their lives.
Where there is a compulsory superannuation scheme in place, there will always be a certain number of people who will not actively choose a super fund. Regardless of the amount of education that is offered by the government, there will always be a certain percentage of people who will not investigate which super fund will best meet their needs. It may be for reasons of financial illiteracy or because it is not an issue that they care to turn their minds to, but realistically there will always be this percentage. Indeed, this has been the experience in state schemes in New South Wales and Queensland offering choice, and where choice has been offered between funds. The government, however, has a naive belief that its education campaign can overcome all apathy or ignorance in the communi 
 ty. Clearly this is at odds with reality and experience.
When the reality of apathy is taken into account, the default fund becomes a crucial and important instrument. The employees who do not actively choose a super fund will be left to the whim of what the employer chooses. Granted, this may not always be a bad thing: some employers may choose very good funds to have as default funds. However, this is not assured. On a most conservative calculation, if only one per cent of the work force end up in bad default funds and they lose only $20,000 each, this will total a loss of $2 billion. This possibility does not seem to concern the government.
A major concern is that employers are not subject to any legal action if they fail to act prudently. Employees effectively have no legal redress for negligent decisions by employers. The government has stripped the AIRC of its power to arbitrate on superannuation matters, and the constitutionality of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is questionable. Employers will have a distinct incentive to go with the fund that offers the lowest rate of compliance cost or some kind of kickback. There is a clear need for an impartial dispute resolutions body in light of the introduction of the high level of discretion for employers.
The Greens (WA) support the committee's view that minimum requirements should be applied to default funds to ensure their integrity. Such requirements are not especially burdensome as many funds worth their salt would comply with the minimum standards anyway. In addition, the Greens (WA) see merit in determining the default fund by reference to the relevant industrial award where that is applicable.
As I have made clear on previous occasions, I clearly reject the right of an employer to influence in any way the membership of an employee in a retirement savings account. There are clear drawbacks to these accounts. They have no minimal control of some group at least theoretically representing their contributors. RSAs represent investment that is not transparent and which is determined by banks.
Investment in the banking sector is open to international players. Increasingly, even those banks whose character is presented as `Australian' have substantial investments, including ownership of banks, abroad. Ownership of foreign banks often entails a management structure where foreign interests are directly represented and funds are freely transferred and invested in any nation, and assets collected in this nation may be lent in any nation. The interests of management in such banks may be totally divorced from the interests of Australia, Australian investors, Australian industry or the Australian economy. The Greens will be supporting measures to ensure that incentives to commission agents and any kickbacks to employers are prohibited.
The legislation seeks to strip superannuation of its status as an industrial relations issue. Significant superannuation gains have been made by unions through both the judicial and legislative process. The industrial setting of superannuation is currently manifested by union representation on industry funds and superannuation clauses in awards. This bill effectively removes superannuation clauses from industrial awards and establishes super as an issue for direct determination between an employer and an employee. Any kind of collective decision making for superannuation arrangements will be watered down significantly. The expertise built up by unions and their important role in consumer protection will be largely lost.
I believe the industry funds have been sensible, secure and valuable investment funds for members in the past. Many of the industry funds already provide choices to employees regarding how their funds are invested. The presence of the unions has meant that many workers have had a strong and informed voice to advocate for consumer benefits on their behalf. In addition, many industry funds were able to keep administrative fees low by economies of scale and minimal marketing.
The proposed choice regime is supposed to provide, as indicated in the minister's second reading speech on the bill, `greater choice and control over their superannuation savings'. As outlined, there is no assurance it will provide 
 choice, and whether it will provide control is highly questionable when many employees have little education or expertise in investment funds.
This industrial relations change is a significant change that should not be lightly dismissed. I notice the Democrats and the ALP have recognised this significance: their respective positions on this issue both attempt to ensure that superannuation remains within the award system. This, we believe, is a valuable goal. The issue for the Greens is going to be whether or not the issues of choice within this bill and within these schemes are realised; so we have a dilemma and we are still listening to the debate as it goes on.
This change is indicative of a broader government plan that undermines unions and other longstanding institutions that were formed to address systematic inequalities of wealth and power. We have the work for the dole scheme and its transfer-the-problem-to-the-individual musical theme of `search for the hero inside yourself'; so if you do not have a job, it is your fault because you have not looked for that hero far enough inside yourself.
The problem comes down to putting the finger on making people feel bad about being recipients of welfare. There are a lot of issues here tied up in these kinds of things about whether or not people have the right to continue to be involved with industry funds, but there is also the issue of whether or not these industry funds can offer the real range of ethical choices that exist.
The savings rebate—or the `tax offset' as it is referred to—is totally inappropriate in the context of the government cutting the services and benefits for the most disadvantaged in our society. It does not even come close to ameliorating the wads of funding the Treasurer has slashed in the last few budgets. The savings rebate is a replacement of the Keating-Willis superannuation contribution matching where the government could match employee contributions. As we pointed out at the time, that scheme had major problems as it used taxpayers' money collected from all to fund retirement incomes on the basis that 
 those who have more shall receive more and those who have less shall receive less. It amplified and extended the imbalances in working life into retirement.
Despite this fundamental inequity, the Keating-Willis plan was worth nearly seven times the benefit of this Costello rebate. The rebate promises a maximum of 15c in the dollar, as opposed to a superannuation contribution that was matched dollar for dollar—thus there is an 85 per cent reduction in benefit. Worker contributions of $1,000 would have gained an extra $1,000 under the Keating-Willis plan. Under the Costello plan, they receive a princely $150.
The savings rebate is typical of the kind of smoke and mirrors approach the government tries to use when it is trying to sell an inequitable measure as a positive for all. For the savings rebate to be characterised as a benefit for all, certain assumptions must be made. There must be an assumption that everyone is financially capable of making superannuation contributions, or that everyone has sufficient savings or investment income to be able to take advantage of the rebate. Clearly, these assumptions bear no resemblance to reality.
Low wage earners and social security recipients spend a high proportion of their income on basic necessities and have a limited capacity to save. Even if these people could save, the level of savings would not enable them to take full advantage of the rebate. They would have to contribute $3,000 per annum to superannuation or save between $50,000 and $100,000 in other savings vehicles to receive the full $450 rebate each year. The main beneficiaries of this rebate are high income earners and wealthy retirees. It is not a progressive measure.
With respect to payment of PAYE, PPS, RPS and so on to the Australian Taxation Office, this bill requires remittances by electronic means. The government has created a curious situation. While an attempt to rationalise and streamline the system of remittance is positive, negative and unfair implications have been ignored. The government has obviously turned a blind eye to the implications that the change has for business. Forwarding payments by cheque has previous 
 ly been a perfectly legitimate form of commercial transaction in this country. Now it is not even an option for large remitters. Beyond the expensive and time consuming compliance measures that businesses are faced with, it will be an offence, and there will be a penalty, for failing to pay electronically. These fines are downright unfair and misguided. They are not aimed at what they are trying to prevent—that is, stopping large payers from deferring payment because a cheque is not cleared for some days.
All in all, I think there are some major problems. The situation that has been presented to us is clearly unacceptable and unfair. It is another example of the government turning a relatively simple concept into a dog's dinner. The bill is a disaster. Nearly every aspect contains anomalies and injustices. This is not a bill to be proud of. It is an embarrassing bill that has wasted a lot of people's valuable time and energy.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1998-05-25,"—My remarks on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998  will go mainly to the question of the choice of fund provisions contained in the bill. In the short time available to me this evening, I would like to make some comments on that issue and I will also make some comments during the committee stage of the bill.
It is important to say at the outset that superannuation in Australia is compulsory and the Australian population is ageing. So superannuation is a particularly important issue, and it is particularly important that parliament deals with it very seriously and provides not only good laws in terms of superannuation but also clear policy that allows people to have confidence in the superannuation system and to plan for their retirement in a secure environment.
The shemozzle that we have seen in relation to the government's plans for choice has worked against confidence in the superannuation system in Australia and has provided people with reasons to be concerned about the future of the superannuation industry and about their retirement income. I think that is unfortunate. The government's decision to defer some of the measures proposed in terms 
 of choice is a good one, but it would have been much better if, in doing so, the government had dealt with a range of other concerns—some of which I will allude to tonight—that have been raised by people in Australia involved in the industry.
I think it would be a good thing if the national superannuation policy encouraged real choice so that people could choose investments which were as secure and as rewarding as possible so as to provide them with the best possible retirement income. It is very hard for anyone to oppose the principle of choice, but when you try to implement the principle it is much more difficult to ensure that you give effect to the very laudable motives that it represents.
The government is very keen on the theory of competition, which will make for lower prices in superannuation and greater efficiency. It says, `If you give choice, the market will apply those pressures and we'll all be better off as a result.' I think that is far too simplistic a notion. It does not take account of a range of issues like the costs of advertising and other competition costs that will be built into profit margins. The government really has to make the case for its model to prove that it is more efficient and that competition will deliver some of the things that the government claims. I do not think the government has made that case out.
We in the Labor Party think that a good superannuation policy should be based on a range of key principles. They include: availability to all workers; real choice through education, freedom from employer pressure, and dispute resolution; secure, higher returns; and administrative simplicity. When you apply those sorts of criteria to the government's proposal in this bill, it really fails the test. What the Labor Party has been arguing for in recent months provides sounder principles on which to build a choice regime in Australian superannuation policy and, obviously, we will be seeking support for amendments to reflect what we think is a sounder basis for a choice regime.
Tonight I will not have time to cover all of the issues I would like to in this debate, and obviously we will do that in the committee 
 stage. However, the first thing I would say is that this bill ought to deliver a real choice of products to people who are on superannuation in Australia and that the government would have been better off taking an evolutionary, rather than a revolutionary, approach in dealing with this policy.
I believe that requiring choice internal to funds would have been a better first step. It would have allowed for a more gradual introduction of a choice regime which, in turn, would allow for education and for monitoring of the take-up and the experiences of providing choice to people. As I say, I believe an evolutionary approach rather than a revolutionary approach would have been a far sounder way of dealing with this very major change to superannuation in this country.
As we have seen in the international experience, competition and the opening up of superannuation do not necessarily lead to the sorts of outcomes that we all think are desirable. You only have to look at the British or Chilean experience to know that there are real pitfalls in this area if we do not proceed with caution. So, while one can agree with the theory and the principle of choice, one does have to take very responsible attitude to the implementation of that theory. I believe that the government has allowed its ideology to override proper, sound principles and caution in the development of the choice regime.
One of the real ironies of this whole thing is that the government's proposition, as it has finally evolved, gives most of the choice to the employer. The employee does not enjoy the widest choice available; in fact, they get to choose between schemes offered by their employer, schemes chosen by their employer. So this is very much a question of employer choice as much as employee choice. That is the government's reaction to the very real difficulties of providing unlimited choices.
No-one pretends that there are not real administrative and other difficulties associated with providing an open choice of any fund to any employee. But the government, in responding to that difficulty, has very much taken the availability of choice away from employees and put that choice in the hands of 
 employers. That is of great concern because I think it gives too much ability to the employers to apply pressure to employees, and it upsets the balance that I believe should be established in terms of the choice regime.
Coming from Western Australia as I do, I have seen this choice theory applied in industrial relations by the Western Australian state government. The experience there has been that a regime of offering choice in terms of award or workplace agreements to employees has, in fact, now seen the state government implementing a system where they only provide the choice of workplace agreements to new starters. The choice that supposedly surrounded the rhetoric of the new industrial relations regime has been replaced by conditions that remove any choice of the employee. So I am a bit cynical about the Liberal Party's attitude and understanding of choice. As I say, the industrial relations experience in Western Australia means that that has given power to the employer rather than the employees. I believe that that is a real concern also in this area of superannuation.
There is also the question about prevention of the pressure on employees from sorts of high pressure sales techniques. One of the good things about the development of superannuation in this country over the last 10 years is that a lot of those practices that were evident in the personal superannuation and life insurance area 15 to 20 years ago have gone. The complaints you used to get about people buying products they did not want, the lack of understanding by people purchasing products not delivering what they thought they would deliver—all of those complaints about insurance sales and superannuation sales—have not been eradicated totally but have been greatly diminished as the superannuation regime and proper accountability measures have been put in place by this parliament.
I very much worry about what this choice regime will do in terms of the reintroduction of commissioned selling agents and the pressure for people to go out and sell various schemes in competition with other schemes. We should be very concerned that we do not take a backwards step to the days where that sort of pressure, manipulation and coercion 
 really hurt people in very serious ways and resulted in people making very poor choices about their financial affairs, as I say, in terms of superannuation and insurance.
That leads me to a whole range of issues like education—which has been talked about by other speakers and which is obviously very important—about disclosure and the need for the key feature statements to be a key part of any regime. The government still has not provided satisfactory progress on the key feature statements, in my view and in the view of a number of senior commentators in the financial area. That is a very important part of any regime of choice—that people are able to make an informed decision between various products and have standard reporting of fees and conditions. That is not, I think, satisfactorily in place at this stage.
There is a range of other issues, which we will debate in the committee stage, regarding the likelihood of employees choosing the appropriate investments. The theory that people will necessarily choose the best investment option for themselves is, I think, not supported in practice. My own personal experience of trying to encourage people in a fund that I had some responsibility for was that they often took very conservative choices—particularly women—which did not result in their getting the best benefit at the end of their time. These are serious issues that will impact on people's retirement incomes and lifestyles; they will affect the whole Australian community.
So there is a whole range of issues that I believe really needs to be taken much more seriously by the government and the parliament. The fiasco regarding the timing of the introduction of the choice and the concern about the government failing to respond to industry criticisms have led to a sapping of confidence in superannuation and a confusion about where we are going. The government really has to step back from its sort of neo-liberal idea of choice at all costs and work with the parliament and the industry to have a much more constructive outcome than the one it currently proposes.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1998-05-25,"—I wish to speak on just one aspect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998  tonight and that is the schedule dealing with superannuation choice. This aspect of the bill has been the subject of a comprehensive Senate inquiry and in the course of that inquiry I think there were some very substantial holes identified in the government's choice policy provisions.
The government has claimed that its choice policy will increase competitiveness and efficiency in the superannuation industry and lead to improved returns on superannuation savings. However, the evidence to the committee put this claim into some considerable doubt. The simple problem is that it is unlikely that the vast majority of workers are in a position to make an educated or informed choice on superannuation or, I suggest, are actually interested in doing so. Evidence from the United States suggests that workers are very risk averse in respect of superannuation and often opt for low risk profiles, with the result that their final returns are reduced considerably.
The choice proposal also opens up the compulsory award based super system to competition from the commercial funds like the AMP, National Mutual, MLC and such like. These funds carry considerably higher administration costs than the award based industry funds because of the need to advertise and to build up market share. The superannuation committee heard evidence that industry fund admin costs were up to 80 per cent lower than that of commercial funds, particularly when commissions, marketing and exit fees were taken into account.
The choice regime will also add quite considerably to competition costs of the superannuation system because of the need for funds to handle what could be frequent transfers between funds. Certainly this has been the experience in Britain and Chile where choice regimes have been introduced. In short, I think that the government has failed to make out a compelling case that their choice arrangements will reduce costs or add to industry efficiency. I think in fact the exact opposite will occur.
So that leaves the argument that competition will increase returns to members. That assumes that members want to choose higher risk funds to get higher returns. The risk averse nature of workers with low levels of knowledge of superannuation is in fact likely to see returns reduced over time compared with leaving the decision on risk return balances to trustees.
But the government also downplays the level of competition already existing in the superannuation industry. We know that trustees are forcing fund managers to compete intensely in their investment returns. Investment managers that fail to shape up are very likely to be replaced quite quickly and fund administrators who fail to deliver low costs are also likely to be moved on.
The trustees in pursuit of their onerous trustee obligations are expected to keep these issues under constant review, and experience suggests that they certainly do that. The evidence tends to suggest that, as a result of the intense competition at the finance management level, industry funds are delivering average rates of return at least comparable with the commercial funds. And when you take into account the low fee structure, the overall result is one where the industry funds on average are delivering better retirement income outcomes over time than most commercial funds.
The real attraction of having competition at the fund management level rather than the fund level is that the trustees are in a position to make a fully informed decision on investment returns and risk profiles. Few fund members would be in command of as much independent advice, knowledge and experience as their fund trustees. The trustees are acting in the interests of the members. So again I doubt that the benefits of competition on returns will on average deliver a better result for the vast majority of workers than existing arrangements. An article by Beth Quinlivian in Personal Investment magazine recently concluded that the low fee nature of industry super funds would result in a final super payout $100,000 higher than the average master trust fund. That is the sort of 
 outcome which is at risk from the government's choice model proposal.
There is a further flaw in the government's plan, which rests on the removal of award clauses on superannuation as a condition for their scheme to operate. With the demise of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, the removal of superannuation as an allowable award matter would also prevent the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from determining disputes about superannuation. So there would be nowhere other than the courts to which workers could take a dispute about superannuation and, given that superannuation became universal only as a result of industrial disputes and given the enormous power over the nature of choice offered that this bill gives to employers, I do not believe that it is good policy not to provide for an effective dispute resolution mechanism.
Superannuation is part of remuneration. Remuneration is at the heart of industrial relations, a decision which was confirmed by several High Court cases. To deny workers access to dispute resolution on a key aspect of remuneration is quite clearly contrary to the intention of industrial laws in this country. Yet without deleting award clauses, the government's choice regime cannot operate. I think that is a most unsatisfactory policy outcome.
So, in short, after careful analysis the Democrats have concluded that the government's choice model will not deliver the objectives that the government has set for it. It could add quite considerably to disputation about superannuation and it provides no avenue for effective resolution of such disputes. I do not believe that the vast majority of workers will benefit from the government's choice model. Some will, but most probably will not. The real beneficiaries will be the big financial institutions which will be able to get around award clauses and access occupational superannuation. That is what this bill was always about: delivering superannuation to the government's financial backers in the banking, insurance and finance sectors.
So what do we do about choice? I think that a better approach is to look at the occupational superannuation industry that we 
 already have and work out how it can be improved. The better industry funds are moving from strength to strength, reducing administrative costs as economies of scale improve, becoming more aggressive about investment strategies and choices and providing better information back to their members. But of course there are duds. Workers do need to be able to exit industry funds that are not performing.
Further, industry funds are not sufficiently portable. There remains the problem that moving from one industry to another too often results in moving from one industry fund to another. We are a country of eight million and workers and 18 million superannuation accounts, and that is not an efficient outcome. I believe that there is a case for modifying current award clauses to provide some flexibility to improve the operation of industry funds. These amendments should allow employees to leave a fund which is not performing, allow workers to take a fund which is performing with them to another employer and provide them with more choice within the fund on how their money is invested.
Last week the Democrats announced our own managed choice proposal to improve the operation of the award based industry superannuation system. Our proposals sought to retain the key benefits of the existing industry based award super schemes while giving employed within that system more options if they choose to exercise them. Our first proposal is to require the AIRC to amend award clauses to provide for choice of at least two industry funds. It should be noted of course that many and probably most award clauses already provide choice of at least two industry funds. We propose that, by 1 July 2000, the AIRC extend this to all award clauses.
These funds would be required to provide employers with information for distribution to their employees so that employees can make a choice between the two funds based on their performance and change that choice if necessary if they fail to perform. On top of that, an employee should be able to take their industry fund with them. Provided the employer agrees, this should be an automatic exception 
 to the award clauses, and our choice model would allow for that. But choice should be more restricted when an employee wants to move outside the award system. Here, the employee needs to be clear about what they want and why. The decision to move outside the industry fund must be employee driven. it must not be driven by employers, banks or finance companies, but by employees.
Our model provides for this but, as it would be an exception to the relevant award clauses, the employee would need to apply for such an exception to be granted. We have proposed that this be done through the Office of the Employment Advocate. The advocate would simply check that the decision was that of the employee, not the employer, that the employee knows what they are doing, and then tick it off, as it were. This safety valve would prevent employers delivering their work forces en bloc to some inappropriate financial institution. It would also be a safety valve to prevent less informed workers being sold inappropriate and ultimately costly superannuation products. It would also be flexible enough to allow workers who know what they are doing to actually go ahead and run their superannuation as they see fit.
The final change that we are proposing is to give employees investment choice within their fund. This is, I believe, the most essential issue in building up employee ownership of their superannuation. Investment choice should cover not just risk profiles but also investment vehicles. I believe that many workers would, for example, want to have a say in how much of their superannuation is invested overseas, creating work opportunities in other countries. They might also like to have a say in how much is invested in venture capital, R&D infrastructure, housing and so forth in this country. At present, the onerous duties on trustees prevent them making these sorts of policy decisions because of the need to pursue the highest return wherever it is available. Giving employees more choice about where and how their money is invested could, over time, help bring some of the $60 billion in superannuation invested offshore back into Australia, creating new Australian job opportunities.
In conclusion, I believe that the choice model of the Democrats avoids the problems inherent in the government's proposals whilst addressing some of the problems with the current system. It retains the benefits offered in the existing system whilst also fixing some of its shortcomings. As such, I think it represents a fair and reasonable evolutionary improvement to current superannuation arrangements. It is my hope that the Senate supports our amendments when I move them during the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1998-05-25,"—I want to take up the issue of choice which has been taken up again and again by those who have spoken before me and which will, I think, lead to a very interesting discussion in the committee stage. In that context, I would like to go to chapter 5 of the explanatory memorandum to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998 , which talks about choice of superannuation funds. I do so because if we are going to debate this bill, as we certainly will, it would be very useful to know on what basis the government is insisting upon giving choice to the people involved. Paragraph 5.13 says:
The Government announced in the 1997-98 Budget, that it would introduce measures that provide employees with greater choice as to the superannuation fund or RSA to which their superannuation is paid. As a result of extensive consultation with superannuation funds, industry associations and employer and employee representatives, the government announced on 25 November 1997 a range of enhancements to the original Budget proposal. These enhancements are designed to significantly reduce the administrative burden on employers while ensuring the key objective of providing choice of funds to employees is achieved.
I am not sure whether choice of funds is given the importance that it is in this explanatory memorandum because of employees' civil rights—therefore, since they have civil rights they ought to have choice—or whether they are given the choice because choice is an economic force which will increase the resources of a person if that force is allowed to operate properly.
I think that is a significant distinction to make because if employees are being given choice because of their civil rights then not a great deal of argument can be made about that 
 because civil rights are self-evident truths. I know that the minister is a great reader of Thomas Jefferson's declaration of independence in 1776.
—Quite right!
—He established the proposition that the truths that we talk about, including civil rights and the rule of law, are self-evident truths. If, on the other hand, a person ought to have choice because of the economic principles involved, then that is a different matter. In those circumstances, the truths are not as self-evident. As I think any economist would agree, there has to be some evidence about that before we go ahead with the proposition. As has been pointed out by speakers before me, there is no evidence that has been brought forward, at least in this explanatory memorandum, which would support that proposition. Senator Sherry said during the meal adjournment that if I quoted the United Kingdom and Chile, those supporting this bill would know that they were cases in which the proposal put forward here did not succeed.
I think it is time that explanatory memorandums were more informative about evidence. I know that we have standing committees and legislation committees which bring forward a lot of evidence, but I think it would be useful for people writing explanatory memorandums to put in such evidence as they have to support the bill that is being explained by the explanatory memorandum. I say that for two reasons. First of all, I think it would clarify in the minds of the people who prepared the explanatory memorandum, and who no doubt had a significant part to play in the preparation of the bill, the parts of the particular bill that are not supported by evidence. It would also help people who do not attend upon the legislation committee understand what the government is putting forward.
A lot of explanatory memorandums are like opinions or advice from consultants, not from lawyers because lawyers are very serious about the advice and opinions that they give. At times an opinion or advice is just run off to suit the reader for whom it is meant. It is not a good thing to use a language that will be attractive and not have any real thought 
 put into what is put. For example, paragraph 5.6 of the explanatory memorandum states:
The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings and placing downward pressure on fund administration charges.
That flows like poetry to our mind because we have heard so often the words competition and efficiency, downward pressure, savings and improved returns. They are the sorts of phrases that resonate around the country and come no doubt from particular economic schools that people might have attended.
When you read words like that, you are immediately on your guard that this is something that has not been thought out. It has been put down because someone has to prepare an explanatory memorandum. I imagine a lot of this stuff is on computers and that all you do is change the name of the act, press a button, there is a rumble in the system and out comes the explanatory memorandum. In my view, that is not good enough because it ignores the case that can be put against it, which has been so eloquently put by previous speakers.
There is nothing here about the effectiveness or otherwise of the retirement savings accounts, which I remember some time ago were spoken about by Senator Lundy. In one of her early contributions in this chamber I think she said that there were some real problems with retirement savings accounts, but none of that is set out in this explanatory memorandum. It is my plea that we generally try to improve the quality of explanatory memorandums. We cannot always rely on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee to bring up issues. If this bill is based on the primacy of civil rights, that would be in accordance with the thoughts of the minister handling this bill at the moment, and that would be a good thing. It is my view that civil rights should receive a higher priority than they do in this parliament at times—not that they should command absolute heights but they should be given greater priority than they presently receive.
Madam Acting Deputy President, over the years you have given priority to civil rights, 
 the rule of law in indigenous people's issues, gender equality and rights of people living under the threat of nuclear disaster. People such as you have given emphasis to civil rights over the years. This is one case where the government—at least in the terms it uses—seems to have given priority to civil rights. We will be able to find out when we come to the committee stage how the issue of choice operates in the context of this explanatory memorandum.
One of the rights that I think would help in this area is the right of funds to sue on behalf of employees whose employers have not made the contribution that they should have made. We could help in this area by giving funds greater rights to require contributions to be made.
Much has been said tonight about choice. It has been said that people must have knowledge of all the facts to be able to make a choice, and that is right. But I am not sure how people can have that knowledge. How can we know the results of investments made by funds? If people invest in shares, are the values going to go up or down? If they invest in the money market, how much is that going to return? If they invest in property, is the property going to keep its value? These are all questions that cannot be answered, and yet the explanatory memorandum is written as if those sorts of issues are beyond doubt. In that sense, this explanatory memorandum—and perhaps the thrust of the bill itself—introduces propositions that are not supported by reality. In other words, no matter how well educated and practised you are in the share market, nobody can guarantee how those things are going to go.
When you talk about choice in this context, you are talking about it in a way which is unreal and tends to give a wrong impression of what things are all about. I think that comes about because of the cavalier—and I use the word advisedly—way in which some of these explanatory memorandums are written.
Let me repeat the main points. This legislation would be praiseworthy if it were based substantially on the concept of human rights. However, I think such an exercise in this case 
 has miscarried. In other words, any attempt in this bill to try to carry out the dictates of human rights has failed because it has not addressed the issues as they should be addressed. Also, there is not enough evidence to convince us that this bill is based on economic principles. Senator Sherry has produced evidence, as have others, to indicate that there is much to be doubted in the propositions that have been put forward.
This bill needs to be looked at further. It is not now in a proper state to be passed. A lot more discussion is needed. I think somebody with the generosity of heart of the minister in this case would understand the thrust with which we come at this bill and would go away and rewrite it. I do not suggest that he writes the explanatory memorandum himself—that would be imposing too much of a burden on him. But I would ask that he gets somebody who has a full understanding of this area—not someone who would go into a mantra mode of repeating the words that we have heard—to make a good and proper analysis of the issues involved.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1998-05-25,"—I, too, would like to add my thoughts and comments on this issue. Having had the experience of being one of the earlier participants in a particular industry fund, I come from a perspective of first-hand experience about what participation in an industry superannuation fund means as a blue-collar worker.
One of Labor's great achievements has been the establishment of such funds for transient workers, workers in blue-collar industries and workers who previously had no access to superannuation generally and the dignity that it can potentially bring in one's retirement. So it has been with great dismay and concern that we have traversed a fairly rocky terrain in respect of this government's attempts to manipulate change and thwart the principles that were put in place by Labor during our period of government. Indeed, these principles were supported generally by the current government—the then opposition. It was agreed that the role of industry super funds and superannuation generally would be supported in a bipartisan way.
However, since the coalition took government we have seen the structural dismantling of that superannuation retirement base for all Australians that Labor was certainly leading towards. We have had experiences with the superannuation tax. We have seen the government co-contribution for superannuation completely scuttled in return—at the time it was politically sold as some sort of recompense—for a family tax package. Ironically, those families fortunate enough to fit within the narrow confines of that family tax rebate and to benefit from it have seen it eaten away by the increases to child care due to the $821 million cut to the child-care sector.
Let us look at the government's superannuation policies in the wider context and at how other policy decisions have been made in relation to retirement incomes and costs to families. We have seen policies that have stifled job growth. We have seen industrial relations policies that have hampered opportunity, particularly for blue-collar workers and those in transient industries such as the building and construction industry. This collection of policies has actively targeted and actively disadvantaged those areas.
It points to a government that has a short-term approach. It is not a government that subscribes to long-term visions about where retirement incomes are going to come from. It is a government that uses these pressures to try to thwart and narrowly confine debate about taxation reform. It is a government that is prepared to compromise what was a sound and progressive program of enhancing retirement incomes for all Australians and turn it into a quick buy, a reallocation of only some of the money—not even all of it—from the potential co-contribution to a family tax rebate. This sort of petty politicking and lack of vision is something that effectively has become synonymous with the John Howard led coalition government.
One of the great ironies in this debate can be highlighted by conveying to you an experience I had as an organiser for the Building Workers Industrial Union at the time that the superannuation debate was still raging within the industrial relations forums. Indeed, it was the Liberal Party at that time, and its voice in 
 industry through employer associations, that argued so actively against the introduction of industry style funds because of the administrative burden that it imposed upon employers in those industries. It should be understood that in the building industry a large number of small subcontractors barely have the time to get their taxation records and their wage books up to scratch, because of the pressures of their work, let alone deal with the administration of a superannuation fund.
From recollection, the opposition at the time argued vehemently against this notion of industry super, specifically because of what they called red tape and administrative burden. In fact, at the time, this argument was largely fought out in an industrial forum. As a union organiser, I can remember having many debates with employers about the value of having an industry fund which could support and help small employers—it did not matter what job they were working on because they only had to get to know the processes associated with one fund.
There are a lot of issues relating to that but one, of course, was the recognition that small businesses in the building industry—I know this example can translate to many different industries—imposed quite a significant burden. It was a burden that was taken seriously by the Labor government at the time. Certainly it was taken seriously by the industry fund and by employer organisations, which embarked upon lengthy education programs and information seminars to try to bring the skills and knowledge of those particular subcontractors up to scratch.
A lot of investment was put in place for that and I believe over time its value was certainly recognised by those employers. I cannot begin to describe the benefit and the positive impact that it had on the workers in that industry. For the first time, employees, who perhaps had had numerous employers in a given year or in any given period of that cyclical boom of the construction industry, consistently had contributions going into one fund. The debate that occurred out there where it happens—on the sites and in the site sheds—ultimately led to a fund that that 
 industry and those workers can be particularly proud of.
So we get to the debate about a choice of fund. That history, that education and that knowledge that has been built up, and the contributions that have been building up and going towards the retirements of all of those workers, are now under question by this government. With this bill, the government is proposing to undermine the system that was put in place. It is proposing to undermine it through the choice model. The government, with its lack of vision and lack of acknowledgment of the industries working in this area—as in the particular example I used—has decided that no longer is red tape an issue and that no longer is the ability of these small companies to administer their affairs an issue. Suddenly, a greater issue is to create confusion and a situation that will make it more difficult for smaller employers to participate in employer contribution schemes for superannuation.
The government argues that its choice model is a question of competition. It is not a question of competition; it is not a question of efficiencies. If it were, the government would look at industry best practice. If it were, the government would look at what industry has chosen through natural evolution as the type of scheme that is best suited and it would take some stock in that, learn from that and appreciate that what is not needed out there in the small business sector is a complicated myriad of opportunities and approaches, all of which require, I presume, for many of these small businesses the hiring of yet another consultant, so many more hours with their accountant or perhaps even some legal advice in relation to the application of this new law. So not only are their administrative procedures potentially spread across four or five different superannuation schemes, funds, RSAs or whatever but, in making their assessment to check their legality in applying these new laws, small businesses will have to hire the services of advisers—professionals, I am sure. That will be very necessary given the complicated state of this legislation.
So where is this government doing industry a favour in this respect? You are not doing 
 small business any favours. They are not impressed by your arguments of choice and competition. They are only thinking about that extra bill from their accountant, their bank manager or their lawyer. And they are thinking about those extra hours spent in the office rather than out there scrounging and searching for more work—putting in their tenders and bids. That is where they need to spend their time at the moment.
Let us look at it from the point of view of the worker. Choice of fund—consumer heaven. I can just see all those building workers out there taking home a pile of propaganda from a bank or industry fund and comparing it—making a detailed comparative analysis of each of the four options that are before them. They have all that time on their hands in their busy lives to make those comparisons. This government is taking these steps to undermine superannuation for workers. I do not know too many blue-collar workers who have the sort of money to purchase advice from accountants or financial advisers. Many have, but many have not. It is those who have not who are going to be unnecessarily bombarded with extra costs associated with making their analysis. They may be under pressure from their employer to go in one direction or another, given the burden that the employer has in administering perhaps four different funds from their business.
Another point worth dwelling on is how the government intends to ensure the soundness of each of these options. As with any increased choice or wider variety, for effectiveness and for the quality required there must be, commonsense tells me, a greater imposition of regulation, compliance procedures and penalties for those who do not comply. So here we hit this contradiction. On the one hand you have the government saying that this choice policy is about consumer opportunity. On the other hand—and we know this from overseas examples—this form of deregulation opens the doors to players who are not always up to scratch. So another layer of analysis is required by the worker and indeed the employer, for which they will have to purchase advice to make sure that they do not breach their liabilities.
It also places an additional burden on the government. Deregulation must be accompanied by specifications about compliance to a far higher degree than before—otherwise they are opening the door to failure and to providers of these services who will not comply with the regulations. Experience with this government has shown us that they are very keen to deconstruct those authorities that have been put in place to monitor and regulate the quality of the services, schemes, funds, et cetera put in place. You cannot have it both ways. Providing greater choice means that you, as a government, need to reinvest in monitoring regulations, tracking compliance actively—not passively—and ensuring that accurate and effective disincentives in the form of penalties are put in place. But we see little of this. Instead we see rhetoric based on consumer choice; rhetoric that flies in the face of all of the messages and symbols we heard from you in opposition when you argued that measures such as this were a burden on small business.
Labor, on the other hand, is committed to the role of superannuation in Australian society. In every debate in this chamber about superannuation, we have reinforced our message that there is a place for a definitive, forward looking, effective and fully funded program of ideas and legislation that will lead to superannuation being an effective source of retirement income for Australians. The price for the backtracking and undermining by this government of that vision for superannuation for this country will be paid by generations who are still in the work force. The baby boomer generation was always going to be under pressure, caught in the space between having the time and the opportunity to build up their superannuation funds and the pressures on government provided pensions. Labor was addressing this problem. Our policies meant that for generations after that there was opportunity for all of us to have a dignified retirement. This opportunity has now been undermined, and with each year that the coalition remains in power this opportunity will be further reduced.
Labor has a series of amendments in relation to this matter of choice. Just as we have 
 attempted to amend previous legislation, we will continue to try to limit the damage being inflicted by this government. Labor's amendments will make this bill much fairer and will make it easier to understand. Our amendments will also still allow employees to have the opportunity to choose a superannuation fund—not to have one forced on them by an employer. If there is one thing that my experience in the building industry showed me, it is that you need the time and you need the opportunity to explain to people how it all works. A decent education program, not shrouded in rhetoric, not shrouded in tax buy-offs and short-term policies that have little to do with retirement incomes and everything to do with confusing the taxation debate, is the way that we will progress superannuation and its changing form in the workplaces of this country.
Labor's amendments limit the damage of this bill but they will not stop the structural undermining of the superannuation program put in place by Labor. As I said, it will be the generations to come that will suffer. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1998-05-25,"—We are debating Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1998 , which has a number of important aspects to it. With the rhetoric of Senator Lundy still fresh in my mind, perhaps I could make a few brief comments on Senator Lundy's view of the world. Senator Lundy, what we are offering here is workers' choice. We are giving the workers choice. The second point I make is that your amendment is very similar to option 2 that we put forward. There are a few little extra flourishes but, make no mistake—
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Madam President, we heard the opposition in silence. I know they are sensitive on this issue. Perhaps they might care to listen. You could not believe, with the rhetorical flourishes in Senator Lundy's speech, that what we were trying to do is to offer workers choice, in other words, give workers a chance to make a choice in relation to their superannuation. Senator Lundy, whatever you say in life as you go through this chamber, small business will never 
 believe that you have their concerns at heart. I have to say that with your track record and particularly that old union of yours, the building union.
As I said, that your amendments are in fact very similar to option 2 that we put forward. I do not know whether you appreciated that, but that happens to be the case. The final point is that, as far as undermining confidence in superannuation is concerned, it has been a great year for super. Super is growing at excellent rates. I do not know how you measure confidence in super. I know how Senator Sherry does but I do not know how you do. The truth of the matter is that, by every measure, there has been very substantial growth in superannuation and people are voting with their dollars to put their money into superannuation. Talk about rhetoric!
This bill implements two government initiatives: choice of superannuation funds and the savings rebate. The savings rebate commences on 1 July 1998. On 13 May 1998 I announced a new start date for the choice of superannuation measure for new employees. That will be on 1 July 1999. Secondly, it builds on the government's program of reducing compliance costs for small businesses by introducing a CGT assets register and changes to the withholding tax arrangements. Thirdly, this bill implements two important 1997 budget announcements which enhance the integrity of the tax system relating to franking credit trading, dividend streaming and private company loans.
The savings rebate will particularly benefit Australian families and older Australians who have saved for their retirement and individuals who have built up their businesses and derive a return. The rebate will apply to undeducted superannuation contributions made by employees and the self-employed and net personal income from savings and investment, including net business income up to an annual cap of some $3,000. In the first year it will apply at a transitional rate of 7.5 per cent and will increase to 15 per cent thereafter. This will deliver a tax saving of up to $450 per year. I know, after many conversations I have had with people around many electorates, that there are many people who, 
 as they should, are welcoming these proposals, which will provide further incentives for people to invest in superannuation.
The rebate, overall, will provide an incentive to save in a way which is fair, allowing individuals to choose the form most suited to their needs and recognising that individuals have to save for life cycle needs as well as for retirement. The bill also implements the government's reforms to choice of fund arrangements. They are designed to give employees greater choice and control over their superannuation savings, which in turn will give them a greater sense of ownership of their savings. The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings. I will be moving amendments in the committee stage to amend the start to 1 July 1999.
The bill introduces an asset register for capital gains tax purposes. This will eliminate the need for taxpayers to keep source documents for lengthy periods and will reduce the compliance costs for all taxpayers with capital gains obligations. The new three-tier system for remittance obligations under the report or payment system, pay as you earn and the prescribed payment system will give small remitters the option to remit these payments on a quarterly basis rather than on a monthly basis. This will provide over 300,000 small businesses with the opportunity to defer the remittance of $500 million in withheld amounts in 1998-99. That is certainly a very substantial number of business operators who will benefit from this.
The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to ensure that payments and loans made by a private company to a shareholder or to a shareholder's associate are treated as assessable dividends to the extent that they are realised or unrealised profits in the company. I will be moving a very minor technical amendment to this measure in committee. This measure, together with the introduction of a general anti-avoidance rule and antistreaming measures, which formed part of the 1997 budget measures to prevent franking credit trading and dividend stream 
 ing, is designed to protect the integrity of the tax system.
The supplementary explanatory memorandum, which has been circulated, contains further guidance on the intended operation of antistreaming measures and the general anti-avoidance rules targeting franking credit trading transactions. The bill will implement two further budget measures relating to tax deductibility of expenses incurred in contesting election to the Constitutional Convention and donations to the National Nurses Memorial Trust. The Labor Party has made some astonishingly extreme comments, particularly on the savings policy.
—`Rebates can be milked for more'—it's not my comment.
—Particularly on the savings policy, but not exclusively, Senator Conroy. Labor's record on national savings is indescribably abysmal.
—They are pretty impressive.
—What Labor speakers failed to perhaps make clear to the chamber was, for example, that Labor's national savings rate reached, apart from the world wars and the Great Depression, its lowest level since Federation—since 1901. They did not mention the $10.3 billion budget deficit that they left us when they were thrown out of office. Not surprisingly, it was omitted in their remarks. Not only that, but many of us are aware of the $70 billion deficit that they ran up in their last five years of office. This is a huge amount of money and I am delighted that at least the shadow Treasurer (Mr Gareth Evans) was prepared to concede recently the significant nature of the deficit which he left this government. We commend that uncharacteristically straightforward comment from the shadow Treasurer. We believe the savings rebate is fair.
—You're a disgrace.
—Senator Conroy cannot contain himself. Senator Conroy, you are going to have your chance in the committee stage and I hope your behaviour improves when the committee stage is on. If you are 
 showing such high degrees of excitement now, I do not hold out—
—I can see why you are so nervous about those two other senators from Victoria.
—Senator Conroy, let us not get into the problems of the Labor Party in relation to branch stacking. I will not be diverted by Senator Conroy. We say that the savings rebate is fair and equitable, unlike Labor's never delivered L-A-W law broken promises and co-contributions. I think that is worth underlining. We believe that it is fair, it is equitable and it will be beneficial to the overall structure of this industry in Australia.
Let me say why we regard the savings rebate as equitable. The opposition spokesmen in this area certainly have no right to talk about equity. They opposed a very significant move by government in recent history to improve the equity of Australia's retirement income system by their opposition to the superannuation surcharge. The surcharge was placed on those people with high income earnings, yet that was opposed by the Labor Party—not actually in the lower house but opposed in the Senate. That has always intrigued us but, in the end, that is the way the Labor Party operates.
The savings rebate will flow to people earning less than $40,000 per annum. Seventy per cent of Australian wage earners earn under $40,000. This is really a benefit flowing to the overwhelming bulk of Australian wage earners. In contrast, not one of these people need pay the superannuation surcharge. The opposition has been, I believe, somewhat misleading in its comments about what the so-called battlers will get from the rebate.
About one-third of wage and salary earners earning less than $40,000 a year made personal super contributions at an average of around $1,300; that is, they already passed the test for getting the rebate. We have given them the opportunity to get an even higher rebate by increasing their contributions. Those who are not making personal super contributions have a big incentive to do so. Each dollar they put in will give them back 15 cents. Not only that, but six million Australians will 
 benefit from this rebate, the vast bulk of whom are lower and middle income earners.
It has been a pity to listen to the debate on choice of funds. Let me make a couple of observations on the remarks which have been made in this debate. I come to this debate having far more confidence than, I believe, members of the opposition do in industry funds.
—Now don't start on industry funds.
—Yes, I do have, because what I heard was how well industry funds were doing, and that is true. A lot of industry funds have done well, and the truth of the matter is, in choice of funds, if industry funds are doing as well as everybody said, whom would the worker choose? The fact of the matter is that there will be industry funds which will perform well, and there will be industry funds which will perform less well. If you have not got confidence in industry funds, you certainly lack confidence in workers. If industry funds are doing so well, whom would workers choose, if what you say is correct?
All I can say is that the rhetoric which you have proffered in this debate seems to me to underlie a certain lack of confidence in the substance. As I say, I have more confidence in industry funds than do quite a range of senators on the other side of the chamber.
—Have you got a list of the ones you like?
—Senator, can you just wait? You will get your chance. You were heard in comparative silence. We can speed the journey, if you would perhaps keep quiet a little. Choice of funds was a pre-election commitment made by the government in the lead-up to the last election, and the model the government has proposed in order to implement its promise has been the subject of extensive consultation with the superannuation industry, employers and employees. Enhancements to the government's original model outlined in the 1997-98 budget were announced in November 1997, after that consultation. 
The first stage of the opposition's choice of fund models involves offering investment choice within superannuation funds. Investment choice in recent years has become a key feature of the Australian superannuation environment. Consequently, many funds do offer investment choice, and it is hard to see how the Labor Party believes that is bringing about any real change in providing employees with greater choice.
The second stage of the opposition's model involves offering what it considers to be `genuine' employee choice. The key features of the opposition's regime of genuine employee choice are in effect quite similar to the employees exercising choice through the informal agreement under the government model.
—Not a chance.
—You did not even know that, Senator Conroy. You were given a bit of paper and you did not even know that. However, there is a difference. Under the opposition model, an employee can make no choice—correct me if I am wrong—if the employee is unable to obtain the employer's agreement to the fund they nominate. Correct?
—You're telling the story; we're just listening.
—That is exactly correct—unchallenged. So all this talk about the employer having the whip hand, under the model that we have put down—
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Senator Conroy, could you stop interjecting?
—This is exactly what happens under the Labor model choice. Of course, on the other hand, the government model allows employees to request their employers to make an offer of choice, if they nominate a fund but are unable to obtain the agreement of their employer.
I must say, in relation to the Democrat model, that I notice that one of the superannuation industry groups today suggested that ASFA did not see the Democrats' proposal to restrict choice to two industry funds as being practicable. That was a view that was brought 
 forward from ASFA today. We are clearly going to have a significant debate on this. The government has been open. This has been on the table for at least six months, so the government has been open to discussions. We have made offers to show people the education program that we have put forward.
—I'm sitting here waiting.
—You did not accept the offer, Senator. We believe that choice of funds is not only right in a philosophical sense, in order to allow people to have control over their superannuation and to provide a choice for them, but is also the democratic way to go. It is a pity that the Labor Party has become so entrenched in special interest politics that they find it difficult to see that. We will be opposing the Democrat model and the Labor model. As I said, the government has been open to discussion with groups and has sought discussions. I hope that in the course of the debate we can reach a productive outcome.
In conclusion, let me say that the Australian Democrats have recently approached me and sought, in the committee stage, that we debate schedule 5, the choice of fund proposal, later in the running order, so that the amendments that they have can be circulated. The government is happy to accept this suggestion. I understand that, again depending on what the chamber wishes, it might be sensible to begin the committee stage with schedules 9 and 10—private company distributions and the savings rebate, respectively. We are in the hands of the Senate, but that seems to me the sensible way to go.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,1998-05-25,"—I want to speak tonight on an important piece of legislation which is due to be debated in the House of Representatives later this week: the Trade Practices Amendment (Country of Origin Representations) Bill 1998 . This is a vital bill for the thousands of Australians involved in agriculture, food processing and packaging and the 1.1 million people employed in manufacturing—and for all Australian consumers who wish to support Australian industry and Australian workers. Through this bill, the government seeks to overhaul the rules for using the terms `Made in Australia' and `Product/Produce of Australia'.
Earning the right to use these terms is a valuable one. It is a commercial advantage. It sets your goods apart from others on the shop shelf. More and more consumers, I am sure, will respect these descriptions and actively seek out products marked in this way, to promote both Australian products and Australian produce. It is important for all of us that these terms are not devalued. However, several court cases and the actions of some companies have led to some confusion already in the community about which term means what. That is why this government has pushed so hard to put some clear definitions in place.
Our aims in this area are threefold. Firstly, we plan to introduce clear and simple tests to determine eligibility to use the terms. Secondly, we will make sure that both business and consumers understand the tests. Thirdly, we will be enforcing the rights rigorously against unscrupulous traders. The changes will be made by amending Part V of the Trade Practices Act.
Businesses will be able to claim that their product is made in Australia only if the product passes a substantial transformation test and at least 50 per cent of the cost of production is incurred in Australia. For example, the government does not regard adding water to concentrate to produce orange juice as a substantial contribution.
I know that pork producers are concerned that imported pig meat may be able to be labelled Australian after very little processing in this country. This will not be permitted under this new legislation. No goods containing imported pig meat will be allowed to carry the `Product of Australia' label. Making ham from imported pork is not considered to be a substantial transformation. Under the new arrangements, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs (Mr Truss) will have the power to make regulations to exclude such simple processing from this test.
A car is a much better example. The components are assembled into a new and different product and therefore a substantial transformation has taken place. To determine whether the car is made in Australia, we would also need to consider whether at least 
 half of the production costs have been incurred here. If this is the case, the manufacturer can legally use the term.
Materials, labour and overheads will be included in the cost of production. General business costs, such as advertising and distribution, will not. Companies would be able to claim that their product was a product or produce of Australia only if the product was 100 per cent Australian or virtually so. So, in effect, only goods that have acquired their final form in this country will be able to claim that they are made in Australia or are product or produce of Australia.
Significantly, the minister will also have the power to regulate the use of special logos or labels where a particular industry wishes to set standards higher than the minimum test, to be set out in the legislation. Of course, this has been particularly so with a number of logos, like the Woolmark, which is an industry based logo that has been particularly successful in its recognition value and that will continue to be so in terms of wool mix and wool blends. Also, I understand that the `Australian Made' logo, which has been substantially devalued and has lost its legitimacy, will be able to be reinstated as something that has some value.
We recognise that policing the change is imperative. We plan to instruct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to enforce the new test to ensure that foreign goods are not falsely represented as being Australian made. The government believes that clearing up some of the uncertainty in this area will be of benefit to Australian consumers, to Australian businesses and to our country's economic bottom line. We promised before the 1996 election that we would sort this problem out. Through a maze of difficulty, which the previous government found virtually impossible to work its way through or was unable to confront, we have made a substantial start. I look forward to the legislation coming into the Senate after the forthcoming debate in the House of Representatives.
