"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-12,"—The government does not support this amendment for a number of reasons. At the outset, I would point the chamber to research conducted by Newspoll earlier this year in an effort to gauge what level of information the community had in relation to the forthcoming referendum and various aspects relating to it. I think it is noteworthy that only 37 per cent of those surveyed had an actual knowledge of how a President would be chosen. The question of how you choose your President is essential to the model of this republic. It forms the basis of the model. In fact, the debate today has largely been on what sort of model is preferred, insofar as how the President is elected or chosen—whether they be chosen by a joint sitting of the parliament or by the people of Australia.
Only 37 per cent of those surveyed knew how the President would be chosen in this model. That meant, conversely, that 63 per cent did not know. What is even more telling is that in the ethnic groups that were surveyed 62 per cent thought that, under this model, the President would be popularly elected. So you have some not quite two-thirds of ethnic groups surveyed thinking that, when they voted for this model, the President would be popularly elected. That is clearly a misconception. The government is of course aiming to clear up these misconceptions, and the lack of knowledge that I have referred to, by a neutral public education campaign 
 costing some $4.5 million. That will be conducted in September. Also, by virtue of a debate from both the yes and no committees in October, which will be federally funded at a total of $15 million, it is hoped that these issues will be drawn out during the course of those campaigns.
Nonetheless, it is essential, when the question is put to the people of Australia about the model being proposed for the republic, that it include mention of how the President is appointed. I say that that is even more important because of the research that I have just pointed to. In the long title which forms the question, that is not mentioned in the amendment proposed by the opposition. They simply say that it is:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and the Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President.
That leaves out entirely the method of appointment of that President. It is the government's contention that, in view of that research, it is essential—it is more than essential, we have a duty—to incorporate in that question the method of appointment of the President. It is also significant that 43 per cent of those surveyed strongly believed that the President would have a role similar to either the American President or the current Australian Prime Minister. Once again, you have these misconceptions afoot which need to be addressed and which the government will be making every effort to address in the forthcoming months.
That does not mean to say that you simply neglect your duty in the way that you frame the question because to wilfully allow a significant part of the electorate to remain misinformed would be irresponsible. The question, as put by the opposition, does exactly that. It deprives the people of Australia of knowing the method of appointment of the President. This has, after all, formed one of the basic tenets of argument in relation to this whole question and the opposition wants to leave that out. The question of the deletion of `Australian' is of no great moment. The question is quite simply that a President will replace the Queen and the Governor-General 
 and that is incorporated in the government's long title of the bill. It is something which is popularly known and is one of the basic arguments in relation to this whole question.
I would put to the chamber that the joint committee was not unanimous in its recommendation on this. There is a misconception afoot, particularly in the press, that there was some unanimity in relation to this. I would point to the dissenting reports in the committee report and cite from Senator Abetz and Mr Hawker, who stated in relation to the question as proposed by the opposition:
Further, the question fails to inform the people of the type of republic on which they need to cast their judgment. For every republic in the world there is a different model. There are also many theoretical republics which have never been put into practice. The proposed republic is such a theoretical model. It is therefore imperative that the Australian people be informed as to the type of republic on which they will cast judgment.
I think senators need to be mindful of that because, as this is such an important question, it needs to be considered carefully.
The question as proposed by the government is a fair one. It takes up the joint committee's recommendation about there being some disagreement with the word `chosen'. That is, if I can put it this way: the process of choosing the President was regarded as one involving several steps, and to apportion that word `chosen' as meaning that the choice resided only with the members of parliament was not appropriate and was incorrect. The government accepted the suggestion that there be a change and, therefore, the word `appointed' has been substituted for the word `chosen'. The long title now states: `A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General to be replaced by a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament'.
That long title states very clearly that the Queen and Governor-General are to be replaced by a President—and that is, after all, in accordance with the model and suggestions from the joint committee. It has corrected another aspect by going on to state that this will be an appointment, not a choice. It then 
 states that it has to be done by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament. That informs the person who is being questioned of the method of appointment. What we have here is a four-line question which is informative, fair and does not leave people in a misinformed state, as would happen if the opposition amendment were to be adopted.
So I say to the Senate and to the community at large: there is no subterfuge involved on the part of the government; there is no secret agenda at all. What we are about is informing the people of Australia when we put the question to them. It is nothing more, nothing less. Research that we have conducted shows that there is some misinformation, some misunderstanding, and it has to be addressed adequately in the question.
The opposition amendment fails to do that. It is the opposition who should be asked what sort of agenda they are running and why they are scared to put to the people of Australia that the appointment will be made by a two-thirds majority of the members of a joint sitting of parliament. What is wrong with inserting one line? That is all it is, one line. The opposition have said that it should be a simple question. The government's question is short and informative.
The opposition is leaving out one crucial line. People should ask, `What is the opposition's agenda in this?' Is the opposition happy to leave the people of Australia under a misconception? Is the opposition happy that 63 per cent of the people, as I have mentioned, do not know how a President will be chosen? Is the opposition happy to leave it at that? They are very telling questions. I reject the amendment as put by the opposition and, in turn, commend to the chamber the current long title.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-12,"—I move:
(1)	 Title, before ""Australian"", insert ""appointed"".
This is my amendment on sheet 1492 to the opposition amendment. It says that the word `appointed' should be put before the word `Australian' so that the long title then would read: `A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitu 
 tion to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic, with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by an appointed Australian President'.
The views on the title and question are many. We all recognise that they have to contain matters of fact, but it is what is excluded or included which attracts our attention. The very best question would be a long one; the very best question would include all the facts. That would mean that the government's question with the addition of the words `and removable at the discretion of the Prime Minister' would be the finest question to be asked. That question would encompass the fact that we are going to create a republic; the fact that we are going to replace the Queen of Australia and the Australian Governor-General with an Australian President; and the fact that that President would be appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament but would be subject to removal at the discretion of the Prime Minister. They are the entire facts of the question.
There is a problem with asking a long question. The consensus from the marketing side of government and from opinion seems to be that people need a shorter question to be asked. I cannot comment on the validity of that judgment. But it is for that reason I have supported the view that you either go for a very long question, which I have just outlined, or go for a very short question, which is the motion which will be put later by Senator Stott Despoja. I think anywhere in between is inadequate.
But, having said that, there is nothing that is factually incorrect about the opposition's amendment. The minister has quite properly said that the key missing word is `appointed'. The dispute between republicans about models finally rests on the choice of one word or two: `appointed' or `directly elected'. It is the appointed nature of the Australian President which is important to direct electionists, and I assume it is very important to republicans who support the appointment model.
There is nothing wrong with or immoral about supporting an appointment model; it is a legitimate point of view. And there is 
 nothing wrong with or immoral about supporting a directly elected President; it is a legitimate point of view. But if you are to ask the people their opinion on it, you certainly need to explain to them—especially to those who have not followed the report, who have not been reached by education campaigns, who have not been reached by the media debate—in the question what is at stake. And this is about a republic with an appointed President; at the nub of it, that is what it is about. That is why I move this amendment to the opposition's amendment which is a factual addition. I must advise the opposition that, if my amendment to your amendment were not to be accepted, I would reject your amendment because I think the question has to have the word `appointed' in it—unless you decide to go for a really short question for marketing purposes.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-08-12,"—As one who wishes to see the establishment of a republic, I am concerned that we minimise as far as possible the opportunity for the question to be misinterpreted. I suggest to the opposition that, if it persists with its proposal, it will give the monarchists a free kick. Nobody could say anything different, because inevitably the question that is going to be raised in the minds of the voting public is: how is this President going to be elected or appointed? The opposition is saying that it will include the long title but put a full stop after `President'.
Of course, the missing element has been exposed by Senator Murray and I concur wholeheartedly with what he said. He has pointed out that there is a need to reduce as far as is possible the complexity of the question. There is also a need to have within that question the elements that are contained in the legislation. Senators heard what Senator Murray said and I concur. Unless you do have the words `appointed President', you really have to proceed and say `appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament'. As he said, that is not a true reflection of what the bill contains, because it does not go even inferentially to the ability of the Prime Minister to remove the President.
In fairness, if the word `appointed' were inserted before the word `President', there would be no need for the remainder, and it inferentially indicates that, if the person obviously is able to be appointed, then they can be removed. But, of course, the two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament are not involved in that removal.
I support the proposal put forward by Senator Murray and—although I do not think the government will wish to agree, because it is all cut and dried—I feel a little disappointed that this proposal put forward by Senator Murray will not meet with the approval of both houses of parliament.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-12,"—I will speak briefly in response to a couple of the remarks made by the minister. I am aware of some of the research that has been done by the government in relation to the referendum task force. One of the important points that the minister has alluded to is that public education has to not only inform but also correct misconceptions as to what is included in the referendum and how the President of a republic would be chosen.
I agree with the minister that an education campaign is fundamentally important. So you would assume that most of the education process must take place between now and when people enter the ballot box. The actual question is not intended as the sole method of influence or education. If the minister and others are so concerned that the method of education or the question is accurate, then I would suggest that you do as Senator Murray has suggested on a number of occasions—that is, you put as much information in the question as possible about not only the appointment processes but also the dismissal processes and powers—and also you get the wording right.
The Prime Minister's compromise announced on Monday, which suggests `a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the Commonwealth parliament', is a statement with which many people would have argument. I think the concept of appoint 
 ment is very much considered to convey the misconception of the parliament having more power than in fact it has under this model. Theoretically, it is the Prime Minister making this appointment, albeit seconded by the Leader of the Opposition, with a ratification or approval process by the Australian parliament. If the government is concerned about the accuracy of the question, the intent of the legislation and the processes of that model being included in the question, then let us get the question right. That is why the Democrats in this case have opted for simplicity.
I would like to ask the minister if reports over the last couple of days are true in relation to the government's education campaign. What information will be provided to Australian households through the government's education campaign on the republic referendum? Is it true that information about the legislation and the model will be available only through public institutions, such as libraries, post offices and presumably schools and other institutions, but will not be mailed to households as originally thought?
Certainly this was an issue that was brought up in the joint select committee. A number of witnesses, especially in regional areas, thought that they would be receiving information from the government. They were not necessarily talking about the Australian Electoral Commission per se, but they thought that they would be receiving information. One witness actually thought that they would be receiving copies of the bills.
I have to acknowledge that, when that was put to the committee, senators and members alike were not able to confirm or refute that suggestion. It sounded unlikely to me that households would receive the legislation. I am wondering if the minister can enlighten us as to what information would be provided to households as part of the government's education campaign. I reiterate: not information through the yes and no committees or the AEC, but whatever information would be sent to households as part of the education process on which we all place a very high value.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-12,"—There will be various steps in the information 
 campaign. The final form is being decided at the moment. To give you an outline, there will be advertising on television and radio and in print. There will be a free-call number available for people to obtain further information. There will be printed material available upon request, but it is not envisaged that there would be a national mail-out other than the one which will be conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission. I remind senators that that one will constitute a very large mail-out indeed, because it will be to all electors and will contain the amendments proposed as well as the written yes and no cases.
That will be a formidable document indeed. That is aimed to reach people some two weeks before the referendum, give or take some time for reaching some parts of Australia. I put it to the chamber that to send too much material out on a direct mail basis could have an adverse effect, and that we should have it in a process of initially alerting people to the issue, encouraging and motivating them to do something, pointing them to where more information is available and providing them with some additional information at that stage. Then you have an avenue of printed material which is more detailed—and that again would have the free-call aspect—and a printed document which can be sent to them on request, free of charge. Finally you have the mail-out that I have referred to.
I would submit that that is not dissimilar to a lot of advertising campaigns where you alert and interest people, motivate them, give them some additional information and then a line of further information, culminating in that final mail-out. There is advice that, if you put too much information in an advertisement, it can burn out very quickly and the message can be missed. Of course, 30 or 60 seconds in a television advertisement does not give you a great deal of room to move. They are basic tenets of advertising strategy which have to be observed in order for it to be effective.
That is roughly the campaign we are looking at. The main public education campaign is in September. Printed information will of course be available during the October period as well. By that time you will have the yes 
 and no committees' campaigns in full swing and, of course, in the last two weeks before the referendum there will be the mail-out. It is a concentrated public education campaign. If you went much further than that, you would risk saturation and burning out the message and you would also risk turning people away. You have to get the right balance. That is what we are working on at the moment, and we think that that strategy is a good one.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-12,"—I thank the minister for his answer and reiterate that the minister has made clear to the chamber that the government will provide a concentrated and formidable amount of information. That means that people who are voting will no doubt have a formidable amount of information about the model before they get to the ballot box. That is why the Democrats are aiming for a simple, effective, accurate question that does not seek to burn out any prospect of people's understanding or to provide too much information in the question: we do not believe it should be saturated—to use the minister's term—but I am very glad to hear that people will have a comprehensive amount of information about the model before they get to the ballot box. Hence the minister has supported the case for a simple and accurate question when we get to the polls.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-12,"—The government believes that there should be a simple and accurate question and it believes that the one it proposes fits that neatly. Might I also say that the question is the last part of that information process. I would take issue with anyone who would say that the government's question as proposed would burn out the message or would overload anyone with information. Some four lines as a long title does not come anywhere near that.
At the same time, it has some simple information contained in it which is essential for the elector—who, at that stage, still may not have come to a conclusion as to what it is all about. Try as we may, there will still be people who will need an accurate question put 
 to them on that day. In fact, it is obvious that your question in any event, despite what advertising you have, should be as accurate and as informative as possible.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-12,"—Madam Chairman, we have probably had a fairly exhaustive discussion on this within both the Senate and the House of Representatives and also in the public arena. I do not want to generate any more excitement this morning. I would like to refer to a couple of points that have been made in the debate over recent hours and to defend the opposition's position on the motion we are putting before the chamber.
The first thing we have to understand is that this is not something that the opposition itself worked out. The long title we are suggesting actually comes from the joint parliamentary committee. It was almost a unanimous decision of that committee to come up with the words that the opposition is now pursuing in the parliament to be the long title of the republic bill.
That committee said in their conclusions:
The committee concludes the most appropriate long title for the republic will be one that presents clearly and simply the essential purpose and outcome of the proposed legislation.
Therefore the committee recommended the words that we are putting up today. So this is not just coming from the opposition; this is something that has been worked upon by members of parliament of all persuasions over recent months.
Senator Murray talks about the absence of the word `appointed' making it unbalanced. Senator Murray, a lot of other words are also absent. That is why the committee felt that a wording that presents clearly and simply the purpose and the outcome is the best way to go. I said to you in the debate a few days ago that I thought there was a streak of Machiavelli in all this—a streak of Peter Reith in the way that you are putting up this amendment. I notice you did not deny it.
—I wish I had that amount of talent, Senator Bolkus.
—I am glad you do not have that amount of deviousness as yet. It 
 must be the narcotic effect of the chesterfields in the Prime Minister's office that is having a bit of an impact on you in moving this amendment.
The other point that needs to be made is that the question is important, obviously. What we are really on about is getting a question that is fair, and that is what the committee thought. One only has to read John Stirton in the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday to see the analysis of the Herald AC Nielsen poll published this week; a poll which on the one hand put the Howard question and got a 31 per cent positive report. Only 31 per cent said they would support such a republic as described in the Prime Minister's previous preferred referendum question, whereas the question proposed by the committee engendered a 57 per cent response for the republic. Questions do make a difference. In a sense, all sides of parliament know that that is the case. There is a degree of shadow-boxing. We would maintain, though, that we have the legitimacy and the cloak of the joint parliamentary committee in pursuing this particular amendment, whereas on the other hand some of the others—I do not refer to people in this debate, but particularly the Prime Minister—have an interest in ensuring that the proposal does not get up.
I do not know that I need to speak much longer, other than to say we could go on for quite a length of time on this. But we do have the preamble legislation to get into as well. It might be an opportune time to go to the vote.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-12,"—For the record, I want to say that I think the word `appointment' that Senator Murray wants to interpolate is factual. That is what the Australian Republican Movement has wanted all the way through. I, of course, support the amendment as put. The Australian Greens have put forward the same amendment and support this alternative over the government's proposal.
— The question is that Senator Murray's amendment to Senator Faulkner's amendment be agreed to.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-08-12,"—On behalf of the 
 Democrats, I move the following amendment standing in my name to the title of the bill:
(1)	 Title, page 1 (lines 13 to 16), omit ""with the Queen and Governor-General being replaced by a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament"".
I move this amendment with a strong desire to ensure that the Australian electorate answers a question on 6 November which is clearly, simply and accurately set out on the issue of the forthcoming republic referendum. In doing so, and I have done this previously in the chamber, I acknowledge the work of the Joint Select Committee on the Republic Referendum in attempting to provide a wording which achieves these ends. While I regret that the entire Democrat party room did not find that acceptable, we believe we have come up with a better version.
My view, and that of the committee, has not been taken up by the government or the Prime Minister and, I understand, despite the fact that the Prime Minister rejected out of hand the committee's wording, there were differences of opinion within the government on the point. We believe the Prime Minister has come up with a compromise that is deeply unsatisfactory. The title proposed by the government is partisan and seeks to influence the vote on the move to a republic. It is no secret that the Prime Minister is not in favour of this change but rather than turning the debate over to those in the government who are in favour of seeking the change and perhaps taking a back seat on the issue—as he intimated he would do—he has not done so. He has entered this debate.
Why the Prime Minister has chosen to do so exposes his deep commitment to ensuring the republic referendum is defeated. He has taken every opportunity to influence this process. This is not a case of a half-hearted attempt at furthering constitutional reform but a concerted effort to undermine republicanism. From insisting on appointing half of the Constitutional Convention delegates rather than allowing them to be elected, and publicly misrepresenting the role of the public nomination process and the appointment of a President, the Prime Minister has engaged in a campaign of subterfuge to sink the republic. 
 However, his insistence on the wording that he has proposed is the most outrageous aspect of this debate so far.
As Professor George Winterton has stated, past referendum questions have been framed in a favourable manner designed to secure a yes vote. As pointed out in yesterday's Australian, despite blatantly favourable wording in past ballots, only eight out of 42 constitutional referenda have been successful. So, when a question like a proposed law to alter the Constitution to provide for fair and democratic elections throughout Australia does not secure a yes vote, can there be any doubt that our Prime Minister is doing all he can to ensure that this year's referendum on the republic is equally unsuccessful?
The wording the Prime Minister has proposed is not only inherently biased against the yes vote in its focus on one particular element of the appointment process—not coincidentally the most unpopular element—but also incorrect. It is inaccurate. The President is not appointed by parliament; the President is appointed according to the following processes: nomination by any member of the public to a nominations committee comprising one-half community members and one-half members of the federal parliament from all parties; formulation of a short list by that committee and its presentation to the Prime Minister; proposal of one candidate to a joint sitting of federal parliament—of course, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition and probably, hopefully, after consultation with leaders of other parliamentary parties; and vote by the parliament on the proposed candidate. If a two-thirds majority approves that candidate, then of course the process is complete. Of course, final ratification comes in the form of the parliament. It has no role in the nomination or selection of the candidate. The Prime Minister's wording is therefore deliberately misleading, despite his claims that it is unbiased, despite his claims that he does not believe in any way that there should be any perception of this debate being rigged.
The Democrats preferred the wording recommended by the 18-member joint select committee in relation to `established by the Prime Minister'. Half of this committee— 
which was established by the Prime Minister—including its chairman, were government members appointed by the Prime Minister. The wording it devised was supported by government members and strongly advocated by them. Yet the government and the Prime Minister made clear that he would have ignored that recommendation. Instead, he has opted for his own. So in order to find some way through the possible stalemate that was developing, the Australian Democrats have agreed as a party room on a much more simple, accurate alternative. What we have proposed to break the stalemate is the wording:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic.
I defy anyone to find bias or inaccuracy in that question. It is the most simple and straightforward way of putting the question to the people on the issue of becoming a republic, and it is the question that Australians are expecting to be asked. It also ensures that the process of informing and convincing the electorate takes place outside the ballot box. The minister referred in the earlier debate on amendments to the title of the bill to methods of education and information. People should know well in advance which way they will vote, rather than us seeking to influence or have a last-minute education campaign in the ballot box on 6 November. It is not an education campaign that would be accurate if we were to use the compromise wording proposed by the Prime Minister.
The Democrats reject the efforts to manipulate the vote inherent in the government's wording. We are serious—very serious—about this amendment. The Australian Democrats expressed yesterday our grave concern and anger that the amendments in relation to putting the Senate in the dismissal process went down. I cannot tell you the anger among some of my colleagues in relation to that vote, but I do not wish to reflect on a decision of the Senate. So this for the Australian Democrats is the last and most important stage, a pivotal stage as to how the Democrats vote on this legislation. Our title is unbiased, straightforward and accurate. It is a reflection of the intent of the bill that is to be put to the 
 referendum, and I urge the government and all senators to accept the simple and straightforward wording that we have provided.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-12,"—At the outset can I point out to the Senate that there is nothing wrong, mysterious or deceitful in the word `appoint'. In fact, I would simply refer you to the proposed section 60, which talks in terms of `appointment'. So we have already used in the legislation the word `appointment'. That, I think, has a symmetry with what we are talking about here in the long title, or the question which is to be put to electors on the day. Finally, in relation to informing people and any subterfuge, I would put to the Democrats that their amendment simply leaves the voter begging for more information, because it says:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic.
What form of republic? What sort of republic? This was the very point that I raised earlier, and I will not go over it again. But the situation is that there are various republics around the world. Any Australian elector going to a polling booth on the day would not be assisted in any way by this question. But to say that the use of the word `appointment' is highlighting some flaw or is in some way making the question biased is totally incorrect. The word `appointment' is in line with other language used in the legislation.
The appointment of the President would occur at the time of the vote of the two-thirds majority in the joint sitting. The only thing then needed to be done is the oath of office. It cannot be put any more simply than that. The appointment takes place at that vote. It is then acceded to by the candidate elect when he or she takes the oath of office. So the point of determination is when that vote is taken. The word `appointment' is entirely appropriate and one which has been used elsewhere. The government rejects any suggestion that that word is biased or has been used for some aspect of subterfuge.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-08-12,"—I am unashamedly a supporter of a long and factual question. This whole 
 debate is about what is left in and what is left out, and I have the personal view that the existing question could have many parts added to it to make it accurate and complete. I would add, for instance, the words `of Australia' after `the Queen'. I would add the word `Australian' before `President'. After that, I would say, `effectively appointed by the Prime Minister and confirmed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament'. Lastly, I would say, `and removable at the discretion of the Prime Minister.' So for me, the title of this bill which would reflect the reality of what we are being presented with would end up as follows:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a Republic—
and I would put a capital R, by the way—
with the Queen of Australia and an Australian Governor-General being replaced by an Australian President effectively appointed by the Prime Minister and confirmed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament and removable at the discretion of the Prime Minister.
That is factual. Some people may say that it does not have to be an Australian Governor-General, but precedent and convention now is that it is. However, you have to be realistic about these things. That preference of mine would not be acceptable to the House of Representatives and to the major parties. We then have to say, `If we can't get the full monty, isn't it better to have the shortest version and let the debate begin so people can add and qualify and adapt their views as they see fit?' The simple virtue of Senator Stott Despoja's amendment is that it is absolutely factual and allows everybody to then go on and say, `But, hey, that means we'll get an Australian President,' or for me to argue that he or she is removable at the discretion of the Prime Minister. We can have the full debate about all the qualifying clauses.
Although I would personally prefer a longer question, I can certainly live with and support Senator Stott Despoja's amendment because it expresses facts with no additional influence attached to it. Of course I would like the appointment manner of the republic to be included in it, but once you say what you 
 want included you need to go for the longest question possible. Frankly, if Senator Stott Despoja's amendment goes down, I would support the government's question as being the next best because it is the nearest to length that you can get.
This is what Senator Stott Despoja is proposing: `A bill for an act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic.' That is a fact. That is what we are being asked to vote for. A republic means many things. It means many more things than just getting rid of the Crown—many, many more things. But there is one major feature of a republic—that is, it does not have a constitutional monarchy. For those reasons, I think this amendment is a useful way around a fairly difficult impasse. My support for this, Senator Bolkus, might put the lie to your view that I might possibly be a spoiler, but if I were a spoiler I would be saying that I want `appointed' in here. That is not my motive. I want a question which either reflects the full monty or is short and sweet.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-08-12,"—I follow up from what I said last night. We obviously felt our question, a question proposed by the joint parliamentary committee, was the fairest reflection. But I also indicated last night that if the Australian Democrats were serious about pursuing their shorter question that would be much more preferable to us than the Prime Minister's question. I indicate now that we will be voting for the Democrats' proposal, but in doing so I also indicate that I do not want this to be a one morning stand, in a sense. I do not want to come back here this afternoon and be confronted by the Democrats maybe doing a shift away from this position.
We have to understand that there needs to be, and there is a public expectation that there will be, a referendum on the republic. It is in the hands of the Prime Minister to deliver that. This Prime Minister has conceded three times in the last 10 days on the question. His first question was indefensible. His second question was indefensible. We still maintain that his third question is unfair. If at the end of the day the Prime Minister says no to what 
 the Senate wants, it will be on his head that Australia will not be going to a referendum on 6 November. That is something that we in the Senate have to appreciate. We are not here to basically participate in a charade at the end of which the Prime Minister gets his way. There is a genuine concern in this chamber, as there was on the joint parliamentary committee, almost unanimously but overwhelmingly, that the Prime Minister's question is unfair, and they came up with a fair question.
We have all had and we are all entitled to have a legitimate view in what goes to the public. We are talking about changing the Australian Constitution here. When we get to the preamble question, we will make some points about how that process has been both undemocratic and contrary to the objective of nation building. Once again, there have been private rooms, secret deals and people left out with respect to the preamble. We have a chance on this particular question to broaden, as we have over recent months, the participation in developing the outcome. The preferred option of the committee was not accepted, but we think this is a much fairer alternative to the Prime Minister's question.
Instead of fixing on one or two aspects of the process, as the Prime Minister does, this basically sets out the objective. If you are going to detail the processes, then you need to detail the lot to have fairness. Like Senator Murray, I believe unless you have the full question put before the people then it will be short of expressing the objective that we are attracted to. We will support you, Senator Stott Despoja, but we would like to think that there is enough will on this side of the parliament to force the Prime Minister to once again front fairness as an issue in this debate.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-12,"—Firstly, I congratulate Senator Stott Despoja on the amendment she has put forward. We have looked at a series of alternatives which are embellishments on the core idea that the people of Australia should be asked to vote on whether or not they want a republic. None of them, I think, is going to succeed. We are left now with that core question, and that excites me a lot. This is the 
 question I believe should have been put at a referendum before the Constitutional Convention was held. It would then have been able to deal simply with the matter of what sort of republic we should have. That would have been the best course to follow.
I was in the position two years ago of changing my position to give the pivotal vote to allow the Constitutional Convention, with all its shortcomings, to proceed, and I have been forever glad that I did. I now find myself in the pivotal position again with Labor supporting the proposal of Senator Stott Despoja and the Democrats that the question be simply whether or not people want to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic. The alternative is the qualified question proposed by the Prime Minister and the government.
I am going to side with the simple question. I think it is a question that people will respect. It is a question that has a much greater chance of getting assent. I am delighted that the Democrats feel so strongly about this because it is not automatically going to receive the agreement of the House of Representatives, but a very strong message is going to go from the Senate to the government in the House of Representatives that this is the question that has to be asked. This is a non-contentious question. This is the simple, basic, bedrock question to Australians: do you want a republic? That is how it should be.
The government has said it leaves the voter begging for more information. On behalf of all of us, the government has to carry out its duty and ensure that that information is available and well understood through the education program that is going to take place in the coming weeks. I believe that Australians do not want complicated questions. They do want the information available, but when it comes to question day, they want the simple question: are we going to have a republic?
I support this amendment; it is a good one. I believe it has got us finally to where we ought to have been at the outset two years ago. I feel very honoured in this situation, as an Australian Green, to be able to make the difference in whether we have a question put 
 to the Australian people shackled by the language the Prime Minister wants or the simple question that Australians deserve; and, of course, I am going to opt for that.

Bill reported with amendments and an amendment to the title.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,1999-08-12,"—I note for the Hansard  that this is not my first speech. But I do welcome the opportunity to speak on this occasion, as I consider this issue to be a most important one in that it concerns indigenous people and the nation. I believe that the debate about constitutional recognition in this country is long overdue; it was overdue in 1901. Yet indigenous people in this country have waited very patiently for the time when other Australians would arrive at the point of being able to include indigenous people as fellow citizens and recognise that there was a special relationship between them and the land.
Personally I have always had concerns about the way this issue has been dealt with, but the Democrats' concerns about the recognition of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have to some extent been allayed. The preamble, in my view, honours for the first time Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders; it recognises them as the nation's first people. That language is significant because it conveys the notion of prior ownership as well as an understanding that our indigenous peoples are the traditional owners of our nation. As people would know, the term `first nation people' is widely used throughout North America and northern Europe by indigenous people themselves.
So, apart from the need for the preamble to recognise the past and the present, it is also a question of recognising the future rights and relationships of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders to land, to people and to national society. I think they are the issues that must be addressed on this occasion. Specific mention has been made in the proposed preamble about the unique relationship that we as indigenous people have to lands, and the value of our cultures is also acknowledged.
I believe that the argument—and the issue at the heart of the current debate—is that Australia can be shifted to reaching a point where we can begin to address many wrongs of the past. Following the decision of the High Court in Mabo—which finally, in the history of this country, laid to rest the legal fiction of terra nullius—Australians can be moved further to recognise that indigenous peoples are, in fact, the nation's first people, the original owners of this continent, whose cultures, laws, languages and customs have defied 200 years of dispossession, the stolen generations and assimilationist policies of governments. I think on this occasion it is therefore very appropriate that we are on the verge of amending the heart of the national legal framework of this country, the Constitution, to include Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and to honour the special status of the nation's first people.
It is my firm belief and that of the Australian Democrats that, if we are to begin to deal with the unfinished business that litters Australia's history, then we must start at the pinnacle of the nation's legal system, and that is our Constitution. But amending the Constitution is important—not because of its legal significance but because it provides an opportunity to deal with matters of symbolic and political significance. My conviction on this matter is due to the fact that the Mabo decision itself and the ensuing native title acts, as amended, have never been able to deliver the recognition and benefits owing to the nation's first people. In short, they have not put indigenous Australians on the map in real terms. I believe it is appropriate that national recognition of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders is given and that that is recognised in our Constitution.
I want to remind honourable senators of this house that one recent case in the Federal Court of Australia is a prime example of how the Native Title Act often fails to deliver justice to indigenous peoples. I refer to the Yorta Yorta case. This was a claim launched by the Yorta Yorta people over quite a substantial area of land and water in Victoria and parts of New South Wales. It was a claim in which the Yorta Yorta people invested a great 
 deal of hope, energy, time and money. That case began in October 1996 and concluded in December of last year. The ultimate decision by Justice Olney was that native title did not exist in relation to the area claimed, and the applicants were told that they failed to establish any continuous links with the land and that the laws and customs of those people did not relate to the time of the earliest contact with Europeans. Justice Olney therefore found that it was not necessary to grapple with the question of whether native title even existed in relation to the claim area; it was more a matter of whether the people actually existed. So far the Yorta Yorta people have not been able to prove to the court that they had an ongoing relationship with their country or with their culture.
I find the finding highly offensive. It is offensive to all indigenous people, because it fails to recognise an existing relationship to land. The ignorance of indigenous law and culture and the fear of the changes that recognition of indigenous people in national society may bring about are at the heart of the absence of indigenous peoples from the national Constitution, and we need to deal with this in a sensitive fashion.
I put on the record that the Australian parliament has before it the opportunity to put in place the foundations for our future relations between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. Perhaps the 1967 referendum provided an opportunity for people to begin to address those issues, but in the most successful yes vote of any referendum in this country, people made a promise to do something, and this is an opportunity to honour that promise.
The Mabo decision and the Native Title Act have been mere stepping stones along the road to reconciliation. In time we will begin to build further on that in terms of the Constitution. I consider the preamble that has been negotiated between the government and the Australian Democrats as one of the milestones that we must put in place. The preamble to the Constitution, in my view, and in the view of the Australian Democrats, has a very simple purpose in terms of what it should achieve for the nation's first people. Its 
 purpose is simply to put indigenous people on the national landscape of this nation. The preamble as it is currently drafted does set the record straight on so many issues that are important to Australia, but if it is affirmed by the people on 6 November, the Australian Democrats believe it will be instrumental in enabling Australians to deal with much of the unfinished business and begin to address the issue of true reconciliation between black and white Australians.
I now want to address the detail of how indigenous people are included in the preamble and, in doing so, explain the significance and meaning of the language that is used, because this is part of the confusion in the current debate. To do this, I will speak very clearly on my understanding of the words that are used now in terms of kinship, custodianship, stewardship and traditional ownership. Kinship does talk about blood relationship. It does talk about sharing of the characteristics of origin, but kinship also captures the essence of the deeply spiritual, intimate and ancient relationship that indigenous peoples share with our country. That is a relationship of oneness and interdependence. Reference to kinship in the preamble to the Australian Constitution would therefore be appropriate, but it should recognise the continuing and evolving nature of indigenous cultures and the ongoing responsibilities we bear in relation to land.
Our blood ties to land continue to remain unbroken, despite two centuries of dispossession and genocide. `Kinship' is perhaps one of the few words in the English language that comes close to capturing the connection to country that Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders feel. Perhaps if further thought were given to the idea of an indigenous word that might be used to describe that relationship, rather than an English one, that is something that I could consider supporting. I am the first to acknowledge that the English language is not equipped to express the emotions and sentiments of indigenous people in this country when it comes to our lands and waters, but this does not alter the fact that it is high time that the principal document of this nation, our Constitution, has the capacity 
 to recognise the special place of the nation's first people.
I want to draw some attention in detail to the term `custodianship' that some indigenous leaders have said should be incorporated in the preamble in preference to such words as `stewardship' or `kinship'. Gatjil Djerrkura, the Chairman of ATSIC, wrote to me earlier this week to express his support for the use of the word `custodianship' in the preamble because, as he said:
It has become accepted amongst indigenous people as the English word most closely approximating our deep and enduring relationship with our lands and seas.
When I considered the meaning of `custodianship', I failed to find any mention of this in any dictionary. The closest reference in any sense was to the word `custody', and custody is about the physical holding of, or control over, a thing without a right of claim to exclusiveness—which is necessary to constitute any possession. That is a definition which I find very limiting. Not only does it fail but it does so in many particular ways. It does not accommodate the spiritual side of our relationship to land and the responsibilities that we bear in relation to those lands. Somehow it also suggests that indigenous people are merely `holding' the land—which has a transitory air about it.
I believe that we must look further than just questions of custodianship. If we seek that as the compromise to something that I think is far better, then indigenous people in this country would only become keepers of public places on behalf of an absent landlord. This seemed further removed from indigenous people's relationship to land. Our land is not about a public building or something that is held by others. Nor are we simply gatekeepers. Our responsibilities in relation to land are much more than that regulation. We have a duty of care, of responsibility to nurture and to respect; and our very survival has always depended on our ability and willingness to learn from land and pass knowledge on to our children and future generations. It is essentially first about people and then about land. In the letter that Gatjil Djerrkura wrote to me, he 
 also evaluated the term `stewardship'. He said:
Where custodianship implies guardianship and care, stewardship evokes a sense of management or administration of the land or property of another. Stewardship therefore has the connotation that it is a temporary state awaiting the arrival of the owner(s).
That introduces a new notion into the discussion of these particular issues, which I think could become more offensive to indigenous people if adopted. That is not what I believe indigenous people are looking for in the preamble to our shared Constitution. I agree wholeheartedly with the comments Gatjil made on `stewardship'; his comments confirm my objection to the use of a word that I find offensive.
I want to put on the record that the preamble is the place for matters of national and political significance. It is about recognition, not about rights. What has been done has been done in good faith. In terms of kinship and describing the characteristics which establish a relationship of people to land, these are the issues that must be dealt with in this Constitution. There are three main issues dealt with in the preamble. It talks about people and their responsibility to each other in the context of kinship. It talks about a deep spiritual connection to land, and about a true and proper recognition of a vibrant and continuing culture. I remind everyone that in previous proposals for an alternative preamble on this question many people used the word `prior' rather than `continuing', and that is a tendency suggested by custodianship—again, in the absence of another landlord.
I accept full well the criticisms that have come from indigenous leaders since the release of the draft preamble and I understand the expression of frustration and exasperation that is shared by so many indigenous people across the country at the continuing unsatisfactory state of affairs and relations between indigenous people and this federal government. But what needs to be stressed above all of that is the purpose of the preamble, and that is to recognise the important place of indigenous Australians in the Australian community; to highlight the fact that they are the nation's first people, a term that I think 
 reflects their status as the traditional owners; and to recognise that there is a continuing and vibrant culture that has survived for thousands of years, and more recently survived despite dispossession and assimilation, a culture which continues to enrich the life of this nation.
The preamble ought to be an aspirational part of the national document. The Prime Minister has made it clear that it will not be able to be used by the High Court to interpret legislation, let alone be legally enforceable. So even if we could come up with other words that might satisfy political ideals, they mean very little to indigenous people in the end. For that reason, the concern that `custodianship' is an improvement and should be included should not be allowed to remain a divisive issue amongst indigenous people nor, for that matter, amongst the rest of the nation.
The preamble is an aspirational document. It is simply not there to do things connected with rights. It is there to talk about higher ideals, about the values of the nation. As for reducing indigenous custody figures, suggesting that there should be a turnaround in the deplorable state of health, or preventing the further extinguishment of native title, the preamble could never do those things, even if it were improved. It is about getting recognition, rather than rights, for indigenous people and to ensure that somehow it becomes the precursor for indigenous rights being recognised and codified in the main body of the Constitution. That is the only appropriate place for those issues.
It is not appropriate that the preamble seek to achieve rights issues as against recognising people. It needs to be concise in terms of what it means for indigenous people, and I do not believe that `kinship' is a compromise: it is a vast improvement on all of the alternatives that have been put forward, including `custodianship'. I do not think that anyone needs to be a constitutional lawyer to understand its meaning and the values embodied in it. The present Constitution is so dense and legalistic that few Australians could honestly say that they had read any of it or could 
 explain with confidence what role it plays in our legal system.
The preamble in this case lends itself to being used as an educative mechanism, setting out what it is that we value about being Australian, where we have come from, where we are going and what is important to us all. The preamble therefore may have the potential to raise awareness, to foster understanding, and to help Australians appreciate each other better. But, most importantly, I believe it is a significant step forward in the reconciliation process.
We still have until May 2000 to deal with the final document of reconciliation. The question has already been put on the table about the place of indigenous people, including the recognition of rights within the Constitution or by other means. I simply say today, in support of the preamble as proposed, that it reflects all of the characteristics of origin of indigenous people, their relationship to each other and their relationship to the land, in a more accurate way than any other word in the English language can.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (PREAMBLE) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-08-12,"—I rise to support the remarks of my parliamentary leader, Senator Faulkner, when a moment ago he addressed this chamber on this bill, the Constitution Alteration (Preamble) 1999 . Before I turn to what I have to contribute to this debate, let me knowledge the previous speaker, Senator Ridgeway. As he said at the beginning of his remarks, this is not his first speech. It may be his debut in the chamber, but I want to say without reflecting on any other senator or anyone that he has replaced in this chamber that it is clear from his remarks that the chamber has acquired an impressive new senator.
My purpose in entering the debate at this point is to formally move in the second reading debate the amendment that has been circularised in my name. For the sake of completeness, I read into the record what that amendment says. It says:
Omit all words after ""That"", substitute
	 ""(a)	 The Senate meet on Thursday, 19 August 1999; and 

	  (b)	 further consideration of the bill be postponed till 19 August 1999:
		 (i)	 to give Australian citizens an opportunity to consider the matter and have an input into the contents of the preamble; and
		 (ii)	 to enable the views of citizens to be considered before the Senate completes its consideration of the measure.""
That is the amendment I intend to move, and I would enjoin the chamber to gather with the Labor Party and carry this at the conclusion of the second reading debate. If it were carried then it would mean that we would meet again next week, after an absence of seven days, in order that we can listen to the Australian community and reflect more accurately in the constitutional preamble the views of the Australian community than rushing to legislation now would enable us to do.
What has been said and emphasised by the previous speaker in his debut speech is that what is before the chamber is a document agreed in a back room between the government and the Australian Democrats. It has their support. But what we need for the Australian Constitution is a preamble that has the overwhelming support of the Australian community and which unifies Australians around a set of words. You cannot do a political deal on this. This is not something open to a political fix. This is something that ought to be inclusive and not an exclusive property of the new coalition that seemingly aspires to run Australia—the coalition of the Liberals, the Nationals and the Australian Democrats. This has got to be something that embraces us all. To proceed in the way in which it is proposed that we proceed runs the very severe and palpable risk that it will rupture the unity and aspirations of goodwill that exist in the Australian community for a preamble that does embrace us all. My amendment, if accepted here, would provide a breathing space to enable the consultations to properly mature, which rushing past the ability to consult thoroughly prevents, and therefore enable, if you like, an affirmation to a preamble to the Australian Constitution which is more widespread than the narrow base of a government-Democrat deal to thrust 
 something on us at a moment's notice without the possibility of properly consulting the issue through.
And so I say to the Australian Democrats and to the government: do not take this intervention as being something to frustrate the objective of a preamble; take it as a constructive effort to try and find a preamble that meets all of our aspirations. The Prime Minister himself has said that he wants his preamble to have broad community support. This is a way in which broad community support can properly flower and be achieved. I do regard this amendment as an important amendment.
I want to offer several reasons, in addition to what I have already said, as to why in practical terms the amendment should be supported. First of all, let us go to what has occurred here legislatively. We are being stampeded. The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, was notified half an hour before question time in the House of Representatives yesterday of the terms of the new proposal for the preamble and told that the debate on the preamble in the House of Representatives would commence immediately at the end of question time. So, if the Labor Party was to consult and form a position after due consideration of all of our members, it would have required us in the House of Representatives to suspend participation in question time, given that timetable, in order to do so. I think that is unfair.
As Kim Beazley has said in the House, it is not unknown for governments with a majority in the House to put oppositions in embarrassing positions and to rush them on matters of legislation. The Labor Party was, in government, as guilty of doing that as is the present government, and so no-one has the moral high ground on that point. But this is not ordinary legislation. This is something much more powerful and fundamental. This is the Australian Constitution. This is something that binds us all. So petty political manoeuvring should not apply here. In fact, it requires a more expansive approach, a more inclusive approach, and something that does not put us in the slot in order that we be dragooned, without proper consideration. We 
 need to act in a way in which our hearts can follow our votes and our feelings can be incorporated in the final document.
So my first point is we are being stampeded. That is unfair, it should not apply and it is not necessary that this occur. My second point is that there are flaws in this preamble, as any document rushed through in urgent negotiation will reflect. It is the classic case of a committee will always agree on a camel when they set out to design a horse. The flaws in the preamble have been pointed out to the Prime Minister, and at least one of the arguments seems to have struck a particular resonance with him, and some of my conservative colleagues in the House of Representatives—whether they do it here is another matter, but I trust they will.
Let me now go to the reference to never forgetting war and the Australians who made sacrifices in time of war. That is something that Australians should aspire to—to reflect on that sacrifice, to acknowledge and respect it. The point was made by Graham Edwards, the member for Cowan, who is a disabled Vietnam veteran who goes into the House of Representatives in a wheelchair because his legs were blown off by a mine in the Vietnam War, that Vietnam War veterans will not qualify under this preamble because it was not regarded as a war. To substitute the word conflict for the word war would embrace our Vietnam veterans and not exclude them.
If you asked most Australians I think they would think it is important that we provide that recognition to veterans of the Vietnam War. I opposed the war in Vietnam at the time but I acknowledge that those Australians who sacrificed their lives, or put their lives on the line because they were required to, are entitled to the recognition that veterans of the First World War and the Second World War are entitled to. It is even deeper than that. Those Australians in the Malayan emergency in the 1950s and early 1960s, who lost their lives or sacrificed themselves, are also entitled to recognition. Those Australians who have participated in peacekeeping forces, either under the blue helmet of the United Nations but nonetheless under the Australian flag, are also entitled to recognition.
I do not want to extend the point but, by confining the preamble to the word `war' and not including in the preamble the word `conflict', we divide the Returned Services League membership and we divide recognition of those Australians who have genuinely sacrificed themselves. The question here is: did they make a sacrifice for the nation in times of armed conflict? The answer is, if you use the word `war', that there are many who would not be recognised.
Let me return to the clause in this preamble that deals with Australian Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. It is put to me by historians and Aboriginal spokespersons that the phrase that has been adopted in the negotiations between the government and the Australian Democrats is historically untrue. It reads:
honouring Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, the nation's first people,
It is put to me that the nation's first people are Aborigines and not Torres Strait Islanders. As a matter of historical accuracy, it should state it in that way. It is also put to me that the better way of stating it would be to not differentiate between Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders but simply use the phrase `Australia's indigenous people'. They would then qualify as a block to be the first peoples of Australia rather than the first people.
It is put to me by Aboriginal spokespersons that this is an important distinction and one that should not simply be rewritten for the sake of convenience, but rewritten so that we get it right historically and give proper recognition to the differences that make indigenous Australians such an important cultural underpinning of Australia's national identity. That ought to be a consideration.
It is also put to me that, notwithstanding that type of amendment, there would be considerable unrest and disaffection among Australian Aboriginal spokespeople and the Australian Aboriginal community if this preamble were to go ahead. It is important to pause on this point: do we want a preamble that provokes division in the Australian indigenous community or do we want a preamble that promotes unity? I have to vote for the block that says unity rather than 
 division, because this is supposed to bring Australia together. Let us not put something that sets Australia apart. In terms of our national identity there can be nothing more fundamental than this question.
I support my assertion on that by simply going to Mr Gatjil Djerrkura who, in reference to the preamble that we have before us, said:
The changes negotiated between the Federal Government and the Australian Democrats have served to weaken rather than strengthen the recognition of Australia's first nations in the proposed preamble.
This is clearly a lost opportunity to acknowledge our ongoing custodianship of this country.
Once again, we miss out.
Those are the words of Gatjil Djerrkura, the Chairman of ATSIC and a person praised by the Prime Minister as being a dignified and representative Australian, when the Prime Minister appointed him to the chairmanship of ATSIC. This is a significant Australian speaking on behalf of his community, as the government appointed chairman of the body that represents the aspirations of indigenous Australians.
His words are entitled to be given weight in this debate. Therefore, this chamber is entitled to pause for a week, rather than rush to legislation, to consider how a better expression can be given which incorporates his aspirations. It is not only him; he is not a lone voice. Let me go to what Mr Patrick Dodson, the predecessor of Gatjil Djerrkura, has said on this matter. And I go no further than today's transcript of AM where he said:
I'd prefer nothing. This is an absolute farce, this preamble. We ought to take it off the agenda, leave it alone. It does nothing and it contributes nothing to enhance the position of indigenous people.
There are several other quotes that I can give, but let me conclude with the last remark made by Mr Dodson in this interview:
I think that the Prime Minister needs to talk very widely with the indigenous people across Australia, not just with the Democrats, and certainly not just with Mr Ridgeway.
I make no reflection on any member of this chamber, and certainly not on Senator Ridgeway, but I incorporate that quote within the 
Hansard  because this is the view of Mr Dodson. It is not a question of whether I support his view or not. He is in many respects and in many quarters regarded as the face of Aboriginal Australia. His views are entitled to be given weight and consideration. Rather than ambush us in this chamber with a preset of words worked out in a backroom between the Democrats and the government on a matter of profound importance that should embrace our national identity, like the preamble, let us simply pause for another week, come back here next Thursday with a chance to find our way through the drafting that is now before us which causes such deep and palpable offence to such well-recognised and significant leaders of Australia's indigenous people.
Let me go to another point. We have the time to take the time to get this right. An adjournment of this debate until next Thursday will not mean that the date of 6 November for the national referendum will be endangered. It is not as if we have to do it today and if we did not do it today the opportunity would be lost. We do not have to do it today. We have the time to take the time to get it right. It seems to me that if we do not take the time to get it right, then there is a question—a substantial one—to those who want to deny us the time: why do you want to rush this through and ram it down our throats without proper consultation when it is not legislation but so fundamental a question as the Australian Constitution?
There might be some who will complain about the cost, but the cost to broad community consensus is much deeper than the cost in terms of reassembling the Australian parliament. There might be people like me who would point out that, even for the most petty and trivial piece of legislation, the normal process is: we get the bill, we get the explanatory memorandum, we have a week to consider it and then we debate it. That has not been afforded to us on this occasion. Why not? Because of the timetable for 6 November. But I repeat: we have the time to take the time.
I want to make a further point, and I will close on this. I did not intend when I started 
 to take my full time, because I know there are many other honourable senators who want to participate in this debate, and I particularly acknowledge Senator Brown, who was kind enough to allow me to go before him in changing the batting order for the speakers' list. But I come down to this—which is, if you like, a plea in conclusion. I think I have made a reasonable case that there are some flaws in the drafting. It is no offence to the drafters to say that more consideration, better and further particulars and greater wisdom brought to the issue might improve it. So let us take the time for that.
It is not a question of having an ego or a badge of honour—`We were the people who drafted the preamble'—because that will sit like an albatross around the necks of the drafters if it does not meet the objective that it sets out to meet: unify the Australian people behind inspirational words of which we can all feel proud. So taking the time in order to achieve that is a substantial thing, because at the end of the day by acting exclusively you cannot create inclusiveness. The Democrats and the government acting together here does not mean that they embrace the nation. The plea is: let us embrace the nation; let us make Australians proud of the preamble; let us achieve something that we can all stand up for. Let us not make it a partisan argument; let us make a unifying national issue. Let us take the time to do that. I move:
Omit all words after ""That"", substitute
	 ""(a)	 The Senate meet on Thursday, 19 August 1999; and
	  (b)	 further consideration of the bill be postponed till 19 August 1999:
		 (i)	 to give Australian citizens an opportunity to consider the matter and have an input into the contents of the preamble; and
		 (ii)	 to enable the views of citizens to be considered before the Senate completes its consideration of the measure"".",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (PREAMBLE) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-08-12,"—I will support that amendment, because I also believe that we need time for the input of the Australian people in getting, as far as we can, this preamble right. We are going to have to live with it for a long, long 
 time, and input from the Australian people over the next week would be very valuable. It takes a lot; I think there has to be very good reason for a move to have parliament or the Senate brought back for anything, but this is an important occasion. We are moving to the referendum at a great rate, and I think we need to—as Senator Cook just said—establish a preamble that has the overwhelming support of the Australian people, that has something which embraces us all.
I also want to commend Senator Ridgeway for his contribution. I, as a non-Aboriginal person, find difficulty in devising the right words to help in a small way assuage the unfinished business that Senator Ridgeway spoke about—a very, very difficult matter. I think allowing more time for debate in the indigenous community would be an excellent thing. But I think Senator Ridgeway has in a sterling first contribution to the Senate helped all of us to get a better understanding not only of the words devised in the preamble that we are now considering but of how the wider Aboriginal community might consider those words and the different points of view that there are within the indigenous community—strongly held points of view—showing the maturity of debate that there is on these strongly held matters.
On behalf of the Greens, I will be moving two important amendments. One is that we in fact stay with the preamble that came together under the stewardship of Gareth Evans. That preamble reads:
Having come together in 1901, relying on God, as a Federation under the Crown, and the Commonwealth of Australia being now a sovereign democracy, our people drawn from many nations, we the people of Australia:
proud of our diversity:
celebrating our unity;
loving our unique and ancient land;
recognising Indigenous Australians as the original occupants and custodians of our land;
believing in freedom and equality, and embracing democracy and the rule of law;
commit ourselves to this our Constitution.
It is half the length of the preamble before us. It is a more memorable, succinct and representative preamble to the one before us.
I commend Senator Lees and Senator Ridgeway for making something of a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The release I have before me describes the preamble as Prime Minister John Howard's new proposed constitutional preamble. It is not his preamble. It is a preamble that has come from a lot of hard work from other people, including the two Democrat senators I have just mentioned. The instant reaction of the Leader of the Opposition was one that many of us shared—that is, this is entirely different to what the Prime Minister wanted. It is mateshipless. It does not have the totally incomprehensible final sentence of Prime Minister Howard's original and badly flawed attempt to come up with a preamble. A lot more input and wise counsel have gone into this one. It is something of a silk purse compared to the original, but it still could do with some strengthening of the drawstring. That is why I, on behalf of the Australian Greens, will move two amendments to that preamble if my effort to have the Gareth Evans version is not successful.
The first of those amendments would replace the phrase `the nation's first people' with the words `the original occupants and custodians of Australia'. I note that Senator Ridgeway said that the words `the nation's first people' conveys the notion of prior ownership. I think we ought to be more direct about that and move to the word `occupants', which, of course, is ownership and more. I put to the Senate that, with the preamble that has come from Senator Lees, Senator Ridgeway, Prime Minister Howard and others, this is another way in which it could be upgraded and improved to do the job of embracing the wishes and the good feelings of all Australians, including indigenous Australians.
The second matter is a difficult one in some ways to put to the Senate because there is such sensitivity about religiosity, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, and whether or not we should have reference to God in the preamble. I will move that we delete the first four words in the preamble before us, those words being `With hope in God'. As I said yesterday, what a long way we have descended from the Constitution as it now stands. It was written a century ago 
 with reliance in the Almighty being put at the beginning of the preamble. We have gone from reliance to hope. That underscores, even in the people who have devised this arrangement of words, the massive change that there has been in Australia, the secular Australia of 1999. I believe that putting those four words—`With hope in God'—at the beginning of the preamble is to immediately cause difficulties for the 26 per cent of Australians or so who do not believe in God in 1999.
We are a secular country. I am indebted to the associate editor of the Age, Pamela Bone, who, with great prescience, under the heading `Message of belief gives faith to non-believers', has today written about Australia's changing attitude towards religion but nevertheless the feeling, as she puts it:
. . . that religion occupies the moral high ground almost as much as it always has. Belief is assumed to be the status quo. People about to give evidence in court are automatically handed a Bible. You can put up a giant sign saying ""Jesus saves"", but I'm not sure what would happen if you put up one that said ""No god exists or has ever existed"". See, I feel rude just writing it.
Pamela Bone goes on to say:
What, then, are we to make of the statement by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, that we ""cannot know"" the truth of that most central tenet of the Christian religion, the resurrection of Jesus Christ? For surely if we ""cannot know"" it, then that makes it as valid not to believe in it as to believe.
She finishes her column by saying:
The logical extension of ""we cannot know"" is that atheism is as legitimate as religious belief (and perhaps wishy-washy agnosticism is the most respectable position of all). Those who hold their beliefs unquestionably will continue to insist that theirs is the only legitimate view. But they might have to learn that tolerance is a two-way street.
The British newspaper The Independent  editorialised in praise of Carey—
that is, Archbishop Carey—
saying his millennium message was ""a breathtaking statement of the obvious"". ""More, Dr Carey, give us more,"" the paper said. Which shows just how far mainstream thought has moved away from religious certainty. There is nothing to fear in this. The best societies in the world are secular ones.
I thank Pamela Bone for that. I agree with that and I think many members of this parlia 
 ment agree with that. But we are all restrained by her original observation that you will get into trouble if you want to talk about it.
I now turn to an article by Chris McGillion in the Sydney Morning Herald on 11 April last year. He stated:
Recent census data seems to confirm the eclipse of religion in Australia. In 1971, 6.7 per cent of the population declared it had ""no religion"". Fifteen years later, this proportion had almost doubled to 12.7 per cent. In 1996 it had swelled again to more than 16 per cent.
On an age break down, the flow away from religion looks more like a flood. Among people aged 20-24, more than 22 per cent declared ""no religion"" in 1996, compared with 12 per cent aged 50-54 and only 5.5 per cent over 75.
Chris McGillion goes on to say:
A MAJOR social transition is under way according to the authors of a recent study on religion and age in Australia, Professor Gary Bouma and Philip Hughes of Monash University.
In last month's edition of People and Place , the journal of Monash's Centre for Population and Urban Research, they write that Australia was once Christian in the sense of having Christian institutions that help form personal identity, interpret life, instil values and defend morality. But no longer.
""The Pre-Boomers [those people born before 1946] are the last cohort of this era,"" Bouma and Hughes claim, ""the last to see the world in these ways and to relate to religious organisations in these ways.""
While this gulf is now dramatically apparent, it has had a long gestation.
Margie Beck, one of the authors of Exploring Religion , a text produced for students undertaking the Studies of Religion course in NSW secondary schools, says that in Australia ""historically there's been a real gap between the  Church in a religious sense and the people—right from the early days when the convicts were forced to practise as part of their rehabilitation"".
Margie Beck is quoted a little further on, and I think this is very pertinent to the matter of putting `With hope in God' at the front of the preamble. The article states:
But Beck doesn't conclude that people's thirst for spiritual understanding and expression is a casualty of the breakdown—
that is, the breakdown in support for religious institutions—
""Australians are spiritual and they find their own way of being religious,"" she says. ""More and more, 
 there is an alienation between people's lived experience and the way the churches present their message. There seems to be a perception that the churches don't have anything to offer in terms of `where I'm at', that the church doesn't meet `my needs' living in Australia in 1998. And so people find other ways of living their religious experience.""
The landscape, with its beaches, mountains, deserts and bush, is an example of the kind of place where many people now seek spiritual reflection, Beck says. In years past, they would have gone to a church.
That is my point entirely. We are all spiritual beings. I will stand in defence of people's rights to express that spirituality in their own way. During my recent trip to Tibet, I was extraordinarily impressed by the spirituality of the Tibetan people—misunderstood by the Chinese authorities—which is the driving force not to give up on their aspiration for freedom and, in particular, their aspiration to be free to follow their spiritual beliefs.
I believe that if we put in the preamble `With hope in God', with a certain intonation of hopelessness to accompany that, we are making a mistake in our secular society. We are a country which believes in the right of people to believe as they will. That is actually written into the Constitution Act of Tasmania. It is the one right, for example, that is written in black and white.
We are in an age where increasingly there is a diversity of spiritual expression which is not represented by God with a capital `G', with the intonation of a gentleman with long white whiskers sitting on a cloud and dispensing knowledge, wisdom and strength. I think spirituality is within all of us and within our collective association with this earth and this universe. If we had words to that effect, I could support it. The narrowness of these words at the front of the Constitution is something that I do not support. I think many other Australians would be concerned by this. It is divisive and ought to be left aside. That would very much improve the preamble, in my books.
I commend all those people who have thought a lot about this. It is a very difficult matter to come up with a set of words, with the necessary framework of poetry, to give 
 inspiration to us—and particularly to young Australians in the future—and something that can be learned and people can feel proud of. I have a different point of view to others on some matters, but I respect the points of view of others. I think the process is getting towards a much better outcome. Therefore, I support Senator Cook's call for a further week, at this important juncture, to get even closer to an outcome that is going to get the wholehearted support of Australians on 6 November.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (PREAMBLE) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-08-12,"—I, too, rise to make a few comments about this incredibly important issue of the preamble and reflect on the time frame that the government, in collaboration with the Democrats, have set to constrain this particular debate. There is no need to rush, and I believe that it is a betrayal of the legacy of the Constitutional Convention and every Australian who has turned their mind at any one point towards the preamble and its symbolic substance of what it means to be Australian. I do not believe we have the capacity to duly consider in this environment, in this chamber, the ins and outs, the subtle interpretations, the semantics, the pros and cons of how we can construct this incredibly important set of words.
In my contribution to the debate yesterday I read out a preamble drafted by one particular group of young people and that was one preamble amongst so many. The one good thing that did arise from John Howard's rather dubious effort to contribute to constructing his preamble was that everyone else thought that they could probably do a little better, and so many have tried. That can be seen by anyone who has engaged in public discussion or taken the time to peruse—certainly from my point of view—the vast array of Internet web sites that now host everybody's suggestions for a preamble. They have taken the time to put down their words and think about how they would like to see our Constitution begun.
To delay this process now would give us time within the public arena and within this chamber, within the constructs of the parliament, to consider it further in the detail necessary. I believe that not to do so will 
 result in a lost opportunity, particularly with respect to indigenous  Australians. You have heard my colleague Senator Cook outline an appropriate amendment which does perhaps the most Australian thing of all, that is, to say it plain—to say `custodianship' because we mean custodianship—not to try to delve into the semantics of words to suit the prejudices of some of those in this place but actually to say it how it is. This is the great strength of the Australian language, of all our colloquialisms—we are blunt, we are to the point. Where is it more important to be to the point than in this preamble?
I believe that the lost opportunity we will possibly see as the government proceed down their structured time path is actually a direct insult to indigenous Australians. It is a direct insult in its construct and it is a direct insult not to allow time for the discussion to develop. Unfortunately, the government's collaboration with the Democrats on time frames of debate in this chamber has become a very disturbing feature in the last few months. I would just like to remind those of you who take an interest in such matters that, with all of the significant pieces of legislation affecting the lives of, I would imagine, every Australian, there has been a constraint placed on the discussion in this place—the GST, the sale of Telstra, the online services bill, and now this particular debate. It causes me to wonder whether these delays are really just part of expedience, about progressing government agendas or indeed about limiting the extent to which public debate can actually develop.
Because we exist in an environment where once the words are spoken in this place they are reported in the newspapers of Australia, in different media, the population as a collective has the opportunity to chew it over, to have a think about it, to see a little editorial opinion sprouted about, to have conversations across their desks in the workplace, in the pubs, in the school yards and in the child-care centres around the country. It usually takes a couple of days for thoughts to develop and views to be expressed. That is how you get public debate, public contribution, because 
 you start to get feedback on the views of the people.
This does not happen overnight, yet the government are taking the opportunity to push through so there is no chance for that public discussion, dialogue, feedback—all of those natural processes of political communication and citizen involvement in public debate—to occur. It is a severe constraint. What it allows the government to do is extend the firm hand of their control and manipulation over it. In some respects, cynics would say, `Well, isn't that what it is all about? Isn't it about controlling it, pushing it through, manipulating opinion to suit your particular policy views?' I would argue that, with respect to all matters that significantly change the structure of the society we live in and all areas where there is absolutely phenomenal symbolism involved in what the change is trying to achieve, such as this Constitution preamble, it is the right thing to do and the respectful thing to do not just to allow public opinion and debate to occur but to actively seek it out.
The greatest irony is that at the Constitutional Convention this was actively promoted. Discussion about the preamble was one of the more dominant features of the dialogue that took place over those two weeks in Old Parliament House. Yet, despite there being a genuine expectation of and an important legacy derived from that convention that once we came here to discuss this issue further we would have an open, democratic process which everybody could feel a part of in some way, no, this government has chosen once again to constrain that discussion.
It is only fair, in my view, to be able to take the time necessary to allow fuller participation in this debate. I do not believe the government are doing that in this case and I do not believe they have done it in the case of many other matters for consideration. My colleague said earlier that there is no reason to rush this through, and I support that view completely.
—Order! It being 12.45 p.m., I call on other government business.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (PREAMBLE) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-08-12,"—I would like to conclude my remarks. The Prime Minister has not been able to find within himself the capacity to act as a non-partisan commentator on this particular issue. What a shame it is that we have reached this point in this incredibly important public debate to find that the Prime Minister of this country has chosen not to take up the mantle of being one who facilitates the progression of this country towards having a modern constitution but allows his own views with respect to the proposed referendum to shine through and overshadow the issue of substance. I believe the people who are being disenfranchised most by this debate are young Australians. A profound opportunity has been lost for this country to respect, honour and dignify indigenous Australians. I believe it will be young Australians who will look towards this Prime Minister as the one who deprived them of an opportunity to say something of profound substance within the construct of the preamble. 
Our amendments go a long way towards rectifying some of these issues, but nothing will change the way in which we have been forced to contemplate the preamble and the compromises that we have made to facilitate the progression of this issue. Our approach is one of rectifying a preamble constructed without the full participation of those who have an interest in it. I think that this, more than anything else, will be recorded in history as one of the greater indictments of the current Prime Minister.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (PREAMBLE) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-08-12,"—The Constitution Alteration (Preamble) 1999 presented to this chamber for consideration reflects a very flawed process, a joke of a process, and as a consequence is very much a second-rate result. We have here a preamble that represents an opportunity missed. It is unfortunate, but this proposed preamble has left us with a document which is essentially uninspiring. If Senator Cook's amendment is not carried by this chamber, I am fearful that we will in fact condemn a generation of children in this country to the recital of a second-rate script. We will see a product that has arisen from what can only be described as a disgrace.
This parliament has had only two days in which to consider this proposition. We received greater notice and opportunity to consider such monumental legislation as the Pig Slaughter Levy Bill, the Dried Vine Fruits Production Underwriting Bill and the Chicken Research Levy Bill. These are matters that this parliament has given us, as members, a greater chance to scrutinise than that currently presented to us as being a major document for the future generations of this country—the preamble of a new Australian Constitution.
I ask: how is it that such a situation can arise? It would appear that the Prime Minister has followed that old adage of the Liberal Party: when it comes to practical politics you ignore the facts. The preamble that has arisen is a result of a deal between the Democrats and the government. I put to this chamber that this country as a nation exists in a form far beyond that represented just by the Democrats and this government. A document such as the preamble to our Constitution ought to involve 
 all the different political representations in this country. It ought to involve the representatives of all the people of this country. We ought not have presented to us a fait accompli in the form of a document, worked out in secret as part of a deal between the government and the Democrats.
In previous times, the Democrats have said to this chamber that their view is that there ought to be a legislative program adopted based on the widest possible consultation. For instance, when it came to the question of the Native Title Amendment Bill in 1997, Senator Lees drew the Senate's attention to the fact that the Democrats were adopting amendments prepared after what they said was:
. . . long consultation with the indigenous working group which made a point of listening to, and indeed taking on board, the views of Aboriginal and other Australians from across the country, without the resources of a full department and without the resources of a range of draftspeople at their beck and call.
It was good enough in those circumstances for the Democrats to engage in a consultative arrangement. It was their view that there had to be a broad basis for consideration of such important matters. But when it comes to the issue of a preamble to our Constitution, the Democrats appear to be satisfied with a late-night deal with Liberal Party.
Is this an appropriate way in which to carry legislation in this country? I am of the view that it is not. Kim Beazley indicated this morning that he is of the view that the Labor Party is providing an olive branch to the government and the Democrats. He said:
We have said, `OK. We recognise that you have junked what you had before. Now you ought to recognise the fact that if you were serious about trying to get multipartisan support you ought to hear what the rest of us have to say. Not just us, hear what the rest of the community has to say in the next couple of days.'
That is the thrust of Senator Cook's amendment. It provides an opportunity to draw people into this process and to consult with the Australian people in a time frame which means you can still put the referendum proposals in November.
We do not have to adopt this sordid arrangement. We do not have to accept the 
 propositions that have been put to us. Frankly, they are products of a flawed process, and they are the work of hopeless negotiators. Anyone who is involved in negotiation knows that the first rule is to keep your eye on the main game. That is the key objective in negotiations. It would be wise for the Democrats to remember that you have to go into negotiations with a clear view of where you have come from and where you want to get to. It would be wise for the Democrats to not be hoodwinked by the first concession that their opponent gives them. That is exactly what has occurred in this case.
We have heard that the Prime Minister has dropped his fascination with the blokey concept of mateship in the form that he has presented. We are told that, as a consequence of that, the Democrats are prepared to roll over on everything else. He has produced a hotchpotch of words. While it remains better than the original proposals that were presented by Les Murray, they were an incredibly low base from which to start a comparison. The improvements that the Democrats have been able to force upon the government ought to be acknowledged, but a lot more needs to be done. From what we have seen before us today, there is quite clearly a great deal of work yet to be undertaken. That is why I am concerned that there has not been a proper process and that there has not been an opportunity for genuine community participation.
The community is very clear about what it wants and has made demands time and time again that the public ought to be involved in such a fundamental matter as a preamble. We have seen preamble writing competitions all over the country—in schools and newspapers and on radio programs. We saw the Constitutional Centenary Federation call for submissions, and they received hundreds. Most of the resulting preambles were far better than the Prime Minister's preamble, and a whole lot of them are a lot better than the effort we see here today. The Prime Minister's department, if I am informed correctly, received some 580 submissions. None of these has been made public. Senator Lees is in the chamber, and I would ask her: is it the case that the Democrat deal makers got to see 
 those submissions? Were any of them taken into account when you dreamt up the proposal that you are putting to us today? I trust we will find out.
The sort of secretive process that has been surrounding the business of the new preamble is not good enough. We have seen the result of last-minute brinkmanship. We are being forced to consider this issue in a manner which is totally inappropriate for such a serious question as will be presented to the Australian people in the forthcoming referendum. The process is without precedent, and there would be few occasions historically around the world of such a provision being undertaken to draft a new constitutional provision of this importance. That is why I say that it is a disgrace. Senator Lees, it is quite clear this process gets the result that one would expect from it.
This preamble is much better than the previous one put up by the Prime Minister, but it falls a long way short of a preamble that the Australian people would want and deserve. We see the reference to `With hope in God'—most public submissions that have been made have indicated that people do not necessarily want to see that in their Constitution. If it has to be there at all, you would have thought it would be appropriate to at least recognise that there are other spiritual beliefs. There are other concepts that need to be considered. For instance, 3LO in Melbourne ran a competition, and 117 people contributed to that. The two best submissions that they selected were given wide publicity. Neither of those two referred to God. The first paragraph of what we have here today clearly demonstrates that, despite the Prime Minister's wheeling and dealing about the republic, there is an absurdity in seeking to try to present this as some sort of additional concept or expansion of a view of democracy and federalism within Australia.
The biggest problem in the current draft is the way in which it deals with indigenous Australians. Senator Ridgeway has made the point that he sees the views that have been expressed in this Constitution as being far better than the original, but the original equated our first people with the flora and 
 fauna of this country and it talked about their inhabiting the continent. It would not be hard to get better than that.
We see through the public comments that have been made about the current proposals by indigenous leaders that the current draft falls far short of the rightful aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It is unsurprising as none of the leaders were involved in the process, and none of them were engaged in any meaningful negotiations about the product. That is not to say their views were not known. Anyone who has any interest in this matter would clearly appreciate the sensitivities of these issues.
ATSIC called in particular for the words `continuing custodianship' to be included in the preamble in order for there to be recognition that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are `contemporary peoples whose very being is uniquely interwoven with this land'. Those sorts of terms are not here. The ATSIC board also brought to our attention their view that there needed to be `respect for land and indigenous cultural heritage' and `recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with continuing rights as indigenous people'. You will not get that here.
What you see is a concept about Aboriginal people and their land as if they were set in time. It is not an evolving continuing process. I am not surprised that they are so cranky about this because they have not had a say. Their views have not been accepted. We are told that this preamble will assist the reconciliation process. From what we have seen today, that is most unlikely.
Patrick Dodson made the point this morning that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would prefer to have nothing in the Constitution than accept this document in its current form. This is a reference which demonstrates the bad faith that this government has shown. It has sought to salve its conscience and its behaviour. Of course, it does not want to be held up to public scrutiny. It seeks to present itself, on behalf of white Australians who have real difficulty coming to terms with the reconciliation process, as having something positive to say about the matter. Quite clearly, it falls far 
 short in that regard. The government here does not wish to properly acknowledge the articulated views and concerns of black Australia.
In my view a preamble ought be aspirational. It ought be something that attracts support rather than divides Australia. I would like to see a preamble that acknowledges social values which are in fact progressive and acknowledges that Australia ought be an inclusive and, in my view, secular society. It also ought to acknowledge a social democratic commitment to human rights. You do not see those points in this document. This is a document which falls far short of those ideals.
The majority of Australians have indicated over the past few months that white Australia does accept the legitimate aspirations of our indigenous peoples. It is only the Prime Minister and the clique around the Prime Minister who are determined to live in the 1950s who refuse to acknowledge those legitimate rights.
The Aboriginal people of this country have very little to be pleased about when it comes to the question of citizenship of this country. It is only in relatively recent times that they were acknowledged at all as human beings in our Constitution. It was only by referendum that that proposition was accepted. In the first 67 years of this country, they were not even included as citizens. Since that time, what progress has been made? We can draw attention to the statistics. We can highlight the fact that Australia is a terribly unequal place.
Recently, in a trip to northern Australia, the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee had cause to witness some of the injustices that exist in this country. We have only to look at the existence of the Aboriginal schools in this country which are appalling and we have only to look at the health conditions and the life expectancy of black Australians in this country today to understand why the talk of reconciliation under this government has such a hollow ring. We have, quite clearly, a proposition that is demonstrated yet again to be demeaning and untruthful. It is an appalling effort. It could have been so much 
 better. It could have allowed for so much more promise.
If we compare, for instance, the South African Constitution, we can demonstrate what an opportunity we have lost. It says:
We, the people of South Africa,
Recognise the injustices of our past;
Honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in our land;
Respect those who have worked to build and develop our country; and
Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.
We therefore, through our freely elected representatives, adopt this Constitution as the supreme law of the Republic so as to—
Heal the divisions of the past and establish a society based on democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights;
Lay the foundations for a democratic and open society in which government is based on the will of the people and every citizen is equally protected by law;
Improve the quality of life of all citizens and free the potential of each person; and
Build a united and democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place as a sovereign state in the family of nations.
May God protect our People.
How could you possibly compare the statement we have been presented with today with a statement like that? We have similar statements. For example, the statement of the Czech Republic, another recently formed country, says:
We, the citizens of the Czech Republic in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia,
at the time of the renewal of an independent Czech state, loyal to all good traditions of the ancient statehood of the Lands of the Czech Crown and the Czechoslovak statehood,
resolved to build, protect and develop the Czech Republic in the spirit of the inviolable values of human dignity and freedom, as the home of equal and free citizens who are conscious of their duties towards others and their responsibility towards the whole, as a free and democratic state based on the respect for human rights and the principles of civic society, as part of the family of European and world democracies,
resolved to jointly protect and develop the inherited natural and cultural, material and spiritual wealth,  

resolved to abide by all time-tried principles of a law-observing state, through our freely elected representatives, adopt this constitution of the Czech Republic.
These are noble sentiments which go beyond what we have seen here today. Just think for a moment about the consequences of adopting this second-rate proposition, the consequences for all Australians who are dispossessed and are disenfranchised and who are not enjoying full citizenship rights in this country. I remind the Senate of an article that appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald  just yesterday, which states:
Aborigines remain dramatically disadvantaged, with most black men not living to see their 50th birthday, more of their children dying as babies, and most of their families living in appalling conditions, according to new Government figures.
Aboriginal children are less likely than others finish high school, get a job, or own their own home. Their families are more likely to be homeless (or living in an over-crowded dwelling), and to be involved in child abuse cases. They are also over-represented in prisons.
How can you say that a document like this will meet the needs of people such as I have referred to? I suggest that Senator Cook's proposition that has been put before the Senate today provides us with a second chance. The Democrats, who are professed to be the great consulters, have the opportunity to test out their resolve in reality, and they will have the opportunity to support the Labor Party amendment.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (PREAMBLE) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-08-12,"—The speeches on the Constitution Alteration (Preamble) 1999 that we have heard this morning from Senator Faulkner, Senator Cook, Senator Lundy and now Senator Carr have basically all been about process, about consultation, about no consultation and about the way this document has been put together. Specifically, this process was determined by government. Yes, we could have walked away and said, `We don't like the original draft. Therefore, we will simply vote it down.' But where would that have got us? It would have meant a missed opportunity. What the Democrats wanted to do primarily was to see that indigenous Australians were recognised 
 somewhere in our Constitution, and this was the opportunity presented to us to do that.
Yes, we could have demanded that it be put though a committee process but, as we looked at the discussions of the recent committee dealing with the other republic legislation, government did not consider this was a problem for us. None of that was acceptable to government. It was their choice not to refer this to that committee. It was, remember, a joint committee and not a Senate committee. Time is now of the essence in that, unless we get both these bills cleared off our agenda, we simply will not have the referendum and this particular bill put before the Australian people in November.
So the choice came down to either the government's process or no preamble. We chose to participate in discussions with government to see if, rather than a formal consultative process, we could indeed build into the initial draft much of the comments and input from the various Net sites where people were having discussions on the preamble, from the many letters to the editor and from my mail, where there were many very good suggestions. Bits and pieces have come into this document, and indeed it is very different from the one that was initially put before us.
So, whether it was consideration by the Prime Minister and his colleagues or considerations that we took into these discussions, there has been quite a lot of change. Certainly we have listened to those who have talked about, for example, the need to recognise the environment and the very strong feelings that have been expressed to us about the word `mateship'. I do want to acknowledge the Prime Minister's great interest in that word. Unfortunately, for many of those writing to us and contacting us, it also has many negative connotations.
The basic decision was to participate to the best of our ability to get the best possible result or to walk away and see no question on the preamble. This is where I have difficulty with the comments of a number of members from the Labor Party about there not being any chance for consultation. What is consultation if it is not now putting this to every voter 
 in this country and leaving it to them to decide whether or not this indeed is acceptable? Surely that is the ultimate level of consultation.
—What about the question? What about the words themselves? What about that? How shoddy!
—Thank you, Senator. Unlike many other pieces of legislation, indeed virtually everything else that I have dealt with in my time as a senator, where the public consultation has to come before, this indeed is a matter where public consultation is going to occur after we have made our decision in this place.
We believed it was extremely important that we recognised the nation's first people, and I am disappointed that some comments in the paper today have just hinged on that word `kinship', which we believe is an improvement on `custodianship', and not looked at the recognition we now have for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders as the nation's first people. The government has come a long way on that, listening to many of the arguments back in the Mabo debate and again under Wik, for that acknowledgment. Hopefully, if this is passed by the majority of people in the majority of states, that will actually be in our Constitution.
I hope that we have before us a form of words that the majority of Australians in the majority of states will be comfortable with. I myself believe it is a strong enough preamble now that we will offend very few. At the heart of the first raft of problems was the fact that there were words and parts missing, and that put a lot of people offside. I think we now have a document that very few people will be displeased with. Obviously we are still going to have arguments about particular words, and here I want to comment on the excellent presentation by my colleague Senator Ridgeway, who expressed extremely well why he feels that the word `kinship' is not just about land but is about links between people and people and then people and land.
As time goes on over the next few weeks, a complete understanding of why we have made that distinction may be reached. I certainly will be talking with Gatjil Djerrkura 
 and others over the coming weeks. Once there is a complete understanding of why we have done what we have done, I have great faith that there will be greater support from Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders for that particular section.
I reiterate my remarks of yesterday and say I am delighted that we have got to the point where we have a real chance, in a positive way, of recognising Aboriginal people. If we had walked away and said, `No, we have a problem with process,' we would never have got this far. As for the environment, certainly for the Democrats it is an important point—and I think for all of us it is important—in that an issue that has been at the forefront of Democrat policy since we were formed is now going to be recognised in our Constitution in a manner that gives us great pride.
I would certainly like to pay tribute to the Prime Minister for the manner in which he conducted the negotiations. His willingness to explore common ground rather than stick to those words which were causing us problems, such as `mateship', has meant that we have a document that we can now present to the Australian people to give them a chance to have a say. I was very disappointed to note Mr Beazley's comment yesterday that he would consider putting `mateship' back in. I can only imagine what some of the women in the Labor Party must have thought. Certainly, judging by some of the calls to our office, many people found it a tad strange. That seems to have disappeared today—I cannot see it in the amendments anywhere. If that is the case, I am very pleased.
I would like to conclude by saying that I think we have reached reasonable common ground. If we were to have, say, six months, six weeks or a week of consultation, we may get a few different words somewhere. Inevitably, whatever the document is that we put before the people, there will be some people out there who would argue that a word, a phrase or a particular term should be changed. It is almost the sort of document that one could consult on forever. But we have a very different preamble from the one that was first suggested, and that has come out of listening, reading and consultation—certainly on our 
 part. I recommend this to the Australian people and hope that it does get the support of the majority of voters in the majority of states, which is, after all, the ultimate consultation.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (PREAMBLE) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-08-12,"—The preamble ought to express the eternal truths, the everlasting virtues and the universal aspirations that we have as people of Australia. That is what a preamble is about. The Constitution that we have been discussing is more the mechanism by which this country is to be governed—the constitutional framework within which it is to operate. The preamble is to be an aspirational thing—that is a point made again and again. What do we, as a nation, strive for? What do we look for? What do we aspire to in matters of the heart, the soul and the mind? What are the sorts of things that we say show human beings at their greatest? What are the sorts of words and ideas that inspired people like Martin Luther King, Gandhi and Mandela? What stimulated the great inspirational figures of this century and of the past—figures that we can all draw from history, whether it be from religious history, political history or what have you?
Perhaps one of the great things about the debate that we are having now is that it is a debate as to the Constitution and the preamble—things which in many other countries have been decided by war, strife and conflict. It is a great mark of the Australian character and culture that we are deciding things through parliament and a referendum. That is to be admired.
Senator Lees has just spoken, and there are some things to be said about her speech. She criticised, in the sense of wanting to wound but afraid to strike, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, for wanting to put back into the preamble the word `mateship'. That was an ungenerous expression of opinion on her part, because Mr Beazley is a truly inspirational person, drenched in Australian history, with forebears going well back into Australian history.
—Convicts!
—Senator McGauran shows the approach that he takes, which is exclusive. Convicts were the people who 
 came to Australia as the original white settlers and who were the first to be brought here. They are not the ones that intruded; they were brought here, Senator McGauran. To belittle convicts is to belittle many of the original people of the European settlement of Australia and to belittle their descendants.
It is a most uncalled for remark in a debate where we are trying to get some unity within Australia amongst people—it does not matter where they come from or what their heritage is. Australia includes heritage from time immemorial, in which lies the history of the indigenous people. It also includes heritage from 1788 onwards: the convicts who established a European presence here, leaving, I hope, a great legacy; the squatters; the selectors; the miners; those who developed the railways; those who brought federation; those who fought in wars such as the Boer War, the First World War, or the Second World War; the migrants who worked on the Snowy Mountains Scheme; and the migrants that settled around Mildura or anywhere else. All of these people are the people of Australia.
Senator McGauran, these are the people of whom we are talking, and for you to select one category of those people and in some way try to denigrate them and their descendants is a most ungenerous approach on your part. It is not the sort of mood that we ought to be bringing to a discussion as to what should be the preamble to our Constitution.
The preamble is going to be an historic document if it is adopted. Even if it is not adopted, it is an historic document illustrating what we as a nation were thinking about at this time. Because it is an historic document, it ought to be said that it is disappointing to see that so few people are speaking upon this matter. I see that, out of a Senate of 76, there are nine people to speak on one of the most historic documents to appear in Australian history. When Senator Lees cavils about the opposition's proposition that there ought to be more time spent on this bill, she cavils at a proposition put by this side of the chamber that every senator who is elected by the people of Australia ought to have a say on one of the most important documents that will resonate throughout Australian history. It is 
 disturbing that this document should come before the Senate in the rushed fashion that it has, and it is disturbing that it is not being discussed and debated as it ought to be. We are talking about a document that is going to epitomise how Australians see themselves not only in this generation but for many generations to come.
There are great concepts that are left out of this document. The senators before me have spoken of some. One concept discussed was the proposition in the preamble which says:
never forgetting the sacrifices of all who defended our country and our liberty in time of war;
It was sought by this side of the chamber to delete the word `war' and put in the word `conflict'. I have a brother who fought during the Malaya disturbance. His contribution to the country is ignored by this. That is why a word such as `conflict' would be more apt than the word `war'.
I do not want to go on and on about things but I do want to say that, had there been a full debate about this in which everybody could express what they felt about Australia, about where it ought to go and about the aspirations towards which they should strive, we might have got a better document. I am not saying for one minute that there are not some great concepts in the document as it is presented now. Of course there are some great things in it; it is a good document. But what we want for Australia's preamble is the best document that we can get because this nation should be striving for the best. For example, is there the idea of community expressed in this document? Surely that is a concept that ought to be included. The document says:
We the Australian people commit ourselves to this Constitution
proud that our national unity has been forged by Australians from many ancestries;
It has that concept of unity, but has it got that concept of common action—the ability of the people of Australia to help those less well off than themselves?
I am old enough, unfortunately, to remember the Depression when the swagmen went through country Victoria, where I lived, and how food was given at the door for them to make out in times of great difficulty and great 
 tragedy. People acted together. There was a sense of community. Following the Depression was the Second World War—again a time in which there was a sense of the Australian people going forward, striving to realise the best that women and men can manifest as people in a community.
That same sense of community was borne out in the preamble to the Constitution of the United States of America. I use the version from the Pennsylvania Packet, and Daily Advertiser, 19 September 1787. It says:
We, the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common Defence, promote the General Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to Ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
That is a short, sharp preamble which resonates. Within that short, sharp preamble the idea of the common purpose, the idea of striving forward as a community is well contained. That is missing from the preamble that is to be put through the Senate today by an arrangement between two of the parties that occupy this Senate, and without a proper public debate.
The Constitution of the United States and its preamble was much discussed. Our Constitution was discussed much throughout the 1890s; but this preamble has not been discussed much. It is simply to be put through and that is the end of that. I thought that Senator Lees was conscious of that. I also thought that a lot of her address was attached to apologising for what she had done rather than explaining how this document encapsulates those thoughts, those aspirations, those things of the heart, those things of the soul that we strive for as Australians and which we ought to put in a preamble.
As I say, and keep repeating, this is a matter not only for us but also for future generations. The sorts of words that Shakespeare captured in the John of Gaunt speech about England—`this sceptered isle'—were magic words. It is very hard, unless you are a master of capturing words, to put concepts into expression. I think if this had been debated, and debated well, then not only the 
 concepts but also the words could have been improved.
Personally, I am disappointed about the lack in this preamble of that sense that we live in a community dependent upon each other, each striving to help the other—picking up the one within our society that may be in need of that help, being generous of spirit and being great of heart. These sorts of concepts appear in other documents but do not appear here. Knowing the processes of politics, we must deal with what we have. As I say, as Australians, we have got here by the process of debate over the years; we have not got here by the terrors of war and the outrages of civil strife.
I think the preamble could have been finished better than it has by greater cooperation and greater debate amongst not only members of parliament but also the community generally, because this is a document that is perhaps one of the most important that has come before this chamber. It is disappointing to see it treated in the way it has—rushed through (and I use those words advisedly)—without the opportunity for the parliamentarians in this place, all with different backgrounds, to express their points of view.
I yearn to hear from my fellow senators—not only from my own great party but also from the other side and on the crossbenches—what they, as elected representatives of the people, feel are the aspirations of Australians.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (PREAMBLE) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-08-12,"—In this hurriedly brought on debate—as a number of my colleagues have pointed out and as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out yesterday—we are proposing a change to the preamble to our Constitution. We are doing it in such a rushed way that the parliament will have only a matter of two days—or three days at the most if we sit tomorrow, which I do not think we will be—to consider it before it is rammed through the parliament and then put before the people. We would have thought that, under any reasonable democratic process, this preamble would have been prepared, tabled in the parliament and circulated for several months, creating an open and proper discussion amongst the public about its content.
It would be amazing to believe that any of us could write a preamble in two days and then believe it could be overwhelming and automatically accepted by the people. We are a democratic society; there is always a range of views. People want to express those views about this preamble. This preamble was only thought of by the Prime Minister initially to make himself look a bit more positive when he is going around saying no to Australia becoming a republic. He wanted something to campaign on, something he was actually saying yes to rather than no, at the same time as the referendum. He wanted to be able to say, `I am thinking about the next century, not about the 1890s or about defending a hereditary monarchy.' This was his device to make himself look a little bit more relevant.
Of course, we know that his first effort of producing a preamble some months ago was laughed off the stage of Australia. It was a ludicrous suggestion. The vision of John Howard, sitting in the Prime Minister's office in his chesterfield, with a quill and inkwell, trying to be Thomas Jefferson or Abraham Lincoln drafting a few appropriate words, is amazing. And look what he produced. It was a failure. I think he discussed his original effort with a couple of other people, and he had such wonderful words in it. The word `fashion' was to be in the preamble for Australia. I do not know whether this meant that he was under the influence of the fashion industry but, in 100 years time, trying to explain to people what fashion may have meant in 1999 would have been a big ask. He also resurrected the word `mateship', which got him into all sorts of strife trying to explain what it meant. Even Les Murray said he did not think `mateship' was an appropriate word to be in a preamble. He found that, overwhelmingly, the Australian people rejected his miserable, laughable effort at producing a preamble.
Mr Acting Deputy President, you may remember that he made no effort to consult widely. You would have thought it would have been smart politics not only to consult the Leader of the Opposition and ask for an input but also to ask a range of other people in the community. No. John Howard believes 
 he is a great wordsmith. He proved himself utterly deficient in that in his first effort. Then he realised, of course, that it would not get through the Senate in the end, and he would have to do a deal with the Democrats. That deal was done 36 hours ago, and it is being rammed through here.
I have to say this is a surprising effort, in particular from the Democrats. Since I have been in this place and throughout their history, the one thing they have argued for is process: allowing time for things to be considered at length; referring legislation and ideas to Senate standing committees, Senate select committees and parliamentary joint committees; and letting bills be tabled. That is why we have a cut-off date for bills being introduced in one session; they cannot be debated and carried through until the next session. That was all part of the Democrats' proposal to have, as they said, a democratic process in this chamber. But on the issue of the preamble to the Constitution of Australia, they say they want to ram it through in two days, and Senator Lees, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, puts out a statement yesterday saying, `I am delighted that we have been able to reach an agreement with the Prime Minister on a preamble.'
She may be delighted—at least she had the opportunity to talk to the Prime Minister. Apparently, the rest of the Liberal Party did not. The opposition certainly did not; the Australian people certainly did not. I am amazed that the Democrats, who have argued for parliamentary process that is open and transparent, could make such a narrow-minded deal on something as important as this. The Democrats will have to bear the responsibility not only for drafting a preamble in agreement with the Prime Minister—although it is marginally better than the first effort that the Prime Minister came up with—but also for ramming this through without open consultation and discussion within Australia. They can say, `Let the people vote against it; the referendum is to come.' We would have thought it much better to have reached a broad consensus after debate and wide consultation in Australia so that, when 
 it goes to the referendum, it will not be a matter of great dispute or argument.
But this preamble will be a matter of argument and dispute. It will not automatically be given a tick because, as my colleagues have said, first, the content of it is deficient in a number of ways; and, second, the English is totally uninspiring. It is extremely turgid. If you asked our schoolkids to learn the preamble that Mr Howard has produced, it would be extremely difficult because there is no rhyme or rhythm and there is no poetry in it. Kids could not learn it if they tried to. It would be a really hard effort. It would be like trying to learn your times table again and again by rote to try to remember it. Remember all those great speeches and all those great pieces of literature? My colleague Senator Cooney mentioned Shakespeare. Well, this certainly ain't Shakespearian in any way.
—`Isn't' Shakespeare.
—Yes, it isn't Shakespeare, that is for sure. It isn't Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson or any of those others. It certainly is not Pericles addressing the Athenians, by any measure. We find it an extremely disappointing effort. It will not add anything to the debate about where the future of Australia is.
I want to draw attention to the proposed preamble that Gareth Evans produced in conjunction with Senator Stott Despoja from the Democrats and Senator Brown from the Greens in April. When one reads it, it is memorable; it is easy to understand, read and listen to. I can imagine kids in school being able to learn it, remember it and quote it. It is something they can take pride in because there is a rhythm to the language.
—Let's hear it!
—I will read it to you.
—He can sing it to you if you want!
—I cannot sing, Senator. That is one deficiency I have, unfortunately. I am hopeless at singing, but I will read it as well as I can:
Having come together in 1901, relying on God, as a Federation under the Crown, and the Commonwealth of Australia being now a sovereign democ 
 racy, our people drawn from many nations, we the people of Australia:
proud of our diversity;
celebrating our unity;
loving our unique and ancient land;
recognising Indigenous Australians as the original occupants and custodians of our land;
believing in freedom and equality, and embracing democracy and the rule of law;
commit ourselves to this our constitution.
It is much, much better. It is simple, to the point and something that people would be proud to say anywhere in the world on behalf of Australia, unlike the turgid effort the Prime Minister has cobbled together with the Democrats.
I want to mention, as my colleagues have, the particular deficiencies, to which the opposition will be moving amendments, in the proposed preamble by the Prime Minister and the Democrats. It has already been mentioned that we will be moving an amendment to make clear the role of our indigenous Australians. The amendment will be:
honouring indigenous Australians as the original occupants and custodians of our land and for their ancient and continuing cultures which enrich the life of our country;
We have taken on the issue, which we know is overwhelmingly supported by the indigenous people of Australia, and I believe it is overwhelmingly supported by ordinary Australians who believe in a reasonable and democratic society and want to give recognition to the fact that our indigenous people have been here since anywhere between 60,000 and 120,000 years before European settlement began.
I also want to mention that I will be moving a further amendment on behalf of the opposition as shadow minister for veterans' affairs. It is a simple amendment. The word `war' is mentioned in the draft preamble from the Prime Minister:
never forgetting the sacrifices of all who defended our country and our liberty in time of war;
The opposition will be moving an amendment to delete the word `war' and put in the word `conflict'. The reason is simple. It was raised by one of the Labor Party members of the House of Representatives, Graham Edwards, 
 a Vietnam veteran who, as we all know, suffered terrible injuries in Vietnam serving our country. He points out that Vietnam was not a declared war.
Our soldiers have served in other conflicts—the Indonesian Confrontation and the Malayan Emergency. We now have many of our service people, men and women, serving with the United Nations peacekeeping forces in not declared wars but conflicts. By inserting the word `conflict' everybody who served Australia and put their life at risk will be better covered in this preamble. We hope the government will take the amendment on board. The minister should at least talk to the former Leader of the National Party, a Vietnam veteran himself, Mr Tim Fischer, because I think he would recognise that he fought in a conflict that was not a declared war.
Our simple amendment exposes the inadequacy of the drafting of this preamble. It was done hurriedly. They did not think of all the aspects of it, and it was rushed forward into the parliament. That is why we are so angry that the process of consultation has been non-existent. I would have thought that there would be plenty of other amendments to this preamble people in the Australian community would want to propose once they have a chance to read it.
Mr Acting Deputy President Watson, I know you are a member of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship group, but I want to raise an issue that I think some members of the Australian community would want to mention about the proposed preamble and it starting with the phrase `with hope in God'. I am not a believer in God; I am an agnostic leaning towards being an atheist. I do not believe that a Constitution for a secular society should have reference in its preamble to a commitment to some religious form, because some of us in the community do not believe in any religion at all. I think the complete separation of state and church is one that should be insisted upon and should not be reflected in the preamble.
I think nearly 30 per cent of Australians at the last census said that they were non-religious in some form or other. Some actually said, like me, they had no religion at all; 
 others said that they did not follow any of the major religions. I do not think that almost 30 per cent of Australians, who are loyal citizens of this country, should be automatically conscripted by having the phrase `with hope in God'. I do not have a hope in God because I do not believe in God. That is a legitimate view I have as a freedom of conscience. I know my view may be disagreed with. I believe in the old Voltaire comment: I disagree with everything you say, but I will fight to the death for your right to say it. I think it is the same in religion.
The personal religious views of individuals should be kept as a separate issue. They should not in any way be written into a Constitution that governs us all. I do not think those of us who are non-believers in terms of God as expressed here—as I think it means here—should be asked to sign on to it. It is not the major point of the preamble, but it is a point that I raise.
I think the preamble of Gareth Evans, Natasha Stott Despoja and Bob Brown did it much better. I find that one more acceptable. They said in the opening line:
Having come together in 1901, relying on God . . . 
In the initial preamble of the original Constitution God was mentioned. I think that was much more appropriate to the way people thought at that time. It recognised the historical aspect. But for the next century, I do not believe it is necessary to have the reference `with hope in God' in the preamble of our Constitution.
I want to conclude very briefly again on the politics of this. The politics of this are awful. The Prime Minister has consistently tried to find a way in which he can undermine the coming debate on the referendum for Australia becoming a republic. He says, `I am out of it. You know my private view, but let the debate take place,' and then he does everything possible to undermine it. This preamble is a stunt to try to give himself something else to say so he does not look like he is saying no or he has got nothing to say on the major issue of Australia becoming a republic.
I am surprised, if not staggered, that the Democrats have fallen again for the three-card 
 trick with this government. They gave away to the government on the GST. They gave away to the government on the environment bill. They have given away to the government on the preamble. I only hope they do not give away to the government on the title of the bill for the republic. It is coming very close to the stage where you can now say, `A vote for Meg Lees and the Democrats is a vote for John Howard.' We in the Labor Party will say clearly and unambiguously at the next election, `A vote for the Democrats is a vote for John Howard,' because increasingly there is no separation on major issues between the Democrats and the government.
These Democrats who were formed on the basis of `keeping the bastards honest'—to use that phrase which they proudly describe—now join the Liberal Party as the bastards. They are not going to be able to survive in the political world by saying, `Vote for us at the next election because we will keep both sides honest.' They have joined one side on the major issues. I hope they do not complain when we in the Labor Party make that point consistently and strongly in the lead-up to the next election and throughout the election campaign itself.
I do not know what strategy the Democrats have decided to take by joining the Liberal Party and how they think they can get more votes. I do not think anyone from the Liberal Party is going to vote for the Democrats because they have done these deals. I suspect a lot of Democrat voters will be coming back to vote for the Labor Party and join the Labor Party as they did 10 or 15 years ago, and that is an opportunity we will take. To me, the Democrats' strategy is baffling, to say the least, if not bizarre. But if that is the way they choose to go to become a part of the government—to support John Howard in every trick he wants to impose on the Australian people—then they are going to have to live with it.
I hope at the very least the Senate will vote for these amendments from the opposition to at least make this preamble marginally useful. But the great tragedy is it is a preamble without distinction, it is a preamble without any idea of being memorable and it is a 
 preamble which in no way you can repeat with pride anywhere in the world, `This is the preamble of the Australian Constitution.' The American people are able to say with pride their declaration, starting with the memorable phrase, `We the people,' and then on it goes. It has become memorable not only in America but all around the world for the last 200-plus years. This is not a memorable preamble; it is a turgid, workmanlike piece, put together by a committee of two people who have got no distinguishing elements in them at all about literature, the English language or even the Australian language.",SENATE,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (PREAMBLE) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-12,"—in reply—I thank honourable senators for their contribution to this second reading debate on the preamble. This is a very important debate and one which should not be cheapened by partisan politics.
—Cheapened? You have rammed it through in two days, Minister.
—It has been cheapened by the fact that the opposition has referred to the fact that, because the Democrats have agreed with the government's proposals, automatically the Democrats are now forming a part of the government and they will vote with the government on all other major areas. The opposition needs to look at the record; it needs to sit down and look at the facts and see that the Democrats are quite capable of voting on issues as they see fit and that they have on numerous occasions disagreed with the government.
But what we have here is a process of consultation, as stated by the Prime Minister; a process where note was taken not only of the many submissions that were made regarding the document but also the draft preamble originally agreed to by the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Greens about the style and some of the content of the original document. So what we have is a process of recognition of what people were saying and there has been a great deal of discussion both in the media and in the parliament in relation to the preamble. It was appropriate that the government spoke to those who were willing to sit down with the 
 government and go through the wording of this preamble. As Senator Faulkner said, there was a discussion with the Democrats. But it was not as he said it—just a discussion over a cup of tea or something. It was a detailed consideration of the wording of this very important document.
Perhaps the most forceful argument that I have heard to date as to why `kinship' was appropriate and more appropriate than `custodianship' when describing the relationship between our indigenous peoples and their lands was highlighted in the speech given by Senator Ridgeway earlier. I think the Senate ought to reflect on that a moment and look at the words of Senator Ridgeway, who described in detail how and why `kinship' was a much more preferable description—it had that ancestral blood link and it had that tie much more than `custodianship', which is something you will find in British common law. That is more a 1999 description in relation to the relationship that one might have with land. I think Senator Ridgeway referred to the relationship that a landlord might have with land. I think the opposition have entirely missed the point on that and they realise it. To denigrate the discussions which took place is to completely miss the advantage and benefit that the new preamble brings with it.
Of course there are other things which the revised preamble has: the recognition of the responsibility that we have to our natural environment—and I do not think any Australian would disagree with that—and the recognition of those Australians who made sacrifices in war. `War' is used in a generic sense. To debate the fact whether a war was declared or undeclared, I think is being pedantic here. `War' is being used in a generic sense. People know what that word means in common parlance and it is appropriate that it be included in the preamble.
There has been discussion about lack of time. Can I say to the Senate that over the last months there has been wide ranging debate and discussion about this preamble, and we have time constraints. I refer to a letter dated 10 August 1999 to the referendum task force from the AEC. In that the AEC 
 states that subsection 11(1) of the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 provides that the yes and no case arguments are to be provided to the Electoral Commissioner within four weeks of the passage of any bill which is relating to a constitutional amendment. So that has to be done within four weeks from the passage of the bill. It then requires further time to finalise the text and the layout of the booklet containing the yes and no case arguments which is to be mailed out to all electors.
It then has to have discussions with the suppliers about the printing of the yes and no case arguments. The delivery of the yes and no case arguments will occur progressively from about 15 October to 19 October if the referendum is to be held on 6 November. Any slippage of time would mean that electors would not get their yes and no cases within time. So what we have here is a concise description of the time constraints that we have upon us. We are to have a referendum on 6 November and we have to meet obligations in relation to the time leading up to that. So the government will be opposing Senator Cook's motion of deferral and would say that there has been more than adequate time to discuss the preamble.
The government is concerned that the preamble be a document which encompasses conventional and current values. I believe the opposition's debate today has not pointed to any aspect of the preamble which does not meet those requirements. We have from the opposition some amendments—in fact, I think there are two or three. One is one word and there is another in relation to the description of the relationship of our indigenous people with the land. There is nothing else, yet the opposition attack this preamble as lacking inspiration. Yet all they can find wrong with it are two points which need amendment and those amendments take us really nowhere. In fact, in one case in relation to our indigenous people, it is quite the reverse. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-08-12,"—I have some further information for Senator Bourne. I am told that the ILO considered adopting a convention on child labour at its recent meeting in June 1999. The convention was unanimously adopted by the International Labour Conference, including support from Australia. The development of the convention occurred through the standard ILO committee process. In that committee no votes were taken because a consensus position was reached between the countries. Australia supported that consensus position.
The consensus position reached was that every member in the committee agreed that the convention article prevents compulsory recruitment for the use of children in armed conflict where they are aged under 18. In 
 other words, what was agreed was that compulsory recruitment for the use of children under the age of 18 in armed conflict should be outlawed.
That does not seem to be very different from Australia's position, which is, as I understand, stated in the Defence Act, that, although we can have members in the armed forces under 18—I think from the age of 17—members under 18 are not liable to serve in the defence forces in time of war. It is a slightly different way of approaching the matter but it does not seem to me to be particularly different in terms of outcome.
The only other bit of information that I have that might be of benefit to Senator Bourne is in relation to the same issue and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I am told that Australia is a strong supporter of the draft optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and that we fully support its goal to raise the minimum age limit from 15 for recruitment into the armed forces and participation in armed conflict. We are also continuing to participate actively and positively in the negotiation of that optional protocol. I think that substantially answers the question that Senator Bourne asked.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Defence Force: Minimum Age for Hostilities</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1

Madam President, I point out that Senator Allison sought leave to move a motion which means, with respect, that the first thing you would have to do is ask whether leave is granted.
—She does not need leave. She sought an answer from Senator Ellison. I do not know whether he was given notice that she would be asking the question. Not having received a response from Senator Ellison, Senator Allison is entitled to move the motion that she has just moved.

If that means that the motion passes, so be it. If we cannot meet the order of the Senate we will give an explanation, as is the usual practice in this chamber.

The PRESIDENT —Senator Allison has moved a motion. To reverse that she would need to seek leave to withdraw it.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order, but you might have covered the point I was going to make in that most judicious ruling that you have just made—that is, there is a motion before the chair that has been moved by Senator Allison.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-08-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) to questions without notice asked today.
In my remarks today I want to concentrate on Senator Herron's answer to my question regarding aged care because the minister in his answer agreed with the propositions I put to him, which were that there was a great deal of confusion and concern among elderly Australians about some of the confusing and administratively disorganised correspondence they are receiving from the Department of Health and Aged Care regarding the income tested fee for residents in nursing homes. The minister conceded that up to four per cent of those residents—that is, 5,500 elderly Australians—were caught up in this bureaucratic nightmare regarding the income tested fee. He concedes there is a problem. He concedes that the minister, like everything else, is looking into it. Mrs Bishop, the Minister for Aged Care, looks into everything but nothing ever happens. This is a problem that has existed since the aged care reforms were introduced by this government.
We had the advantage recently of the Audit Office report into the implementation of those reforms, which highlighted some of the problems associated with the income tested fee. That report was a useful adjunct to the Productivity Commission report which also found that the government's aged care reforms had failed, that in terms of the income tested fee they are not raising the money predicted. There is a real problem in terms of their efficiency in any event, but the bureaucratic and administrative nightmare that has been foisted on elderly Australians by the income tested fee has to be seen to be believed.
It would be a joke if it were not so serious because lots of elderly Australians, people in their 80s, are getting letter after letter from the department giving conflicting advice about what their aged care is going to cost them, giving conflicting advice about previous decisions, and are getting letters arriving on subsequent days giving conflicting advice. Providers are at their wits end. Elderly Australians are confused, worried, and really concerned that they may not have anything 
 left from their pensions or other income to support their own personal needs because they keep getting these advices about changes in their fees.
The incident I referred to in my question today is just one of many. We had an elderly Australian receive advice on 12 November that they would be charged $36.75 a day, backdated to 16 September 1998. On 23 April 1999 the department advised the provider that the resident should not have paid any fee and had to have over $6,000 refunded. On 30 June 1999 the department then advised the provider that the same resident should have been paying the $36.75 a day and over $10,000 had to be collected in backdated fees. Think of the anguish, the concern, that these people have been through as the department mucked around with refunds, changing its mind, and eventually the family of this resident had to find $10,000 in backdated fees. This has caused real upset, real concern.
But that is not an isolated case. Interestingly, today the minister confirmed that up to four per cent of nursing home residents—5½ thousand people—are affected by these sorts of things. In another case the department sent three letters in two days advising of three different levels of fees for the same resident. It seems to me that, even by bureaucratic stuff-up standards, that is a record. This was a letter to an Australian aged in their 80s, who is having to cope with that sort of bureaucratic confusion and worry. There have been a number of cases in recent times where the residents have actually been advised to divorce in order to better cope with the administrative complexities of this income tested fee.
We also have a situation where the rate of the fee for residents who are in receipt of an overseas pension can change with every fluctuation in the exchange rate. So they are having fortnightly changes to the amount of the fee they are paying. There you are, an elderly resident of a nursing home, and your fee changes fortnightly—you get a separate advice—because the exchange rate has changed. We have examples of providers receiving advice from the department that they have to charge a resident a fee of 1c a 
 day as a result of their calculations. The whole thing is a complete nightmare, and it is causing a great deal of stress to elderly Australians. The government has had over two years to sort out this mess. The minister said today, `We're looking into it.' They have to do more than look into it. They have to fix it, and fix it fast. It is not good enough to just say, `We're looking into it.'

"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,1999-08-12,"—Here we go again: the Labor Party grizzling and complaining about areas and issues they had adequate opportunity to redress during their 13 years of government, and they did nothing. The motion before this chamber at the moment is to take note of all the answers given by Senator Herron today. There is a variety of them, not least the one that Senator Evans has just raised about the issue of aged care. I have to say that the hypocrisy of the Labor Party in raising the issue of aged care just rings so loudly in the ear that it is breathtaking. This comes from a mob who held the purse strings of this country for 13 years and who ran aged care institutions into the ground. So many of them did not comply with health standards, fire standards or safety standards, yet they criticise the coalition government for increasing expenditure and starting to get the issue well and truly under control. I just think that is absolutely and utterly objectionable to the Australian people at large.
That is to say nothing of another question, raised by Senator Crowley of Senator Herron today, about CJD. The CJD issue is not a new one, and anyone would know that. This issue was very much a problematic one that confronted the Labor government. The previous Labor government did not do a thing about it.
—Rubbish! Who instigated the Allars inquiry?
—It is not rubbish. Senator Forshaw, unfortunately, was not part of the committee system that assessed this matter many years ago. If he had been, he would not have made the stupid, inane interjection that he did. The fact of the matter is that it was a bipartisan position, taken when the Labor Party were in government, to try to resolve this issue. When the coalition came to 
 government, the Labor Party suddenly had a different position. They wanted a public inquiry—a public inquiry they had steadfastly resisted when in government because there was a will by both of the major parties to resolve the issue peacefully, quietly and without causing anxiety and angst to those affected. But, oh no, while there is political mileage to be made, then, once they are in opposition, the Labor Party change their tune.
Today we see Senator Crowley yet again pushing this issue when in fact, through the excellent chairmanship of Labor Senator Mark Bishop throughout the inquiry into this issue, it was resolved quietly and considerately for those who were affected. It was a unanimous report, brought down by all parties, and was given due consideration by the minister. The minister then agreed to provide compensation to those affected. So this whole issue, while being exceptionally serious, was not politicised until now.
There has been a change in the chairmanship of that committee. Senator Bishop, unfortunately, is not the chairman of that committee anymore; Senator Crowley is. Now, Senator Crowley is politicising the issue. I would encourage Senator Crowley not to politicise an issue that has so seriously affected so many people, not just in Australia but throughout the world, and to show a little of the sensitivity that should be accorded to those people for something that is very important to their lives and their safety and security. I think it is a very sad day when these issues are further politicised when there has been agreement by both parties not to do so.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Aged Care Residents: Means Tested FeesPituitary Hormone Injections: CompensationHealth Insurance: Pre-existing AilmentsGenetically Modified Food</title>,Questions Without Notice,26,1
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,1999-08-12,"—I do wish Senator Knowles would take heed of her own words. I asked a question today of Minister Herron about a matter of concern that follows from, as Senator Knowles accurately said, the agreed position of all parties on the outcome of the inquiry. It was agreed that there should be $3 million available for recipients of the pituitary hormone injections which placed them at risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. As I said to the Senate during a supplementary question today, I was assisted by Senator Herron's informa 
 tion about the new variant CJD, which, on all the evidence, has not affected anybody in Australia.
No, Senator, I am not politicising this, but you may try to make some points by doing it yourself. But I am very concerned, on the information that has come to me and, I am sure, has come to you, that the definition of `mental disorder' which makes people eligible for the funding under this $3 million is so restrictive that many of the people who otherwise might have thought they would be eligible will be denied access. What we want is confirmation that the $3 million will be available to people who have a whole variety of mental health illnesses, in the face of the evidence that they could one day get CJD.
Senator Knowles is leaving the chamber, and it is entirely appropriate for her to do that. She should know that her standing up here and saying that Labor did nothing for 13 years is falling on extremely deaf ears. One of the things the Labor government did was to establish Medicare. Everybody knows Medicare belongs to the Labor government. And what did Medicare do? Medicare said that the two million Australians who had no health insurance before the Labor government came into office would never again have to worry about whether they could afford to be sick and to seek medical and surgical treatment in this country. Medicare took away that great fear for Australians, particularly for the two million people who were previously uninsured. Even Mr Howard says, `Despite everything, we couldn't possibly move away from Medicare. It is so liked by the people of Australia.'
Labor did lots in government, and it had more to do, just as some of the things that the coalition government have done need to be closely examined. Senator Evans is quite right to ask, `Is this government really writing three letters about the same kinds of costs to people in private nursing homes?' If it is, most people would sensibly say, `Whoops! That's not a very good solution at all. We must have a look into that.' It would be much better to acknowledge that there has been a major stuff-up if people are getting three letters saying `pay more', `pay less' and `pay 
 nothing'. That is only going to confuse, frighten and terrorise people. A government should be able to say, `Something's gone terribly wrong. We'll look at it.'
It is very important that we are able to say that this coalition government has it very wrong when it comes to health care. The premiers of all the states and the chief ministers of the territories have asked that there be an examination of health costing and health funding in this country because they believe the situation has got to a point where there is an absolute need to have a look at what is turning out to be insufficient money to run our country's great public hospital system. Some $1.7 billion can be found to supplement and shore up private health insurance. We do not know how many extra members it has, but it will be very few. These are precious dollars that are not available to go to our public hospital system where thousands of Australians expect to be able to have excellent care—medical, surgical, childbirth, et cetera—provided to them as they have had in the past and without too much of a wait. This is now under threat because of insufficient funding.
There is a need for an inquiry to look at the best way of managing precious health dollars in this country. That is why I am delighted that the Senate has approved an inquiry into the whole question of health funding, which I hope will be adequately assisted by the coalition government and will not have to enjoy the particularly stupid point-scoring political nonsense of Senator Knowles. When there are problems to be addressed—and there clearly are—the government of the day has to cop the odium attached to them. That is best done by saying, `Whoops! That's not going right. We'll fix it.' Letters to people in aged care and insufficient funding for our public hospitals deserve this government's full attention, not scornful, pointed dismissal.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-08-12,"—Today the Labor Party has shown how disorganised it is, because it cannot focus on one issue. It has to trawl across the whole 
 gamut of health. It shows that it has no focus. When Senator Evans was speaking on all the answers that Senator Herron gave today, Senator Evans gave an example of a nursing home resident who he claimed had had a number of letters with different amounts of money in them. I always take these examples of the Labor Party with a grain of salt because often, when you look at them very carefully, there is an explanation.
—You were very good at exposing them yourself! You chased them!
—I did not interject when Senator Crowley was speaking. She may show me the same courtesy. Senator Crowley is now leaving the chamber—that might be useful; I will be able to get on with what I have to say. Senator Evans gave an example. We always take what they on the other side say with a grain of salt until we see the evidence to make sure it is an actual case and can be explained. When I look at that example, one wonders—and I do not know—whether it might be explained by the fact that an aged care bill was to be brought into the chamber in the last session. The Labor Party held up the bill and would not agree to it being treated as non-controversial, and that has created a number of problems for older people who are moving from one nursing home to another. Labor come in here and cry crocodile tears. They contributed to a number of problems associated with fees for older people because they failed to cooperate and assist in reducing the problem that was there. As a result of Labor's cynical and unnecessary delays, a number of older people have faced difficulties when transferring from one nursing home to another. Labor have not allowed us to implement an election commitment to ensure that residents of nursing homes who are moving from one nursing home to another are not required to pay an accommodation fee.
There is not one ounce of grace or concession on the other side. I have often stood in this chamber and given credit to the Labor Party for the reforms they brought in for hostels. In Australia, we have some of the best aged care facilities at that level for people who are less frail. But Labor failed to 
 bite the bullet when it came to reform for nursing homes. They left nursing homes in an appalling mess. They initiated a report—the Gregory report—and it was pointed out to them that 75 per cent of nursing homes did not meet building standards, that 13 per cent of nursing homes did not meet fire standards and that 11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet basic health standards. They cut capital funding to nursing homes by over 75 per cent in the last four years of their government. There was no access to private capital for nursing homes, and proprietors had to rely on government funds. The banks were reluctant to lend money to providers of aged care on this basis.
Objective standards of building quality were not enforced. There was no protection of hostel residents who were placing their money into hostels as an ingoing. There was no way of ensuring that that money was safe. They put the family home in the assets test for hostels. Fees and bonds were virtually unrestricted in hostels; they could charge any amount of fee or bond—it was not capped. There was no funding support for residents suffering from dementia. In fact, for some bizarre reason, there was an active process of not supporting dementia specific facilities. I was given the reason once, for example, that dementia residents had rights and I argued very strongly that people without dementia resident in nursing homes also had rights.
The funding was based on where a person lived, not on their care needs. There was no flexibility for providers spending money on residents. Nursing homes and hostels were separated; that is, if you were in a hostel out in the country and you became frailer, there was no way—if there was not a nursing home in your small town—that you could stay there. You were not allowed to age in place; you were sent to a nursing home sometimes up to 150 kilometres to 200 kilometres away from where you lived—from where your family was and your spouse lived.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-08-12,"—I also rise to take note of the answers given today by Senator Herron to various questions. I should probably state that, 
 in taking note of the answers of Senator Herron, you are really taking note of non-answers. If there is one thing constant in politics—and there is not much—it is that, whenever Senator Herron gets asked a question in question time, he cannot answer it. He either has to take it on notice and get back to the person who asked it or he stands there and fumbles around, generally reading from a brief regarding another issue. And, if he cannot find another brief, he tries to have a stab at it and reinvent history as he goes along. We saw that today. For instance, on the issue of private health insurance, once again he said, `Oh well, you know the figures are going to come out today and they are going to show that there has been an improvement in two quarters.'
Of course, what he does not say is that this government has allocated in the vicinity of $1.7 billion of taxpayers' money to try to prop up the private health insurance industry. And the only reason there has been any increase in the membership of private health funds—if indeed there has been—is because people know that they can join a health fund at the lowest level of cover and thereby escape the imposition of an increase in their Medicare levy, and they can still, when they get sick, go to a public hospital. Senator Herron won't tell you the full story. He just waffles around in here and tries to hold out hope that one day things are going to get better in the private health insurance industry. Under this government, they are certainly not going to get any better. We know that, and yet they will continue to waste taxpayers' dollars in huge amounts to try to prop it up while, at the same time, starving the states of much needed funds for the public hospitals.
Turning to the other issue of aged care, the other thing that is constant in this place after question time is that, if Senator Knowles gets on her feet to take note, what you are going to get is the most pious protestations about the so-called wonderful things that this government has done and a bucket job that she will try to drop on the Labor Party. Again, she will always distort history. She did it in her taking note of answers today. She said that the Labor government did nothing 
 with respect to the issue of CJD—Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This is simply not true; it is an absolute distortion of the truth. For people who may not know, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a terrible disease that may only become evident many years after the patients under those human growth hormone programs first commenced their treatment.
It was during the years of the Hawke Labor government when this situation really came to public prominence and, as a result, the Labor government and the then Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, instituted what was called the Allars inquiry into CJD. The previous Labor government took steps to deal with the issue, but it was not an issue that had commenced under the term of the Labor government. It was a problem that could be traced back many years to when Liberal governments were in power. I would not want to suggest that it was their fault because the fact was that, around the world, it was not until many years later that the medical fraternity discovered the links between CJD and some of the treatments such as hormone growth treatment and were able to take steps to try to deal with it.
The question that Senator Herron was asked today was about the recommendations of the last Senate inquiry, which I sat on as a member—contrary to what Senator Knowles would try to imply—and which recommended that compensation be paid to persons who, while they may not have contracted or may not contract CJD, nevertheless have suffered psychiatric stress or trauma because of the very real fear that they may contract it and felt anguish because of the situation that they found themselves in, having been on those earlier programs.
Finally, in the time that I have left, I asked Senator Herron a question about genetically modified organisms. What did he do? He stood up and essentially read back to me a communique that I had in front of me that the public would already have been aware of.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-08-12,"—I follow on from the previous speaker, Senator Forshaw, in his criticisms of Senator Herron. Fancy a unionist of his background 
 coming in here and criticising one of Australia's leading surgeons with regard to health issues. He would have more knowledge about health in his little finger than you would have in your whole body, Senator Forshaw, bar your briefing notes. You have to admit that.
Senator Sherry interjecting—
—Order, Senator Sherry. Senator McGauran, would you please address the chair.
—Madam Deputy President, I am sure that Senator Herron does not know too much about unionism, but he knows a lot about the health system and health care and what is needed. He is one of the most valuable senators, one of the most valuable parliamentarians and representatives in this parliament on this particular issue. On the flip side, in the other house we have Dr Wooldridge as the actual minister. You could not possibly criticise overall, Senator Forshaw, Dr Wooldridge's contribution—
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. My point of order goes to relevance. Senator McGauran has criticised my colleague on the basis of his being a unionist and he has criticised Minister Herron as a leading surgeon. I would argue that that is not relevant to the debate. If it is relevant to the debate, then we should take account of the constant criticisms by Premier Kennett of Senator McGauran.
—Order! There is no point of order. However, I am sure that Senator McGauran is going to get back to the answers delivered by Senator Herron.
—I am, Madam Deputy President. I am setting the stage for the fact that both the minister in this chamber and the actual minister in the other house whom he represents have an expertise and know the health system back to front. Those opposite have some nerve to come in here and pretend that they know something about the health system. I can go through what these two ministers have achieved. As a National Party member, I just want to recognise what 
 Dr Wooldridge has achieved in his short time in the ministry.
I remember one of your previous health ministers. At one stage you had the nerve to make Senator Richardson the health minister. He had no expertise at all.
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. My point of order is: does Premier Kennett have the appropriate qualifications to criticise Senator McGauran, his own colleague, in the way he constantly does?
—Senator Sherry, there is no point of order. What you have just put is frivolous. Senator McGauran, I am sure that you will get back to relevance in relation to the actual answers given today, thank you.
—I want it on the record that, with regard to rural and regional health, Dr Wooldridge has acted like no other minister in this portfolio before has. Only last week he opened up in the City of Shepparton, in my state of Victoria, a rural health education centre where university students—
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I know that a certain latitude is allowed and I know that the responsibilities of the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the minister representing him cover the areas of rural and regional health. But the questions asked today of Senator Herron, from what I recall, related to aged care, the CJD issue of compensation and the issue of genetically modified food. Private health was raised in one of the answers by the minister, but at no stage do I recall any specific question being directed to the issue of rural and regional health, being what could be described as a discrete area within health.
—I am sure that Senator McGauran is going to address the answers that were given.
—I am, Madam Deputy President. But it must be noted that Senator Forshaw stood up and criticised our performance and our ministers on this side of the house. I was simply acknowledging the good work that they have carried out in their time in the portfolio.
 But, as you said, the issue of the private health system was raised, and the government never misses an opportunity to make this point in regard to private health insurance: when you came into government in 1983, we had a very healthy private health system. At that time, 65 per cent of Australians were in the private health system. Back then, because 65 per cent of Australians had private health cover, there were not the same pressures on the public health system and on our large public hospitals as there are today. But by the time you left office, it was 34.5 per cent and tumbling.
We immediately took on this crisis, something that you never did. I must admit that I did joke that you made Senator Richardson health minister at one stage. Senator Richardson did try to do one good thing, and that was to encourage Australians to go into the private health system. But he was quickly and duly rolled, and not just by his Prime Minister who I remember quite well said, `Senator Richardson would be a very brave man to bring that to cabinet.' And he did. He was a brave man, but he certainly got rolled. But that was the whole philosophy of the other side. You never saw the crisis in regard to private health.
—We did not waste the billion on it that you did.
—Senator Forshaw seems to think that an incentive to get people into private health insurance, a 30 per cent rebate scheme which we have brought in, is a waste of money and time. It is working, Senator Forshaw. If you look at the latest figures, we have halted the tumble. In fact, private health insurance has jumped ever so slightly.
This will be a cultural change over time. These incentives take time to take effect, and you will see the uptake of private health starting to increase, certainly from the low base of 34.5 per cent that you left us with. With more incentives on the way—because Dr Wooldridge is forever studying this most important issue that is so costly to us—you will find that the percentage of the population electing to be covered within the area of private health will start to climb. Hopefully, 
 within the next few years, it will climb up to 40 per cent at least.

I think it is incumbent on the minister to give the Senate good reason for the motion that he has moved. I presume it is because he is expecting that debate is going to continue after 6 o'clock.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-08-12,"—In my reply, which ends the debate on the second reading, can I say that the vote that we have just seen will ensure that there is a referendum and that I think that is an historic occasion for Australia. In light of that, I would urge senators opposite and those who are not minded to support the preamble proposed by the government to do so, because it would provide an opportunity to put to the people of Australia the question not only of whether Australia becomes a republic but also of whether for the first time they would like have a preamble in the Constitution.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-08-12,"—This is a bill which proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 to provide that customs duty is not payable on goods imported on a temporary basis for use in the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games, certain events in the Sydney Cultural Olympics and a number of events leading up to these Olympics. No duty will be payable on these goods on the proviso that such goods are exported by the end of the year 2000. A regulation to this extent has already been made. The bill essentially gives legislative support to this regulation.
The goods which will be covered by the provision are the vast amounts of infrastructure items such as desks, tents, chairs, et cetera, which will be—and in some cases already have been—brought in by SOCOG. Also covered will be motor vehicles, telecast technology and any other goods which will be imported specifically for use in relation to the Olympics and related events and which will be exported again once these events are completed. Duty will become payable if the goods are used in contravention of the regulations—for example, for a purpose other than one related to the Olympics or associated events, or if the goods are not exported before 31 December 2000 without the grant of an extension of time.
In order to ensure that there is a clear audit trail for all temporarily imported goods, the bill provides Customs with the power to demand information regarding the goods on importation. Owners of the goods must also notify Customs of their intention to export the 
 goods without entry documentation so that Customs has a complete record of the movement of the goods. The bill will reduce the administrative complexity involved with the large numbers of the goods temporarily imported into Australia for the Olympics and related events and will ensure that Customs is able to track these goods to prevent them from illegally entering the domestic market.
The opposition supports the passage of this bill through the parliament, although it is a matter of concern that SOCOG has a need to import so much of the infrastructure for the conduct of the Olympics. It is a concern to the opposition that Australian companies were not able to win tenders to supply these goods. There is also a concern on the part of the opposition about the technology which will be coming in with broadcasters. It highlights the fact that Australia appears to be behind other nations in that regard. The question must be asked: why are our major television stations behind in digital technology? One wonders whether the government is looking at the initiatives in this bill to reduce administrative problems to see how they could be applied across the board. Having said that, the opposition will be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>CUSTOMS AMENDMENT (TEMPORARY IMPORTATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-08-12,"—I thank Senator O'Brien for his contribution to the debate. This bill relates to customs preparations for the Olympics, and the bill has two functions. For goods temporarily imported for the Olympics, the bill sets 31 December 2000 as the last date for those goods to be exported, otherwise duties and taxes become liable. For goods temporarily imported for the Olympics, the bill requires submission of a formal application to Customs which contains details of the importer and the goods to assist in the audit and acquittal of the eventual export. This bill is important as it puts in place measures and dates for goods that are temporarily imported for the Olympics and the Paralympics. I have noted the comments made by Senator O'Brien with regard to the activities of SOCOG, and I trust that he has taken the opportunity to raise those same issues with the Labor government administra 
 tion in New South Wales. I commend the bill to honourable senators.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-08-12,"—This legislation has some history in that most foreign international carriers operating into Australia are not subject to the Rome Convention of 1952, which was well intentioned at the time and was designed to limit the liability on industry arising from damage to persons and property on the ground. In the time when the convention was drawn up, the industry was in its infancy, and it is arguable that it was inappropriate for the industry to be required to meet the extent of the compensation that might be necessary in some of the greater calamities that might have occurred. However, the position has now changed, and that limitation is no longer valid. It is especially inappropriate when prompt and adequate compensation is to be considered for innocent victims of air accidents.
The involvement of the non-flying public who are injured as third parties on the ground is obviously not a matter of their choice. A 1952 convention should not be applied to them at this stage. As far as the opposition is concerned, what also highlights the situation as to the need for change is that the situation that applies when operators of aircraft registered in non-convention countries fly over Australian territory is quite different. While these operators are also subject to strict liability, there is no statutory limit to the compensation payable by them. As a consequence of these circumstances and Australia's adherence to the Rome Convention, damages received by victims of an accident caused by an Australian registered aircraft—such as Qantas or Ansett—on an international flight 
 are likely to be substantially less than if an aircraft of a non-convention country—such as Japan, the UK or the United States—was involved. This variation in the levels of compensation creates uncertainty, can increase the costs on the judicial system and on the parties, and can increase the levels of litigation necessary to obtain better compensation.
This bill will have the effect of making all aircraft coming within its jurisdiction subject to strict and unlimited liability, and it will bring them into line with the great majority of foreign carriers who serve the Australian market and aircraft in the majority of Australian states. As this will require the repeal of current legislation, this bill needs to be passed—that is, the current legislation giving effect to the Rome Convention needs to be set aside. Australia's participation in the convention will be formally renounced, as I understand it, at a time consistent with the new act coming into force. The opposition supports these measures and commends the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>DAMAGE BY AIRCRAFT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-08-12,"—The Australian Sports Commission Amendment Bill 1999  is designed to facilitate the exchange of information between the Sports Commission and the Australian Customs Service about the importation of, or any attempt to import, perform 
 ance enhancing substances. The Labor Party support this legislation as it is a continuation of the policies first introduced by Labor earlier this decade when we established ASDA—the Australian Sports Drug Agency. When ASDA was established by the Labor Party, it signalled the first time in the world that a drug agency had been created under government legislation. Its purpose was to ensure that Australian athletes were able to compete and perform in an environment unpolluted by performance enhancing substances.
Performance enhancing drugs and other substances that are illegally used in competitive sport have caused a great deal of damage to both international and domestic sporting competitions. When ASDA was first created, one of the key aims of the then Labor government was for the agency to act as a deterrent to any athlete who might consider using prohibited substances. To achieve this goal, ASDA implemented a variety of strategies based on policy advice, education, advocacy and deterrence. In 1996-97, ASDA performed a record number of anti-doping tests. Its dominance in preventing the use of illegal substances in sport is such that ASDA now estimates that 99 per cent of athletes have been deterred from participating in banned doping practices since its programs began. The success of Australia's Sports Drug Agency is highlighted by the fact that it has not had a single successful legal challenge against its testing programs.
We are proud that ASDA has proven itself to be worthy of the exceptional international reputation it has gained. The Australian Sports Commission Amendment Bill 1999  seeks to build on this platform created by Labor. Its stated purpose is to enhance the Sports Commission's role in working with other sporting organisations to provide a competitive environment untainted by performance enhancing drugs. The main provisions in this bill are designed to establish a structure that facilitates the exchange of information about the importation of banned substances from the Australian Customs Service to the Sports Commission. This information that Customs will be supplying to the Australian Sports 
 Commission will not be about individual athletes that have been confirmed as drug cheats, rather the information will detail situations where there exists a possibility of an offence being committed.
There are, however, a few aspects of the bill that are still to have the procedural aspects finalised, and we will take the government's assurances that these measures will be properly enacted. First, there is the vexed question of what actually constitutes a performance enhancing drug. ASDA and the Therapeutic Drugs Administration are well positioned to provide these details, particularly as the nature of what is considered performance enhancing does change depending on circumstances. Nevertheless, the government should have provided concrete definitions in this legislation. Some recent incidents involving sportspeople demonstrate that some substances that may be legally used outside of competitive sport are nevertheless illegal if used by competitive athletes. To their credit, the government have already implemented the  Australian Sports Commission Amendment Bill 1999 , which establishes an Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee to adjudicate on situations where athletes need to take medically prescribed drugs that may also be deemed to be performance enhancing.
The second issue of concern that we have with this bill is privacy. The bill outlines fairly restrictive conditions covering privacy. However, an analysis of the bill shows that there is no provision for any redress if an individual has personal information unlawfully disclosed. We have been assured that all privacy measures will be strictly observed and that the Privacy Commission has given the nod to this legislation. Although the government could have done more in this respect, we are satisfied that the appropriate privacy legislation will be sufficient to ensure protection of our athletes.
Given that Australia is hosting the next Olympics and that we have an excellent international reputation for dealing with drugs in sport, Labor will support this bill without amendments. Yet we remain disappointed that the Minister for Sport and Tourism has not treated this issue with the serious policy 
 consideration that it deserves. It was both disappointing and demoralising that the minister failed to attend the IOC World Conference on Drugs in Sport in Lausanne in February this year. The proposed drug summit that has been mooted by the minister is no substitute for attendance at this conference and for arguing Australia's position on the international stage. The IOC has a seemingly ambiguous position on the use of drugs in sport and the Australian government should have done its utmost to ensure that all practicable support was provided.
In supporting this bill, the opposition is mindful of the way this government has slashed funding to the Sports Commission and has not allocated new funding to ASDA to facilitate changes to its operations. The government must ensure that additional budgetary pressures do not compromise the other essential functions of the agency. We would not like to see a situation in which ASDA's ability to continue testing national and international competitors is in any way undermined because of stretched resources.
On a more positive note, we welcome the tenets of this bill which will establish a mechanism for the exchange of information between the Australian Customs Service and ASDA for the purposes of assisting with the agency's testing program and activities. The opposition is confident that the necessary complementary Customs legislation will be both adequate and competent.
It should be noted that the government intends to increase the level of administrative and coordination support that the Australian Customs Service provides to ASDA in relation to the illegal importation of banned sports drugs. Given this increase in functions, we urge the government to address the issue of resourcing and to ensure that Customs officials are provided with adequate training with respect to locating and reporting the importation of performance enhancing drugs in sport.
Labor will support the passage of this legislation. It will help ensure that the 2000 Olympics and competitive sport in general will be free from illegal substances.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SPORTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,46,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-08-12,"—I thank Senator Lundy for her comments. The government will certainly take note of the points she has outlined, particularly those of an administrative nature that will need ongoing surveillance and scrutiny.
The amendments in this bill will enhance the overall effectiveness of Australia's anti-doping regime and help to keep us at the forefront of the international fight against the use of banned drugs in sport. The bill will facilitate the exchange of necessary information between two key Australian agencies, thereby improving the whole of government effort to rid sport of drug cheats. I think the Minister for Sport and Tourism, Ms Kelly, is to be commended for achieving this whole of government arrangement that is so important and for her pioneering in this area.
Work being done in concert with the provisions in the Australian Sports Drug Agency  
 Amendment Act 1999 commenced on 1 August, allowing for Customs to pass certain sports drug related information to the Australian Sports Drug Agency. The amendments have been developed in close consultation with, and agreed to by, the Attorney-General's Department and the Privacy Commissioner to ensure that the rights to privacy continue to be protected.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
