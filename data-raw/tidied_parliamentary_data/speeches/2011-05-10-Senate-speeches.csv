Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (12:33):  The Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011 is primarily about ensuring that the subsidies and grants given to victims of the floods and Cyclone Yasi are tax deductible, and the coalition of course supports the tax deductibility of these subsidies and grants for people who suffered such a terrible start to 2011. We are debating this bill on the day that this government is going to deliver its next budget—the fourth Labor budget, the fourth deficit budget, the fourth budget that no doubt in the great Labor tradition will deliver more wasteful spending, more taxes, more debt and yet another deficit—and of course the government will again use the floods and the cyclones as excuses for the budget being in such a disastrous position.


Floods, cyclones and bushfires are a sad part of the Australian reality. Good govern­ments ensure that the budget and the economy are resilient enough to be able to deal with these sorts of tragedies if and when they occur, because as sure as night follows day they will occur, and a good government budgets for those sorts of contingencies. But this government has so mismanaged our public finances and so mismanaged the budget that there is no flexibility in the budget anymore. There is no resilience at all and we are now of course in a situation where, as a result of Labor's waste, mis­management and reckless spending, our budget is already in record deficit territory yet again for this financial year.


The government for the last couple of weeks has been talking about how this is going to be a tough budget. Yet over the last five months, the budget deficit for this financial year alone has blown out by another $8½ billion. Five months ago when the government released the MYEFO, the deficit was going to be $41.5 billion. Now we are being told that it is going to be more than $50 billion. Next year's budget is going to blow out by more than $8 billion and last year we were told that the deficit would be about $12 billion plus and it now looks as if it is going to be more than $20 billion. There is no suggestion that the government is in any way, shape or form capable of ever delivering a tough budget. I draw to the attention of the chamber that, as we speak, the government is borrowing $135 million every day to fund the deficit for this financial year. When we have a cyclone or when we have a flood, like we had earlier this year, the government cannot help itself but go for yet another ad hoc tax grab—which was the $1.8 billion increase in income tax, also known as the flood tax. So here we are: it is borrowing $135 million every day. Next year the government will spend $6 billion on interest payments to service the debt that it has now accumulated. Six billion dollars worth of interest payments! Just imagine how much a prudent government, how much a good government, how much a government that spends taxpayers' money wisely, could do with $6 billion. That is six world-class public hospitals. Just imagine how many roads or how much infrastructure could be built. Imagine how much could be done in the reconstruction effort in Queensland if the government had not mismanaged the finances to the extent that it has.


Wayne Swan talks about the budget tonight as a tough budget. As I have already mentioned, this is not going to be a tough budget. I noted the description of the budget by Senator Wong earlier this week. I think it was in the Sydney Morning Herald. Senator Wong said that this will be 'a Labor budget'. I took that as being a bit of a threat to the Australian people—that the budget tonight is going to be a Labor budget. If it is going to be a Labor budget, we sure know that it is going to be a budget full of wasteful spending, full of more taxes, full of higher deficits and more debt, and full of ideological attacks on those Australians who are not seen to be part of the Australian Labor Party voter support base. It will be a tax on those Australians who take additional responsibility for their own health care by taking out private health insurance. These are the sorts of things, no doubt, that we are going to see in a good old-fashioned Labor budget.


Here we are, in a circumstance where we have a budget that is an absolute mess. This is, of course, a very bad tradition of the Labor Party. This will be the ninth con­secutive deficit budget of a federal Labor government. It will be the fourth consecutive deficit budget of this Labor government—four out of four. Of course, there were five consecutive deficit budgets under the previous federal Labor administration. So deficit budgets are part of Labor's DNA. Mismanaging the economy, mismanaging our public finances, is part of Labor's DNA. People across Australia know that, whatever happens, the Labor Party in government messes things up and it is the coalition that has to come in and fix it, through a sound approach to better financial management and by restoring good government. Labor always talks tough before a budget and then goes on to deliver yet another deficit. Labor does not know how to live within its means. This is no doubt going to be the way it is going to play out yet again tonight.


The other part of this legislation is an attempted fix of another Labor Party stuff-up. Remember the First Home Saver Accounts, which the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, announced back in 2008 with much fanfare? We were told as part of the budget then that the First Home Saver Accounts initiative would see 730,000 home saver accounts opened over four years. Just 24,000 people have taken it up because it is such a low-value offering, due to the way it was structured by the government back in 2008. This bill will make some changes which will make the offering slightly more attractive. In particular, the changes that will be made by this bill will allow savings to be paid into a mortgage at the end of the minimum qualifying period rather than requiring them to be transferred to a superannuation or retirement savings account. We support that change, but we make the point again that the government do not know how to manage any program competently. They do not think things through before they press ahead. Wherever you look there is failure, waste, mismanagement and incompetence. There is weakness, there is indecisiveness and there is budget mismanagement. So this is yet another fix for what was an example of Labor Party incompetence in Wayne Swan's first budget. With those few remarks, on behalf of the coalition, I indicate that we will be supporting this bill.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-05-10,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (12:42):  I also want to make a few remarks on that part of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011 that deals with making exempt from income tax the disaster income recovery subsidy payments made to victims of the recent floods and Cyclone Yasi. Both events were traumatic for those involved and there was loss of life in both instances. Regrettably, both happened in my home state of Queensland. I want to emphasise to anyone who might be listening to this debate that, whilst there were those disasters, they are a matter of course—that is, nature occurring. Indeed, Queensland is open for business and always has been. We know how to deal with cyclones, particularly in the north. They cause great trauma to those directly involved, but for the rest of the North Queensland area life continues as usual. Holiday destinations along the north coast of Queensland are certainly open and very welcoming to people around Australia, and indeed the world, who may want to experience a great holiday in the North Queensland sunshine as we approach the southern winter.


I also wish to address the aspect of the bill where recovery subsidy payments are made to victims. I think it is appropriate that they are exempt from income tax. This has always been something that various governments have looked at. I think the Howard govern­ment set the scene some years ago when it declared tax exemption for payments to victims of a cyclone in Western Australia whose name I cannot recall. I think that was the first instance when the Howard govern­ment dealt with this particular problem that arises from disaster subsidy payments and set the scene for subsequent governments to follow and apply income tax relief to these payments. While I am on my feet I also want to congratulate the Greens political party for their support of legislation which effectively provided a tax on all Australians to assist with the flood recovery in my state of Queens­land and elsewhere but which imposed its burden only on individual tax­payers and not upon those companies that the Greens are always railing against—those multinational mining companies that are ripping the lifeblood out of Australia. That, I mention for the benefit of the Hansard, is a summary of the approach the Greens political party have always made. They always look at these international investors in Australia and say how awful it is that they are digging up Australia and exporting the profits overseas. It amazes me then why the Greens supported the Labor Party in imposing a flood tax on individuals but allowed those multinational profit-taking companies, that the Greens are always so keen to talk about, to be exempt from any payment of that flood tax which would go towards recovery in Queensland and elsewhere.


I simply cannot understand, with all the rhetoric you hear from the Greens as we approach the budget on how we need to increase taxes on these mining companies and other international companies, why they exempted those very same companies from the flood levy, from the flood tax. If the Greens were genuine—and you know my view on that I do not think the Greens are genuine about too much at all except personal publicity and promotion of their ultra left-wing agenda within the Australian political scene—one would wonder why they would tax Australian individuals but let off all of those companies which make substan­tial profits in Australia.


I do not want to rehash the debate on the flood levy but I always thought that rather than having a flood levy it would have been better to take the money needed for the recovery from cyclones and floods from the general revenue in which case companies would pay company tax towards it, the extra wealthy would pay a higher level of contribution towards it and those with lower incomes would barely contribute at all. That is appropriate in a nation with a progressive tax system. But no, the Greens did not support that. The Labor Party and the Greens, the alliance, got together and taxed individual Australians but let companies go.


It has been brought home to me as I have toured the cyclone devastated parts of North Queensland that the local butcher and the local baker are paying the flood recovery tax but Woolworths and Coles, their competitors in the bread and meat markets, are not paying a cent towards the flood recovery levy. How could the so-called party of the worker, the Labor Party, and the Greens, who are so keen on their left-wing agenda, possibly penalise local small businesses in North Queensland and indeed elsewhere by imposing a flood tax on them but exempt Coles and Woolworths, who compete with them in their businesses?


As we approach the budget tonight you will find a lot more of that sort of hypocrisy coming from the Greens. I say to the Greens: good on you. You are supporting a govern­ment that believes in the Pacific solution. I thought the Greens were opposed to the Pacific solution for boat people who come here without permission. I thought they were violently opposed to that and yet here they are supporting a government which is now having—



Senator Xenophon interjecting—




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Senator Xenophon interjects and says, 'It is not the Pacific solution; it is the South China Sea solution.' You are accurate as always, Senator Xenophon, but tell me the difference. If it goes to Manus Island, it will be again adopting the Pacific solution and I would not mind having a bet with you, Senator Xenophon, that eventually—




Senator Xenophon:
  I do not bet.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You only bet up to a limit, I know. I would not mind betting that it will not be too long before our current Prime Minister, in spite of all of her promises, will actually do what Mr Abbott has suggested and pick up the phone to the president and have the boat people also dealt with at other places in the Pacific.


Here you have another example of the hypocrisy of the Greens and you are going to get a lot of that in the next couple of days as the Greens—they talk about how they oppose these things—support when the crunch comes their mates in the Labor Party to adopt the Pacific solution, if I may call it that. What confidence can anyone have in the Greens? I just cannot wait until the new Senate starts and we have Senator elect Rhiannon in the Greens little group here. Unfortunately you do not bet, Senator Xenophon, but I would not mind betting that she will be making a leadership bid very soon after she gets here and who would discourage her from attempting to do that and give a bit of real exposure to the Greens as to what they really stand for. I do not think Senator elect Rhiannon tries to hide where she is coming from, where she is going to or what her goals are, and that might be a refreshing change even if it is a change that is totally abhorrent to particularly those of us on this side of the chamber.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Macdonald, for some time now we have been straying a long way from the question.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You have anticipated me wonderfully, Mr Acting Deputy President. The next words to come out of my mouth were to be: 'But I think I have strayed a little from the debate before the chamber on the exemption from income tax of disaster income recovery subsidy payments.' I will conclude my remarks; I do not want to delay the chamber. I will simply say that with the victims of Cyclone Yasi this sort of legislation is well received. It is certainly supported by the coalition and, as I say, it follows an initiative started by the Howard government some time ago. There are anxieties, if I might put it that way, with the recovery effort. I was told recently that the number of suicides in the town of Tully, which was one of the towns that received the direct brunt of Cyclone Yasi, have increased. That in itself is a tragedy.


I know a lot of small businesses in Mission Beach, Cardwell and Tully will not reopen. People had put their life savings into small businesses in those areas affected by the cyclone. In terms of being able to take advantage of the generosity of other Australians in making voluntary donations to various appeals and also of the Australian people as a whole through the flood tax—not Australian companies, I might add, but Australian people who will be contributing through the flood tax—the way that has been administered is causing some real concern and the rules relating to that have also caused some anxiety. I think it is not the time today or on this bill to go into that. Suffice to say that, as with so many things with the Labor Party at both federal and state level, the idea is good and the principle is correct but the administration of those relief schemes leaves a lot to be desired. Never is sufficient thought given to them. Never is sufficient thought paid to the importance of small business in those areas and of the small business people who create the jobs in all parts of Australia but particularly in regional Australia. As I say, I am distressed to hear that a number of them will not reopen their doors. But insofar as this legislation is concerned, as Senator Cormann has said, the coalition support the exemption from income tax of those subsidy payments and we urge support for this bill.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:55):  Mr Acting Deputy President, I will try not to be admonished by you. I will stick to the terms of the bill.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Very wise!




Senator XENOPHON:
  I indicate my support for this legislation, the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011. It seeks to implement the recent disaster related initiatives and changes to Australia's tax laws. My principal concern that I explored at the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into the flood levy legislation was for those individuals who have suffered from lesser-known disasters, such as the Stockport floods in South Australia, who have also lost their homes and whether they would be liable to the levy. I am satisfied with the response I have received from the government that those areas of South Australia that have been the subject of a declaration made under the NDRRA, the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, so long as one of the following conditions were satisfied: whether an individual was seriously injured; an Australian was killed, and that Australian was an immediate family member of the individual; or the individual's principal place of residence was destroyed or sustained major damage; or the individual was unable to gain access to their principal place of residence for at least 24 hours; or they were stranded in their principal place of residence for at least 24-hours. They would be fully covered—in other words, they would not be subject to any income tax levy. They would need to apply for that, so there is an administrative process, but they would clearly be eligible to be exempt from any levy.


I note that in my home state there were floods in Stockport, Riverton and Rhynie areas in early December 2010. There were also floods in the Barossa Valley in February 2011 which affected Eudunda, Swan Reach, Nuriootpa, Kapunda, Tanunda, Stockwell and Ebenezer. For the Clare and Gilbert Valleys Council the damages bill was in the order of $15 million. The Regional Council of Goyder had a damages bill of $10 million, the District Council of Peterborough had a damages bill of $2 million and as well there were damages for councils in Orroroo, Carrington and the Flinders Ranges and for the Northern Areas Council. 


I believe that the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements cover those individuals and businesses that have been affected and I think it is entirely appropriate in the context of the administrative arrange­ments in this bill. Therefore, I indicate my support for the government's bill as being necessary administrative arrangements to the tax act to implement the effect of the flood levy.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2011-05-10,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (12:58):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 to this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011, amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt from income tax the disaster income recovery subsidy payments to victims of the recent disasters that devastated parts of Australia during the 2010-11 summer. The amend­ments also exempt from income tax ex gratia payments made to certain New Zealand visa holders affected by the disaster in 2010-11 where the Australian government disaster recovery payment has been activated. Exempting these disaster relief payments from income tax is consistent with the gov­ernment's response to other disasters such as the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria—your home state, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall—and alleviates the financial hardship being felt in affected communities.


Schedule 2 exempts from income tax category C payments made under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements for small businesses and primary producers affected by the 2010-11 floods and Cyclone Yasi. This measure recognises the hardship suffered by small businesses and primary producers in affected areas and provides certainty for recipients in terms of tax treatment at a time when they should not need to worry about tax matters. Schedule 3 increases the flexibility of the first home saver accounts. Individuals who purchase a home before meeting the minimum release conditions will now be able to put the money towards their new home. This change amends the tax laws to allow money in a first home saver account to be paid to a genuine mortgage, after the end of a minimum qualifying period, should the account holder purchase a dwelling in the interim. Currently, this money would go towards their superannuation balance. First home saver accounts are designed to encourage individuals, through tax concessions and government contributions, to save for their first home over the medium to long term and have been available since October 2008. This measure applies to houses purchased after the bill's royal assent. The bill deserves the support of parliament and I commend the bill to the Senate.

 (Western Australia) (12:33):  The Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011 is primarily about ensuring that the subsidies and grants given to victims of the floods and Cyclone Yasi are tax deductible, and the coalition of course supports the tax deductibility of these subsidies and grants for people who suffered such a terrible start to 2011.

Floods, cyclones and bushfires are a sad part of the Australian reality. Good govern­ments ensure that the budget and the economy are resilient enough to be able to deal with these sorts of tragedies if and when they occur, because as sure as night follows day they will occur, and a good government budgets for those sorts of contingencies.

This will be the ninth con­secutive deficit budget of a federal Labor government. It will be the fourth consecutive deficit budget of this Labor government—four out of four. Of course, there were five consecutive deficit budgets under the previous federal Labor administration. So deficit budgets are part of Labor's DNA. Mismanaging the economy, mismanaging our public finances, is part of Labor's DNA. People across Australia know that, whatever happens, the Labor Party in government messes things up and it is the coalition that has to come in and fix it, through a sound approach to better financial management and by restoring good government. Labor always talks tough before a budget and then goes on to deliver yet another deficit. Labor does not know how to live within its means.

Remember the First Home Saver Accounts, which the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, announced back in 2008 with much fanfare?

Unfortunately you do not bet, Senator Xenophon, but I would not mind betting that she will be making a leadership bid very soon after she gets here and who would discourage her from attempting to do that and give a bit of real exposure to the Greens as to what they really stand for. I do not think Senator elect Rhiannon tries to hide where she is coming from, where she is going to or what her goals are, and that might be a refreshing change even if it is a change that is totally abhorrent to particularly those of us on this side of the chamber.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Senator Macdonald, for some time now we have been straying a long way from the question.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  You have anticipated me wonderfully, Mr Acting Deputy President. The next words to come out of my mouth were to be: 'But I think I have strayed a little from the debate before the chamber on the exemption from income tax of disaster income recovery subsidy payments.' I will conclude my remarks; I do not want to delay the chamber. I will simply say that with the victims of Cyclone Yasi this sort of legislation is well received. It is certainly supported by the coalition and, as I say, it follows an initiative started by the Howard government some time ago. There are anxieties, if I might put it that way, with the recovery effort. I was told recently that the number of suicides in the town of Tully, which was one of the towns that received the direct brunt of Cyclone Yasi, have increased. That in itself is a tragedy.


I know a lot of small businesses in Mission Beach, Cardwell and Tully will not reopen. People had put their life savings into small businesses in those areas affected by the cyclone. In terms of being able to take advantage of the generosity of other Australians in making voluntary donations to various appeals and also of the Australian people as a whole through the flood tax—not Australian companies, I might add, but Australian people who will be contributing through the flood tax—the way that has been administered is causing some real concern and the rules relating to that have also caused some anxiety. I think it is not the time today or on this bill to go into that. Suffice to say that, as with so many things with the Labor Party at both federal and state level, the idea is good and the principle is correct but the administration of those relief schemes leaves a lot to be desired. Never is sufficient thought given to them. Never is sufficient thought paid to the importance of small business in those areas and of the small business people who create the jobs in all parts of Australia but particularly in regional Australia. As I say, I am distressed to hear that a number of them will not reopen their doors. But insofar as this legislation is concerned, as Senator Cormann has said, the coalition support the exemption from income tax of those subsidy payments and we urge support for this bill.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:55):  Mr Acting Deputy President, I will try not to be admonished by you. I will stick to the terms of the bill.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Very wise!




Senator XENOPHON:
  I indicate my support for this legislation, the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011. It seeks to implement the recent disaster related initiatives and changes to Australia's tax laws. My principal concern that I explored at the Senate Economics Committee inquiry into the flood levy legislation was for those individuals who have suffered from lesser-known disasters, such as the Stockport floods in South Australia, who have also lost their homes and whether they would be liable to the levy. I am satisfied with the response I have received from the government that those areas of South Australia that have been the subject of a declaration made under the NDRRA, the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, so long as one of the following conditions were satisfied: whether an individual was seriously injured; an Australian was killed, and that Australian was an immediate family member of the individual; or the individual's principal place of residence was destroyed or sustained major damage; or the individual was unable to gain access to their principal place of residence for at least 24 hours; or they were stranded in their principal place of residence for at least 24-hours. They would be fully covered—in other words, they would not be subject to any income tax levy. They would need to apply for that, so there is an administrative process, but they would clearly be eligible to be exempt from any levy.


I note that in my home state there were floods in Stockport, Riverton and Rhynie areas in early December 2010. There were also floods in the Barossa Valley in February 2011 which affected Eudunda, Swan Reach, Nuriootpa, Kapunda, Tanunda, Stockwell and Ebenezer. For the Clare and Gilbert Valleys Council the damages bill was in the order of $15 million. The Regional Council of Goyder had a damages bill of $10 million, the District Council of Peterborough had a damages bill of $2 million and as well there were damages for councils in Orroroo, Carrington and the Flinders Ranges and for the Northern Areas Council. 


I believe that the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements cover those individuals and businesses that have been affected and I think it is entirely appropriate in the context of the administrative arrange­ments in this bill. Therefore, I indicate my support for the government's bill as being necessary administrative arrangements to the tax act to implement the effect of the flood levy.

"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2011-05-10,"



Senator FARRELL
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water) (12:58):  Firstly, I would like to thank those senators who contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 to this bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 1) Bill 2011, amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt from income tax the disaster income recovery subsidy payments to victims of the recent disasters that devastated parts of Australia during the 2010-11 summer. The amend­ments also exempt from income tax ex gratia payments made to certain New Zealand visa holders affected by the disaster in 2010-11 where the Australian government disaster recovery payment has been activated. Exempting these disaster relief payments from income tax is consistent with the gov­ernment's response to other disasters such as the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria—your home state, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall—and alleviates the financial hardship being felt in affected communities.


Schedule 2 exempts from income tax category C payments made under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements for small businesses and primary producers affected by the 2010-11 floods and Cyclone Yasi. This measure recognises the hardship suffered by small businesses and primary producers in affected areas and provides certainty for recipients in terms of tax treatment at a time when they should not need to worry about tax matters. Schedule 3 increases the flexibility of the first home saver accounts. Individuals who purchase a home before meeting the minimum release conditions will now be able to put the money towards their new home. This change amends the tax laws to allow money in a first home saver account to be paid to a genuine mortgage, after the end of a minimum qualifying period, should the account holder purchase a dwelling in the interim. Currently, this money would go towards their superannuation balance. First home saver accounts are designed to encourage individuals, through tax concessions and government contributions, to save for their first home over the medium to long term and have been available since October 2008. This measure applies to houses purchased after the bill's royal assent. The bill deserves the support of parliament and I commend the bill to the Senate.

Will the government acknow­ledge that the asylum-seeker policies it has pursued for the last three years have encouraged the people smugglers and have manifestly failed; that those failed policies have encouraged thousands of people to queue-jump to try to reach this country illegally at great risk to their lives; and that those failed policies have resulted in a hugely expanded onshore detention system which is now bursting at the seams and has become the scene of riots and mayhem?

Senator CHRIS EVANS
 (Western Australia—Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:01):  The simple answer is no. There is no doubt that we face a range of challenges in relation to unlawful people movement through the region. This is a problem that Australia shares in the region with countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, and it is something that we have resolved to tackle in a regional context because we know that we have to work together to address these issues. It was a lesson that the previous government learnt as well about needing regional cooperation in order to deal with these issues.


I note in passing that this is a now huge issue around the world. We are seeing Europe responding to large numbers of people fleeing North Africa; in fact, people are demanding a review of the EU arrangements in terms of border control. There are huge issues in the United States and Canada. Unauthorised people movement and people seeking asylum is a huge issue for our century as transportation becomes more available.


So I do not accept the proposition that was put by Senator Abetz. The government is working with countries in the region to try and address the challenge of unlawful movement. We do have a huge issue in that many people are seeking refuge and fleeing persecution, and we as a region have to work to tackle those challenges. A lot of work has been done in recent times through the Bali process, which we have reinvigorated with Indonesia, and the announcement the other day regarding a framework of cooperation with Malaysia is part of that regional response to an issue we are all dealing with.

I think it was cynical, and it was costly. It is worth remembering that the people who were subject to the Pacific solution are now settled in Australia and New Zealand; the vast majority have settled here or in New Zealand. The Howard government did a deal with New Zealand to take a large number of people off the island of Nauru in order to have political cover for the fact that the Pacific solution had failed; it was cynical, it was costly and the reality is that people were resettled in Australia. The Howard government did not like to front up to that, they did not like to publicise that, but the reality is that those people were settled in Australia. So the Pacific solution was no solution. We need regional cooperation, we need the support of our neighbours, and that is what this government is focused on. (Time expired)

Installers also conduct any cabling and antenna work where necessary. Centrelink performs checks to ensure the installations are working properly.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Minister Assisting the Attorney-General on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:05):  I seek leave to incorpor­ate two responses to questions taken on notice during question time. The first relates to a question Senator Williams asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, on Thursday, 24 March 2011, relating to the Gulgong hospital. The second relates to questions Senator Fielding asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General on 24 March 2011 in relation to concerns about Centrecare.


Leave granted; the document read as follows:


As part of a suite of health reform measures, the Commonwealth is providing $120 million in capital finding over four years to the states and territories for an additional 286 beds/bed equivalents to expand subacute care capacity in Multi-Purpose Service (MPS) facilities in rural and remote areas. This will be done under the National Partnership Agreement for the Expansion of Subacute Care in Multi-Purpose Services (the NPA).


The total funding available for New South Wales (NSW) under the NPA is $38.8 million. Following agreement of the NPA, funding will be provided based on an approved Implementation Plan, which will outline activities and required funding. NSW will distribute the funding according to local needs, based on this Implementation Plan.


The Department of Health and Ageing has also received a proposal from the NSW government seeking funding for a number of aged care places at a multi-purpose service in Gulgong. This proposal is currently being considered by the Department against the criteria listed in the Aged Care Act 1997.


Negotiations with the states and territories on the NPA will commence shortly.


In terms of recurrent funding for the residential aged care places, if the NSW government proposal seeking aged care places is successful, the funding for these places would be provided from the time the service (and places) became operational.



Senator Fielding asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General on 24 March 2011:


Q: Is the Government aware of concerns by Centacare? In particular that there is an eight week waiting period on post-separation services and that a decrease in funding will increase waiting periods further?


The Senator also referred to a lack of consultation regarding funding cuts.




Senator Ludwig -



The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to Senator Fielding's question:


The Government is aware of Centacare's concerns about waiting times in post separation services. The Government has received and responded to correspondence from Centacare about this issue. Waiting times for post separation services vary and can occur for many reasons, unrelated to funding cuts, including:


that clients need to go through a comprehensive intake and assessment process before the intervention can commence;


that group programs that run over a number of weeks may only be scheduled on a periodic basis;


it may take some time to locate, invite and assess the other party as suitable for the dispute resolution process; and


a clinical decision may be made to refer the client elsewhere for another intervention (for example, related to family violence) before it would be suitable to provide the family relationship service to that client.


The Attorney-General's Department will continue to monitor waiting times for post separation services.


Last year, the Government announced that some funding from within the Family Relationships Services Program would be re-directed to provide legal assistance and advice to help separating families resolve disputes with targeted legal assistance delivered by organisations such as community legal centres.


This included reallocating $48.4m from the Family Relationship Services Program over four years, with a total investment of $51.8m to help separating families resolve disputes with targeted legal assistance through community legal services.


However, the Government continues to provide more than $200 million in funding each year for the Family Relationship Services Program. This includes an annual investment of more than $90 million per annum for mediation services under the Family Support Program which supports separating families to resolve issues around children's matters.


Early indications since redirecting the funding indicate that this new approach to providing legal assistance for couples attending Family Relationship Centres has been positive and demonstrated that early and targeted legal advice can help couples resolve their disputes without resorting to the courts.


The Government has consulted extensively with the family relationship services sector on changes to their funding arrangements.


Further, the Government has also decided to defer the measures that apply to Family Relationship Centres until January 2012 to assist in transitioning to the new funding arrangements.

 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:05):  I move:


I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by Senators Evans, Ludwig and Carr to questions without notice asked in question time today.


It is an interesting day today because, to be honest, very few people are going to be watching us; they have got other things on. But people stopped listening to the Labor Party long ago. I came to parliament this week thinking that maybe things would settle down, and then all of a sudden we had what would have to be one of the most peculiar decisions that has ever been foisted on this nation—the so-called Malaysian deal.


To throw further light on the Malaysian deal today, we had Senator Carr's response to the 'little bomb' issue. They had a little fire and they found a little bomb and they got a little inkling that something was going on. They found a little bomb at one of the detention centres. But don't worry—it was not a big problem; it was only a little problem as it was only a little bomb. There was a little fire going at the same time. There was a much bigger fire earlier on—a really big fire. That was a big problem, but then they had a little problem. Unfortunately, the peptic ulcer inside the government's stomach started to give a bit of a twitch and they realised that they had to do something. So the thought police, the brains trust, of the Labor Party got together and worked out this deal. They got on the blower and started ringing people all around the world to see if they could come up with a deal to cover up for the fact that the budget was going to be a disaster and that they also had a bit of a problem because people keep burning down buildings in the middle of Sydney—burning them down, mind you, when Australians are sleeping on the street merely miles away. That is the more sobering side of the problem that they have.


Apparently we are sending to Malaysia 800 people and then they are sending back to us 4,000 people. There is logic in that somewhere, apparently. It started off as a one-to-one deal, but it has somehow changed while Julia Gillard was negotiating. She cannot say it and she cannot do it, but she decided that she was going to negotiate her way out of the problem and this is how she would do it. Not only are we sending Malaysia 800 people and getting 4,000 in return but we are also sending them about $292 million. This sounds like the deal of the century. This is Labor Party politics. Now we also find that there will be a trail fee, a sort of trail commission, on this and apparently we are going to have to pay them another lazy $200 million to look after the problem. So it is about half a billion dollars and rising for this complete and utter fiasco.


On a deal like this, I expect the phones to be running hot in Julia Gillard's office. We will have Hugo Chavez on the phone saying, 'Mate, I can do a better deal for you. How about you send me 50 and I will send you 10,000. And I'll cut the price: I'll do it for a lazy 100 mill.' President Koroma of Sierra Leone—another country that is not a party to the United Nations refugee convention—will be on the phone: 'Don't worry, Julia; I'll help you out. I've got a few refugees here. How about we park a couple of hundred thousand over there. We could send you a couple of hundred thousand refugees, because we've got them in bulk. We've got a civil war on; we can park them over there.' Maybe we could go to the former Prime Minister of Somalia, Haji Hussein. He has probably got a few refugees. He should be in the market. It could be one of their biggest exports—exporting refugees to Australia. It is just so bizarre. You have become so bizarre. You have become so strange that if you did not laugh you would cry. And we get all this for the lazy sum of $292 million.


It should be noted just before the budget that a good bloke called Kenneth Rogoff from Harvard University has been listing the countries that have had the greatest cumulative increase in real public debt since 2007. I will go through the top three because we do not want to mention every country in the world: No.1, Iceland—we all know about Iceland; No. 2, Ireland; and No. 3, Australia. You get yourself into debt like that when you come up with ludicrous, mind-numbing solutions such as spending half a billion dollars on making your problem of 3,200 people bigger. We pay them half a billion dollars and the net effect in Australia is that we are 3,200 people worse off.


Who thought that up? Who is the plant from the Liberal Party or the National Party in Julia Gillard's office giving her this advice? Own up—who are you? Stop giving her this advice. Stop making it easy for us, please. We do not need any more help. This is what is happening. This is the manic world of the Labor Party. (Time expired)

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2011-05-10,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:11):  On rising to speak on the motion to take note of answers, I am very proud of the fact that this government believes in real regional cooperation on asylum seekers. We know that, ultimately, that is the best way to manage this issue. It is also the best humanitarian outcome, something the Howard government, frankly, was never interested in. I, like most Australians, feel strongly about honouring our international protection obligations, and it is sad to me that Senator Joyce does not seem to take that obligation seriously. I do not shy away from the fact that we must find a better way to support vulnerable refugees. Our resolve to end the dangerous transport of so many vulnerable lives in shonky boats is one that I support. You need look no further than at the loss of nearly 30 lives before last Christmas off Christmas Island.


Malaysia has taken a much greater burden on it as a nation in terms of managing asylum seekers, with an estimated 100,000 people seeking refuge there. A funda­mentally important part of this arrangement is that the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, will be working to process the 800 refugees that Australia will send to be processed in Malaysia and will work closely with us to resettle the 4,000 that will come here as part of this increased humanitarian intake.


In my mind, this is no small thing. I am but one of thousands of Australians who make a small monthly donation to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees fund, which works to support, resettle and process refugees. The UNHCR has a very difficult job and has been encouraging of Australia and other countries seeking to work together to find regional solutions on this issue, to support vulnerable people who need our protection.


Our arrangement with Malaysia is something we have been working on over the last six months as part of a regional cooperation framework. Very sadly, Mr Tony Abbott and Mr Scott Morrison have turned a blind eye to the facts when mounting their scare campaign on these issues. Frankly, I am surprised that Mr Abbott objects to an increase in the humanitarian intake. He showed he was prepared to support such an increase and in fact double the intake to win Mr Andrew Wilkie's support in the House of Representatives.


This government is committed to delivering on regional cooperation. This may be hard—it may be difficult—but ultimately it is the only path which will see better outcomes for asylum seekers throughout the region. We will see better outcomes for people who would otherwise languish in our detention centres. This arrangement is but the first step, and we need to keep talking to countries in the region. It is no easy task. We are working through the Bali process, we are talking to Papua New Guinea and we are working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Such ap­proaches were never a real prospect under the Howard government. Mr Abbott has simple rhetoric—'Stop the boats,' he says—but he has no credible plan to enhance the capacity of refugees to get the protection to which they are entitled throughout the region in an orderly fashion.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:15):  May I issue an apology to all the Australian people listening to this broadcast for wasting five minutes of their lives listening to a bunch of nonsense from Senator Pratt. It was just extraordinary that Senator Pratt was interjecting on Senator Joyce during his speech, saying, 'This is not a joke,' and yet everything that Senator Pratt has said makes an absolute mockery of what the government has been saying for the last three years and the 10 years previously. During this time our discredited Prime Minister—and I say she is discredited because we cannot believe a word that comes out of her mouth now—has duped an increasingly sceptical and disillusioned public by saying that offshore processing is inhumane, it is wrong and it has no place here in Australia. The only thing she has not acknowledged in the entire thing is that offshore processing actually stops the trade in people smuggling and it stops the boats from coming.


But according to the government the boats were coming due to push factors and it had nothing whatsoever to do with the soft treatment they have received in Australia since the government changed the laws. The facts speak for themselves: since 2008, 224 boats have come to this country, entering Australian waters illegally and carrying 11,246 arrivals seeking asylum. Since the last election we have had nearly 4,500 people arrive, and still the government said that nothing was wrong and that they would not go back to the inhumane treatment of refugees. There is nothing more inhumane than having people in a detention centre who are threatening the lives of other people by setting it on fire, by having riots and by planting bombs.


The government would not acknowledge these risks, but all of a sudden it has now done a deal. It has ditched the East Timor solution, which it has been defending for months since the last election, and it has cooked up the Malaysian solution. I say 'cooked up' because it has been cobbled together, clearly at the last minute. But the government's representative, Senator Pratt, has just told us that the government has been working on this for many months. They have been negotiating with themselves, because they have talked themselves out of a one-for-one deal to a one-for-two deal, a one-for-three deal et cetera, until they got a one-for-five deal. But let me tell you: that is not all you get, and it is not all that Malaysia get. They also get hundreds of millions of Australian taxpayer dollars.


The Australian people are very sympathetic to the plight of those who are in need. That is why we have a humanitarian refugee program. What they do not like are those people who are seeking to jump the queue and bypass the system. Yet this government seem to want to encourage that. They have said that they will not deal with an offshore processing centre on Nauru because it is not a signatory to the UNHCR—and yet they go off and deal with Malaysia, which is also not a signatory to the UNHCR. Is there any wonder that the Australian public are questioning the very legitimacy of this government?


Since when have we had a circumstance where the Australian people cannot believe a word that comes out of the Prime Minister's mouth? Since when have we had a circumstance where the Australian people believe that everything their government tells them is based on spin and lies? And they have got good reason to be suspicious of everything this government says, because not only do we know that the Prime Minister is an illegitimate prime minister but we also know that this government is so bereft of any structure and of any substance that it cannot manage the most simple policy decisions. It has put at risk Australia's border security. We know that; the evidence speaks for itself.


And now the government expect the Australian public to believe that they have done a good deal on our behalf, because when we get the next 800 people arriving in this country illegally we are going to swap them for 4,000 people who are in Malaysia seeking asylum. Eight hundred for 4,000—I would love to play poker with our Prime Minister. Whatever money she has got left after squandering it on so many bad programs would soon be in my pocket, because she cannot even carry off a bluff adequately. This is the problem we have: we have a government that do not know what they believe in and we have a Prime Minister who does not believe in anything. She has put everything on the shelf—everything that she has spent her entire life defending. And you wonder why the Australian people say, 'Enough is enough; we need to go to an election'.

Senator HURLEY,ALP,2011-05-10,"



Senator HURLEY
 (South Australia) (15:20):  The opposition are certainly full of sound and fury today. I think they must have spent the last few weeks listening to the more extreme radio shock jocks and reading emails from the more extreme right-wing groups. They seem very buoyed up, comparing finding a solution to the refugee issue in our region with poker games where people are swapped like betting chips; yet, in the same breath, they criticise the Australian government for their reaction to it.


The thing that the opposition clearly does not understand is this concept of a regional framework. I understand that the Howard government rhetoric was framed in these terms. It is not just about Australia and the refugees who make it to our shores; it is about the number of refugees coming to our region. It is not solely our problem; refugees are also coming to our neighbours in the area. They come to Malaysia, they come to Indonesia and they come to other countries in the region.It is a proposal that rather than deal separately and inefficiently with this issue we look at it as a region and try to develop a framework that will begin to address the problem; deal with refugees with dignity and humanity—not compare them to poker chips; look at decent solutions in conjunction with the UNHCR and the office of the International Organisation for Migration; and find a way to talk about the overall problem and how we can sort it out among ourselves and assist genuine refugees who are fleeing from countries—and there are a number of such countries around the world—where there is severe repression and threats to people's lives. We are dealing with increased numbers of refugees around the world.


As part of that solution, we have agreed to take an extra number of refugees. Clearly, there are some in the community that are going to dislike that. But what is the alternative? We leave refugees to pile up in Malaysia or Indonesia under very poor conditions? What is the serious proposal of other parties in this discussion? It is to go back to a solution that they found useful a decade ago. It is no longer useful. It is important now to look at the current situation and look at a way to address the situation that gives due respect to other countries in the region that are also experiencing an increase in the number of refugees and gives due respect to those refugees. It is, in the end, a practical solution to the problem. This is what the Gillard government has attempted to do. This arrangement will provide a method by which the refugee cases will be processed according to the UNHCR, which, as has been pointed out by the opposition, Malaysia has never been a party to. It now will be. Surely that is an advance which should get some recognition from the opposition. But no, they go onto these fantastic flights of fantasy about other countries joining in. This ignorance stems from a refusal to listen or to give good analysis to a situation.


No government would expect an opposition party not to critique its policy, but a nation would expect an opposition to be able to seriously address the issues and come up with a reasonable, sensible alternative proposal if necessary. It is clear, from today anyway, that the opposition has got nowhere near that state of affairs.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2011-05-10,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (15:25):  To paraphrase the now Prime Minister: another 224 boats, another 224 policy failures. When Ms Gillard was the shadow minister for immigration, not often did she have to come up with that line 'Another boat, another policy failure'. Regrettably, there have been 83 boats since she became Prime Minister on 24 June and 69 since the election of last year when Labor reversed what was a successful policy of the last coalition government, handed to them on a plate and rejected. That equates since 2008 to no less than 11,246 asylum seekers who have arrived on these shores. What we see yet again today is failure by an incompetent Prime Minister and an incompetent Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in this latest effort—that is, to try and strike a deal with Malaysia.


It was in March of this year that the asylum seekers rioted on Christmas Island. What was the reward after the first night of riots for those who led it? They in fact got their wish and they were air-transported to Darwin on the mainland. So what happened the next night on Christmas Island? The riots naturally extended and expanded to where others in detention, staff and people on the island were at risk. We now move forward to April this year, a continuing policy of a failed incompetent minister, to Villawood. As others have said, we saw not only firefighters, staff and others in Villawood put at risk but the destruction of Australian government property in this effort led by the allowance of an incompetent minister. What action have we seen taken? As spelt out here this afternoon, 11 days it took for the Federal Police to get these people down off the roof of that detention centre. Australians are heartily sick and tired.


We now see the latest knee-jerk reaction. Nobody believed that East Timor was going to participate in this so-called regional solution. There has now been a suggestion of Manus Island. That is probably a smart one because it is a return to the Howard govern­ment solution. We have just heard Senator Hurley, the previous speaker, making reference to involving and including those in the region. We now know, of course, that Nauru itself is willing to sign up to the UNHCR. We already have the assets available to us in that country. It only requires the Prime Minister and her incompetent minister to swallow their pride, pick up the phone and get on with what worked in the past.


We have seen a billion dollar blowout in the budget for immigration during the current financial year—budgeted at $200 million but will cost over $1 billion. One can only wonder what we are going to see this evening.


I have spent much time in Malaysia. I have even spent a brief time as a guest of the corrective services department in Malaysian detention centres. I can assure you they are not a place you would want to spend more time than is necessary. For those who do not believe that, they need to consult nobody else other than Anwar Ibrahim. But we have also now learnt that the Malaysians quite correctly will reserve for themselves the right to actually determine who of the 800 come to this country. So let us see the scene: the asylum seekers leave their home country, they go through Malaysia—incidentally, they have a passport when they go through Malaysia—they get on a boat, they come down here, they are processed, nobody likes them, so what happens? They go back to Malaysia and guess what happens to the people smugglers: they get to sell a second ticket, because they will leave that detention and once again return to Australia. The merry-go-round created by this incompetent government will only continue. The people smugglers are the ones who probably are smiling the most. Naturally those who do end up coming down on the boats a second time will destroy their identification papers and their passports, which gives us more work to do.


I conclude my comments with the observation that when the Howard government stopped the boats they continued the level of migration by genuine refugees, those who had been waiting for years and continue to wait for years in camps and who are currently being put further to the back of the queue because of these queue jumpers, most of them well-heeled, who are making a mockery of this country and its citizens.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2011-05-10,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (15:39):  I listened very carefully to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in his answers to some of the questions he was asked today in question time, and I caught the phrase 'sleazy deal', which I will have another look at when I review the Hansard tomorrow. But I have to say for the minister's information that the only sleazy deal that is actually being done is the deal that is being done by the Gillard government with the government of Malaysia: 'We'll give you 800; however, in return we'll take another 4,000.'


This government has shown the people of Australia that there is no principle that it is not willing to break, no promise it is not willing to not keep and no policy that it is not willing to shred in the interests of staying in power. Based on what we have seen with the latest thought bubble coming out of the Prime Minister, the Malaysian deal, Australians can only assume that the Prime Minister of Australia must wake up each morning and say to herself: 'What do I believe in today? What spin or tall story can I give to the media so that they can tell the people of Australia that maybe I have some form of idea or policy, even if those ideas or policies have a shelf life of approximately 24 hours?' This is no better reflected than in the deal that has been done by the Gillard government, the so-called Malaysian deal: the deal where we send one asylum seeker to Malaysia and in return the Malaysian government sends us five back. That is the deal that has been struck by the Gillard government.


I have to say the absolute absurdity of this deal was summarised quite beautifully today in a cartoon in the Advocate newspaper on page 15. The cartoon is of the Prime Minister, and it has a thought bubble coming from her head which says: 'Hee hee! We trade their 4,000 for our 800 and we throw in $290 million, and the Malaysians fell for it.' That sums up the state of this deal that the Gillard government has done with the Malaysians.


But, on top of that, what Australians need to understand is that they pay for everything under this deal. The Malaysians are not going to be paying for anything. We have negotiated a deal whereby we give, we take back even more and we pay for both the giving and the taking. For every refugee that we are going to be giving back to Malaysia, Australians will have paid $90,000, and for every refugee that we will be taking from Malaysia to Australia Australian taxpayers will have paid approximately $54,000. That is absolutely absurd, but I have to say that, if I were the government of Malaysia, I would have snapped up the deal. I would have snapped it up and then I would have turned to the Prime Minister and I would have said, 'Are there any other deals that you'd like to do today?' because I am quite sure that, with the way that that Prime Minister negotiates, there was certainly a deal to be had by the Malaysian government.


The coalition is not against genuine refugees seeking asylum in Australia. What we are against, however, is an incompetent government that has absolutely no idea whatsoever about maintaining the integrity of Australia's borders. The so-called Malaysian deal—on top of the potential to do the deal with PNG, on top of the fact that the Nauruan government would actually like the phone picked up for a call to them and on top of the fact that we also had East Timor thrown in the mix at one stage—represents nothing more and nothing less than a panicked announcement by a Prime Minister who realised that she was running out of options very quickly and the only policies that actually worked were the policies of the former Howard government. Because the details are so lacking under the Malaysian deal, the Prime Minister of Australia cannot even tell the Australian people which refugees we will be getting from Malaysia and, more so, which refugees we will be sending to Malaysia. The Prime Minister of Australia has refused to rule out whether or not pregnant females, children, the elderly and people who have disabilities seeking asylum in Australia will be sent to Malaysia as part of the deal that was struck with them. If this is true, it is possibly the most inhumane move I have ever heard from any government. It is an absolute disgrace. 


What is worse is the utter hypocrisy from the Labor Left, because it was reported in the newspapers today that this Malaysian deal—despite the lack of detail, despite the obvious flaws and despite the complete disregard of a humanitarian approach—has been accepted by the left wing of the Labor Party. If that is true—and we have no reason to doubt it is not—there is only one conclusion that can be reached about the Labor Left: they have trashed their principles and they have let the Prime Minister of Australia walk all over them and throw out their core values. Clearly, they do not have the guts to stand up to the Prime Minister and tell her that she is wrong. The members and senators of the Labor Left should be ashamed. They are being ignored and they are being ridiculed by the Prime Minister of Australia. In fact, the Australian newspaper today reports that left faction convenor Doug Cameron initially had reservations about the plan but Senator Cameron, who tackled Ms Gillard on the issue at yesterday's caucus meeting, said he had come to see it as an innovative solution. It must have been a pretty pathetic tackle if the outcome is that the Labor Left have rolled over, had their tummies tickled by the Prime Minister and have accepted that the Malaysian deal is in some way innovative.


Which part of the deal do the so-called Labor Left see as innovative? Is it the part where for every one asylum seeker we get five back? They probably do like that part of the deal. Is it the part where the Prime Minister has refused to rule out the deportation of pregnant women and children and has refused to rule out the deportation of the elderly or the infirm? Perhaps the Labor Left really like the part where the Prime Minister of Australia said, 'We are going to do a deal with Malaysia, even though last year I am on the record as saying that I will rule out anywhere that is not a signatory to the refugee convention.' We all know that Malaysia is not a signatory to the refugee convention. Perhaps the Labor Left were won over by Malaysia's alleged undertaking that asylum seekers will not be sent back to the country that they are fleeing from. All I can say to the left wing of the Labor Party is that I hope that statement by the government of Malaysia is not one with the same substance as the statement by Prime Minister Gillard the day before the scheduled election last year when she said to the people of Australia, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' We all know what happened as soon as the Prime Minister assumed office—she changed tack. 


To the Labor Left: you have rolled over just like you did on the pay equity deal. You rolled over and you played dead. You did not have the guts to stand up and, just like that, you have done the same here. You have rolled over and you are betraying your constituency by agreeing to the Malaysian solution. You are now endorsing the Prime Minister of Australia's game of Pacific bingo. What Pacific island will the Prime Minister come up with next? We have had East Timor for months and months. East Timor was the be-all and end-all for the Labor Party. That was going to be the saviour policy for the Labor Party. We on this side had consistently said it was never going to happen, and every time we said that what did the Labor Party tell us? We were wrong. And now it has been absolutely, completely and utterly ruled out not only by the East Timorese but also by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen. East Timor is done and dusted. 


What did we have in the press the other day? We had PNG. We had the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizen­ship, Andrew Metcalfe, making a quick and quiet trip up to PNG to have a chat with the PNG government about whether or not we should reopen Manus Island, despite what the Labor Party has said about Manus Island in the past. Lo and behold! Before the dust had even settled on the newspapers, the Malaysian deal was struck, allegedly. According to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, it is going to be struck within the next few weeks—signed, sealed and delivered. On top of that, we have Nauru in the mix—the only country that wants the Prime Minister to pick up the phone and say, 'Can we bring refugees to you?' The Prime Minister refuses to deal with them.


This is a government that is in complete disarray. This is a government that has a minister whose department is failing to tell him what is going on in the detention centres. We have a Prime Minister and a Labor government that is so desperate that it will do anything and say anything and accept any deal in an attempt to get itself out of the mess it is in.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2011-05-10,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:51):  I did check the diary today to see what day it was just to remind myself which particular section 75 debate we would have, because if you look at the record over the last several months one day per sitting we have had words very similar to those used today. I think there are three words that are different today but it is the same process.



Senator Cash interjecting—




Senator MOORE:
  I'm sorry; maybe you should check for the next sitting Tuesday so that we can get those words accurate—so we know, so we can get the rhetoric right. I have listened to the debates very carefully, I have taken part in a few of them, and it is really great to have the consistency of the rhetoric, even down to the point of making sure that someone, somewhere gets some guts. We are consistently reminded of that.


I really strongly believe that these issues are so important that we must continue to discuss, we must continue to find a solution that will be something that the whole of the parliament can share. But, in that process, what truly disturbs me is that, every time the opposition put up this motion, they begin with an announcement that we have to secure Australia's borders and the process seems to indicate, and we have seen it over many years, a visual picture of Australia being under attack, being invaded. They build up the fear, they build up the rhetoric and they put in place a view that any discussion of the serious issues of asylum seekers in our nation and in our world should be derailed by the premise that we are already in a warlike situation.


This is not new from the opposition. We have seen elections fought using this process. At no time has there been any attempt to hide the number of boats, to mislead with numbers. In fact, what we see is an agreed process whereby when a boat is found to be coming towards Australia that is announced openly to the world. We are told that a boat has been found, we are told how many people are on it and we are told what the process will be. It is not exactly a clandestine, secret operation. In terms of the numbers that have been thrown around in this chamber, we can determine exactly what numbers there were, how many people were involved. These are people who are seeking asylum; we must remember that. We are looking at that issue, and as a country and as a parliament we need to come up with a process under which we take due respon­sibility as a nation. We must take that responsibility. There is no doubt about that.


I cannot explain how pleased I was to have a lecture in this asylum debate today about compassion in processing people. I totally support that. That word, that process and that value should have seen a higher level of debate in this place over the past number of years. That needs to be on the agenda—treating people with compassion. Certainly that is something that will be part of any decision, of any agreement.


Once again, the rhetoric is very important. In the previous speaker's contribution we did not hear about international negotiations, we did not hear about discussions that were held openly between nations to come up with a solution, including at the recent Bali conference. That was a conference; it was not some kind of poker game where people were sitting around making deals. Again, colouring the debate, ensuring that instead of listening to what was happening, instead of understanding the seriousness of the issue, it is better to marginalise, to use rhetoric which takes the focus away from the issue, and also to give those quick one-liners that can be picked up so easily in the media, that can be used to scare, to terrify, to make people genuinely afraid.


What we have had over the period of the Rudd and Gillard governments is an acknowledgement that there is a real issue of asylum seekers in our region. We have also identified as a country that, based on international circumstances, it is an issue not only in our region. The issue of asylum seekers, people fleeing to seek another place to live because of conditions in their homelands, is something that countries are struggling with, making negotiations about and working to come to solutions on across the whole world.


It is no different in the Asia-Pacific region. In fact, what has been acknowledged in the Asia-Pacific region is that because of a number of key issues over the past few years in our region—including the continuing war on Afghanistan, the issues in Sri Lanka, what is happening around the Iranian issue and, most particularly in the past couple of years, the uncertainty in Pakistan—more people are fleeing into the Asia-Pacific area.


So what has our government done? We have said that we wish to work with the other countries in our region to come up with a regional solution. This is similar in some ways to the negotiations, the commitment that governments have made towards the good work that has been done in the past on trafficking and people-smuggling, where we have been able to work with other nations to make sure that everybody has acknowledged and accepted their own responsibilities. What has been referred to as the Malaysian deal, which is an agreement between two countries, is premised on the fact that there is an issue in our region. No-one denies that one of the key points in the journey that people take in this region is Malaysia. They have a significant problem. More than 90,000 people in the Malaysian Peninsula have been identified as seeking asylum.


There is a real need for all countries in our region to understand their responsibilities. We have made a commitment that we will, as a signatory to the international conven­tion, work within that framework to come up with a solution. It is true Malaysia and other nations in our region have not yet signed up to that convention, and that is a serious gap in the process. Labor was absolutely scathing of the coalition government and our policies, especially the Pacific solution, and vowed to end them in government. The fact is they worked. We controlled our borders and it was the Australian government who decided who was to come to Australia. An the infamous words from some, but for us a statement of how it is, I can recall John Howard's words: 


We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.


Of course, we look back now. That is not the case at all, is it? It is not only the people smugglers that are going to make this decision nowadays—we know that the responsibility has now gone to them—but now it is also, I understand, the Malaysian government. They have obviously done a pretty good deal on this. 


I would like to touch for a moment on the contribution from Senator Moore in regard to our policies and that somehow they lack compassion. I would remind Senator Moore and those on the other side that I do not think there is a lot of compassion in a policy that allows people to place the lives of women, children and men on boats that we saw demonstrated at Christmas Island in December on that fateful, tragic day. As a consequence of getting on their boat, so many lives were lost in a pretty horrific way. I do not think you can say that it is not compassionate to ensure that under the UNHCR those people with the highest priority in the world come first. That is the idea. There are 50 million people seeking a migration outcome. We must give the priority to those most in need, and we have identified those people who are leading in abject poverty and misery in the Horn of Africa. The majority of those refugees on boats are not priority refugees, because they can least afford to get on a vessel and to pick a forum.


So what is the latest bumbling attempt to empty our detention centres with the proposal to ship 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia? Well, in return we are going to receive 4,000 refugees picked for us specially in Malaysia. If this plan were cooked up by anyone else, people would have dismissed it as a bad joke. Unfortun­ately, it is real and only could be put down to a desperate and incompetent government. A one-off deal: 800 out, 4,000 in and, by the way, we get to pay every single way. Who could possibly have sat down and said, 'This is in Australia's national interest. You can have 800 of ours, we'll take 4,000 yours and we'll pay everything that is going for.'? I mean, really, spare me.


I understand that the media originally said that this was going to be a two-for-one swap, but such was the strength of the negotiating capacity of the Labor Party, we actually managed to back it up to five to one! If that is not an act of desperation I don't know what is. Malaysia seriously saw the Prime Minister and Minister Bowen coming. That is a complete act of desperation. They have actually got to settle 4,000 refugees in another country at no cost and only had to take 800 people in return, with Australia also footing the bill for that process. Wouldn't it be great if we could do a deal like that?


I can recall them saying that this is going to stop the boats. I can tell you what it will do. It will make sure that boats arrive in a different place—called mainland Australia, mark my words. This is a sophisticated place to play in and you need sophisticated policies that are able to respond. They will not be going to Christmas Island; they will be coming to mainland Australia. If you live where I live—in Darwin—or in Broome in Western Australia, they will be the sort of things to look out for. I am not sure, again, that that is in our interests. 


It does appear to be that, once again, it is only really pride and vanity that prevent this hopeless, incompetent, weak and indecisive government from picking up the phone and actually doing a deal that has been there forever. Ring up the President of Nauru. They have the facilities—again, run by IMO. We have a senator shaking his head on the other side—'No doubt it is because they are not actually a signatory of the convention.' Well, sir, neither is Malaysia.


I think the meltdown of the borders is completely emblematic of the government's weak, indecisive nature. You are not capable of making a decision—we know that right across the board. But even when it you come to make decisions you give away our national interest in the process. Weak and indecisive. It will never do. (Time expired)

Senator O'BRIEN
 (Tasmania) (16:07):  You have to give the opposition some credit for trying. They are desperately trying to do everything they can and say everything they can to try and make the arrangements that this government has entered into with the Malaysian government not work. They are desperately hoping that they do not work, and they are desperately hoping that there is no way that this government can intercept the intentions of the people smugglers. I have to disappoint the opposition. If they do not understand how this system is going to work, let me tell them. The point of the arrangements—



Senator McGauran interjecting—




Senator O'BRIEN:
  Senator McGauran, with his interjection just then, clearly does not understand the logistics a people smuggler will have to deal with. That is, they will have to convince clients in Indonesia that paying the people smuggler money to put them on a boat to Australia will not have them end up in Malaysia. It is curious, isn't it, that there has been a focus on the numbers as if this is some sort of slave trade—as if it is trading person for person. This government is serious about—



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator O'BRIEN:
  Perhaps, Senator Brandis, you will shut your mouth and listen for a change. You are pretty good at opening it.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




Senator O'BRIEN:
  Yes, it is pretty ugly, Senator Brandis, when you yell across the chamber persistently.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
):  Order! The interjections are just far too much. I would ask senators to desist.




Senator O'BRIEN:
  Thank you for your protection, Mr Acting Deputy President. The fact of the matter is that this opposition is treating the arrangements as if it is some human bargain—as if a person-for-person arrangement is a fair trade. This is not about a trade. This is, on the one hand, this govern­ment accepting Australia as a developed country with substantial resources has the capacity to receive refugees who have been through the appropriate process—and, after all, wasn't that the proposition which the former government advanced as justifying the Pacific solution? This government is saying: 'Let's get the UNHCR working in Malaysia. Let's get the UNHCR involved in Malaysia—and the IOM. Let's get an assessment of people who have been waiting there for years'—and we are told there are over 93,000 of them—'and let's make a small contribution and accept 4,000 of them and for Malaysia to make a contribution to what has been agreed on a regional basis in the Pacific region, and that is: let's find a way to disrupt the people smuggler arrangements which lead to a train of people moving from Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran through this region looking for sanctuary, predom­inately in Australia.' So there is nothing wrong with the government's proposal to find a way to get the Malaysian government to become involved in a regional solution to disrupt the activities of people smugglers. But, of course, we are reminded of the coalition's Pacific solution—we were told that all we had to do was pick up the phone and we could have returned to it. We could have made an arrangement with Nauru about what was once perhaps but is not now a ready-to-function destination for potential refugees. 


What did the UNHCR say about the Pacific solution anyway? I think it was Richard Towle, the spokesman for the UNHCR who said:




Australia was obviously looking at ways to divest itself of some of the responsibilities of dealing with refugees.



That is: the former government was seeking to divest Australia of its responsibilities to deal with refugees. That is what he said. He went on to say:




The countries that were negotiated, Nauru and PNG at that time, did not have a refugee issue of their own and largely became places were Australia was able to manage its own protection responsibilities under the convention.





So it was not a regional burden-sharing arrangement at all. It was much more of a responsibility-shifting arrangement. And that's why we think they are not only philosophically but also in the way they were implemented they're quite different types of arrangements. 



He said the latter reflecting on the proposed arrangements, those to which there has been in-principle agreement between the Australian government and the Malaysian government. I say again: Australia is in the position to accept refugees and there are refugees who satisfy the test and are waiting for an opportunity and looking for an opportunity to come to a country such as Australia. Over many years Australia has accepted its responsibility. I believe—unless someone tells me this is not the case—that this is a bipartisan policy between the opposition and the government. We both agree that this country has the capacity to accept refugees, has a responsibility to accept refugees and is prepared to accept refugees who go through a process of seeking asylum from outside of our borders. 


What has this put in place? It puts in place arrangements where, on the one hand, those refugees languishing in Malaysia will get an enhanced opportunity to come to Australia if they satisfy the necessary tests. On the other hand, people smugglers, particularly in Indonesia, will be faced with the problem of convincing those who hitherto would have paid the money to come to Australia that in fact they are not paying the money to go backwards and end up in Malaysia. Self-evidently, that is a proposition which will cause a great deal of trouble to the people smugglers in Indonesia. 


Of course it was the government's hope to negotiate such an arrangement with East Timor. I am happy to say that, although East Timor does not find itself able to move down that path, Malaysia does. The government has also announced that it has in train discussions with other countries about broadening the scope for such a policy, because, at the end of the day—and I think this was also the policy of the coalition—this problem is not just an Australian problem; it is a problem for the region. There are refugees in Indonesia. There are refugees in Malaysia. In the future, one suspects, there will be refugees looking to go to countries such as Papua New Guinea as their economy improves, particularly as the mining sector grows and there is more wealth and opportunities there. There will be other islands in the Pacific which will be seen as destinations for refugees. 


So it is a regional problem and it is a problem that is developing. It is a problem that is not going to go away just by Australia trying to shift its responsibilities, as the Pacific solution did, by shifting those people to places of detention in Nauru and PNG with no other solution available. 


The fact that the UNHCR and the Malaysian government have embraced this approach, given Malaysia's history on refugees, shows just what a substantial breakthrough this arrangement is and just what sort of deterrent this will be for the people smugglers in the future. 


On 8 February, the UNHCR spoke about the previous Nauru situation and the then closure of that centre the UNHCR said:




… 
in our view, today's closure of the centre on Nauru signals the end of a difficult chapter in Australia's treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. Many bona fide refugees caught by the policy spent long periods of isolation, mental hardship and uncertainty – and prolonged separation from their families.



The reality was of course that many of those people ultimately found their way either to Australia or New Zealand. So all that that arrangement did was defer the inevitable—that genuine refugees would find a location and that, being in our region, the likelihood was that it would be Australia or New Zealand. 


I note Senator Scullion talked about the cost of arrangements with Malaysia. We were paying substantial amounts of money to the Nauruan government and the government in PNG for them to operate facilities on our behalf as well as paying for the cost of the operation. So let them not say on the one hand that we are spending money on arrangements with Malaysia, when they spent money, on just the same basis, when they wanted to locate refugees in Nauru and PNG when they were in government. So it really is a bit hypocritical of those who would argue that we should not be paying that money, when one looks at the performance of the previous government.

Senator McGAURAN
 (Victoria) (16:22):  There was a senator whose term finishes on 1 July, like mine does. Senator O'Brien, you did not have to lapse into every single cliche—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Marshall
) (16:22):  Senator McGauran, please address your remarks through the chair.




Senator McGAURAN:
  Through the chair?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes, thank you.




Senator McGAURAN:
  Senator O'Brien did not have to lapse into every possible cliche. He did not have to put up with this so-called Malaysian policy that was not run through the caucus or the cabinet, yet again. He does not have to put up with the insult of the government towards him and his backbench. He does not have to do that, given his limited term here; yet he did. Like every other speaker on the other side, you, Senator O'Brien, are probably someone who did not have to and should not have, and you may as well say you have wasted your public life in this place if you really believe a word you said. None of you do.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McGauran, please address your remarks through the chair, not directly to other senators. 




Senator McGAURAN:
  So I should keep looking at you.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  You do not have to look at me, Senator McGauran, but you need to address your remarks through me.




Senator McGAURAN:
  I like to spray it all around the chamber—but I want you to know that, at all times, I am addressing you, through you, about Senator O'Brien. Have we got that?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you; I am relieved. Please continue.




Senator McGAURAN:
  Good. Anyway, that is what he chooses to do in his dying days of politics and being a parliamentarian. What a shame, because you know as well as everyone—everyone on that side knows—that this is a case of 'here we go again'. This is not the East Timor solution. This is not the people's assembly. This is not the Papua New Guinea deal. This is the Malaysian deal. It is a new one. It is a brand new deal that you knew nothing about. Cabinet did not know. You are taking it all over again from your leadership. You do not have to; you should not. It is no way to run a government, it is no way to run a country and it is no way to serve in public office at all. Sooner or later you have got to stand up to that.


I heard one speaker mention the 'consistency of this debate'. You bet it is consistent; it has been going on for years. Let me read to you, for the purposes of those on broadcast, what this debate is about. They will recognise the terms of this debate, because it has been going on since 2008. It reads: 'The Gillard government’s continued failure to secure Australia’s borders and introduce policies to deny people smugglers the product they sell'. It is a consistent debate, and we have been consistent in putting up the policies to fix the problem. We have been consistent in bringing the government to account. It is the government's inconsistency and policy failure after policy failure. The only consistency is that the leadership will announce it, when you know nothing about it, and within 24 hours you have to walk in here and defend it. You are given your riding instructions, you are given your dot points and you dutifully undertake the defence of the indefensible.


Quite often I come into this place singing the praises of Senator Doug Cameron. He is on a different political spectrum from me, but I have always looked for what Senator Doug Cameron has said in the newspapers. I always like to cut these things out and put them into my top pocket for moments like this. I have always thought, 'Here's a man, unlike the other weaklings across the other side, who will stand up to the Prime Minister, who will raise things in the caucus meetings.' But that is just a perception. I have now been disappointed by Senator Cameron. His latest foray in the caucus room—and it always manages to get into the newspaper, I should add—was to pretend that he was standing up to the Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, and ask about this latest deal, the so-called Malaysian solution. Senator Cameron quickly, as it was rightly described, rolled over. I have worked Senator Cameron out. He is a big disappointment. I am going to have to find another hero on the other side now, in the limited time I have—but I will be watching on A-PAC.




Senator Lundy:
  You are really just filling in time.




Senator McGAURAN:
  All he does is put it up—so the media think he is a grandstander—and just rolls over, just like very other person. And don't you talk, Senator Lundy! I remember coming into this place—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator McGauran, please address your remarks through the chair.




Senator McGAURAN:
  She is interjecting and provoking.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will ask senators to cease interjecting.




Senator McGAURAN:
  The night that Julia Gillard—oh, what was her name?




Senator Lundy:
  Oh, come on.  Show some respect!




Senator McGAURAN:
  I have no respect! How is that? I just want to make this point before I get on to the substance of my address. On the night that Ms Gillard took over the prime ministership there was an adjournment debate in this House. I spoke on it and so did Senator Lundy. On that very night, or perhaps it was the night after, Senator Lundy came into this chamber and dripped with praise for the new prime minister, because she was all part of that plot. She was out for a promotion. Get her the Hansard. It is disgraceful. It is terrible that anyone could be as greasy as Senator Lundy. Heaven forbid if that is how she treats her public office. And she—who does nothing in this chamber—has the audacity to interject on me and say that I am just filling in time. Rubbish! You are the greatest filler I have ever met.


The gravity of this issue does require someone from the front bench, other than an interjector, to come in and speak on this issue. But they never do. They always leave it to the hapless backbench, who know nothing about what is going on. They were warned about the softening of the laws by the Labor Party in 2008. They were warned by their own department. Senator Evans was warned by the department that this would lead to a surge and he was warned by the Federal Police that this would lead to a surge. And that is exactly what happened. But due to the false piety of the other side trying to claim some delusional moral high ground, they maintain this soft policy. What is so moral, I ask them—and I ask the next speaker to answer this question—about giving succour to the people smugglers? What is so moral about inducing people to cross the seas on treacherous journeys where many are lost? What is so moral about denying those in the detention camps, who rightly apply and queue up, their chance to come out to Australia? These are the true moral questions that those on the other side ought to address. You have a policy that is in shambles. You are in denial. (Time expired)

Senator WORTLEY,ALP,2011-05-10,"



Senator WORTLEY
 (South Australia) (17:52):  In rising to speak in this discussion can I first say that this matter of public importance was proposed by those opposite, yet we have had Senator McGauran stand here and waste eight minutes speaking about nothing. He would have had plenty of time to prepare if he had a case, but he does not have a case.


Unlike Senator McGauran, I welcome the opportunity to set the facts straight about what this government has done, and is doing, in the critical area of border protection and, importantly, to set the facts straight about the global context that has given rise to the displacement of people of many nations, some of whom are fleeing civil wars and the like to seek safe haven for themselves and for their families


The issue of unauthorised boat arrivals and irregular migration is not confined to Australia; it is a global problem which many countries around the world have been experiencing for some time now. These countries include Denmark, Sweden, Greece, Italy, Belgium, France, Germany, the United States, Austria, Norway and the United Kingdom. In March this year, the UNHCR released a report showing that during 2010 an estimated 358,000 people fled persecution in their homelands to seek asylum in industrialised countries. The total number of claims made in Australia remains well below levels seen in many other countries. It represents two per cent of total applications for asylum in the industrialised world, according to the report. In 2010, the main destination countries for asylum seekers were the United States, with 55,500 claims; France, with 47,800 claims; Germany, with 41,300 claims; Sweden, with 31,800 claims; and Canada, with 23,200 claims. In comparison, in Australia we received 8,250 claims, and these were largely from people coming from the most troubled and conflict-ridden regions of the world.


Let me be clear: border protection is indeed a matter of public importance. This government has a long-held commitment to addressing the serious nature of people-smuggling activities and to targeting those criminal groups who seek to organise, participate in and benefit from people smuggling. For the record, the Labor government has devoted unprecedented resources to protecting Australia's borders and developing intelligence on people-smuggling activities. It has worked cooperatively with Australia's regional partners to disrupt people-smuggling ventures overseas, and we are subjecting people smugglers to the full force of Australian law.


We know that people smugglers are motivated by greed and we know that they work in sophisticated cross-border crime networks. We know also that they have little regard for the safety and security of the people being smuggled, endangering their lives in unseaworthy and overcrowded boats.


The Gillard government believes the way to respond to what is a regional problem is to develop regional solutions. Irregular migration and people smuggling are global and regional problems that cannot be tackled by acting alone. These issues must be tackled in partnership with other countries. Under the Howard government, Australia took a unilateral approach. The Howard coalition government acted alone. It is a fact that genuine regional cooperation was never a prospect under the Howard government, and Senator McGauran knows that.


Protecting Australia's borders and airports from threats of terrorism, people smuggling, organised crime, illegal foreign fishing and the trafficking of illicit goods continues to be a top priority of the government. Those opposite know that the Labor government introduced legislation, including the Anti-People-Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, which reflects this. This bill ensures that people-smuggling activities are consistently and comprehensively crimin­alised and it makes it an offence to provide material support for people smuggling. It also equips our law enforcement and national security agencies with effective investigative capabilities to detect and disrupt people smuggling. It is just one example of the government's commitment to addressing the serious nature of people-smuggling activities and targeting those criminal groups who seek to organise, participate in and benefit from it.


On Saturday, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced new measures as part of a regional cooperation framework that aims to put people smugglers out of business and prevent asylum seekers making the very dangerous journey to Australia by boat. The bilateral arrangement will take the form of a cooperative transfer agreement that will see asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by sea being transferred to Malaysia. In exchange, Australia will expand its humanitarian program and take on a greater share of the burden of responsibility for resettling refugees currently residing in Malaysia. The core elements of this bilateral arrangement will include a provision that 800 irregular maritime arrivals who arrive in Australia after the date of effect of the arrangement will be transferred to Malaysia for refugee status determination. In return, over four years Australia will settle 4,000 refugees already residing in Malaysia. Transferees will not receive any preferential treatment over asylum seekers already in Malaysia. Transferees will be provided with the opportunity to have their asylum claims considered, and those in need of international protection will not be refouled. So no-one who is transferred will return to their country of origin while their claims are being assessed or if they are found to be in need of protection. Transferees will be treated with dignity and respect in accordance with human rights standards. In addition, the UNHCR will be responsible for the processing of applicants involved in this process and a robust, independent advisory board will be established to oversee the implementation of the agreement.


Unfortunately, today most of the world's refugees are living in countries that have not signed the UN refugee convention. In the case of Malaysia, there is agreement to abide by key parts of the convention. Australia and Malaysia are working closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration to operationalise the arrange­ment.


In response to the government's announcement, UNHCR regional represen­tative Richard Towle said the scheme has the potential to improve the way the region manages refugee flows. In an interview published on the ABC online website, he says:




… it's very important that this agreement is appropriately monitored and is seen to deliver not only outcomes for governments in terms of dealing with human smuggling and trafficking movements but also is seen to deliver improved protection for people in the region.





I think in that 
sense it has the potential to … 
make a significant practical contribution to what we're trying to achieve in the region.





And if it's a good experience other countries can look at it and say yes, that's a positive way of managing these issues. Perhaps we want to embark on similar or other initiatives under a regional cooperation framework.



Mr Towle goes on to say that there are significant differences between the current deal and the Howard government's Pacific solution. He says:




This is an agreement, it's a bilateral agreement that has been negotiated within a broader regional cooperation framework with the involvement of UNHCR and the involvement of IOM … and we hope the involvement of other important actors as well, including non-governmental organisations.





So it is an agreement between countries that are actively involved with refugee issues and both commonly face a refugee displacement problem.



Mr Towle points out that the Howard government's push to house asylum seekers in countries without a refugee problem was about shifting responsibility. He says:




Australia was obviously looking at ways to divest itself of some of the responsibilities of dealing with refugees. The countries that were negotiated, Nauru and PNG at that time, did not have a refugee issue of their own and largely became places were Australia was able to manage its own protection responsibilities under the convention.





So it was not a regional burden-sharing arrange
­
ment at all. It was much more of a responsibility-shifting arrangement. And that's why we think they are not only philosophically but also in the way they were implemented they're quite different types of arrangements.

Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (16:51):  The coalition supports the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. It essentially appropriates an extra year of funding for the Australian Research Council for the 2013 year as well as providing for indexation of the funding in the forward estimates. Other than that, the bill makes no substantial amendments to the ARC Act.


However, it is worth briefly giving some context to why research matters. Research is the engine of innovation, productivity and, of course, growth. In a modern advanced economy, research is essential to maintaining the edge over our competitors and improving the lives of Australians. Virtually every technology we use, every convenience we take for granted, has its roots in research. We might not see or think much about research, but its benefits are all around us. Spending on research is, quite simply, one of the best investments a government can make. In purely monetary terms, it produces a better return on every dollar spent than just about every other way the government can spend money. It advances human knowledge, produces countless direct benefits and spin-offs and, when commercialised, brings a wealth of benefits to our country, our economy and our people.


In all fairness, I am starting to sound like my friend Senator Carr, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, in expanding the benefits of research. In a sense I raise this because of mooted cuts to the budget of the National Health and Medical Research Council, the NHMRC. I know that Senator Carr and I am sure Senator Evans as well—being responsible for tertiary education—would agree with me that the funding of research is critical. It is a pity that the government is considering cutting those funds. I am hoping that Senator Carr, Senator Evans and others in the government that care about these things will make sure that Mr Swan and the bean counters do not get away with too much. I think it is fair to say that with research you cannot just cut it and then pick it up the next day, because when you cut it people leave, contracts are broken, relationships are destroyed and expertise often goes overseas.


Just the other day I was at the well-named Menzies Research Institute at the University of Tasmania where they are doing great work in the areas of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. They have 150 researchers there and it is one of the Australia's great medical research institutes. I am really concerned about what might happen to that institute among others if those cuts that are being mooted in fact occur.


One of the great interests of former Prime Minister Mr Howard was medical research. Senators will remember that, between 1995 and 1996 and up until the 2008 budget, the coalition provided a fivefold increase in medical research funding with funding increasing to about $700 million annually. It was one of Mr Howard's great passions. I was told when I was at the Menzies Research Institute that the then Prime Minister spent nearly an entire day at the institute looking at the projects and the medical research being undertaken at the University of Tasmania. That is a long time for a prime minister to spend in one spot looking at one particular project. To the coalition, this is very important research not just for the researchers in Tasmania but for the Australian people.


I know the budget is being delivered tonight and I know there are financial constraints on the budget. I accept that and I think the country knows that. Suffice to say that cutting medical research at this time would be the wrong move because the benefits it brings to all Australians has great multiplier effects. I am hoping tonight that Mr  Swan does not take an axe to that. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (16:56):  The Australian Research Council is a statutory authority within the Australian government's Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio. Its mission is to deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and benefit the community. In seeking to achieve its mission, the ARC provides advice to the government on research matters and manages the National Competitive Grants Program, a significant component of Australia's investment in research and development. Through the National Competitive Grants Program, the ARC supports the highest quality fundamental and applied research and research training through competitive selection processes across all disciplines, with the exception of clinical medicine and dentistry.


This is an appropriation bill to support the ongoing operations of the ARC. It will fund the high-quality research we need to address the great challenges of our time, to improve the quality of people's lives, to support the development of new industries and to remain competitive in the global knowledge economy. Bills to amend the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to receive administered funding occur each year. This is to apply indexation to existing approp­riation amounts, create an additional forward estimate and may also contain new funding for new initiatives. The current bill updates the special appropriation funding cap amounts administered by the Australian Research Council to include indexation adjustments to three existing financial year appropriation amounts and adds a forward estimate year in the Australian Research Council Act 2001. The bill adjusts the Australian Research Council's funding cap for the financial years beginning on 1 July 2010, 2011 and 2012 in line with indexation and sets the funding cap for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2013. Indexation adjustments and adding an additional forward estimate are part of the standard budget process and are administrative in nature. The proposed amendments change only the administered special appropriation; they do not alter the substance of the act or increase departmental funds.


The ARC is the major source of funding for the innovative, investigator driven research that has underpinned inventions ranging from the bionic ear to the Jameson flotation cell which saves the coal industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year. ARC centres of excellence provide key science and policy advice on the management of coral reefs, are developing automated control systems for the mining industry and agricultural sector and are taking some big challenges in medicine such as applying nanobionics to regenerate spinal cord injuries. ARC funding has enabled regional centres such as the Cairns campus of James Cook University to attract Australian and international leaders in tropical rainforest ecology to build world-class teams of researchers and postgraduate students. Ongoing funding for the Australian Research Council is essential to the vitality of the Australian higher education system. Excellent researchers across all areas of the university system must be able to compete for funding if we are to keep world-class academics in Australia working in our universities and teaching the next generation. Since 2007 the Australian Research Council has delivered on our 2007 election commitment of 1,000 Future Fellowships. The Australian government will provide, over five years, up to $844 million and will award up to 1,000 of these midcareer research fellowships. The inaugural 200 future fellows were announced in September 2009 and a second round of 200 was announced in October 2010. Sixty of the fellowships announced last October identified environment and climate change as a target research area.


In July 2010 we announced the establishment of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Change to address uncertainties in regional climate science. This world-class research centre, hosted by the University of New South Wales, will receive $21.4 million over seven years. The centre's research programs will investigate the effects of tropical convection on Australia's climate; risks; mechanisms and attribution of changes in Australian climate extremes; the role of land surface forcing and feedbacks for regional climate; drivers of spatial and temporal climate variability in extratropical Australia; and mechanisms and attribution of past and future ocean circulation change.


In January 2008 we announced the establishment of the ARC Advisory Council and a range of other measures to enhance the independence of the ARC. In January 2011 six new members were appointed to the council, increasing its overall size from seven members to 10, to enhance its range of expertise and experience and ensure it is well placed to provide strategic and policy advice.


In February 2008 we announced that the ARC would deliver the Excellence in Research for Australia framework. This is a world-leading research evaluation frame­work reflecting the Australian government's commitment to a transparent, streamlined evaluation of the quality of research undertaken in Australia's universities. The Australian government has provided $35.8 million over four years. Since 2008 the ARC has undertaken three years of comprehensive and widespread consultation with the higher education research sector on the develop­ment of ERA. The first full round of evaluations for ERA took place in 2010. The ARC delivered the ERA 2010 national report on 31 January 2011. This landmark report highlights both Australia's research strengths and areas with potential for further development. It will allow the Australian government to plan the future of research investment in Australia. It provides assurance to government, industry and the Australian public of the quality of research conducted in Australian higher education institutions and the value of government investment in the research sector. For ERA 2010 the ARC received data in relation to some 330,000 unique research outputs and over 55,000 researchers.


The ERA initiative is a key element of the government's agenda for the reform of Australia's higher education system, articulated in Transforming Australia's Higher Education System (2009), and its innovation agenda, expressed in Powering Ideas: An Innovation Agenda for the 21st Century (2009). ERA gives Australia, for the first time, the capacity to rigorously measure our achievements against our peers around the world. It draws together rich information about discipline-specific research activity at each individual institution, as well as information about the contribution to the national landscape of each discipline in each institution.


In March 2008 the government announced the opening of all ARC grant schemes to international competition and in July 2008 the government announced the opening of the ARC schemes to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. The ARC continues to work closely with Indigenous researchers on a range of new initiatives for those Indigenous researchers.


In September 2008 the ARC introduced the Australian Laureate Fellowships Scheme to build strong teams around our very best research leaders. The Australian government will provide, over five years, up to $239 million and will award up to 75 fellowships. The inaugural 15 laureate fellows were announced in June 2009. In November 2010 the Prime Minister announced two additional laureate fellowships—the Kathleen Fitzpatrick Australian Laureate Fellowship in the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences; and the Georgina Sweet Australian Laureate Fellowship in Science and Technology—for female researchers and research leaders of international repute. The new ARC scheme 'Researchers in Industry Training Awards', part of the government's Clean 21 initiative, will focus on increasing industry engagement in research and development projects through funding research student stipends in industry sectors vital to Australia's future. Up to 200 awards will be available—100 each in 2012 and 2014—an investment of $23.4 million over six years. The targeted industry sectors include built environment, clean energy, future manufacturing, industries supporting innovative regions and the marine and maritime industry.


The new Discovery Early Career Researcher Award scheme will provide more focused support for researchers and create more opportunities for early-career researchers in both teaching and research positions and research-only positions. It is expected that up to 200 three-year awards will be available each year, commencing in 2012.


The ARC has also introduced Research Opportunity and Performance Evidence to enable assessors to take into account any career interruptions, including those for childbirth and caring responsibilities—very welcome news. In November 2010 the Australian government approved $21 million in funding for the ARC Special Research Initiative in Stem Cell Science and announced the successful proposal of Stem Cells Australia, who will conduct world-class research and create a public awareness unit to provide public education and encourage public debate into the ethical, legal and public policy issues associated with stem cell science.


In July 2010, 13 new centres of excellence were announced, with total Australian government support of $255.9 million over seven years. This was in addition to the Australian government's announcement in February 2009 of an additional $82.25 million to extend the funding of the 11 existing centres of excellence.


Through this important legislation, the ARC will continue to advance our efforts to build a fairer and more prosperous Australia through innovation and education. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2011-05-10,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (16:51):  The coalition supports the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. It essentially appropriates an extra year of funding for the Australian Research Council for the 2013 year as well as providing for indexation of the funding in the forward estimates. Other than that, the bill makes no substantial amendments to the ARC Act.


However, it is worth briefly giving some context to why research matters. Research is the engine of innovation, productivity and, of course, growth. In a modern advanced economy, research is essential to maintaining the edge over our competitors and improving the lives of Australians. Virtually every technology we use, every convenience we take for granted, has its roots in research. We might not see or think much about research, but its benefits are all around us. Spending on research is, quite simply, one of the best investments a government can make. In purely monetary terms, it produces a better return on every dollar spent than just about every other way the government can spend money. It advances human knowledge, produces countless direct benefits and spin-offs and, when commercialised, brings a wealth of benefits to our country, our economy and our people.


In all fairness, I am starting to sound like my friend Senator Carr, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, in expanding the benefits of research. In a sense I raise this because of mooted cuts to the budget of the National Health and Medical Research Council, the NHMRC. I know that Senator Carr and I am sure Senator Evans as well—being responsible for tertiary education—would agree with me that the funding of research is critical. It is a pity that the government is considering cutting those funds. I am hoping that Senator Carr, Senator Evans and others in the government that care about these things will make sure that Mr Swan and the bean counters do not get away with too much. I think it is fair to say that with research you cannot just cut it and then pick it up the next day, because when you cut it people leave, contracts are broken, relationships are destroyed and expertise often goes overseas.


Just the other day I was at the well-named Menzies Research Institute at the University of Tasmania where they are doing great work in the areas of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. They have 150 researchers there and it is one of the Australia's great medical research institutes. I am really concerned about what might happen to that institute among others if those cuts that are being mooted in fact occur.


One of the great interests of former Prime Minister Mr Howard was medical research. Senators will remember that, between 1995 and 1996 and up until the 2008 budget, the coalition provided a fivefold increase in medical research funding with funding increasing to about $700 million annually. It was one of Mr Howard's great passions. I was told when I was at the Menzies Research Institute that the then Prime Minister spent nearly an entire day at the institute looking at the projects and the medical research being undertaken at the University of Tasmania. That is a long time for a prime minister to spend in one spot looking at one particular project. To the coalition, this is very important research not just for the researchers in Tasmania but for the Australian people.


I know the budget is being delivered tonight and I know there are financial constraints on the budget. I accept that and I think the country knows that. Suffice to say that cutting medical research at this time would be the wrong move because the benefits it brings to all Australians has great multiplier effects. I am hoping tonight that Mr  Swan does not take an axe to that. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2011-05-10,"



Senator LUNDY
 (Australian Capital Territory—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) (16:56):  The Australian Research Council is a statutory authority within the Australian government's Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio. Its mission is to deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and benefit the community. In seeking to achieve its mission, the ARC provides advice to the government on research matters and manages the National Competitive Grants Program, a significant component of Australia's investment in research and development. Through the National Competitive Grants Program, the ARC supports the highest quality fundamental and applied research and research training through competitive selection processes across all disciplines, with the exception of clinical medicine and dentistry.


This is an appropriation bill to support the ongoing operations of the ARC. It will fund the high-quality research we need to address the great challenges of our time, to improve the quality of people's lives, to support the development of new industries and to remain competitive in the global knowledge economy. Bills to amend the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to receive administered funding occur each year. This is to apply indexation to existing approp­riation amounts, create an additional forward estimate and may also contain new funding for new initiatives. The current bill updates the special appropriation funding cap amounts administered by the Australian Research Council to include indexation adjustments to three existing financial year appropriation amounts and adds a forward estimate year in the Australian Research Council Act 2001. The bill adjusts the Australian Research Council's funding cap for the financial years beginning on 1 July 2010, 2011 and 2012 in line with indexation and sets the funding cap for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2013. Indexation adjustments and adding an additional forward estimate are part of the standard budget process and are administrative in nature. The proposed amendments change only the administered special appropriation; they do not alter the substance of the act or increase departmental funds.


The ARC is the major source of funding for the innovative, investigator driven research that has underpinned inventions ranging from the bionic ear to the Jameson flotation cell which saves the coal industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year. ARC centres of excellence provide key science and policy advice on the management of coral reefs, are developing automated control systems for the mining industry and agricultural sector and are taking some big challenges in medicine such as applying nanobionics to regenerate spinal cord injuries. ARC funding has enabled regional centres such as the Cairns campus of James Cook University to attract Australian and international leaders in tropical rainforest ecology to build world-class teams of researchers and postgraduate students. Ongoing funding for the Australian Research Council is essential to the vitality of the Australian higher education system. Excellent researchers across all areas of the university system must be able to compete for funding if we are to keep world-class academics in Australia working in our universities and teaching the next generation. Since 2007 the Australian Research Council has delivered on our 2007 election commitment of 1,000 Future Fellowships. The Australian government will provide, over five years, up to $844 million and will award up to 1,000 of these midcareer research fellowships. The inaugural 200 future fellows were announced in September 2009 and a second round of 200 was announced in October 2010. Sixty of the fellowships announced last October identified environment and climate change as a target research area.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (20:02):  On 6 March this year, I had the opportunity to visit McMullen Abbeyfield House in Huonville in southern Tasmania for its 10th birthday celebrations. McMullen Abbeyfield House, in Huonville, is part of Abbeyfield Australia, which is the peak national body that represents 26 affiliated Abbeyfield associations. Across Australia, there are 23 Abbeyfield houses and three hostel aged care facilities. These facilities are located in Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland. Tasmania has five Abbeyfield houses, with the others being in Burnie, Launceston, Chigwell and Glenorchy. Tasmania is certainly well represented in Abbeyfield houses, given the state's small population, but bearing in mind the percentage of the population over 65 this is possibly not surprising. 


McMullen Abbeyfield House is a group home that encourages independent living in a supportive environment. Residents come and go as they please, retaining their indepen­dence and personal interests, but they have the company of others if they choose to socialise in shared areas of the home. McMullen House has a wonderful vegetable garden and many fruit trees. Many of the residents enjoy harvesting the wide variety of vegetables and fruit grown and also cook and preserve much of the produce. Indeed, I was quite envious of the many preserve jars on the wall unit.


The residents have a real sense of pride and belonging in their home. They have a housekeeper and are provided with home-cooked meals. The residents tell me the food is wonderful, and if they want to cook they are encouraged to do so. I think this is one of the aspects that makes the facility a real home for many: the fact that they can make a cake, cook a dinner or just be in the kitchen with the housekeeper.


Costs are met by residents paying 70 per cent of the base pension plus 100 per cent of their rent assistance to Abbeyfield. Payments cover food, accommodation, cleaning, materials and power, plus a gardener for those bigger gardening jobs, and rates on the building. If family visit and wish to stay overnight, there is a guest room, and family and friends can stay for meals, both at small cost. This is a real sense of home; it is not at all institutionalised. There is a real sense of warmth and personality, and the residents really enjoy the mix of independence, while still feeling supported. A couple of the residents told me it was the best move they had ever made. McMullen Abbeyfield House was largely funded by a private estate. Land and the equivalent costs of seven rooms and en suites were included. The remaining three rooms were funded by the state government and the normal public housing eligibility criteria apply.


There is another Abbeyfield House, in the northern suburbs of Hobart. Abbeyfield Glenorchy was developed with funding under the Local Government Community Housing Program, and a contribution from the Commonwealth government, at the time the Keating government. The Common­wealth government funding came in the form of two separate grants, $440,000 in the 1992-93 financial year and $40,000 in the 1993-94 financial year. This project was also greatly supported by Rotary, Lions and the Trust Bank Foundation.


While I am mentioning Abbeyfield Glenorchy, I would like to congratulate the five people who were awarded life membership of Abbeyfield Glenorchy Inc. for their service last year. They are Mrs Anne Gunn, Mrs June Flood, Mrs Merle Diakovsky, Mr Max Maynard and Mr Leo Hurst. Mr Hurst is also a director on the Abbeyfield Australia board. He is joined there by fellow Tasmanian David Kay, who is the national treasurer.


Abbeyfield's focus has been providing assisted group housing for Australians aged 55 and over. However, there is now also accommodation for people with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. This change in direction has occurred as a result of need in the community.


Abbeyfield Australia is part of a worldwide movement with 18 countries using the concept of group housing, which began in the United Kingdom in 1955. The concept came about when Richard Carr-Gomm volunteered his services to help elderly people needing practical assistance and companionship. Mr Carr-Gomm went further than just being a helper and companion. He purchased a house, made it available for people to live in and became the housekeeper, although this was only for a very short time. Mr Carr-Gomm then founded the Carr-Gomm Society, which operated on the same principles. Abbeyfield in Australia began in 1986 with a home in Melbourne. Other countries using the concept include Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jersey, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, South Africa, the United States of America, and an associate member, Mexico. At present more than 9,000 people live in 850 Abbeyfield houses worldwide. Abbeyfield Australia is a registered not-for-profit company and registered charity.


The national peak body advocates for all Abbeyfield houses and helps to maintain a management and support framework for all associations. This includes providing: legal and governance advice; national repre­sentation and advocacy; planning, building design and project management; a national framework of policies and operational procedures; a comprehensive suite of tar­geted insurance policies; affiliation and man­age­ment agreements; ongoing operational guidance; and collegial support and volunteer networking opportunities


Abbeyfield Australia understands that Australia's demand for affordable housing will continue to increase at a rapid rate as the 'baby boomer' generation ages. They also recognise that group living is a highly cost-effective way in which to provide quality community based accommodation. Abbeyfield Australia has both the capacity and the experience to assist in meeting the demands of the nation's changing population.


Each Abbeyfield house is managed by a local incorporated association with its own volunteer committee of management. The local association must manage the house in line with the Abbeyfield Australia gov­ernance principles and procedures. The association is responsible for: compliance with tenancy legislation and food safety standards; induction and continuing liaison with residents; employment of the live-in housekeeper; budgeting and financial management; and consultation with residents on both an individual and a house level


Abbeyfield Australia is hopeful that it will be able to help meet the demands for affordable and cost-effective community housing. Abbeyfield believes its expertise and community volunteer commitment, combined with financial support from the Australian government, can deliver good outcomes in an economically responsible way. Once built, there is no need for ongoing financial support from government as all operational costs are met through the rent. The Abbeyfield business model allows for consistent outcomes while maximising local community involvement and ownership.


Each Abbeyfield house has room for 10 residents with each having their own bedroom with ensuite and tea and coffee facilities. Shared areas of the house include lounge and dining areas, a laundry and an outdoor area. When I was at Abbeyfield House in Huonville each room had its own little outdoor area and many of the residents had tables and chairs where they could relax with family. As mentioned, a housekeeper provides nutritious meals and the maintenance and house costs are covered by the local association.


One of the most important things about an Abbeyfield house is that they are designed to feel like a home and not like an institution or facility. Abbeyfield residents experience many benefits, which may include: affordable, supportive, safe and long-term secure accommodation; greater indepen­dence for older residents; an opportunity for people with disability to move out from their parents' home; enhanced social relationships and companionship; increased community participation; and the lessening of isolation for those people who live in isolated areas. They also allow people to stay within the area they have grown up in. That was a great benefit at the Huonville home I visited. There is also additional opportunities to access work, especially for residents with disability. It eases the burden on family members who have been previously caring for the resident.


I believe Abbeyfield is a great concept in that it provides affordable housing as well as allowing residents to live independently while still receiving support when needed. Abbeyfield Australia has developed a strategic plan for 2010 to 2015 and it has set a target of having 46 households across the nation by the end of that period. With that many houses, about 650 people will be living in Abbeyfield accommodation. Further to this, by 2025 it is envisaged Abbeyfield Australia will have more than 100 properties accommodating approximately 1,300 people.


In conclusion, I would point out that Australia has approximately 522 local government areas. If there were just one house in each local government area that would accommodate more than 5,200 people. That is certainly something worth thinking about.
