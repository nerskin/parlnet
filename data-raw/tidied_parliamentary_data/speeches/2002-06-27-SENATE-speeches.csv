No. 20	Disability Discrimination Amendment Bill 2002.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-27,"—I am motivated to agree with this motion but on the understanding that some difficulties I have with the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2002 are agreed to by the government. Otherwise, the bill should be taken off the list.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-06-27,"—As always and as I said yesterday, if there is any disagreement we will pull the bill. We would obviously seek to reach agreement up until 12.45 p.m. and, if there is no agreement, the bill will be pulled.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,3,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-27,"—I oppose this motion. My difficulty with this procedure is that we have not had adequate time to deal with the Migration Legislation Amendment (Procedural Fairness) Bill 2002. My cursory view of this legislation is that it limits natural justice in terms of people making an approach to the courts. The legislation has not been before a committee. It has not been directed to a committee.
—Yes, it has.
—I am told it has been; however, I have not heard an argument for urgency from the government. We know we have got a crammed timetable for today; inserting this legislation into the timetable without an opportunity for full debate is not something I support. I suggest to the government that the proper course of action is to have this piece of legislation brought before the Senate after the winter recess.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,14,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-06-27,"—I want to speak briefly on this motion. As people may be aware, standing order 111 is put in place so that bills that are introduced in one session are not automatically debated in that same session unless there is a compelling case for urgency. It is basically a protection against the government rushing things through. I would have to say that I disagree to some extent with what Senator Brown said. I do think the Migration Legislation Amendment (Procedural Fairness) Bill 2002 has had enough time for consideration. There was a reasonably comprehensive committee inquiry into it, and on that side of things I think it is fair enough although perhaps slightly tangential to the general purpose of the cut-off. I note the Labor members of that committee, in their findings in the report, felt that this legislation should lie on the table for a period of time until a particularly crucial full Federal Court decision comes down. I think there is a lot of wisdom in that view, and I notice that the same arguments were put in the House of Representatives by the shadow minister, Ms Julia Gillard, when debating this bill. 
Whilst it is not the usual practice to use a cut-off order to wait until a court case comes down, I think it is a wise course of action and, in that sense, preventing this motion from going through would achieve that outcome. If this does go through, which I assume it will, we can revisit that question when we debate the bill later on. In that context, where there is a major court hearing happening that could significantly affect the issue that is addressed by this legislation, and also because we do have some 20 bills to deal with in one day, I think that removing this bill and making it 19 bills would be in the Senate's interest and the parliament's interest. So, for those reasons—which are not the normal reasons for which I would oppose exempting something from the cut-off, because I do think that there has been enough time for scrutiny—the Democrats will oppose this motion.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,14,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-06-27,"—The opposition will be supporting the exemption from the cut-off, and I think the reasons need to be made plain. This is a technical bill but it is not a complex bill. What it does—and perhaps this may help Senator Brown, because his explanation of the effect of it surprises me slightly—is to create a belt-and-braces effect. There was a case called Miah, and I do not want to get into the technicalities of the case, which overturned the longstanding view that the Migration Act codified procedural fairness. That was first introduced by former minister for immigration Gerry Hand in 1992. This might assist Senator Brown in coming to the conclusion that this is a matter that is urgent from the government's perspective, and that is why we are supporting it.
The codification was understood to exist since 1992. It was then that the Miah case was overturned, by a narrow majority, and so there was no longer a view that there was a code; and obviously since the decision there has been time for other interpretations to be put on it. There is now a degree of uncertainty which needs to be put beyond reasonable doubt, and that can be done by this bill.
In addition, there was a quite significant and lengthy committee inquiry. I was the acting chair during part of that inquiry, so I can say that it did receive sufficient and quite lengthy scrutiny. There were both majority and minority reports, which allow people to examine the issues in detail. The reason— and I think Senator Ian Campbell will probably go to it—that the government have sought to bring it forward and allow it to be proceeded with is that there is a need to ensure that there is certainty in relation to the law in this area.
Question agreed to. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,14,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-27,"—I just need to finish something I was saying last night about the regulations that we propose as they relate to the Greens amendment. I was talking last night about how the regulations would also cover the protection that will be available to affected organisations in relation to action taken in good faith and without negligence. The regulations are also likely to cover the required minimum levels of circulation to their staff that affected organisations should undertake of the procedures themselves and of action taken under the regulations in relation to particular persons and accounts. It is not possible to be more specific about these regulations because detailed consultation will need to take place with the finance industry and other relevant stakeholders at the time of drafting these regulations. I think that is quite reasonable in the circumstances. Although responsibility for the regulations will be that of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, officers of the Attorney-General's Department, AUSTRAC, AFP and Treasury, will also be consulted during the drafting process so that there will be an across-the-board approach, if you like, in relation to government and the drafting of these regulations.
The steps that I have outlined are consistent with guidelines that currently appear on the Foreign Affairs web site in relation to procedures that should be followed by those who currently have obligations under the existing Charter of the United Nations (Anti-Terrorism Measures) Regulations which will be replaced by proposed part 4 of the charter of the United Nations Act 1945. What I outlined last night and this morning is a comprehensive summary of why the government cannot agree to the Greens proposal that would enable asset freeze listings to be disallowed by parliament, and a clarification of the reason we have proposed disallowance in relation to the listing of terrorist organisations but we do not do so here.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-27,"—Minister, does the listing that has been made by the government of organisations to have their assets frozen and of individuals to have their assets frozen include only organisations and individuals known by the Security Council or are there other organisations and/or individuals on that list?",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-27,"—The government's existing listings under regulations drawn listings are taken from the United Nations Security Council resolutions and on information provided from other sources including other countries. I understand that the listing, albeit deriving from those other sources, is a listing which has its genesis in the United Nations Security Council resolutions.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-27,"—Could the minister tell the Senate which organisations, other than those nominated by the Security Council, have been put on this list and which individuals. What does this mean for those organisations and/or individuals? Does it include a prohibition on them fundraising?
—We will have to take that on notice, because there is some detail to that, and endeavour to get back to the committee as soon as we can. And on fundraising as well.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-27,"—There we have it. We already have a government that has moved beyond listings coming from the Security Council to prohibit organisations and/or individuals in Australia by back door proscription. Effectively, when you remove the ability to fundraise and the ability to have any sort of financial structure, when you foreclose on people having credit cards, on having bank accounts, on being able to raise and disperse funds, you knock that organisation or that individual out of functioning in society. It is effective proscription. But the need for it can be seen from the government's point of view, I am sure, in view of the well-known terrorist organisations which have been listed by the Security Council. I will not reiterate our concern with that except to say it is not endorsed by the General Assembly of the United Nations, and in the Security Council the big five powers have the ability of veto. What we are saying is that when they send the list to us, we do not. 
The problem here is that the parliament ought to have an overview of this listing which knocks people out of action in the community. The minister has argued that we need to do it swiftly and we sometimes need to catch hold of money in accounts before the presumed terrorist organisations or individuals have the opportunity to move it on. What I am saying to the committee and what is being expressed in these amendments from the Greens is, so be it, but bring it to the parliament and let the parliament have a view of what is going on here. Otherwise we leave the executive, which is not elected as an executive by the people of Australia, to decide for itself which organisations and which individuals in this country are going to be knocked out of functioning—effectively having their rights removed by back door banning—by this back door method of proscription.
The argument is that the government is going to act responsibly. That argument is fatally flawed and we have had senior jurists appear before the relevant Senate committee and express opinions in public which say, `You should not open the door, even in a healthy democracy such as ours, to an abuse by a future executive without parliamentary overview.' It is an extremely necessary and healthy thing, if we must be proscribing organisations in our country in this robust democracy, that the buck stop not with the executive but with the parliament. What worries me doubly here is that the Labor Party, the opposition, is going along with this, saying, `Let's remove the parliament from this process, we will leave it to the executive.' This is the Labor Party that says it is concerned about proscription, of banning of organisations and that it has historically been against the banning of organisations. Now we have the test here it is saying, `We will allow this backyard banning of organisations which the government in these circumstances is putting before the Senate.'
This goes far beyond Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden and co. This goes to a raft of organisations which have already been proscribed and individuals and opens the door to more. The government does not have to explain itself. It does not have to fit any particular set of rules and regulations except the wide-open definitions of terrorist, terrorism or terrorist organisations which is in this legislation and the bill we dealt with last night. It is enough for the government to be able to show that there is a threat to health and safety involved in what somebody is doing. As I have pointed out before, into that net can fall active unions, environmental groups that are protesting, people who are protesting outside Woomera or the World Trade Centre or in the streets of any of our cities or towns. Indeed, Indigenous people who want to protest against uranium mining could find themselves caught up by this legislation. People on the wharves who want to protest against health and safety regulations could find themselves caught up in this legislation as endangering health and safety. It is very dangerous legislation and Labor is going along with it.
I make an appeal to Labor to think again about this. Do you really want the executive of this government, and much worse some other potential government which is much more high-handed and proscriptive and much less concerned about traditional rights in our country, being able to proscribe organisations under the wide-open definitions that are in this piece of legislation? I think most members of the Labor Party would be horrified if they knew the potential of this legislation. I think many supporters of the National Party and the Liberal Party would be horrified if they knew the potential for a minister to proscribe organisations under the wide-open definitions here. Were this bolted down to what the community sees as terrorism, people who are involved in the planning or carrying out of bloody acts against people and property, there would be a better argument, but it is not. If you are an organisation or individual allegedly involved in threatening communications such as email systems or if you are in the bush, up in trees which are wired together, as is common in protests, or if you are at a protest anywhere with deep-pit latrines, you could be in trouble. I can tell you from protests I have been to that the first thing that happens is the health authorities arrive from the local council to try to put you out of business. If you are going to be a serious threat to health and safety in their view you can go on this government list. The government can say, `We would not abuse this.' Does the opposition really accept that? Is the opposition assured that this is fine—with this government let alone some other governments that you can think about? The Mayor of Dublin said, `The price of peace is eternal vigilance.' It is the same for democracy and I think the Labor Party has taken its eye off the game here. It has gone to sleep on this one, and that is very worrying because once this legislation goes through we cannot get it back, at least not in the term of this government. You cannot get it back through the House of Representatives whatever we might try in the Senate.
I appeal to the Labor Party to think again about this. Do not give the executive the power to proscribe through the back door without allowing us the ability to oversight that. Allow the parliament to keep a watch on this. If you must do this, that is, allow the proscription to be instantaneous and secret and unknown to the individuals and organisations affected by it, because that is what this bill allows—we oppose that and you support it—have the matter brought before the parliament and have us empowered to keep a watch on the excess of this or some future executive. That is very, very important to the health of this functioning democracy.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-27,"—Minister, I think that Senator Brown draws attention to the fact that currently before the committee we have legislation that provides for asset freezing of organisations nominated by the Security Council of the United Nations and we also face a situation where there is a separate list of organisations to which asset freezing applies that is in part drawn from United Nations lists and is in part drawn from other sources. I imagine that some of those other sources include the US State Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade here and its agencies. The minister may be able to inform the committee in relation to the head of power for the production of the existing list. I am sure Senator Brown would acknowledge that it is certainly not the bill we are dealing with at the moment. I imagine it is existing legislation relating to the implementation of United Nations sanctions, but the minister can confirm that. The point that is made by senators is, in part: what will be the status of the existing list once the current legislation is passed, and will the source of such a list be limited to the Security Council of the United Nations only? That is not the entirety of Senator Brown's argument—I think you would acknowledge, Senator Brown, that you had other points to make—but it is a substantive—
—That is not the case.
—I am saying that it is not the entirety of your argument but it is a substantive issue that you raise before the committee. Perhaps the minister can assist the committee in what will be the status of those other organisations—in other words, organisations that appear on current lists for asset freezing that are not nominated by the United Nations Security Council. That is one part of the issue that is currently being debated and something on which I do think the minister ought to be able to provide some clarity. I would ask if the minister could perhaps assist the committee in that regard— understanding, Senator Brown, that there is a range of other issues that you raise as well.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-27,"—This is quite opportune because I was going to expand on a point I made yesterday in answer to a question from Senator Murray in relation to the listing of assets of entities from overseas that might be engaged in terrorism. Yesterday I mentioned to Senator Murray that the United Nations Security Council listing was the source of this and that the way to do it was to work through the United Nations Security Council and have someone listed. I do not think that it was really quite clear enough that clause 1(c) of resolution 1373 states that the Security Council:
1. Decides that all States shall:
...	...	...
(c) Freeze without delay funds and other financial assets or economic resources of persons who commit, or attempt to commit, terrorist acts or participate in or facilitate the commission of terrorist acts; of entities owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons; and of persons and entities acting on behalf of or at the direction of such persons and entities, including funds derived or generated from property owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons and associated persons and entities;
Resolution 1373 provides member states with a direction to follow that part of the resolution to freeze, without delay, funds and other financial assets et cetera of those entities as mentioned in that subclause. Of course, it has to be made out that the requirements are met.
So what you have there is a situation where you can not only rely on the United Nations listing, which has already been determined and which, of course, is the difference between this and the listing of terrorist organisations. The UN Security Council has said, `There is a list.' If we make that disallowable, we are breaching our international obligations. But the Security Council has also said that you have the ability to go further, and should go further, by virtue of clause 1(c) of resolution 1373. That is a requirement made by the United Nations which, having agreed to this, we are required to follow. That is the head of power, if you like, or the legitimate direction that we get to act in this way. It is a question of meeting an international obligation. This international obligation is one that coincides with our domestic interests in countering the financing of terrorism, and we want to do that by freezing that financial support. This is the second aspect of freezing those assets, but it still has its genesis in the United Nations resolution, albeit not a specific listing—that has been dealt with already and can be added to, of course. This gives member states a direction that they should not just leave it there but should also take other action.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-27,"—I want to mention two things. Firstly, I am looking forward to receiving that list from the government of organisations which have not been nominated by the Security Council but which have been proscribed. Secondly, of the countries with which Australia has had an exchange of information about potential bannings, does that include, for example, China, Pakistan, India, Thailand and Malaysia? Where is the limit on our getting information and exchanging information with countries overseas? Is there any limit? Is there a line drawn there? While that list is coming, I want to point out to the opposition that, while ever the regulations—which were passed last October and which we did not pick up on—exist which allow for the proscription of organisations, those regulations provide for the government to be able to proscribe organisations outside the listing by the United Nations Security Council.
The amendments coming down the line from the Greens would effectively repeal that regulation. It is very important that that regulation be repealed if the opposition is going to be able to stick by its view that proscription will not be allowed outside of the Security Council listing. I ask the opposition to have a look at that. I can see the opposition saying that it will not allow for listing outside of the Security Council listing, but that is a subsidiary matter to allowing the Security Council—where China, the UK, France, the United States and Russia all have a veto power—to have a veto on the listing of organisations or individuals for proscription. Through this means the Labor Party is agreeing with the government that we in this country should not have a veto power, that we should not have a review and that we simply become a rubber stamp of the big powers on the Security Council without reference even to the United Nations General Assembly.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-27,"—I just want to complete the answer to Senator Faulkner's query because he also asked what the status of these current listings will be once the amendments are made. The regulations have been put in force in relation to the listings. What we are doing in this bill is transferring it from the regulations and putting it into the bill, which in effect is transposing it from one aspect of legislation to another. We think it is important that it be included.
—But that will only be the United Nations Security Council.
—The UN Security Council, that is right.
—The issue that Senator Brown raises—and I think followed through part of what he said—is the issue of those that are on current DFAT lists that are not nominated by the UN Security Council. That is not the whole issue, but it is part of it.
—I just wanted to deal with that question of what is on regulation and how it will find itself in this bill. The second aspect, which I spoke about earlier, which is dealt with by resolution 1373 clause 1(c), is that other aspect where we have the ability to make listings other than the list that has already been made by the United Nations Security Council. I have covered that point. I just wanted to cover the aspect of regulations being put into legislation. Senator Brown, we are getting that list as fast as we can. 
In relation to the fight against terrorism, we do deal with other states; we do it with law enforcement and the exchange of intelligence. Pakistan and Afghanistan attended the conference in Indonesia on people-smuggling and the fight against transnational crime. There is often useful exchange of intelligence with other countries. In no way is there anything untoward in that. It can advance, in many cases, the fight against transnational crime and terrorism.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-27,"—Can I make this general comment in relation to what the objective of the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002 actually is. The objective is in fact to give force in domestic law to the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. The opposition has been critical of the government for its tardiness in signing and ratifying that convention. But, in accordance with the broad principle that I have outlined previously in these committee stage debates, the Labor Party takes the view that it is essential that Australia act in good faith in accordance with its international obligations and, in this sense, within the spirit of the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.
If the current bill passes, there will be a particular regime in relation to asset freezing of those organisations listed by the Security Council of the United Nations. The point at issue here is that there are other organisations already listed by the government for the purposes of asset freezing, some of which are nominated already by the Security Council of the United Nations and some of which are not. It seems to me that that is a statement of fact; no-one has denied that. The point needs to be made that that occurs under a separate head of power and that legislation has not been, and will not be, dealt with as we examine this package of terrorism bills.
That does not mean that the substantive issue of what occurs in relation to those organisations that are listed on the broader list or those organisations that are not nominated by the UN Security Council is not an important question. I do suggest, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman Calvert, to Senator Brown, with all due respect: your amendments do not achieve the outcome of removing those other organisations—those separate from the ones nominated by the United Nations Security Council—from any capacity for the government to use another head of power to propose an alternative asset-freezing regime. The difficulty with what we are debating here is that those matters effectively are not before this committee. The opposition want to see the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism receive the force of domestic law. We do want to achieve that outcome. We do want to see the Australian government and other member states of the United Nations act against those organisations that have been nominated by the United Nations Security Council for asset freezing. We do want to see that achieved. There needs to be an international response to the threat of terrorism and an international response to the financing of terrorist organisations. This is, in my view, part of Australia playing its proper role as a good international citizen. I am not going to resile from that for one minute. It is essential that we in Australia play our part in that struggle.
There nevertheless remains a separate issue about the existing lists. I believe that whatever arguments might be brought to bear about the validity or otherwise of any organisation that might be placed on those lists— and I cannot say to the committee that I have made an extraordinarily thorough examination of those lists, because I have not—I am not aware of any domestic organisation that is on those lists. But the minister can correct me if I am wrong in that regard. As I understand it, they seem to be all international organisations. None of those organisations could be defined as domestic. Putting other arguments aside—and I think we need to nail this down so the committee can move on—I respectfully suggest that the head of power that enables the government to list other organisations for the purposes of asset freezing is something that we are not debating here. What we are debating is those organisations that are nominated by the United Nations Security Council. As far as the Labor Party are concerned, we do not and will not resile from ensuring that those organisations do have their assets frozen and that we act in support of the international community to deal with the serious problem of the financing of terrorist organisations. We strongly support placing in domestic law our commitment to the United Nations convention and a domestic legislative framework in Australia in accord with the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. They are the principles with which the Labor Party approach this particular debate; they are clear.
Whether those other issues which were raised by Senator Brown can be debated at another time, I do not know. But at the end of the day, the head of power is different. The government did not need this legislation to make those lists. In fact, those lists exist now and the legislation we are debating is not through the parliament. That is the nitty-gritty, that is the bottom line, and that is what I think we need to focus on as we look at what this committee might believe is the benefit of the legislation that we are currently debating. As far as the Labor Party are concerned—I want to nail our colours to the mast absolutely—this is important; this is essential. This is about Australia playing its part with the international community to ensure that we make our best possible efforts and endeavours to ensure that we deal with the financing of terrorist organisations. I am not ashamed of that and I will not resile one inch from that important objective.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-27,"—There we have it: the Labor Party does accept that the executive should be able to effectively proscribe organisations and individuals in Australia without reference to the parliament. Moreover, we are about to get a list from the government of organisations not named by the Security Council but which, through the antiterrorist measures of the charter of United Nations regulations of last October, will allow the government to continue to proscribe, through the freezing of assets, organisations and individuals in Australia not necessarily named by the Security Council. And Labor knows what it is doing in this. The next-but-one Greens amendment would remove those regulations which the government is working under. But let me say that those regulations effectively defeat the purpose of this bill, which is to have the Security Council listed terrorist organisations effectively frozen out of business by freezing their assets.
Through this complicated process—and going back to the Security Council resolution—other organisations not named can be proscribed. What is the point of this bill? What is the point of the Labor Party saying, `We're confining it to Security Council listed organisations,' when we already know the government is listing, proscribing, banning and freezing the assets of other organisations and individuals in Australia outside of this legislation? The Greens amendment says, `We'll put a stop to that, we'll confine the banning process to what is in this legislation,' but the Labor Party say, `We're not going to support that.' That undermines the whole purpose of confining this bill to freezing the assets of those organisations listed by the Security Council. It gives the power to the government, the executive, to go on and freeze the assets of other individuals and organisations—and Labor know that and are going to support it.
It pulls the rug out from under what we have heard in the debate in the last few days that Labor are inherently against proscription; that Labor see it as dangerous in our democracy to allow governments to proscribe organisations without reference to the parliament. That is the principle the Greens are standing for—that is what our amendments do—but the Labor Party say, `That is a different head of power; that has to be dealt with somewhere else.' We will be moving to amend, or to repeal, the regulation that gives the government that power, and we will be doing that very shortly. This whole process is one of the opposition joining the government to allow the executive to effectively ban organisations in this country whether or not they are on the Security Council list.
I ask the minister: is it possible that a future government, through reference to the Security Council or otherwise and working with, for example, the security organisations in Indonesia, may proscribe the OPM, the freedom fighting organisation—it does have a military arm—in Papua? Will a government look to freeze the funds of anybody linked with the Aceh freedom movement? What about Tibet? Is it possible that a government, acting outside the parliament and with no parliamentary review, will be able to proscribe organisations in Australia which are raising funds for the Tibet freedom advocates—as far as I know there are no fighters in terms of an armed struggle—in Tibet, which is occupied by the People's Liberation Army under the control of Beijing, because Beijing says that the Tibet freedom advocates are criminals or terrorists? Remember, they say the Dalai Lama is a criminal. 
Are we going to allow a process whereby a government, in the interests of trade or of good relationships with countries bigger, more powerful or perhaps more threatening than our own, could proscribe organisations such as those, at least as far as their ability to raise funds and exist as financial entities is concerned? I again go back to Justice Dowd's illustrative case of attending a fundraiser for the Tamils for the medical care and rehabilitation of the young people damaged in the civil war in Sri Lanka. Will the fundraising organisation be proscribed because the money is potentially going to armaments? The Tamil organisation, which has been in armed rebellion in Sri Lanka, is already proscribed in this country.
We cannot allow it without parliamentary oversight; that is the issue here. We cannot allow it without this parliament being able to say, in the wake of a proscription by the government, `We want to look at that; we want to analyse it.' We must at least have an appeal court. Remember that proscription occurs at the United Nations level through to the government level here without any rights given to those who are proscribed. There is no effective appeal process against it. There ought to be one, and parliament ought to be the place for it. Even when an organisation has been proscribed and had its assets frozen, we should be able to review that. Governments make mistakes; ministers make mistakes; the executive makes mistakes. It is up to parliament to review the executive when it makes a mistake, and parliament can only do that if you give parliament that power. Labor is joining the government in removing from the parliament that power of veto over the executive.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-27,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, I hope you do not mind if I come back to the amendment before the chair instead of debating the amendments that Senator Brown is going to move in short order. We always need to be flexible in these committee debates.
—It saves time.
—I accept that absolutely, Senator Ray—but I do not know if any of us should be talking about saving time at the moment. I want to come to the substantive question before the chair. It is a very serious issue, and I acknowledge that the government has treated it seriously. I have read very carefully and listened very carefully to what Senator Ellison has said. I appreciate the fact that he provided the opposition with a response to Senator Brown's amendments and that he was generous enough to say to the opposition that the government was comfortable if it discussed with or provided a copy of that response to Senator Brown in the chamber discussions about these amendments.
We have listened closely to what Senator Brown has said, and we certainly have listened carefully to the government's response. In particular, I note that the government now believes that departing in any way from our obligations under a Security Council resolution would place Australia in breach of article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, to which Australia is a party. Indeed, as I understand it, the government's position, as explained by the minister, is that under article 27 of the Vienna convention, Australia cannot justify failure to perform a treaty obligation on the basis of domestic legal impediment. The minister at the table noted that Australia was bound and obliged to comply with UN Security Council resolutions, notwithstanding any conflict with domestic law resulting from the operation of a disallowable instrument. Rightly, the government states these principles in support of our role in the international fight against terrorism. The principles are solid and should, in my view, form the foundation for Australia being a responsible international citizen. 
Nevertheless, I think I can best characterise the government's counter arguments as an unprincipled resort to a principle the government does not believe in. As I hear and read what the government has said in response to Senator Brown's amendments, we have a government that has consistently and persistently argued to the High Court that it should interpret UN conventions in a way which does not give rise to domestic legal obligations. The government, of course, for the most part—I am sure senators would be aware—derides United Nations conventions. The same government tells us we should not contemplate requiring it to freeze assets only by regulation because, heaven forbid, this would place it in breach of a UN convention. I have sought advice on this issue because I have to give a considered response to it; it is a serious issue that is raised in the Green amendments. I am reliably advised that this is the same government which has repeatedly instructed the Solicitor-General to argue the contrary case, the same government which was trying to persuade the High Court as recently as 16 May this year in the Yorta Yorta case that our domestic laws did not need to be consistent with international law standards. So I do hope the minister at the table, Senator Ellison, and his ministerial colleagues, the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Government Solicitor have been paying close attention to this change of heart. I do not want to see a situation where the government says one thing in the parliament and says another thing in the courts. I think if the government really believes in those principles, as Senator Ellison has stated them, then it should stick to them and stick to them at all times.
I have considered the arguments that have been put forward by Senator Brown and I have considered the arguments that have been put forward by Senator Ellison on behalf of the government. And I would like to outline to the committee the conclusions which the opposition has drawn as a result. It would be defensible for the parliament to decide to implement by regulation the asset freezing obligations flowing from our acceptance of the UN convention on the suppression of terrorist financing. But it is also true that if parliament were to disallow a regulation freezing the assets of an organisation listed by the United Nations under this convention, this would place Australia in breach of its obligations under the convention. And we say that that is undesirable. 
We also recognise that a regulation regime would create an operational difficulty. Clearly, if Australia were to adopt such a regime, any entity with assets in Australia would immediately take action to move the assets as soon as the United Nations listed it, knowing that the Australian government would be bringing forward a regulation to freeze these assets. So we have decided, because of that situation, not to support Senator Brown's amendments. We do not accept that our approach on this issue is inconsistent with our insistence on a regulation regime for listing UN declared terrorist organisations. The current United Nations list comprises organisations and individuals in respect of which UN member states have a number of obligations: freezing assets, preventing entry into or transit through their territory and preventing the supply of arms or related materiel.
We have proposed—and the Senate has accepted—that the Attorney-General should have the capacity, if there is a particular need to do so in the Australian context, to declare an organisation which is on the current or, for that matter, any future UN list to be a terrorist organisation for the purposes of this legislation. The Attorney-General will need to make the case for any such listing; the Attorney-General will need to persuade the parliament. 
In the case of the UN Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing, there is a very specific obligation that flows from our ratification of it—that is, to freeze the assets of any organisation listed pursuant to the convention. That is our obligation as a member state of the United Nations, and that is an obligation that we believe Australia should take seriously. We accepted that obligation when ratifying the convention, and we accept it in passing this legislation that gives domestic effect to our obligations under the United Nations convention. It is for those reasons that the opposition will not support this amendment from Senator Brown; and it is in those circumstances—and I commend the case that has been mounted in relation to this—that we do not consider it necessary to require a disallowable regulation to give effect to those obligations.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-27,"—I have here the lists which have been the subject of regulations in relation to the freeze listings, and I seek to table those lists. I hasten to add, however, that we are trying to get the other list, which will indicate those which are not on the list of the United Nations Security Council. What we have here is the total list—some of these are on the United Nations Security Council listing and some are not. We will get, as soon as we can, an indication of those which are not but, in the meanwhile, I seek to table these lists.
Can I say, in relation to Senator Faulkner's remarks, that the government does not believe that it is being inconsistent in its action; it believes that it is entirely consistent with the arguments it has put forward in other contexts. It has always said that domestic law should be the first point we turn to in relation to our commitments and responsibilities, but we do say that the content of Australian law is, foremost, a matter for the Australian parliament, and how we implement our treaty obligations is a matter for the Australian parliament. In this case, the government considers that compliance with our obligations relating to freezing of assets pursuant to Security Council resolution 1373 is a crucial contribution to international efforts to combat terrorism, and we think it is essential that we put that into domestic law. We believe that we are being entirely consistent, but we acknowledge the opposition's position on this.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-27,"—So do I, and I am horrified. The government is about to produce a list of organisations which have not been nominated by the Security Council, which are proscribed in Australia, already—presumably, no entirely domestic organisations, but that is coming next. I ask the opposition, `What are you going to do about that?' The opposition says, `We will vet organisations listed by the Security Council—that is what we are going to do here. But we are going to have no power to deal with ones not listed by the Security Council.' It is compounding the situation. The very organisations I think we need to be most worried about—that is, those not listed by the Security Council, but proscribed by the executive here—should be vetted by parliament. Labor's outcome will be the reverse. The ones listed by the Security Council, we vet; the ones not listed by the Security Council, but which the government proscribes, we do not vet. What an extraordinary situation.
Now we have Labor adopting the government's argument of last night, which is that, in some way or other, parliamentary overview in this country would be flouting Security Council Resolution 1373, which says to proscribe these organisations as fast as you can. That is hogwash. What is expected is that parliaments—the elected democratic systems—will deal with these matters as expeditiously as possible. As I said last night, let the government proscribe an organisation at the behest of the Security Council and, if it must, with Labor support, without listing from the Security Council, immediately freeze their funds, but make that reviewable by the parliament. Because, mark you me, this is going to cause trouble down the line. There is going to be enormously contentious proscribing and banning of organisations—and individuals—here in Australia, through freezing their assets, without them being consulted or even knowing about it, with no parliamentary review. There must be parliamentary review.
What has happened to Labor on this? Labor has spent the last two days arguing that proscription is dangerous if left in the hands of the executive. Suddenly, not only has it fallen into line but the worst aspect of this emerging power of the executive—which is to proscribe organisations in this country that have not been mentioned by the Security Council—is that we get no overview at all; it is left to the executive and there is no appeal. We will have a debate some time down the line because some individual or organisation has been falsely proscribed and has had all their assets frozen by the executive and the parliament will not have the power to do anything about it, except to debate it. I ask the Labor Party to think again. We should not be allowing that to go through. This parliament is the supreme power in our democracy, not the executive, and it is a very dangerous situation if it is left to the executive.

That is what the Labor Party is doing and that is in accordance with the traditions and values of our party. I am not ashamed to say so and I am not ashamed to see the Labor Party support the government if they are doing the right thing in seeing Australia, as a member state of United Nations, play its role as a member of the international community to ensure that we do something about the financing of terrorist organisations. If it means that this parliament acts in accordance with a United Nations convention to ensure that we freeze the assets of terrorist organisations, I say, quite simply, good.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech

The Green amendments would do nothing to trammel the empowerment of the United Nations resolution, to give force to the international agreement on this—nothing at all—except to have this parliament oversee it. Labor is saying, `We won't have the parliament oversee it.' The Greens are saying, `We will have the parliament oversee it.' Whichever option you take, it does nothing to alter the fact that a UN resolution is being enforced through this legislation. The implication that somehow or other the Greens amendments are going against the wishes of the United Nations is patently wrong.

I have covered the absolute vital need for this suite of amendments. Through the Statutory Rules 2001 No. 297, the government has the ability to freeze the assets of and to backdoor ban organisations and individuals in Australia who are not listed by the Security Council. Notwithstanding this legislation, that power—outside this legislation—remains if these amendments are not passed. The Greens are saying to the opposition: join the Greens in getting rid of that power which has already seen organisations not listed by the Security Council banned effectively in this country.
The Greens amendments are responsible. They say there is a list being made up of proscribed organisations; the amendments will give time for that list to be incorporated into regulations under this legislation, which is reviewable by parliament. The organisations and individuals that have been proscribed will not be rehabilitated through this process. The parliament will get a review.
What can I say about this? Labor is making a huge mistake again in joining the government to give the executive a power that it should never be allowed to have without parliamentary oversight. This legislation is going to haunt the country through its potential to be abused by the executive in the years to come. I remind Labor that, once the legislation passes, we certainly cannot revoke it or amend it in the term of this parliament because the House of Representatives will not allow it through. This is a major grab for power by the executive, without the authority of the parliament, and Labor is endorsing it. This is a mistake equivalent to that made by Labor in the run-up to the last election when it rubber-stamped what the government was doing about asylum seekers. I do not think that Labor's constituency, when it gets to know about it, is going to appreciate it. I do not think Labor has thought this through. The argument it is putting forward is inconsistent with the voting power it is now manifesting at this vital stage in dealing with this piece of legislation.
We on the crossbench, and I know the Democrats support this point of view, do not have the numbers. But the argument is clear—it has not been rebutted; it cannot be rebutted—that we are transferring to this executive, through regulatory power outside this legislation which Labor is now endorsing, the power to proscribe organisations and individuals in this country without reference to them and to knock them out of business, with no review. We should not be doing that. I again appeal to the Labor Party to support the Greens amendments.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I assure Senator Brown that the Labor Party—both its membership and its constituency—has traditionally taken the view that Australia should act as a good international citizen. Whenever the Labor Party is faced with the question of whether domestic legislation should give an Australian government the necessary powers to fulfil our obligations under United Nations resolutions or conventions, we say yes. I can say that quite proudly, Senator Brown. That is what this legislation does: it gives force in domestic law to the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Why should anyone in this parliament be ashamed, for one minute, of ensuring that we do something about freezing the assets of terrorist organisations? The legislation we have before us enables Australia to play its part as a member state of the United Nations—and play it properly. So I can assure Senator Brown—and I can certainly assure this committee—that this is very much in accordance with Labor values and principles. We will defend our role in ensuring that the international community works tirelessly to combat the threat of terrorism. This is a part—perhaps only a small part but nevertheless a very important part—of that challenge. It is one that the Labor Party is very comfortable being part of.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-27,"—I can tell Senator Faulkner and the Labor Party why they should be ashamed: this is not about the implementation of United Nations resolutions, because the Greens amendments do not alter that implementation; they say that there should be parliamentary oversight. The argument here is not about whether we are implementing a UN resolution. It is about whether we transfer power from the parliament to the executive—to a minister of this or some future government—to ban organisations through the back door in this country. Is that in accord with Labor principle? Is this the modern Labor Party platform we are dealing with that says, `Transfer the power to the executive; sideline the parliament'? That is what is happening here in the critical matter of proscription of Australian based organisations.
I thought that Labor was opposed to this. I thought its principle was to oppose government proscription. As of today, that principle has fallen by the wayside. As of today, Labor supports the conservatives in giving the minister the ability to ban—without reference to parliament—organisations and individuals in this country on the basis that they may be a threat to communications or public health and safety. That is it in a nutshell. Labor is making one hell of a mistake here. Labor is letting down a century of advocacy of the rights of organisations to function— and function robustly—in this country without proscription. Labor knows that, if organisations and individuals go over the boundary into terrorism, there are strong criminal sanctions against murder, injury, destruction and rape—the whole gamut of violent and dastardly things which our community regards as terrorism—which apply. Those powers are already there.
Today we are not talking about those things; today we are talking about the executive—a minister—having the power to proscribe and ban people and organisations in this country because, in his view, they are a threat to public health and safety or because they are threatening or interfering with communications such as email flow and web sites. That is without reference to parliament; without any parliamentary oversight; and without any comeback to the fulcrum of democracy, the defence of civil and political liberties and democratic rights, which is this parliament. We are not a country run by the executive. We are run by the parliament. The people empower the parliament. They vote in the parliament—not the executive; not the minister. They are appointments made thereafter. I thought that Labor saw the elected parliament in the same terms in which I am portraying it now. But not any more. Now the executive has the right to proscribe and ban individuals and organisations. Remember that ministers are going to make these decisions on the basis of politics, amongst other things. Shame on the government for cutting parliament out of a review of this banning mechanism. Double shame on the Labor Party for backing it.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-06-27,"—I rise to speak briefly in support of the Greens amendments. One Nation would go one step further than Senator Brown's comments. If we had the situation where the Australian people had their rightful right of appeal to the Governor-General, that would lessen but not remove the argument that Senator Brown has put forward. Where the situation becomes absolutely critical is that the Australian people no longer have that right of appeal to the Governor-General. The Governor-General clearly states in written form that he takes his advice from the executive government. So we are missing an extremely important part of our political scheme—that is, the separation of powers between this parliament, the executive government and the judiciary; I add to that the Governor-General. Our Constitution clearly sets out that it is not the executive government that advises the Governor-General what to do, it is the other way round. If Australians had that right of appeal against the government or the executive government when they are appeased, this place would find that it would not have so much anxiety in the transfer of power to the Governor-General.
Senator Faulkner previously referred to these amendments as removing the ability to seize the assets of terrorists. If that is the case, very simply move an amendment to separate those two powers. There is no need for the ability to proscribe an organisation to be closely aligned and tied to the ability to seize assets. Again, there has to be a separation of power and of the functions between the people who hold that power. I very clearly put on the record that One Nation totally objects to the Attorney-General and/or the executive government having the outright power to proscribe any organisation in this country. We will support the Greens amendments to remove that ability.

In general there are a number of aspects to these amendments which are similar. Government amendment (19) will enable the Governor-General to make regulations under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 setting out procedures to be followed in relation to the freezing of assets. I have dealt with this at length during the previous debate on Greens amendment (6) and I do not think I can add anything further in relation to that. Government amendment (2) would make a minor amendment to the commencement provision to ensure that the financing of terrorism offence commences immediately after the headings and definitions relevant to that offence; it is merely a technical amendment.
Government amendments (1), (3) and (20) deal with the definition of political offence. Amendment (20) will ensure that financing of terrorism offences are excluded from the definition of political offence in the Extradition Act 1988 and, by reference, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. This amendment implements Article 14 of the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Amendment (1) amends the long title of the bill as introduced to include a reference to the Extradition Act 1988. That is a technicality, if you like. Amendment (3) amends clause 2 of the bill as introduced to provide that the proposed amendments to the Extradition Act will commence at the same time as the financing of terrorism offences. This brings those amendments to the Extradition Act into sync with the other amendments. I commend the amendments to the Senate.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-06-27,"—Likewise, we Democrats support removing for the time being at least this particular section of the legislation. I would add, however, our very real anxiety and concern about the question of stored communications being a part of this bill. Access by security agencies is still an issue which we are strongly opposed to, at least in the sense of ensuring that an interception warrant—or at the very least, a search warrant—ought to be required to access stored communications. I think the question here is that there was some definitional debate around the question as to what constituted stored information. As I understand it, for example, if any of our spy agencies, our security agencies want to intercept telephone communications, whether that be landline communication or mobile phone communication, then an interception warrant is mandated, or at least required. 
But this is not the case with stored communication. We heard evidence during the committee hearing from several people including the organisation Electronic Frontiers Australia, a civil libertarian Internet organisation. They argued that voicemail, email, and SMS text messaging via mobile phones, constituted to some degree stored information in that for some period of time—no matter how short—the communications being communicated from one point to another point using those technologies were stored either with some telephonic agency, if it were voicemail or, in the case of email, with an ISP.
The fear with many in the community, particularly those involved in the IT sector and peripheral sectors, is that we might have the scenario down the track where we see agencies having pretty much unfettered access to stored information, as it relates to voicemail, email and SMS messaging. To the extent that the government is going to revisit this—it is stated clearly that it will—we will retain our implacable opposition to having complete access to that and will argue at the time it comes up that either an interception warrant or a search warrant should be mandated. But we note that, for the time being, it has been removed from this bill, which will allow these bills to progress. To that extent, we support its excision and I, too, will be opposing that it stands for now on the paper.

14.  Schedule 3
The day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent
(2)	Page 19 (after line 11), at the end of the Bill, add:
Schedule 3—Amendment of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 relating to emergency services calls
1  After subsection 6(2)
Insert:
Communications to emergency services numbers
	(2A)	In this section, an emergency services numberis a telephone number:
	(a)	on which assistance in emergencies may be sought from:
	(i)	a police force or service; or
	(ii)	a fire service; or
	(iii)	an ambulance service; and
	(b)	that is specified in regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph, or is in a class of numbers specified in regulations made for the purposes of this paragraph.
	(2B)	If a person who is lawfully engaged in duties relating to the receiving and handling of communications to an emergency services number listens to or records a communication passing over a telecommunications system to the emergency services number, the listening or recording does not, for the purposes of this Act, constitute the interception of the communication.
These amend the Interception Act to allow the recording of communications to emergency services numbers. The effect of these amendments is to enable numbers such as 000 and the mobile phone or teletypewriter equivalents to be prescribed in regulations as emergency service numbers and to permit police and emergency service organisations to continue recording calls to such numbers. The amendments have the effect of excluding from the definition of interception, the monitoring or recording of communications to emergency service numbers, when the recording or monitoring is done in association with the lawful receipt and handling of such communications. This is a result of advice received to the effect that there is a possibility that recording these calls may currently breach section 7 of the act, whenever a particular caller is unaware of the recording.
Item 1 defines emergency service numbers as, a number or class of numbers prescribed by regulation on which emergency assistance from police, fire or ambulance service can be requested. Once a number is prescribed as an emergency services number, the monitoring or recording of communications to these numbers will not amount to an interception, as long as it is performed by persons lawfully engaged in duties related to the receiving and handling of such communications.
We believe these amendments are sound. The Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 affects a range of amendments to the Telecommunications Interception Act 1979. These relate to the definition of interception offences for which warrants may be sought, agencies who may receive intercepted information, and the context and purposes for which intercepted information may be used and other amendments. We believe this government amendment is necessary and I commend it to the Senate.

This amendment relates to the question of a public interest monitor, a theme which we Democrats carry through in many elements of legislation which deal with, you could argue, the public interest and perhaps their entitlement to stronger security concerning privacy. As I have said, the Democrats welcome the government's decision to excise the controversial provisions dealing with delayed and stored communications from these bills. As I said, the provisions would have ensured—and we are likely to return to them—that delayed messages such as email, SMS messages and voicemail were not protected under the Telecommunications Interception Act. During the committee process— that was the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee—the federal Privacy Commissioner argued the following: 
There seems to be little justification for reducing the privacy protection of a communication as intimate as voicemail message or SMS in comparison with a live communication, simply because the transmission of the former is temporarily delayed.
We Democrats agree with that. I understand the government wishes to pursue the issue through separate legislation. If the government feels a clarification of the powers of various authorities to access certain communications is necessary, we do not object to that. However, we will object to any attempt to establish a legislative regime that would make it possible for authorities to access email and other communications without a warrant. The government has indicated that its objective was to ensure that these communications could be accessed by other lawful means such as a search warrant. The phrase `other lawful means' is vague and we believe that there are processes by which the government would have been able to access such communications that are far less accountable and rigorous than a warrant application process. No doubt, we will we revisiting these issues when the government reintroduces those particular provisions in a forthcoming bill.
The amendment I have moved addresses the telecommunications interception warrant application process. I accept that the nature of law enforcement requires a degree of secrecy and that it is not always appropriate to insist upon levels of transparency and accountability that are justified in other areas. Nonetheless, telecommunication intercepts are an intrusive violation of civil liberties when used improperly. The possibility of detecting their use, and thus exposing their misuse, means that we must be vigilant at the point at which interception warrants are issued. We Democrats suggest a modification to the current process that would allay concerns about the misuse of telecommunications interception powers while not compromising the secrecy or effectiveness of law enforcement operations. It is based on the procedure that currently operates in Queensland in relation to the granting of search warrants. Part 10 of the Queensland Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 1997 establishes the position and powers of a public interest monitor. The monitor has a range of responsibilities under the act. Of particular relevance is the requirement that the monitor appear at any hearing of an application to a Supreme Court judge or magistrate for a covert search warrant or surveillance warrant and to test the validity of the application by means including presenting questions for the applicant to answer, cross-examining any witness who has sworn an affidavit or given oral evidence in support of the application, and making submissions on the appropriateness of granting the application. 
The current process by which telecommunications intercepts are approved is one-sided and unfair. Typically, an application is made to an eligible member of the AAT, who makes a decision as to whether to approve the intercept based solely on representations made and evidence presented by the relevant law enforcement agency. The rights, interests and privacy of citizens are deeply affected by these quasi-legal proceedings in which they are not represented. The covert nature of telecommunications intercepts obviously precludes direct legal representation of subjects, but that does not mean that their rights and interests cannot be represented by an independent party. The design of our legal system reflects the view that justice is best served by adversarial proceedings in which all interested parties are represented before an independent arbiter. It does concern me that there is no procedure by which representations can be made on behalf of prospective subjects of telecommunications intercepts as to the lawfulness of issuing warrants or the soundness of the evidence on which the warrant applications are based. 
The success of the public interest monitor in Queensland confirms that a similar system in relation to telecommunications intercepts would be practical, worthwhile and cost-effective. The number of warrants currently issued is not so great as to require any significant bureaucratic structure. I would expect that appointing one or perhaps two barristers in each state or territory to appear as required and be remunerated for their services by way of an hourly rate would enable a monitor to participate in the vast majority of warrant applications. Obviously, where exceptional circumstances require the immediate determination of a warrant application and a monitor is unavailable to participate in proceedings, it is appropriate that the application proceed. However, the monitor should be required to review the case as soon as possible.
If the government is not in a position to support this proposal now, I would encourage it to consider the proposal as part of the process of re-examining the excise provisions in this bill dealing with delayed messages. I would also encourage the government to consider whether this model could be applied to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. We believe that the public interest monitor could play an important role in the warrant application process that is proposed under that bill. Implementing this proposal would go some way to assuring the community that ASIO will be appropriately accountable in exercising the extraordinary powers the government wishes to confer on it. Of course, this is not to suggest that the Australian Democrats are in any way supportive of giving ASIO the power to detain non-suspects incommunicado without charge. We think that is a totally inappropriate power. However, we do believe that, if extraordinary powers are to be given to ASIO, then it must be fully accountable. I commend this amendment to the Senate and, should it fail on this occasion, would encourage senators to give some thought to supporting the proposal at a later stage.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-27,"—The situation we face in relation to this bill is that the government has removed amendments dealing with stored data, emails and SMS. I think most senators would agree that what is left in the Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 is relatively uncontroversial. It deals with terrorism offences, arson, child pornography and the 000 interception and state crime bodies. Those issues have been dealt with by the Senate committee. The matter before the chair, proposed by the Australian Democrats, has not been dealt with. I think the Democrat proposal is a significant one, but I do respectfully suggest to the Democrats that it requires some close scrutiny. I note the point that Senator Greig makes that a similar regime for a public interest monitor actually exists in Queensland and, as I understand it, appears to operate quite effectively. 
I say to the Democrats and the government that it seems to me that the sensible way for us to go is to deal with this when the legislation that has been flagged by the minister comes forward. That legislation will obviously need to be re-examined closely by the Senate committee. I would hope that the government and the Democrats would be able to facilitate committee examination of this proposal as well. That might be a sensible way forward on this particular matter. It is an amendment that requires constructive and close examination. It is not a frivolous matter, and I think there is an opportunity for the Senate in its committee system to give the proposal that sort of examination. I would be keen to see the Senate committee explore the proposal when the new bill comes forward. I think that should include an examination of the Queensland experience of similar provisions because the scope of this proposal across the Telecommunications Interception Act is so significant.
It is a significant initiative in the view of the opposition and it does require scrutiny by the Senate committee. For those reasons I am not willing to commit opposition support to the proposal at this stage. But I do think there is a way forward on this. I think delaying full consideration of this matter until the government reintroduces its proposals for emails and SMS messages will actually give a good outcome. It will give the parliament an opportunity to examine the legislation that the minister has flagged but will also give us an opportunity to have a thorough examination of what Senator Greig proposes. I certainly would facilitate a reference that enables that to occur as the matter is dealt with in the Senate committee system. I do not know if that gives Senator Greig any comfort, but I do think it is a sensible way forward in the circumstance. While we are not going to the merits of this Democrat amendment, I indicate that I think it is a matter that deserves thorough and constructive consideration. The opposition will not support the amendment at this stage. I really do think there is an appropriate way for this to be dealt with and I think this amendment is important enough to warrant that level of examination.",SENATE,<title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-06-27,"—The government oppose Democrat amendment (1). We have foreshadowed forthcoming legislation which no doubt, when it is brought into the Senate, will be subject to a Senate committee's scrutiny.
—Yes, it will. Maybe the amendment could go there too. Wouldn't that be a way of dealing with it?
—As Senator Faulkner says, it could well be dealt with there. Whilst I am dealing with this, I will just say that the government believes that there are very good safeguards in place in relation to the issuing of an intercept warrant. Without detaining the committee, I will just touch on that. It should be remembered that warrants can be sought only in relation to serious offences such as murder, kidnapping and drug trafficking. Evidence must be adduced to satisfy a nominated judge or member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that there are sufficient grounds to justify the grant of a warrant to undertake the telecommunications interception. The judge or AAT member specifically considers, when dealing with this issue, the privacy matters associated with each IT warrant application. If that judge or AAT member is not satisfied as to the seriousness of the offence justifying the overriding of privacy protection of the individual concerned, the warrant is not issued. I add that there are detailed reporting requirements made of the ombudsman in relation to these powers. 
So, for the record, the government would stress that there are strong safeguards in relation to the interception warrants which are issued. In addition, the Attorney-General inspects each warrant on the general and special warrants register, which is prepared by the AFP. That records the details of every warrant issued in the relevant state, territory and Commonwealth jurisdiction. An annual report is tabled in parliament on the operation of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and monitors the issue of warrants. There are strict requirements on which agencies may receive intercepted information and the purposes for which that intercepted information may be used. We believe that there are strong safeguards in place. I do believe that perhaps the Democrat concerns can be addressed at another time, when I am sure that this matter will be raised again. For those reasons, the government opposes the Democrat amendment.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I rise to speak to the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2002. I know that a number of bills have been scheduled during this time and I shall be as brief as I can. A number of points need to be made. The Senate Selection of Bills Committee recommended, and the Senate subsequently agreed to, the referral of the provisions of the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2002 to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 13 June 2002. Referral was contingent upon the introduction of the bill into the House of Representatives and this occurred on 16 May 2002.
The primary purpose of the Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2002 is to create the Australian Protective Service as a statutory authority, with the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police as the agency head. This would result in the commissioner being the head of both the AFP and the APS, which would remain separate agencies. So while the second reading speech describes the APS becoming an operational division of the Australian Federal Police, the new arrangements change the CEO in effect. The bill also updates the language used in the initial Australian Protective Service Act 1987 in order to make it clear that there are two types of Australian Protective Service employees: Protective Service officers and Australian Public Service employees. This distinction is relevant because the act gives Protective Service officers a range of powers, including arrest powers, search powers and the authority to carry a firearm. These powers are not available to an Australian Public Service employee in the Protective Service. These employees undertake administrative and similar duties and therefore do not require the power given to Protective Service officers.
This bill also broadens some of the delegation powers of the Director of the Australian Protective Service. Currently the act permits the director to delegate his or her powers only to another Protective Service officer; the director cannot currently delegate his or her powers to an APS employee in the Protective Service. The bill contains provisions that would allow the director to do so; however, this power is restricted to matters of an administrative nature. Further, the bill clarifies that the general orders which the director may issue are subordinate to a range of other laws and instruments. This provision is currently in place, but will be amended to take account of the transition from the Public Service Act 1922 to the Public Service Act 1999. It follows that the Australian Protective Service, as a statutory authority, is required to submit an annual report in the same manner as other statutory authorities.
The Australian Protective Service Amendment Bill 2002 has been presented by the government as part of its counter-terrorism response following the events of September 11 last year. The government announced the proposed changes to the APS with much fanfare. In February of this year, the Minister for Justice and Customs announced that the Australian Protective Service would become an operating division of the Australian Federal Police. He said in his press release of 14 February that this change `consolidates and enhances national security initiatives'. He promised that it was necessary in order to ensure `the closest possible co-ordination between two of Australia's key counter-terrorist agencies' and that it would strengthen `both organisations' ability to fulfil their counter-terrorism responsibilities'.
We were told by the Attorney-General's Department in Senate estimates in February that the relevant legislation would be comprehensive and detailed. The government made much of the benefits that would follow from total integration and said that by 30 June the APS would be an operational arm of the AFP. It will not be—at least not in that meaningful sense. This bill does not do what the government said it wanted to do. It does not address the significant issues that the government knows to be important. It does not tighten or increase coordination of Australia's operational effectiveness to counter terrorism. This bill resolves none of the strategic or organisational issues the government itself said were important in requiring the integration and consolidation of our Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. This bill has been put into parliament in an overcrowded legislative calendar in order to meet the government's self-imposed deadline. In fact, what this bill does is make the APS a stand-alone statutory agency. All it does is change the CEO from the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to the Commissioner of the Federal Police.
Labor had concerns that this bill had the potential to create an anomalous situation in which the Commissioner of the AFP, who enjoys a high degree of operational independence under the AFP Act, would be placed in the position of being instructed, directed and told what to do by the government of the day in regard to his position as the head of a statutory agency. This could have significant implications in relation to AFP-APS joint operations. The commissioner could never be sure that his operational plan for using the APS in partnership with the AFP would or could not be countermanded by political directions.
The committee sought information about whether the Commissioner of the AFP, in his role as CEO of the AFP, would indeed be subject to ministerial direction in relation to operational matters. The Attorney-General's Department assured the committee that there is no power in any legislation to direct the way operations are carried out and that the government had put on record that there would be no interference with operational decision making. To that extent, we take some comfort from these assurances and place them clearly on the record.
Following the passage of this bill, the government will explore steps to further align the AFP and the APS and will introduce further legislation. Therefore, Labor does not oppose the government's moves to integrate the APS into the AFP. We understand that it makes sense. This is, in truth, Labor's policy. Labor proposed the creation of a federal protection service that would form an integral part of the AFP with its own deputy commissioner to command and control all the protective security and counter-terrorism responses necessary to ensure the safety of Australians and Australian interests.
Given the time available at this time of day, I summarise by saying that this bill has as its immediate consequence the certainty that another piece of legislation will follow. Parliament will have to consider further legislation prepared by this government sometime in the future in order for it to achieve what it said was urgent and necessary back in February. We know that there is going to be extensive consultation in the next phase, and Labor welcomes that. Labor is prepared to accept this bill. We are aware that all agencies involved are working hard, planning for the next stage which will see full integration of these two organisations. But, to use a hackneyed phrase, the devil is always in the detail. We wait with interest to see the detail and will examine those issues as they emerge. The government should, and we encourage it to do so, move quickly to spell out the detail of its plans for the eventual integration of the APS with the AFP.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN PROTECTIVE SERVICE AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-06-27,"— I thank Senator Ludwig for his comments. Nevertheless, this bill reflects the ongoing commitment of the government to effective national law enforcement. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-06-27,"—I rise to speak against the International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 because of the functions it will carry out. There are issues of concern relating to international tax agreements—commonly known as the double tax act. The act was predicated on the basis that there would be a balance of Australian owned companies operating overseas which would repatriate their profits back to Australia and pay their taxes in Australia, being their place of domain, and, conversely, companies domiciled outside Australia which carry out activities in Australia and return their profits to the country where they are domiciled and pay their taxes. That is the basic fundamental process upon which international tax agreements were predicated.
There are two issues that have proven over time that the acts do not in any way achieve their original purpose. Firstly, we need to address the issue of Australian owned companies operating overseas that would and should repatriate their profits back to Australia. We see many and varied percentages on this. In some areas of our economy, we are 100 per cent owned and controlled by overseas corporations. In other areas, overseas ownership is in the high 90s. Progressively, depending on the particular industry, there has been an increase in Australian ownership of companies within those brackets. There are no Australian based companies substantially operating overseas to bring their profits back into Australia to be taxed here. Conversely, there is an unhealthy level of overseas ownership of Australian companies in some sectors of the economy. Therefore, there is no resultant tax revenue for Australia.
The second issue that renders international tax agreements void is the ability of companies to channel offshore costs on both imports and exports. For example, a company producing a product in the Philippines and ultimately selling that product in Australia will invariably tranship articles through a holding company in a tax haven. The cost structure in the Philippines will be minimal. The articles will be transhipped through the holding company and re-enter Australia at a maximum price just below that of the cost of operations in Australia. Therefore, they will be shifting their profit percentages offshore from both Australia and the country in which they are domiciled. Neither Australia nor the other countries will benefit from the original intention of this international tax agreement.
This particular agreement goes to an agreement with Russia and also changes some parts of the protocols with the United States of America. If it was the government's intention originally to ensure that companies do not pay tax in two countries, I commend it. If it was the government's intention to assist companies to pay tax in neither Australia nor their country of domicile, I deplore it. As it is clearly the outcome of our global economy that these international tax agreements assist companies to avoid their taxes in Australia and overseas, I believe it is time that the Australian government revisited this proposal and took a very good look at it in light of their responsibility to the Australian people. I place on record that One Nation will be voting against the legislation.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-06-27,"—In speaking to the International Criminal Court legislation, let me say that ratification of the Rome statute establishing the International Criminal Court has long had the solid support of the opposition. The opposition welcomes the introduction of the International Criminal Court Bill 2002 and the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002, which will give effect to Australia's obligations under the Rome statute. The bills incorporate a number of amendments to the exposure draft of the legislation, which were considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. For Australia to fully participate in the assembly of state parties meeting in September, it is necessary for Australia to ratify the statute by 2 July. It is important that Australia be involved in the establishment of the court, and the opposition is prepared to cooperate to secure timely ratification of the statute. However, protracted turmoil in the Liberal and National parties has left little time for parliament to consider the new amendments. The government provided its amendments to the exposure draft to the opposition shortly before question time in the House of Representatives on Tuesday last and brought the bills on for debate that afternoon in the House of Representatives. As a result, parliament's consideration of the amendments has unfortunately been short.
The amendments fall into three categories: amendments which seek to implement recommendations of the joint standing committee, amendments which the government describes as technical; and, amendments which seek to implement the declaration proposed by the Howard government to secure the support of the Liberal and National parties for the ICC. It has not been possible to review in as much detail as one would have liked the amendments described by the government as technical. However, issues may well arise in the future regarding their operation. To take one example, some amendments to the definition of `offences' substitute specific references to provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights for references in the exposure draft and the Rome statute to principles of international law.
The government obviously has sought to respond to criticism that the wording of some offences is too vague. However, given time to examine the provision in detail, we are concerned that this might result in a narrowing of certain offences under Australian law. If that is the case, it appears possible that Australia could be met with a request for surrender of a person to the ICC where the alleged facts fall outside the offence as defined in Australian domestic law, but within the offence as defined within the Rome Statute.
A cursory look at the definition of `persecution' in clause 268.20 of the consequential amendments bill does nothing to allay this concern. The definition in that clause refers to deprivation of a number of rights in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, yet the definition in article 7 of the statute refers simply to the deprivation of fundamental rights. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has held that fundamental rights may include economic rights. But these are not part of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and so there may be an inconsistency in the definition. The opposition has raised this simply to highlight the uncertainties caused by the rushed consideration of the amendments resulting from the disarray of the coalition parties.
An issue that will attract some scrutiny in the international community is whether the government's proposed declaration, as implemented in these bills, amounts to an impermissible reservation within the meaning of article 120 of the Rome Statute. For the purpose of the debate on these bills, it is necessary only to mention the second element of the declaration, which reads:
To enable Australia to exercise its jurisdiction effectively, and fully adhering to its obligations under the Statute of the Court, no person will be surrendered to the Court by Australia until it has had the full opportunity to investigate or prosecute any alleged crimes. For this purpose, the procedure under Australian law implementing the Statute of the Court provides that no person can be surrendered to the Court unless the Australian Attorney-General issues a certificate allowing surrender. Australian law also provides that no person can be arrested pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by the Court without a certificate from the Attorney-General.
This element of the declaration is implemented through a number of amendments to the exposure draft, which include the following measures: (1) no person may be arrested or surrendered to the ICC unless the Attorney-General has issued a certificate; (2) a decision by the Attorney-General to issue or to refuse to issue a certificate subject to a privative clause that is, in itself, final and may not be challenged in any court but the High Court; (3) a person is effectively not liable for prosecution for a crime against the administration of the Justice of the ICC if they either engage in conduct that results in a failure or a refusal by the Attorney-General to issue a certificate or engage in conduct in reliance on the absence of a certificate from the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is also not liable to prosecution purely for failing or refusing to issue a certificate.
These measures concern Australia's obligations under the statute to establish national procedures for cooperation with the ICC. Views may well differ about whether these measures meet Australia's obligations under the statute and whether this aspect of the government's declaration impermissibly seeks to modify the legal effect of the ICC statute. However, we are now considering in a short space of time whether to pass legislation that the government has insisted be passed before it is prepared to ratify the statute. For that purpose and in a spirit of cooperation, the opposition is prepared not to oppose these measures. We are concerned about the use of the phrase `absolute discretion' in connection with the power of the Attorney-General. One would expect the Attorney-General to exercise his or her discretion in accordance with Australia's obligations under the statute.
During the second reading debate in the House of Representatives, the shadow minister for foreign affairs sought an assurance from the Attorney-General that this discretion would be exercised in that way. The response from the Attorney-General was disappointing. He said:
The member for Griffith's comments appeared to be based on a misapprehension that the Attorney-General is bound by the international statute rather than the obligations contained in Australia's domestic legislation ... The discretion will be exercised in accordance with the International Criminal Court Act 2002, when passed. The act will be the domestic implementation of Australia's obligations under the International Criminal Court statute. Australia's international obligations under the statute become effective domestically only because they are translated into domestic Australian law.
As the Attorney-General would be well aware, there is a distinction between exercising an executive discretion in accordance with domestic law and exercising it in accordance with international obligations. Once again, the opposition calls on the government to provide an assurance that this absolute discretion will not be exercised by the Attorney-General inconsistently with Australia's obligations under the Rome Statute. We are equally concerned that the use of the phrase `absolute discretion' could lend legitimacy to another country's efforts to use the phrase to shield criminals from the jurisdiction of the court. The fact that this absolute discretion is accompanied by a privative clause compounds these concerns. The third element of the government's declaration reads as follows:
Australia further declares its understanding that the offences in Articles 6, 7 and 8 will be interpreted and applied in a way that accords with the way they are implemented in Australian domestic law.
This is worded in terms of an understanding and, thus, has the clothing of an interpretive declaration for domestic political consumption. However it begs the question: what if at some point an inconsistency emerges between Australia's jurisprudence and ICC jurisprudence on a particular crime? There is not a lot of Australian jurisprudence around on these crimes, as you would expect. It is also difficult to speculate how Australian jurisprudence will develop, given that there is a range of views in the Australian judiciary about the extent to which Australia laws should be interpreted consistently with international law.
Finally, I note that the Attorney-General issued perhaps what could be called an `ungracious' press release last Tuesday evening. In that press release, he tried to give the opposition the full wet lettuce treatment when he used these words:
It now remains for the Opposition to stop grandstanding as it did in the House this afternoon and to demonstrate its much-touted support for the ICC by ensuring swift passage of this legislation through the Parliament.
The criticisms made by the opposition in the House of Representatives, in my view, were entirely justified. Describing those criticisms as `grandstanding' manifests a contempt for the processes of parliament. No amount of tough talk from the normally demure Attorney-General can hide the chaos that has characterised the Howard government's deliberations on the International Criminal Court. If the first Border Protection Bill 2001 and the antiterrorism legislation this year demonstrate one thing, it is that it is important that legislation emanating from this government be given close scrutiny. It is unfortunate in this case that such scrutiny has been shortened due to the agony and chaos in the Liberal and National parties and the savaging of the Attorney-General by the member for Mackellar.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-06-27,"—In 1874, the International Committee of the Red Cross proposed that there be an international court to try atrocities committed in war. Some 128 years later, the world is now poised to realise that dream. In the aftermath of World War II, the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal set out to punish those responsible for some of the worst atrocities in the history of humanity. It buoyed hopes that an end to impunity might finally come for those who commit such deeds. The promise of Nuremberg remains unfulfilled. After Nuremberg, the politics of the Cold War proved a difficult obstacle to establishing a permanent international criminal court. Today, the enforcement of international law remains selective and ad hoc. Tribunals have been established to deal with atrocities in Rwanda and Yugoslavia. Many argue that other countries such as Burundi, Cambodia, Somalia, Liberia and Zaire-Congo deserve similar attention.
The proposed International Criminal Court will be a standing court with jurisdiction over certain serious crimes of international concern occurring in the territory of the state parties to the statute or by nationals of state parties. The purpose of the court is to ensure that future gross violations of international law, such as crimes against humanity and genocide, do not go unpunished. The arm of the law must be long enough to reach the perpetrators of these brutalities, even where domestic legal systems are unable or unwilling to deliver justice.
The International Criminal Court will provide a politically neutral forum in which gross criminal violations of human rights can be tried when normal legal avenues have been exhausted. The statute is based on three key principles. The first of these principles is complementarity. Under this principle, the ICC may assume jurisdiction only where domestic legal systems are unable or unwilling to exercise jurisdiction. The ICC is not intended to replace domestic courts but rather to provide an alternative avenue for the prosecution of criminals where domestic legal systems fail. Article 1 of the statute provides that the jurisdiction of the court `shall be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions'. Under article 17, the court has no jurisdiction over any case that is or has been investigated or prosecuted by a state. The only exception to this is where the state is or was unwilling or unable genuinely to prosecute. It remains the primary obligation of Australia to prosecute violators of international law. The court's jurisdiction is deliberately minimal and deferential to national legal systems.
The second principle is that the statute deals solely with the most serious violations of international law. The court will have jurisdiction over a few `core crimes' such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The third principle is that the statute is almost completely confined to customary international law. The statute is not about promoting international law over domestic law; it is about providing the means for ensuring that those who brutally violate established core international human rights standards are brought to justice. The ICC will not have jurisdiction over past atrocities but will send a message that the international community will no longer tolerate gross violations of human rights. Future perpetrators of inhumane atrocities will no longer be able to take solace in the knowledge that there is no established body to try them for their brutality.
Future perpetrators of inhumane atrocities will no longer be able to take solace in the knowledge that there is no established body to try them for their brutality. History teaches us that individuals responsible for serious crimes against humanity are rarely brought to justice. We now have a unique opportunity to change that from this point forward.
Unfortunately, a number of misconceptions have been prominent in the Australian debate over ratification. It has been argued that the court will be political and will not meet the basic standards of fairness and independence required for the trial of serious crimes. There is considerable confusion about what matters the court will hear and a great deal of suspicion about the supposedly political nature of the court. Some have argued that the ICC will be used to revisit past atrocities. However, articles 11 and 24 of the statute clearly state that the court's jurisdiction will be strictly prospective. Furthermore, some have argued that the court will be used to challenge national policies in relation to issues such as abortion. Under article 5, the mandate of the court is limited to `the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole'.
The question of which crimes should fall within the jurisdiction of the court was a difficult issue during the treaty negotiation process. Ultimately, it was agreed that the jurisdiction would be limited to the four core crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and aggression. It was never intended that the court be a forum for the challenge of anything but the most extreme state policies.
Finally, it has been argued that the court will operate politically and that accused persons may suffer unfair trials. The experience of ad hoc tribunals generally would not support such criticisms. Even the Nuremberg trials, condemned at the time by some as `victors' vengeance', were considered fair by those responsible for defending the accused. Indeed, in many cases it may be that an international court would be the fairest place to try a criminal notorious in his or her own country. The statute contains a number of safeguards to ensure the integrity of the court and the fairness of the trials it conducts. Firstly, the provisions relating to the appointment and qualifications of judges are quite rigorous. Judges will be appointed by an assembly of state parties. They must possess the qualifications required in their respective states for appointment to the highest judicial offices. There are requirements as to specialist expertise and provisions ensuring that the expertise on the court is balanced. No two judges may be nationals of the same state. The procedures for appointment compare favourably with the procedures for appointing justices to the High Court of Australia.
The statute provides that the court is to function as an independent body. Apart from special procedures applying to the first election of judges, judges will be elected for a term of nine years and will not be eligible for reappointment. Judges can be removed for serious misconduct or for an inability to exercise their functions. However, the decision to remove can be made only by a two-thirds majority of the state parties upon a recommendation adopted by a two-thirds majority of the other judges. This provides greater security of tenure and independence than, for example, Australian High Court justices enjoy.
The statute also offers significant protection of the rights of suspects and accused persons. Article 55 establishes a number of rights to be enjoyed by suspects, including the right against self-incrimination, the right to legal assistance and freedom from coercion and arbitrary arrest. Article 66 establishes the presumption of innocence and provides that the prosecution bears the onus of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. The rights of the accused in relation to the trial detail are in article 67 and offer a high degree of procedural fairness. Article 81 offers a comprehensive right of appeal. The statute contains extensive provisions to promote the integrity of the court and protect the rights of the accused. While no institution can ever be completely immune from corrupting influences, the institutional structure is of a high quality.
Arguments about sovereignty have been a key theme of the Australian debate over ratification. One commentator remarked that, if Australia were to ratify, `the erosion of national sovereignty would be epic'. As a matter of international law, the concept of state sovereignty is no longer as fundamental as it once was.
In the Pinochet case, the House of Lords held that the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel or Degrading Treatment or Punishment confers universal jurisdiction on a signatory state to prosecute for offences within the ambit of the treaty. Universal jurisdiction in relation to the crime of genocide was pioneered by Israel in Israel v. Eichmann. US courts have exercised universal jurisdiction, in one case prosecuting a Lebanese citizen suspected of hijacking a Jordanian aircraft in the Middle East. Increasingly, it appears that the maintenance of state sovereignty is not a `catch-all defence' in law. This reflects a growing recognition that humanity is diminished when atrocities go unpunished.
It is clearly in Australia's interests to have binding prescriptions on war crimes. From time to time we are called upon to participate in conflict. It is vastly preferable that, as far as possible, those conflicts comply with basic humanitarian standards. Even the fiercest critics of the court recognise Australia's interest in seeing war criminals brought to justice. Even if Australia's opponents are not state parties to the statute, the individuals responsible will still be liable to prosecution if the crime occurs in the territory of a state party. War crimes against Australians are clearly more likely so long as those who commit them enjoy a reasonable prospect of impunity.
Australia played a leading role in the negotiations leading up to the finalisation of the blueprint for the court. Australia chaired the `like-minded group of countries' consisting of 65 countries which advocated a strong and effective court, and was active in the drafting and negotiation process. Australia has the opportunity to continue this active role. If this legislation passes the parliament today, we will be able to participate fully in the assembly of state parties and will be able to contribute to the election of judges and prosecutors to the court. Given that Australians could be subject to the court's jurisdiction even if we do not ratify, it is in our interests to have an effective voice in the assembly of state parties.
The current ad hoc approach to the prosecution of serious crimes of international concern offers only a modest contribution to the promotion of compliance with international law. Even in the early stages of World War I the campaign for an independent forum for the prosecution of such crimes was afoot. In 1915, Theodore Woolsey argued:
... unless something like this ideal is realised, we may well despair of the future of international law as relating to war. Punishment must follow crime with sufficient certainty to impress the criminally inclined. Punishment of the vanquished only, though better than nothing, fails of this certainty. It will be interpreted as revenge. Punishment of law breakers amongst the victors, as human nature goes, is unlikely except through neutral agencies.
It is impossible to know to what extent the horrors of humanity's most brutal century could have been avoided if institutions had been in place to bring such criminals to account for their actions. Unfortunately, there are many who today oppose Australia's involvement in the belated realisation of this ideal.
Participation in the court's creation is a worthwhile endeavour. Uncertainties surround the creation of any new institution, but that should not be an insurmountable barrier to attempts to promote basic humanitarian standards. The perils of ratifying the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court have been significantly overstated in the Australian debate. Indeed, as far as the interests of humanity are concerned, the most perilous action is inaction. I sincerely congratulate the government for ratification and, in particular, compliment Minister Alexander Downer for this tremendous policy victory.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2002-06-27,"—I seek leave to have my speech on the International Criminal Court incorporated in the Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The legislation before us today will enable Australia to ratify the Treaty of Rome, giving the International Criminal Court jurisdiction within Australia. This Court—at best—is severely flawed and at worst, is unconstitutional. It threatens to diminish Australia's national sovereignty, hinder military operations, generate selective and politicised justice, and eventually develop into an authoritarian master. Significant, long term problems will result if Australia ratifies this treaty.
TIMEFRAME FOR COMMENT ON BILL
It seems to be a characteristic of this government that Bills are now brought on in such haste that we have an extremely compressed time frame for public comment. The ICC Bill vas not posted up on the government's website until after 9pm Tuesday. The Consequential Amendments Bill was not posted up until Wednesday morning. Just after midday Wednesday, my office received a hard copy of the Bill. There is no bills digest.
So....the best we had to work with up until Tuesday night was the exposure draft dated 30/8/02. The exposure draft was 147 pages long and ended up with 30 amendments, making it a whopping 247 pages.
On top of this, we have the Consequential Amendments Bill, which amends 6 Acts and is another 94 pages.
Can the government please tell us how we, as the people's representatives in the Senate, the house of review, are supposed to digest this legislation, send it out to our constituents and respond to their concerns within 48 hours. If they do not have access to the Internet and email, how will they get a copy of the Bills? It seems the government just doesn't care. Once again, they are trampling all over our democratic rights with an entirely undemocratic process.
I remind the government that the Spring sittings of Parliament commence on August 12. The Preparatory Commission of the International Criminal Court has set a September 2002 date for the first meeting of the Court's Assembly of States Parties.
Australia will only be able to participate actively at this Assembly if the government passes legislation and ratifies, becoming a State Party by the time the meeting is held. Why wasn't the legislation put back until August? Is it that the government didn't want to give people time for consideration?
CONCERNS OF CONSTITUENTS
I note that the Joint Standing Committee inquiring into the 1998 Statute of the International Criminal Court has concluded that it is in Australia's interests to ratify. Acting expressly on feedback from my Queensland constituents, I report that One Nation does not concur with the Committee's conclusions. We vigorously oppose the ICC and all of its trappings.
Let me elaborate on some of the concerns expressed by my constituents.
GLOBAL GOVERNANCE STEP BY STEP
This Court will wither our sovereignty, freedom and independence. It is another step towards global governance. Non governmental organisations—as opposed to nation-states—played a pivotal role in the establishment of the ICC. The ICC will be a permanent Court that will investigate and bring to justice individuals who commit the most serious violations of international humanitarian law, namely war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. In theory it sounds very nice. But the reality is that this is another one of those prickly civil society initiatives that smacks of international double speak.
A network of over 1000 civil society organisations, known as the Coalition for an International Criminal Court was funded—in part—by the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and various national governments. The World Federalist Association, Amnesty International and Parliamentarians for Global Action are among those who agitated for the Court.
These civil society organisations address the process of change by commencing with national behaviour and it's all downhill from there. Let me remind the Chamber that the establishment of an International Criminal Court is one of the key tenets of the report—Our Global Neighbourhood—by the Commission on Global Governance. The Commission said:
“We would like to see such a Court instituted as a matter of the highest priority. “
And that is exactly what the government is doing.
Is it the case that these so-called civil society groups have usurped the place of our constituents? Is this how global governance works? Are our constituents being disenfranchised by stealth? This is not empowerment of the people, it is entrapment of the people.
As Senators would be aware, there are three levels of government. The Parliament, the Executive Government and the Judiciary. On an international level, we already have the seat of a potential global parliament, the United Nations. The Rome Statute will give effect to the Judicial arm. What we are seeing is the emergence of global governance—step by step.
EROSION OF SOVEREIGNTY
One of the main criticisms of the ICC treaty is that it is supranational. Multilateral treaties rest on cooperation between independent nation-states pursuing overlapping interests. Supranational treaties seek to subordinate sovereign nation states to new forms of international authority. The ICC falls in the latter category.
Let me cite Liberal MP Bronwyn Bishop, who has cautioned that the Australian Government will be required as an obligation of ratification under Article 89 of the Statute to “comply with requests for arrest and surrender” by the ICC of one of its own nationals.
The Manual for the Ratification and of Implementation of Rome Statute states that:
“Modification must be made to all states ` codes of criminal law and human rights legislation. “
It further states:
“Should there be a conflict between the ICC legislation and existing state legislation, international law established under the ICC and decisions of the ICC take precedence. “
If Australia ratifies it means we agree to these obligations and we will give the ICC the power to override Australian law.
This is a surrender of our sovereignty.
We are continually told by the ICC lobby that the Court is not meant to subordinate national Courts. Let me provide further evidence to the contrary. The treaty's preamble states:
“is intended to be complementary to national criminal justice systems in cases where such trial procedures may not be available or may be ineffective. “
It also appears that the ICC could ultimately decide what constitutes an “effective” trial.
The ICC would have the last word on whether a trial must be made “available” in a given circumstance. The ICC, in other words, could have de facto supreme judicial oversight.
CONTENTS OF THE BILL
I would like to point out that the scope of this Bill is extremely wide ranging and the definitions contained in the legislation are extremely broad— it sounds all too familiar doesn't it?
The contents of the ICC Bill include: arrest and surrender of persons; identifying or locating persons or things; taking evidence or producing documents or articles; questioning the person being investigated or prosecuted; facilitating the voluntary appearance of persons as witnesses or experts before the ICC; temporary transfer of prisoners to the ICC; examination of places or sites; search and seizure; provision of records or documents; protecting victims and witnesses and preserving evidence; identification, tracing and freezing or seizure of tainted property (assets); investigations or sittings of the ICC in Australia; search, seizure and powers of arrest; provisions relating to the execution of search warrants; stopping and searching conveyances; arrest and related matters; protection of Australia's national security interests; transportation of persons in custody through Australia; enforcement in Australia of reparation orders made and fines imposed by the ICC; forfeiture of proceeds of international crimes; enforcement in Australia of sentences imposed by ICC.
So here, in this legislation we have some of the key elements that we have in the government's anti terrorism legislation—phone tapping, assets forfeiture, a broad definition of a `thing', search and seizure powers and the list goes on.
CORPORATIONS FUND ICC
We are told that the International Criminal Court is a separate entity from the United Nations. According to the Rome Statute, its expenses will be funded by assessed contributions made by States Parties and by voluntary contributions from Governments, international organisations, individuals, corporations and other entities.
I repeat, corporations and other entities. Who are these `other entities'—moreover, which corporations will be funding the ICC and to what extent? How impartial will this criminal Court be if it is funded by multinational corporations? Will so called `justice' be dished out to various countries according to the level of funding pumped in by a particular TNC? How transparent is the funding process? Could the ICC be used to pursue the particular political or economic agendas of multinational corporations?
LEGAL OPINION
Several noted legal experts have expressed reservations about the International Criminal Court. Former Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Harry Gibbs, regards the Statute as detracting from the right of national self-
determination. Sir Harry bluntly condemns it as a surrender of part of our sovereignty, to a greater degree than other treaties because it would potentially subject Australian citizens to the jurisdiction of an international Court in respect of acts performed in Australia (article 12(2)(a)).
According to Sir Harry, ratification of the Statute would:
“in no way be advancing our national interests but would, on the contrary, be failing in its duty to preserve our sovereignty and to afford to our citizens the protection of our laws. Servicemen and women in particular would be exposed to the mercies of a Court whose standards of fairness might fall well short of our own and whose sympathies in some future conflict would be impossible to predict.”
University of New South Wales Professor of Law, George Winterton has raised the likelihood of the ICC being in conflict with the Australian Constitution in relation to the exercising of federal judicial power. Although Professor Winterton does not object to Australia's accession to the ICC as a matter of policy, he noted in his submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties: “Ratification may be appropriate, even though a successful Ch. III challenge (ie: a charge that the ICC violates the Constitution) in the Australian Courts could render Australia unable to fulfil its obligations under the Statute, and consequently liable therefore under international law.
Professor Richard Wilkins of Brigham Young University Utah criticises the Statute's “sweeping” language, which he says is “limited largely by the imaginations of international lawyers and the judicial restraint (or lack of it) that will be exhibited by the judges on the ICC. The ICC, he believes, “has the potential to become... a tool for radical social engineering.” Clearly, this is the real agenda behind the Treaty of Rome.
EXPANSION OF POWERS
Although the preamble of the ICC draft statute states:
“The Court is intended to exercise jurisdiction only over the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole”
many advocates of the Court do not want to limit its purview to the core offences of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. In fact, there has been a tendency on the part of advocates of the ICC to try to transfer human rights violations and violations of other international prohibitions to the domain of the Court.
For example, Amnesty International, one of the civil society organisations which supported the establishment of the ICC argued strongly that the Court handle war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide and that the “perpetrators of human rights violations must be brought to justice” there as well.	One scenario could be that eventually the ICC would establish `complimentary' jurisdiction not only over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide but over matters of domestic law enforcement and internal security as well.
Professor Richard Wilkins has indicated that this is not far from reality. He suggests that the elastic terms of the ICC statute will enable the Court to become the ultimate forum for the resolution of delicate questions of political and social policy.
The language of the ICC statute is broad and sweeping. The crime of genocide, for example, includes not only killing members of a “national, ethnic, racial or religious group,” but also “causing serious ... mental harm to members of the group.” Professor Wilkins points out that the ICU's machinery conceivably could be called into play to prosecute the racially and religiously charged rhetoric often employed by both sides of the ongoing dispute regarding a Palestinian homeland in the Middle East. While no rational person approves of rhetoric inspired by racial or religious intent, it is far from clear whether such name calling contests qualify as “most serious crimes of international concern.”
ICC AND THE MILITARY
Concerns have been raised by the US administration relating to the jurisdiction of the ICC in relation to military operations. All war crimes allegations could be brought before the Court.
The powers of the ICC outlined in the Rome treaty are an open invitation to abuse. Cases could be brought before the Court based upon the complaint of any country that ratified the treaty (an “ICC States Party”) or the initiative of the ICUs prosecutor-an international independent counsel.
Once indicted, the defendant(s) would be tried by a bench of judges chosen by the States Parties. As an institution, the ICC would act as police, prosecutor, judge, jury, and jailer. These functions would all be performed by ICC staff, or under their supervision, with only bureaucratic divisions of authority. The ICC would be the sole judge of its own power, and there would be no process to appeal its decisions, however irrational or unjust those might be.
The ICC would be empowered to investigate, try, and punish certain crimes, such as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Currently, nation-states have primary responsibility for prosecuting these crimes. In exceptional cases, they have been addressed through ad hoc tribunals set up by the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council. Ad hoc tribunals are set up for specific crimes and given prescribed authority, which prevents them from expanding their original mandate. The ICC, by contrast, would have greater autonomy and powers to investigate and prosecute suspected war crimes. This unprecedented power could threaten the ability of Australia to engage in military action to protect its national security interests.
Former US secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, as well as former CIA director Richard Helms and former US national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski were among the signatories of a November 2000 open letter warning that the US must put “our nation's military personnel safely beyond the reach of an accountable international prosecutor operating under procedures inconsistent with the US Constitution. There is a strong evidence indicating that their words are equally applicable to Australian defence personnel engaged in overseas military actions.
We need to consider that the Australian Defence Force has two major overseas deployments at the moment: its contribution to the United Nations peacekeeping mission in East Timor (approximately 1400 personnel); and its contribution to the coalition against terror which is not a UN run operation (approximately 1550 personnel have been committed). There are also commitments to other operations.	For this reason alone, the ICC treaty should be vigorously opposed.
ICC AND SOCIAL POLICY
The ICU's impact upon political decisions involving Australian defence force personnel reveals only the tip of the ICU's iceberg of new international laws. Professor Wilkins points out that not only soldiers, but corporations, churches and citizens could face potential prosecution by the Court.
The ICC statute condemns `crimes against humanity' such as acts of murder, extermination, enslavement, forcible transfer of population, torture, sexual slavery, persecution and “other inhumane acts”. These crimes certainly sound terrible but the Rome Statute gives very little guidance as to what these words actually prohibit. For example, the crime of “persecution” as set out in the Statute and as further refined in the “Elements of Crimes” condemns the “severe deprivation” of a group's “fundamental rights.” The crime of “inhumane acts” criminalises the infliction of “great suffering”, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health, by means of an inhumane act. What do these terms proscribe? At present, it is impossible to say definitively. No international lawyer or jurist can predict with any certainty how far this language might sweep. Recent decisions at international meetings however, suggest that such language could be used to completely refashion social policy on a world-wide scale.
The language of the crimes of “persecution” and “inhumane treatment” could be used to dictate marital policies, abortion policies, strictures and rules for religious practices and so on. While these and related arguments unquestionably press the outer boundaries of the ICC Statute's plain language, they cannot be dismissed; due to the vagueness of the ICC Statute's language, these issues might easily fall within its reach.
CONCLUSION
In my concluding remarks, I wish to recap on the extremely compressed time frame for comment on this bill. The way the government has gone about the process is an outlandish display of autocracy. Not democracy. This sort of behaviour certainly does nothing for the government's cause, in fact it compels us—to even more vigorously oppose the ICC.
Australian defendants brought before the ICC will be deprived of many of the crucial protections currently guaranteed by our common law system. The ICC is a hybrid of legal traditions and will operate with control and accountability mechanisms that, in some respects, differ from those in the Australian judicial system. For instance, in the ICC model the role of investigator and prosecutor are combined and operate without Executive oversight. What safeguards are there in relation to this role?
Ratification of the ICC should be resisted. History teaches us that unchecked power, unfettered powers are quickly and inevitably abused. The ICC threatens the rule of Australian law. It could obstruct our military operations. The long list of problems that are likely to emerge with the formation of the ICC—in any conceivable incarnation—creates doubt about the wisdom of establishing the Court in the first place. I urge the Howard government to change course and decline to ratify this treaty. It will open a Pandora's box of legal mischief and political folly.

The speech read as follows—
The Government believes that the International Criminal Court can make a valuable contribution to the future punishment of persons who commit acts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
Events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the last decade have focussed world attention on the possibility of putting an end to impunity for individuals who commit gross atrocities under the guise of war.
It is an inescapable fact that the perpetrators of these crimes in the last century were largely left unpunished.
The new century must not follow suit.
The establishment of the International Criminal Court is one practical way that Australia can help ensure that this goal is achieved.
Senator Harradine has asked that I place several matters on record.
I would like to assure the Senate that the definition of forced pregnancy contained in the International Criminal Court Statute was carefully drafted to ensure that it specifically set a high threshold for “ethnic cleansing” intent, while stating unequivocally that the definition should not in any way be interpreted as affecting Australian domestic laws in relation to pregnancy—including abortion.
Australia firmly advocated the latter part of this definition together with delegations from the Holy See and many other countries who were concerned to ensure that the crime of forced pregnancy could not be interpreted so as to interfere with the legal rights to regulate nationally with respect to pregnancy (ie anti-abortion laws).
There was a clear understanding in negotiations that the crime of forced pregnancy could not be interpreted as a justification for carrying out abortions.
Indeed, the definition adopted in the Statute deliberately focuses on the forced pregnancy and confinement of a woman with the intent to effect ethnic composition, not the event of a birth arising from such action. An abortion in such circumstances would be no defence.
Moreover, for the Statute to have such an interpretation it would have to be amended.
This could only occur 7 years after the Statute enters into force on 1 July 2002.
Any amendment must be approved by a 2/3 majority of States Parties. This would be highly unlikely in relation to this particular definition given the very delicate negotiations which resulted in the agreement of the final compromise text included in the Statute.
Finally, no amendment to a definition of a crime (including forced pregnancy) will apply to a State Party (including Australia if we ratify) unless they agree to be bound by that amendment.
The Statute allows for a State Party (ie Australia) to withdraw from the Statute on 12 months notice.
While it is not the intention for such action to be taken without proper consideration it is important to understand that the right to withdraw is available.
For Australia to exercise this right would only require the executive (ie the Government) to write to the United Nations.
It is worth noting that for persecution to be proved under the Statute and Australian domestic law, it must be committed “in connection with any other act” (that is with any other act that is a crime within the jurisdiction of the court. (see clause 268.20)).
This is a safeguard against expansive interpretation of what might constitute persecution. The Government is confident that persecution is defined domestically in such a way as to allow Australia, in all cases, to take advantage of the principle of complementarity.
Assuming that international law could ever form the opinion that there was a right to abortion in international law, even in this hypothetical case, the mere denial of access to abortion, for example or any other abortifacient, would not constitute the crime of persecution under the Statute unless that denial was accompanied by another crime within the jurisdiction of the Court (for example, genocide.)
The crime of forced pregnancy does not require a denial of access to abortion to be proved.
Nor would the performance of an abortion be sufficient to negate the commission of the crime, if the other elements are present.
This means any confinement, even if not until the birth of the child, is sufficient to prove the offence if the woman was forcibly made pregnant; and her forced pregnancy and detention were designed to affect the ethnic composition of the population; and that conduct took place in the context of armed conflict or as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against a civilian population.)
Finally, it is useful to note that ancillary offences such as aiding and abetting are dealt with in Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code and would apply to the offences to be enacted in Division 268 of the Code through the ICC legislation.
However, critically, for these ancillary offences to be committed, all of the same elements would need to be proven as would be necessary to prove the primary offence.
Australia's support of the International Criminal Court is based on the many of the checks and balances contained in the International Criminal Court Statute.
Its functions and role have been carefully articulated and its powers circumscribed to protect the sovereignty of the countries who support its establishment.
However, these Bills before us today provide safeguards additional to those in the International Criminal Court Statute to ensure the primacy of Australia's right to exercise its jurisdiction over those crimes, protecting our national interests.
The International Criminal Court Act will be the domestic implementation of Australia's obligations under the International Criminal Court Statute.
Australia's international obligations under the Statute become effective domestically only because they are translated into domestic Australian law.
The International Criminal Court Bill 2002 will establish procedures in our domestic law to fulfil Australia's obligations under the International Criminal Court Statute.
The principle that the International Criminal Court does not replace, or stand above, national courts is reflected in clause 3 of the International Criminal Court Bill 2002, which reiterates that the International Criminal Court Act “does not affect the primacy of Australia's right to exercise its jurisdiction with respect to crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.”
Under the Bill, The Attorney-General must not issue a notice for arrest, provisional arrest or surrender of a person for a crime unless he or she has signed a certificate that it is appropriate to do so.
Examples of the way the domestic law relates to our international obligations are provided in the explanatory memorandum.
Clause 181 of the International Criminal Court Bill 2002 and clause 268.122 of the amendments to the Criminal Code in the International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 are designed to ensure that domestic judicial review is limited.
In accordance with one of the recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, the Government will closely monitor the operations of the International Criminal Court and report on these operations annually to Parliament.
These reports will allow the Government and the Parliament to ensure that the operation of the International Criminal Court, and the way in which its jurisprudence develops, remain in Australia's national interests. Clause 189 of the International Criminal Court Bill contains the reporting requirement.
The International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 incorporates the offences of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the International Criminal Court Statute into the Australian Criminal Code.
This ensures that those crimes will be interpreted and applied under Australian law.
The offences will apply to all conduct, regardless of whether it or its effect occurs within or outside Australia.
The offences apply to all persons regardless of nationality and apply equally to members of the Australian Defence Force.
This proposed legislation is designed to enable Australia to take full advantage of the protections afforded by the principle of complementarity.
This means that the Court will not replace national courts, but be complementary to them.
The Court cannot act except when national jurisdictions are genuinely unwilling or unable to investigate and prosecute.
A fundamental element of the International Criminal Court Statute is its recognition that it is the primary duty of every State to exercise its national criminal jurisdiction over these crimes.
The International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002 also sets out the principle of complementarity in clause 268.1.
Australia retains comprehensive jurisdictional coverage over members of the Australian Defence Force for crimes within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, wherever committed.
The Defence Force is satisfied that, under this regime, the interests of its members are adequately protected.
The Government believes that the establishment of the International Criminal Court is an important development to ensure that those who commit the most egregious crimes against humanity are brought to justice.
It is in Australia's national interest to be part of this important international effort to deter and punish those who commit atrocities. This legislation will give effect to the Government's commitment to this principle.
I commend these Bills to the Senate.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-06-27,"— I would like to thank the relevant stakeholders from the disability sector and the transport sector who have worked together cooperatively and willingly to achieve a practical, effective outcome in relation to the granting of appropriate temporary exemptions from the disability standards for accessible public transport. Unfortunately, this is in contrast to the conduct of some members of the opposing political parties. Passage of this extremely important legislation, the Disability Discrimination Amendment Bill 2002, has been hampered by non-government political incompetence and indecision.
In March this year, the government sought to expedite the passage of the bill through the House of Representatives as non-controversial legislation. Although the shadow Attorney-General's office agreed to this, the debate did not occur until these sittings because it appears that the opposition whip did not receive the message to list the bill as non-controversial. Senator Allison also recently criticised the government for delaying the passage of this bill. The Democrats were first approached on 11 March to list the bill in the Senate as non-controversial to ensure its passage in these sittings. The Democrats finally changed their mind and agreed just this week. The government then acted to make sure that debate proceeded swiftly.
This bill is an important precursor to the formulation of disability standards for accessible public transportation services and facilities. Now that we have finally got the bill to the Senate, I would like to commend the bill to the Senate. It is an essential part of ensuring that the standards will operate in a fair, balanced and effective way for people with disabilities and for public transport operators and providers. Once the bill is passed, the Attorney-General will be able to formulate and table the standards. I am very pleased to commend the bill to the Senate.

"Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",LP,2002-06-27,"—Yesterday, Senator Lundy asked me a question about the Defence PMKeyS contract. I have some information to add to my answer. I seek leave to have that information incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
I am pleased to add to my answer to Senator Lundy's question yesterday regarding Defence's PMKeyS Project and in doing so correct the factual errors in her question.
By way of background, the Personnel Management Key Solution Project, or PMKeyS Project, entails the delivery of a major IT solution to replace over 20 large and purpose-built human resource and payroll computer systems throughout Defence. The Project commenced in September 1997 as part of the Defence Reform Program.
On 10 July 1998 a contract was signed with PeopleSoft for the implementation of the PeopleSoft Human Resource Management System (HRMS), which is a commercial, off-the-shelf, human resource management and payroll system.
The PMKeyS Project business case provided initial estimates for the cost and timeframe of PMKeyS implementation across the whole of Defence.
The initial budget was $25m and the timeline expected completion in 3 years, or around the end 2000. The contract cost for the PeopleSoft HRMS element of the Project comprised $13.5m of this amount.
In addition to the software provided by PeopleSoft, other external providers have been engaged to provide services towards the PMKeyS Project, including for project management, training development, training delivery, and production system problem resolution.
Implementation of the project is a complex activity, involving the effort of PeopleSoft, Defence project staff and sub-contractors. Progress of the project has been monitored by Defence, and to date, there has been no action or failure in performance by PeopleSoft that has been judged to warrant legal action.
It is pleasing to advise the Senate that Defence implemented the civilian HR component of the PMKeyS Project, including payroll in October 1999.
The implementation of the civilian component was timely, and covered some 19000 civilian staff including staff on compensation payments, around 2500 military personnel on compensation payments, and around 2600 Instructors of Cadets.
As the initial project completion date approached in 2000, it became apparent to Defence that the time-scale and budget estimates for the ADF component of the implementation were ambitious, and the level of customisation required had been underestimated.
The level of customisation of the PeopleSoft HRMS product ultimately required to meet the complex functionality required by the ADF has had a significant impact on time and cost for implementation across the ADF.
Defence has worked with PeopleSoft and other contractors to deliver the requisite level of functionality, which includes career management and professional development and training management.
The internal business process changes required to implement in Defence a uniform human resources management system have also taken longer than originally estimated.
This has been a massive systems integration task. Some 80,000 ADF personnel's records are involved, including Reservists.
I can advise the Senate that from early July this year Defence will have rolled-out PMKeyS to the Army.
This will mark the implementation of a single, human-resources software system for all Defence staff; currently some 100,000 personnel records. The ADF payroll component is the remaining body of work to complete the Project.
The Project expenditure to date is around $61m. Approximately $46m of this has been paid to contractors.
Defence is currently undertaking a review of progress to date and of the estimated completion date and the total project costs. However, as advised to the recent Senate Legislative Committee hearings on the Defence estimates, completion is currently expected by the end of 2003 with total Project costs in the order of $70m.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Defence: Contracts</title>,Questions Without Notice,29,1,speech

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
There are two matters to raise in taking note of the minister's response. Firstly, the matter as to process: there was an interjection, and I understand that is disorderly, but it did lead to the issue of whether or not my office had followed protocol and contacted Minister Coonan's office prior to yesterday's question time, when I initially raised this matter. That was a response to an interjection from Senator Patterson. I did say at the time that I was confident my office had rung Senator Coonan's office. I did recheck that after question time and, yes, my staff had rung the staff of Senator Coonan and had spoken to two of her staff about this matter before question time yesterday. There appears to have been—I will be charitable—a communication breakdown in Senator Coonan's office. I just want to make it clear for the record that my office had followed protocol and understood courtesy in phoning first.
Secondly, as to the questions themselves and the answers that we require, the minister is correct: they are quite detailed questions, and they are important questions because they go to issues in relation to modelling, revenue and costs of a range of measures— for example, matters relating to taxation revenue expenditures in the area of superannuation and other like tax expenditures. The minister did complain in question time about Labor's alleged attitude to budget and revenue matters. I would just point out to the Senate that the sorts of questions that we have put on notice, and answers to them, are quite critical for any opposition and, indeed, for commentators in tax and economic and superannuation areas, to make reasoned judgments about policy initiatives. This is particularly so in light of the Inter-generational Report, which I will not go into today because of time but which I believe is not a full picture of the issues facing Australia with respect to the ageing population.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer (Senator Coonan) to questions without notice asked today.
I want to draw to the Senate's attention the response of the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer to my question in relation to a superannuation fund retirement pension product—
—Madam Deputy President, on a point of order: I understand there is an agreement amongst the parties and the whips that the Senate would be dispensing with this procedure this afternoon with a view to proceeding to valedictories. Is Senator Sherry wishing to intrude into the time for valedictories?
—No, Senator Watson, that is not the agreement. I understand that will be happening not later than 4.30 p.m.
—Madam Deputy President, there has been a misunderstanding here. I was led to believe after the leaders and whips meeting that we were not going to have taking note of answers today. That was my understanding and Senator Brown is nodding his head. Obviously, the Leader of the Opposition was not of that view, and it seems now that we are taking note, which makes it rather difficult for me because most of my take-noters have left the chamber.
—Madam Deputy President, if we do want to get on to valedictories early, I make the point to Senator Calvert that we should keep to any agreement we have reached. Before we move on to the valedictories, if people are going to give a travelogue on a couple of reports, I would rather have the noting done because it is more valuable.
—The Labor Party will be pursuing taking note today as normal.
—I want to draw the Senate's attention to the issue that I raised with Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer and the minister responsible for superannuation matters. I did ask a question about a particular superannuation fund retirement pension product called `freedom of choice monthly income pool'. This product is an income stream or a retirement pension, as it would be more commonly known, that had been purchased by an individual who has contacted my office to complain that the pension has stopped being paid. This is a private pension, the individual is in retirement and the private pension that they have purchased is no longer being paid. Of course, for any person in retirement this is a very serious matter. If you have saved over your working life, you get to retirement and you purchase an income stream, then you obviously have to live on that in retirement. For the individual—and there are others affected by this so-called `freedom of choice monthly income pool'—this is a very serious matter indeed.
Fortunately, for the Australian superannuation system the number of these failures is small in the context of the eight million Australians who have superannuation, but for those individuals where this occurs it is quite devastating. If you are elderly, you are retired and you are receiving an income, and you obviously need that income to live on, what on earth do you do if for some reason your retirement income, and in this case the `freedom of choice monthly income pool', ceases to be paid? It is a very serious matter indeed for those individuals who are affected. 
The minister did indicate that she had heard of this particular product. It comes under the broader banner of what has become known as the Commercial Nominees case. There are a particular number of matters that are a cause of concern to the Labor opposition in the approach taken by the minister in this area. One matter of great interest to me was that she did inform the Senate that the individuals who selected this `freedom of choice monthly income pool' had exercised choice—they had actually gone out into the market and decided to purchase this retirement pension; they had exercised choice quite freely. That is what she alluded to. I find this interesting in view of the policy position of the Liberal government, which is to force choice on every Australian. Every Australian, under government policy not legislated for yet, will have to go out into the marketplace and choose a particular superannuation fund. It is a worry to the Labor Party that, under this proposed government model that is yet to pass this Senate, anyone who bought a pension called `freedom of choice monthly income pool'—I think it is quite aptly named, given the circumstances—will be dudded. Their retirement pension income has stopped, which is catastrophic for those who are retired.
I turn now to the issue of the regulator. The regulator is the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, commonly known as APRA. The minister is staunch in her defence of APRA and its role as regulator. I, as deputy chair of the Senate committee, and Senator Watson, as chair—in fact, he has taken a much harder line than I have on this—know that, in this case, APRA was not as diligent as it should have been. Despite the evidence that emerged, APRA did not pick up on it or act quickly enough to ensure that the problems arising in this area were minimised. I hope that Senator Watson refers to this because the minister continues to defend the role of APRA. According to the Treasurer, Mr Costello—and he created this regulator—APRA is the world's best regulator. After HIH and Commercial Nominees, I do not see anyone—other than the Treasurer and, apparently, the Assistant Treasurer—calling this Australia's `world's best regulator'. It did not act appropriately with respect to Commercial Nominees and the so-called `freedom of choice monthly income pool'.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I also wish to take note of the answers given today by Senator Coonan.
—You never keep an agreement, George.
—I thought you did not want to take part in the debate, Senator Ferguson. The intervention by Senator Watson in response to Senator Cook taking note of the answers given by Senator Coonan demonstrates the difficulty we on this side have in dealing with the minister, Senator Coonan. I asked her a question today in relation to the meeting that took place at the Royal Perth Yacht Club. I got a confused and confusing answer. That is not unusual in this place. A lot of the answers from Senator Coonan over the past few weeks have been confused and confusing. I recall asking her a question a couple of weeks ago about household debt. She proceeded to give me an answer with respect to rates of housing renewals or approvals in this country—an answer totally unrelated to the question. There was a similar set of circumstances in response to my question today.
It is clearly demonstrated that this minister does not have a grasp of her portfolio. She is not across the issues for which she has ministerial responsibility—and it is an important ministerial responsibility. Questions such as how revenue is collected, whom it is collected from, who pays it, who fails to pay it and who avoids paying it are of great importance to the Australian community. The minister has said that she attended a meeting at the Royal Perth Yacht Club with persons who had concerns and that she discussed issues relating to mass marketing schemes with those individuals. After that meeting, she took what I think is the extraordinary step of ringing the Commissioner of Taxation to put some views to him in relation to the issues raised at that meeting. We have had various answers from the minister as to exact views she put to the tax commissioner and what she requested of him. It is interesting to note that the minister was able to go to Western Australia and spend a significant period in Perth—she was certainly able to spend a Saturday, part of her weekend, at the Royal Perth Yacht Club—talking about these issues.
—You would have been on the golf course. That is where you would have been.
—I am not the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Ferguson. No members of my golf club are involved in mass marketing schemes, Senator Ferguson, or have the capacity to avoid their taxation commitments. The point is this: it has clearly been demonstrated that Senator Coonan was previously in the vicinity of Kalgoorlie for discussions about these issues. The biggest number of taxpayers affected by these schemes are in Kalgoorlie—an area that has been very well served by my colleague Senator Cook. He has gone out of his way to provide a service to that community that the local member has not been capable of providing.
While the minister was in that vicinity, did she take the opportunity to go to Kalgoorlie and talk to the people who were involved in any of these schemes? Did the minister invite any representatives from Kalgoorlie to come to the Royal Perth Yacht Club to hear what she had to say about mass marketing schemes? How much of her time did she spend on the water on that Saturday, sailing around the beautiful environs of Perth? How much time did she actually spend talking to the people who were involved in these schemes? She still has not answered the question. Why did she pick up the phone and ring the tax commissioner? What was the objective of that phone call? Who was she seeking to benefit by making that call? She has not answered that question; it remains unresolved. If she is concerned about all of the people in this community who pay tax and contribute to the revenue of the community, then she ought to attend more clubs than the Royal Perth Yacht Club.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions </title>,Questions Without Notice,31,1,speech

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I too wish to take note of the answers of Senator Coonan during question time. I am not aware of breaking any undertaking. I do not understand such an undertaking was given because—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Senator Cook, you have the call for five minutes. Other conversations can take place outside.
—I do believe agreements should be kept.
Senator Knowles interjecting—
—You are not my whip. There is a serial history of considerable incompetence in this chamber by ministers who are assistant treasurers. Senator Jim Short occupied that portfolio for a short time. He is now, I understand, at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He moved out of that portfolio after an embarrassing display and a somewhat stuttering attempt to answer questions properly, and I think it is fair to say that many in the chamber felt a lack of confidence in him. Senator Rod Kemp then succeeded him in that portfolio, and we all know Senator Kemp as someone who would never allow an answer to get in the way of making a political statement. Often his answers were not to the question but simply regurgitated the lines of the day turned out by the spin doctors in the back room of the Liberal Party. He did that rather than try and answer the earnest questions of senators in this chamber and shed light on detailed matters. In fact, during Senator Kemp's tenure, when he was asked detailed questions he appeared even more embarrassed.
Now we have Senator Coonan. From our side, Senator Coonan was extended a degree of respect and tolerance as befits a debutante to the front bench of the government, but she seemed to believe that her job was to start out with a bit of biffo, beat up on the opposition, rather than actually answer a question. My observation is that it is always far better for ministers to get on top of their portfolios, to know the facts and to answer on the facts before they get into trying to best the political debate in this chamber. Senator Coonan has made a shaky start, and some of her answers to the questions over the last couple of weeks have left some doubts in the mind as to her competence. One hopes that during the break she can regather her forces and come back and start to answer those questions thoroughly and professionally.
That leads me to the question that Senator Campbell was referring to, the meeting at the Royal Perth Yacht Club. The Royal Perth Yacht Club nestles in the peppermint trees lining Matilda Bay opposite Perth, bordering on the stately sandstone of the edifice of the University of Western Australia. It is a select part of Perth; it is not a part that most people have access to. Not everyone is a member of the Royal Perth Yacht Club and therefore not everyone knew that they could consult the Assistant Treasurer on mass marketed tax schemes at such a select venue. Indeed, as has been said, a number of people in mass marketed schemes reside out on the red dust and saltbush of the Kalgoorlie alluvial plain, and many of those have been specifically targeted by what I regard as the serious problem in this issue, promoters, who said to themselves: `Hello! Here's a chance to make a killing. People in the mining industry have big per capita incomes'—they also have big per capita costs but they have some disposable income—`and if we can turn our attention from doctors, lawyers and airline pilots we might be able to inveigle some of these people into investing their hard-earned dollars into mass marketed schemes.' These promoters were gulling them with information that is shonky at best about the legality of some of these schemes. A number of innocent people were caught. 
A series of important questions needed to be answered so that those people knew how to elect to accept an offer from the tax office or exercise their rights at law. The questions that those people had—and there has been considerable community trauma about this in the Kalgoorlie region—were not answered in time for them to make a fully informed decision. They had to go with a decision in the circumstances at the time. The answers are apparently going to be given today, but the offer from the tax office expired last week. So the answers will be interesting but not useful for the real problems that they face. This question of privilege and right seems to be being confused. Senator Coonan, I think, could have used her time to have gone to Kalgoorlie and answered the questions of those individuals so they would know. (Time expired)

The statement read as follows—
Madam President, I had the privilege of being part of an Parliamentary Delegation that visited Finland and Germany between 7 and 19 April 2002. The delegation undertook a series of meetings, inspections and discussions on issues of current relevance and importance. A central objective of the Delegation's visit was to renew and reinforce the existing good relations between the Australian Parliament and the Finnish and German parliaments. 
The Delegation was led by the President of the Senate, the Hon Margaret Reid, and comprised Senators Winston Crane and myself, and three Members of the House of Representatives, Mrs Kay Elson, Mr Michael Danby, and Mrs Margaret May.
The Delegation's program in Finland, 7-12 April 2002, was hosted and arranged by the Finnish Parliament. The Delegation held meetings on a range of political, economic and social issues with the President of the Republic, the Speaker of the Parliament, members of the Finnish Parliament, the Speaker of the Sami Parliament, the Prime Minister, government officials and civic and business leaders. 
The Delegation's program in Germany was hosted and arranged jointly by both chambers of the German Parliament, the Bundesrat and the Bundestag, and included visits to Berlin and the new German States of Brandenburg and Thuringia between 13 April and 19 April 2002.
In Berlin the Delegation met with members of the Bundestag and Bundesrat, the President of the State Parliament of Berlin and senior members of the ministry and bureaucracy. The members of the delegation participated in a very informative forum arranged by the Australia Centre on “German-Australian Collaboration in Science, Education, IT and the Arts”.
The Delegation visited Potsdam, the capital of Brandenburg, and Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, to meet with members of the State Parliaments and ministers responsible for European affairs. 
The Delegation was shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic shooting of many students and teachers at a high school in Erfurt, the Thuringian capital, just one week after our visit there. The Leader of the Delegation wrote to the President of the State Parliament, and to others whom we had met during our visit to Erfurt, to express our deep sorrow and sympathy.
During the Delegation's visit to Finland the Speaker of the Parliament, Mrs Riitta Uosukainen, was presented with a formal letter from the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives inviting her to visit the Australian Parliament.
In Germany the Delegation presented letters to the presiding officers of the Bundestag, President Wolfgang Thierse, and the Bundesrat, President Klaus Wowereit, inviting them to visit the Australian Parliament. The Delegation is pleased to note that President Wowereit was able to respond almost immediately to his invitation and visited Australia in May 2002. 
The Delegation is indebted to many people here in Canberra and in Germany and Finland for the success of their visits to both countries. A full list of those to whom we wish to express our gratitude is included in the report but today I would like to especially mention Madam President, the Leader of the Delegation, the staff of our Embassies in Berlin and Stockholm, and our colleagues in the Parliaments of Finland, Germany, Brandenburg and Thuringia who hosted the Delegation's visits. Dr Ditta Bartels, Managing Director of the Australia Centre in Berlin. 
The Delegation's discussions with members of parliament, ministers and officials in Finland and Germany covered a wide range of topics including, not surprisingly, immigration policies, refugees and asylum seekers; border protection; foreign policy; trade; education; and the problems facing the new States of Germany—the former East German territories which joined the German federation after the fall of the Wall. 
In the time available today I wish to focus on just two aspects of our visit—our discussions concerning the European Union and the funding of Research and Development in the countries we visited.
European Union
Germany is one of the founding members of the EU, and Finland is one of the newer members, having joined in 1995. In both countries the Delegation met with the parliamentary committee responsible for oversight of EU matters, and in Germany with two State ministers responsible for EU affairs. 
One of the questions we asked constantly during our time in both countries was: How do you maintain the balance between your sovereignty as a nation, and your commitment to a supranational organisation such as the European Union?
The answers to this question were never clear cut but we gained the impression that it was a matter of trade-offs, and that constant vigilance was needed to keep the balance right.
For example, the Finns told us that in foreign policy and security matters they retained a relatively high degree of sovereignty because such matters are determined in the EU by inter-governmental cooperation rather than supranational decision-making. However, in respect to other EU matters the Finns felt that they had conceded a substantive part of their autonomy. We were told that “the Finnish Parliament now not so much makes laws as defines the negotiating position to be taken by Finland in EU forums”. 
On balance, however, the Finns felt that they had got the balance in the trade-off right. In response to a question about how one reconciles globalisation and democracy, the Delegation was told that Finland was looking at the EU as a test case of how this tension might be resolved. The members of the Finnish Foreign Affairs Committee were of the view that despite some loss of sovereignty on economic and social matters, Finland's leverage in economic affairs had actually increased since it joined the EU. Prior to Finland joining the EU in 1995, two thirds of its trade was already with western Europe but because they were not members of the EU they had no say in policy making. Now that they are inside the EU the Finns feel that they have more power over trade matters today than they did in 1994 when they were outside.
In Germany the question of the relationship between an individual country and the governing bodies of the EU is complicated by the fact that Germany is a federation consisting of 16 States. 
The Bundesrat, the German equivalent of our Senate—though very different in composition and powers—is the prime constitutional mechanism for involving the States of the German federation in EU affairs. Following the treaty of Maastricht the Federal Constitution was amended to require that the Bundesrat be consulted on EU matters, and that in the case of matters falling exclusively within the jurisdiction of the States, the carriage of the matter was to be delegated to a representative of the States nominated by the Bundesrat. 
Thus, on some matters the German Federal Government goes to Brussels to negotiate, and in other areas where the States have the prime constitutional responsibility (such as policing and education) a delegation of State ministers will represent German interest in EU deliberations.
There is no Federal minister of European affairs, though this is a matter for consideration at the present, and at the Federal level EU matters are dealt with by the relevant portfolio minister. 
Each State, however, has a minister responsible for European affairs and these meet regularly to coordinate their responses to EU proposals. Individual German States each maintain an office in Brussels—in effect a “mini-embassy”—to monitor and lobby on EU matters.
The Minister for Federal and European Affairs in the Thuringian State Government neatly symbolised the complexity of these arrangements when he told us that he had to maintain three separate ministerial offices—one in in Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, one in Brussels and one in Berlin. 
The European Affairs Committee of the Federal Parliament, the Bundestag, told the Delegation that Germany was hoping that the accession of 10 or 12 mainly eastern European countries to the European Union in the next couple of years would provide an opportunity to review the powers and procedures of the organs of EU governance—the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. 
Germany is keen to clarify the division of powers within Europe, including the possibility of re-nationalising some matters and confirming the powers of the German States in other areas. There is community pressure to address what has been called the `democratic deficit' that characterises present arrangements, by giving EU decision-making some more public support and legitimacy. 
The sheer size of the EU means that the original structures of governance are no longer appropriate. Unanimous decision-making had been feasible when the there were only six members but with the current 15 members the requirement for unanimity is too cumbersome, and unless the situation is changed decision-making would be virtually impossible when the EU numbers expanded to 27. Majority or weighted voting were among the options that could be considered. 
In Finland too there were some concerns about the “democratic deficit”. We were told that in the last municipal elections only 56% of Finns voted—much lower than the usual turnout prior to Finland's accession to the EU. The Finns thought that this may have been because many people think that “the real decisions are made in Brussels anyway” and therefore local elections do not matter so much any more. 
R & D
Though it has few natural resources other than the talents of its people, Germany is the world's third largest economy after the United States and Japan. The German economy is almost as big as that of France and the United Kingdom combined. Leaving Japan to one side, the German economy is almost as big as the combined economies of East Asia from ASEAN through China and Taiwan to South Korea. One of the keys to Germany's economic success is the amount of resources devoted to research and development—2.5 % of GDP compared to Australia's 1.8%. 
In the Delegation's discussions with the Prime Minister of Finland we were told that the Government had a target of lifting R&D expenditure to no less than 3.6 %.
In both Germany and Finland R&D is seen as a joint responsibility of both government and industry. In Finland the Delegation was able to gain an appreciation of industry's perspective on R&D when it visited the splendid new headquarters of the Nokia Corporation just outside Helsinki
Nokia is the great success story of the modern Finnish economy. It is now the world leader in mobile communications, manufacturing not only mobile phones but also network support systems. In 2001 Nokia's net sales totalled US$ 28.15 billion and accounted for four per cent of Finland's GDP and about 20% of export earnings. It employs 54 000 people in 18 production and research facilities in ten countries, including Australia. During a visit to Nokia headquarters the delegation was told that today Nokia invests eight to ten per cent of net sales in R&D and that 18 600 people, 35 per cent of Nokia's workforce, works in this area. It was planned to continue this level of investment despite a slowing in the rate of sales growth. 
In Berlin the Delegation was able to gain an insight into German perspectives on research and development when we attended a most useful forum on “German-Australian Collaboration in Science, Education, IT and the Arts” which was arranged by the Australia Centre, Berlin. Members of the delegation participated in discussions with more than forty representatives of German and Australian universities, research institutes, high-tech industries, government and broadcasting institutions, and the German-Australian Business Association. The Delegation wishes to express its appreciation for the work done by the Managing Director of the Australia Centre in Berlin, Dr Ditta Bartels, in arranging the forum.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-06-27,"—We start on our long journey into night with a large number of bills still before us. I will try to truncate my comments somewhat more than I otherwise would. But I do think we should do the issues we debate some justice, so I will take some time outlining the Democrats' view on the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Disposal of Assets—Integrity of Means Testing) Bill 2002. We heard from the Labor Party representative, Senator Bishop, on this matter a day or two ago and I will now give the Democrats' perspective. 
This bill relates to the assets test as it applies to social security payments, particularly pensions. The assets test contains rules, commonly known as the gifting rules, whereby assets disposed of for low or no consideration remain included in the asset value of a person for five years after their disposal. Aside from those recipients who wish to gift assets for purely benevolent reasons, the gifting rules in practice can operate to address situations where people who may be eligible for a benefit except that they are excluded by the operation of the assets test, can arrange their financial affairs to dispose of assets so that they are eligible for either a full or part benefit or pension and, where relevant, the associated fringe benefits.
The free area for gifting of assets in the Social Security Act has not changed in the past 10 years. Prior to 1991, it was $4,000 for couples and $2,000 for singles. That was changed by the Keating government, and the free area was increased to $10,000 for both couples and singles. It was justified at the time as both a reasonable improvement to pensioners' benefits and a simplification of the rules. Back in 1991, of course, $10,000 was worth a lot more than it is now. Essentially, the value of the gifting limit has diminished through depreciation to the point where, based on CPI increases, $10,000 then is worth close to $13,000 today. So, in effect, the true value of the gifting limit has reduced by almost a third over the past 10 years. This legislation before us seeks to reduce it by 50 per cent over a rolling five-year period.
From the Democrats' examination of the issues—and it is not a new examination; the matter was brought up in legislation a couple of years back and at that time the Senate rejected what was a slightly different change to what is being proposed here—there is a clear tension between the deliberate usage of the gifting provision to maximise pensions and the disadvantage or negative impact on those people who do not use the provision for specific pension maximisation purposes but for genuine gifting. The question often asked is why those who receive income support payments should be constrained in their generosity by governments. Frequently, the question is raised as to why Australians who have paid taxes during their working lives should be denied social security payments just because their assets are over the means test limits. The line is often put: why should the thrifty be penalised when they have managed to save sufficient to have so many assets that they do not qualify, while those who were not able to save for whatever reason or perhaps chose not to save do receive all those entitlements with no questions asked?
There is no simple black and white answer to this. The complexity of some aspects of the means test arises from a conflict between rights and freedom of choice on the one hand and the affordability of our welfare system on the other. There is also the question as to what level of need we should identify people as having before they qualify for payments and assistance. That is why we as legislators must question the provision in a means test that permits those who are reasonably well off to systematically divest themselves of their assets to acquire and retain publicly funded income support.
Three years ago in this place we considered legislation that sought to reduce the gifting provisions by halving the $10,000 a year free zone to $5,000. The Democrats opposed that bill at the time because we were not convinced that it was sufficiently justified to support, particularly given the available evidence. Things have of course changed financially over the last few years in not only the rate of the Australian dollar and unemployment rates but also, and more particularly, the development and expansion of the financial planning industry. The term `creative accounting' now extends to `creative financial planning'. There has been a political consensus for some years that some amount of gifting by pensioners is a legitimate practice and that gifting without loss of pension entitlement up to a limit is reasonable. The question then becomes where that limit should be set. We now regularly see financial planners advertise in the print media and on the Internet that they can find ways in which people can have thousands of dollars above the assets test limit and still receive a part pension. In consideration of recent tightening of loopholes, such as trusts and private companies, financial planners are increasingly turning their attention to gifting.
Each year, a small number of Australians give money and other assets to family members to maximise social security income support and/or qualify for a concession card. Gifting has been widely promoted as a financial planning strategy in its own right but it is of dubious long-term value for many people in that the amount of the gift is usually more than the increase of pension received as a result. Many older people are motivated to dispose of money and other assets by misinformation or myths about the huge value of the concession card or the possible winding back of the age pension down the track. The problem is that many fail to recognise the possible long-term financial implications of their action. This to some extent may be justification in itself for limiting their capacity to gift large sums, which might assist financial planners in getting business but does not assist the person themselves in any financial sense. 
It remains that there is a community expectation, one that I am not particularly opposed to, that some form of assets test or cap should operate so that those with sufficient resources to support themselves do so. Indeed, some financial planners will tell you there are strong reasons for discouraging the practice of gifting with the primary purpose of welfare maximisation, particularly if those involved are reasonably young and healthy. It is much better to maintain your capital base at as high a level as possible rather than continually whittling it away so you can get small amounts in pensions or other concessions. This is a regular message that other Democrats and I have received from financial planners. 
We are not much aided by the government's failure to get extensive data on the amount of gifting that occurs by Centrelink customers now to estimate the impact of the proposed new gifting rules. Instead, they use Department of Veterans' Affairs data extrapolated to age pensioners. I think that when we are looking at savings measures we need to have as much detail as possible about what the impact of those savings could be in not only pure dollars but also the number of people affected. Through this loose statistical extrapolation, the government indicates that the measure is expected to apply to about 0.2 per cent of all pensioners, which is about 4,000 people. The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants estimates the deprived assets totals several hundred million dollars.
Despite this government's recent attempts to remove certain people's access to the disability support pension, I am sure that there is no plan to scrap the age pension. It is often floated as something that may need to happen down the track because of the dramatic ageing of our population. I do not see that as likely to be the case. It is certainly something that is flagged from time to time as a possibility. It does remain though that the money people give away today could be needed in future for their self-provision or health care.
It is also important that we make the distinction that pension recipients can gift as much as they please. There arises occasionally the misperception that pensioners are somehow limited in how they dispose of their own funds. The Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans Entitlement Act 1986 do not prevent people spending or disposing of their assets as it suits them. What they do is prescribe a limit above which there should not be an obligation by taxpayers to fund the resulting increase in pension for every dollar they give away beyond a certain limit.
We believe that the gifting of assets by part pensioners in return for an increase in pension is generally legitimate and socially beneficial. We recognise that older Australians at times want to or indeed need to assist younger or less fortunate members of their own families including assisting with the deposit on a home or education fees. That reminds me that I have not paid back my mother for the loan she gave me for a house deposit. I had not thought of that for ages. I know what it is like. Parents can come in handy in terms of providing extra cash to help get a house deposit. Obviously that, and I am now speaking from self-interest, is not necessarily a bad thing—the issue is how much that can be without affecting their assets test. In many cases gifting assets can help the younger family members concerned and is also of wider social benefit. At the same time we want to ensure that only those who are legitimately in need of income support receive it.
Those are some of the arguments that we have had to consider in looking at this bill. The bill retains a maximum gifting limit of $10,000 per year and that is the free area that people can give away without it affecting the calculation, but it places a $25,000 limit on the total in any five-year rolling period. You could actually give away $10,000 two years in a row and $5,000 the next, but then you would have to wait two or three years before you could gift any more—you would have used up your limit. An amount of $25,000 is not necessarily terribly much. In Sydney the median house price is now around $300,000, and $25,000 is not even a house deposit; $25,000 does not pay the university fees for a student studying a band 3 university degree.
Accordingly, the Democrats intend to move an amendment to increase this total rolling figure from $25,000 up to $30,000. This is not just an arbitrary figure grabbed out of the air. This will enable older Australians who genuinely wish to assist family members through a major purchase to do so more freely without unreasonable impacts upon them. But it would be an irregular occurrence because the five-year rolling total remains in place; it would still mean that sizeable gifts would only be irregular occurrences rather than people being able to gift large amounts year after year and whittle back their own capital base.
On balance, the Democrats have come to the conclusion that, with the slight change that the government has made from its previous proposal to still allow a maximum of $10,000 a year and with that extra Democrat amendment I will move in the committee stage, we will support this bill on this occasion. It should be noted in passing that special arrangements have been put in place in the past for the rural sector, for whom it is a cultural norm, if not an expectation, that gifting of properties from one generation to the next will occur. And it is worth noting that from 1997 until late last year a moratorium was in place on the gifting of farm properties of up to half a million dollars in value, and many rural people made full advantage of that in gifting rural properties to family members.
We also note that earlier this year the minister provided a three-month extension for people who wanted to transfer control of their private trusts or private companies before social security deprivation provisions were applied. This measure particularly advantaged the farming community. Additionally, farmers who are currently winding up their involvement in farm trusts and who have complied with all the other requirements of surrendering control of their businesses have been able to continue operating their farming partnership until the end of this financial year without necessarily having all the farm assets attributed to them under gifting provisions. So we are satisfied that adequate consideration has been extended to the rural sector.
On balance, we are willing to support the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Disposal of Assets—Integrity of Means Testing) Bill 2002. We think it does overcome some of the issues of inappropriate gifting strategies that are being proposed and pushed more and more by financial planners to achieve social security maximisation, often for an illusory benefit to the person who gifts their money away and, with the benefit of our amendments, it will also be equitable for those for whom gifting is a legitimate activity.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DISPOSAL OF ASSETS—INTEGRITY OF MEANS TESTING) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,41,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2002-06-27,"—I thank Senator Bartlett for his contribution. As he rightly pointed out, people are able to gift $10,000 a year. Some time ago the government wanted to reduce the opportunity for wealthier people to maximise their opportunity for the pension by gifting by reducing that amount down to $5,000 a year. That met a not terribly positive fate in the parliament and so we have come back to look at it another way. That other way is to say, `If in any one year you think there might be a genuine need to make a gift of over $5,000, surely you cannot imagine those genuine needs are going to come up every year, so we would like to see'—and this is what this bill proposes—`a five-year limit of $25,000 on a rolling basis.'
I note that Senator Bartlett gave advance warning of his intention to move an amendment to shift the total amount up to $30,000. It is strange to have the Democrats moving an amendment to help out those who are wealthy enough to give away $30,000 over five years. Usually it is the Liberal Party that is accused of doing things for people with a bit more money. I was equally touched, Senator Bartlett, by your suggestion that some older people might use this to assist, as I think I understood you to say, their grandchildren to pay for one of the band degrees— because I remember the higher education debates and the Democrats had some very strong views about those whom they called the `rich and thick'. I would have thought that any kid whose grandparents can fork out and pay for all of their fees would fit into that category and the Democrats might not be so happy that that was happening. In any event, we are very grateful for the support.
—I wouldn't go crook.
—I am not going crook; I am just saying I am touched— touched at the comparison between how people who could give away $30,000 were thought of before and what they can do now. I welcome this refreshing change of attitude. I am genuinely pleased, Senator Bishop. You, for example, went and paid for a degree. You recognise the value of an investment in education and that it is an asset.
—Mine wasn't a gift, though.
—Yes, that is right: you did not have a rich granny who paid for you to go, who could maximise her pension by flipping a bit of money your way. Nonetheless, Senator Bartlett, we are terribly grateful for your support in this matter and we hope that it stops more people who have got a few bucks using the gifting rules to palm the money off elsewhere to maximise their pension when really we would rather the pension money goes to people who are really in need. So thank you very much, and I indicate we will be supporting your amendments.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-06-27,"—In the interests of time, I seek leave, on behalf of Senator Hutchins, to incorporate his speech on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002. I understand that it has been shown to the government.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
One of the main reasons given by the Government for the introduction of this bill is the alleged burden that unfair dismissals claims place on small businesses. When speaking on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998, I discussed the true impact that the introduction of such legislation would have upon small business. The Government has continually told us that as many as 50 000 jobs would be created by scrapping unfair dismissal laws. Results from the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey published in 1997 showed that unfair dismissals are not in any way considered to be a significant impediment do the creation of jobs. Unfair dismissal laws did not rate a mention as an impediment to hiring new employees. In fact the figure of 50 000 jobs was merely estimated by the head of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. It was not based on an analysis or research, yet the Government has taken that figure and repeated it like a mantra since the introduction of bills similar to this one. In fact, the `fair' dismissal laws may discourage businesses to keep their number of employees below fifteen. That does not encourage job growth by any stretch of the imagination.
This bill is simply an example of what appears to be an increasing trend for style over substance. The so-called `Fair Dismissal' bill has simply been an opportunity for the Government, in particular the Minister for Workplace Relations, to roll out rhetoric that makes them appear to be in favour of the greater good of workers. This bill does nothing to create jobs, in fact it only serves to remove one of the most basic of workers' rights: the right not to be sacked without reason.
Every hard-working employee, who is an honest worker day after day, is entitled to job security. This bill is purely arbitrary in its nature in that it creates a situation where the size of the company that an employee works for determines their level of job security. It would exclude the new `special' class of workers employed by small businesses under a Federal award from unfair dismissal protection. Why that group should be singled out is not entirely obvious. Only 8 095 workers covered by Federal awards lodged unfair dismissal claims in the 2000/2001 financial year. The number of those who were employed by small businesses would have been a small number indeed. This bill targets a relatively small element of the workforce in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner.
Not only is the Government content to discriminate against workers on an entirely arbitrary basis, but once they are in need of assistance in finding a job, they are often met with entirely unhelpful behaviour from staff at Job Network agencies. I mention this because of a constituent who has contacted my office. He is a resident of Kingswood in Western Sydney. In 1999 Mr Wayn Guy was using the services of Employment National to assist with him finding a job. While he was using a computer at the Employment National Office, Mr Guy found a diskette which contained personal and somewhat derogatory information about himself. Subsequently, the Privacy Commissioner found that Mr Guy's privacy had been breached and recommended an inquiry into Employment National's procedure relating to information stored on computer diskettes. Yet Mr Guy has not received an apology from Employment National. Mr Guy, the Member for Lindsay, the Member for Grayndler and myself have all requested apologies on his behalf. Yet neither the Department nor Employment National have apologised. They have simply stated that they “regret [Mr Guy's] level of concern over the incident”. So we see that while the Government wants to discriminate against a group of workers, their agencies fail to act in a decent manner while Australians attempt to find themselves employment.
As much as the Government may wish to allege otherwise, the Australian Labor Party is committed to an industrial relations system that provides for the creation of Jobs. There is no evidence, however, that any jobs would be created by the proposed changes. We would simply see the advent of an industrial relations system where there are two tiers of workers: those who are protected by unfair dismissal laws and those who are not.
The obvious effect on a worker's ability to keep a job that he or she deserves and does well, the bill would be an opportunity for unscrupulous employers to force workers into a situation where they are compelled to work under poor conditions. Any small business owner who wanted to employ their workers under Australian Workplace Agreements would be able to sack a worker if they refused to sign an AWA and insisted upon their rights under the award system of wages. The worker would not have any legal right to appeal such an unjust decision. As was seen during the Patrick's Dispute, there would be clear opportunity for employers to create smaller shelf companies to become exempt from unfair dismissal laws. The exemption from unfair dismissal laws could allow employers to circumvent obligations to existing employees and replace them with new employees at a cheaper rate. It is fairly clear that the proposed laws in this bill are by no means watertight.
While the Government's aim is to provide greater freedom for small business, quite the opposite could result from the introduction of these laws. The removal of the right to use unfair dismissal laws could see workers making claims under unlawful dismissal laws. Unlawful dismissal claims are heard in the Federal Court, where costs for the claimant, the employer and the taxpayer are higher. The main advantages of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission are its relative cost-effectiveness and speed. While unfair dismissal laws may be of some concern to small business it must be noted, as it was by the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association in their submission to the Senate inquiry into this legislation, that the concern for small business “is not really the cost of compliance, but the inconvenience of compliance”.
The Labor Party's position on this bill is clear. As it stands, the Government's proposed changes to the unfair dismissal system do not address the problems that exist. The current system is open to exploitation by advocates who are less interested in workers getting their jobs back than obtaining a source of funds from which to deduct fees. The current system's bias against reinstatement is evidenced by the fact that since 1997, of the 5% or so of unfair dismissal cases that actually proceed to arbitration, 838 applicants were awarded compensation and only 132 were reinstated. One of the main reasons there has been such a bias towards compensation payouts is because of the manner in which many advocates get their fees through operating on a contingency basis. Labor's amendments will amend section 170CH(3) of the Workplace Relations Act to restore the emphasis upon reinstatement rather than compensation.
A recent CPA survey showed that one of the greatest problems for small business was confusion about the operation of the unfair dismissal laws. There is a lot of misinformation about unfair dismissal laws. For that reason, the Australian Labor Party's amendments aim to make the system quicker and simpler for small business. The amendments will streamline the system by encouraging the Commission to make better use of electronic means of communication in the process so that claimants or defendants don not have to attend face to face meetings in the conciliation phase of the claim. Better education will be provided to small businesses about how unfair dismissal laws work through publicly available guidelines. Our amendments will allow bulk applications for multiple claimants in the same workplace to streamline the process and provide faster resolution of unfair dismissal cases. Our amendments will also establish indicative timeframes to ensure claim cases do not drag on do the detriment of the business and employee concerned.
Labor believes that every employee has a right to appeal against a decision by their employer to sack them if that has been done unfairly and unjustly. But we recognise there are problems with the current system, including the current system's tilt towards compensation payouts, the over-involvement of unscrupulous advocates and the complexity and length of the process. Our amendments will strike the right balance between protecting employees' rights and making it easier and simpler for small business people to deal with claims. Our system will ensure a fair go all round.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I would like to make a comprehensive contribution on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002. In my case, there is a history attached to dealing with this piece of legislation; I think this is now about the seventh time that I have done so. I could not miss the opportunity to make the point I have reiterated on many occasions that merit is not with this piece of legislation; it is part of the government's political agenda. In the interests of time, I seek leave to incorporate my remarks.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I find it ironic that the Government presents to the Senate the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 as one of its first pieces of legislation in this 40th Parliament.
New Parliaments are supposed to be about new vision, new vigour and new ways of tackling common issues for the national good. Unfor-tunately, the Government presents this place with a piece of old legislation that's driven by an old agenda.
In fact, the only new thing about this Bill is the name, with a minor amendment to the word `unfair', replacing it with the word `fair'. But while the title may have changed, the disdain and disparagement has not.
I have lost count of the number of times this Bill has been presented and re-presented in this place. Each time it has been rejected for very sound reasons. So why doesn't the Minister listen and learn, or as we do in the Senate, negotiate.
The reason is because this Bill is not about finding a workable and fair solution for small employers and employees. It's about politics— very cynical politics.
I certainly hope this is the last time this dismal piece of legislation is brought before this place. And so on that hope, Iwant to catalogue briefly the many reasons why the draft legislation before us should be dismissed as unworthy.
Firstly, and fundamentally, the Bill divides Australian workers into two classes. It removes for anyone unlucky enough to be working in a business of 20 employees or less, protection against and recourse from unfair dismissal.
The explanatory memorandum to this Bill states that it is designed to “prevent small business employees (other than apprentices and trainees) from applying under the WR Act for a remedy in respect of harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination of employment”. Let me say that again: harsh, unjust or unreasonable termination. This alone should be enough to stop a reasonable Government from pursuing such reform.
But the lunacy does not stop there, as there is no rhyme or reason to the dividing line of 20 employees between businesses that do and do not have to meet due process in terminating an employee. In fact, earlier versions of this Bill set the cut-off mark at 15 workers. Where is the Government's explanation for this change?
The Government loves to claim that the Opposition plays up the issue of class warfare, particularly in the arena of industrial relations; but here we have the Government actively attempting to create a new underclass of worker.
Second in the line of reasons to reject this Bill, is the lack of evidence that the legislation will actually benefit a small business people.
Over the years the Government has proffered a range of flawed and poorly crafted market research in support of its agenda to exempt small business from the unfair dismissal laws. Not once has the Government said `right, we are going to get independent professional research on this matter and really find whether it will benefit small business'.
The inaction of the Government to develop any credible research highlights the games they are really playing. The best example of this lack of substance to the Government's proposals is its consistent claim that around 50,000 jobs in the small business sector will be created if unfair dismissal laws are removed. Whit is the origin of this figure?
Well, as I have pointed out before, it was a figure plucked out of the air by Mr Rob Bastian, the head of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, COSBOA, at the time.
Mr Bastian admitted, under questioning from Senator Murray during a Senate hearing, that he had no scientific basis for the figure; rather, it was his extrapolation, calculated from unsolicited off-the-cuff comments by businesspeople contacted by COSBOA telemarketers.
As it happens, there is some very recent independent research into what will assist small business: a small business survey carried out by CPA Australia earlier this year. The survey asked 600 small businesses across metropolitan and rural areas in all states, what were the main impediments to hiring new staff. In response to the question, only 5% said that unfair dismissals were an impediment, and only three percent (3%) of small businesses nominated “changes to unfair dismissal laws” as something that would encourage them to employ more staff.
I note that Senator Murray in his address highlighted limitations with the CPA survey data, and I'm not declaring it to be a definitive piece of research, but as far as I know it is independent and professionally developed. I think it ironic as we debate that a relatively simple piece of market research can easily highlight that the Government's priorities do not seem to be the same as many a small businessperson.
For the record, I'd like to point out that the most authoritative national research on the subject of unfair dismissals was the 1995 Australian workplace industrial relations survey. While the research is now out of date, it was extremely comprehensive and the results were very indicative of where business were at.
Over 78,000 workplaces were surveyed in that research, a very large statistical sample. And out of 78,000 workplaces, when asked why they had not recruited employees during the previous 12 months, unfair dismissal got a response of 0.9 per cent. Less than one per cent of businesses felt hindered from recruiting because of the unfair dismissal laws.
I could go on about the spurious research that the Minister and his predecessor have trumped up time and again over the years on this matter. Quite simply, the empirical evidence does not provide any support for the Government's bill here today. But don't take my word for it. This is what the Federal Court of Australia said recently on the matter in the case of Hanzy v Tricon International Restaurants (15th November 2001):
“It seems unfortunate that nobody has investigated whether there is any relationship between unfair dismissal legislation and employment growth. There has been much assertion on this topic during recent years, but apparently no effort to ascertain the factual situation.”
But, let me move on and look at a third reason to reject the Bill. At the end of the day, it won't solve small businesses' problems.
Referring again to the recent CPA survey, it highlighted that the main impediment to recruitment for small business was the lack of skilled or experienced applicants. In fact, twenty-five percent, a quarter of all small businesses surveyed, nominated this frustration.
And what is the Government is doing to make people work ready. The clearest indication of the Government's priority on helping people become skilled for work is the delay of the Government's working credit policy.
Here's a chance to increase the supply of skilled people who are job ready (a term that Minister Abbott has been known to use), and what does the Government do, delay, delay, delay.
The Howard Government has always claimed a special connection with small business, asserting that this is the sector that drives our modern economy. I don't disagree with the engine-room assertion, but the Government has done little to actively help the sector tackle the issues of attracting qualified people to work in it and now wants to actually further reduce worker confidence that small business is an inviting sector to work in.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 makes the small business the option of the desperate person—hardly the way to build a modern vibrant sector.
Now it could be left there, with the Government and the Opposition at loggerheads over this Bill. However, earlier this year, the Labor Party began to highlight that it wanted to remove any unreasonable burden on small businesses in regards to the unfair dismissal process.
The Labor Party is not anti-small business. If we can make matters more efficient and ensure fairness for all parties, we will look at any ideas. And this is what we have done and what we are putting to the Government: a raft of proposals that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the unfair dismissal process. The proposals will give small business quicker resolutions, greater certainty of outcomes, and reduce legal costs.
In particular, Labor proposes:
1.	We want to restore the emphasis on reinstatement (rather than compensation) as the primary remedy for unfair dismissal.
This will enhance job security while discouraging applications directed at securing a payment of compensation rather than the restoration of the applicant's job.
2.	We want to restrict the capability for unscrupulous private paid industrial agents to profit from unfair dismissal laws. This is to be done by creating a register of agents and allowing the Commission to remove from the register those agents who are incompetent, who abuse the processes of the Commission or who exploit workers.
A number of states have already put this measure in place, and has obvious benefits for all concerned.
3.	It's also important that the Commission be required to consider the appropriateness of granting leave for a person to be represented by a lawyer or paid industrial agents in unfair dismissal conciliations.
4.	Labor wants to streamline and simplify the litigation process by encouraging the Commission to make better use of electronic means of communication in the early resolution of matters.
The New South Wales Commission has issued a Practice Direction that sets guidelines for the conduct of Telephone Conciliation Conferences. The direction allows parties to participate in the proceedings, where the Commission considers it appropriate, by telephone. This may be appropriate where distance make its hard for people to attend the Commission.
5.	We think it's vital to reduce business uncertainty about unfair dismissal laws. In particular we want to see the Commission establish practical examples that provide guidance for business operators on how the laws apply in relation to typical workplace situations.
6.	It will also be helpful to introduce provisions into the Workplace Relations Act that allow a union to make an application against unfair or unlawful dismissal on behalf of a worker or workers who were dismissed at the same time or for related reasons.
A union, with its knowledge of the workplace, will in many cases be better placed than a law firm to evaluate the merits of the case and to conduct negotiations with the employer.
7.	Finally, it is important to establish an indicative time frame for the resolution of unfair dismissal applications, including appeals, so that applications are resolved promptly and without undue delay.
These seven amendments will have an immediate and concrete benefit to all parties in an unfair dismissal dispute. Employers and employees will both benefit.
It is now up to the Government to come to the party and show that it will back some commonsense legislation.
In closing I want to point out that the Labor Party is taking the issue of employment and small business very seriously. An inquiry into Small Business Employment is currently underway under the chairing of Labor Senator George Campbell.
The inquiry seeks to understand the impact that government regulations are actually having on the small business sector. There is a special emphasis within the inquiry on the capacity of small businesses to employ more people, and the measures that would enhance that ability.
I look forward to seeing the inquiry's report later in the year when it is tabled.
The Government would do well to pay attention to this inquiry. It's a chance to have an independent, objective and non-partisan look at what Australian small businesses need in the 21st century.
However for the Bill at hand, its time for the Government to show if it can move passed partisan politics, and embrace reform that benefits all parties.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (FAIR DISMISSAL) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,43,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I realise the chamber is pushed for time this evening. I am not seeking to incorporate my speech; I just want to say a few words on behalf of my constituents in the Northern Territory. People in this chamber should realise that the Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Dismissal) Bill 2002 will, for a number of reasons, severely disadvantage those people who live in the Northern Territory. Firstly, the Northern Territory only benefits from the federal industrial relations laws. There is no state based legislation, so this will have an impact on every single employee in the Northern Territory, as the federal bill is their only recourse to justice and fairness. But there is no fairness in this bill, despite what its title says. People will be interested to know that 80 per cent of the businesses in the Northern Territory employ fewer than 20 people, and 70 per cent of those employ fewer than 10. So the economy of the Northern Territory is based on an extremely large number of small businesses. In fact, only 20 per cent of businesses in the Territory rely on a large and substantial work force. The rest have fewer than 20 employees, and more than 50 per cent of those have fewer than 10.
The basic premise of my speech tonight is that the rights of all employees should be the same, regardless of the size of their employer. Why should 20 per cent of the businesses in the Territory and their employees have the same rights as those people whom this bill will affect—those employed by 80 per cent or more of the businesses in the Northern Territory? In doing some consulting about this bill, as I travelled around some of the regional centres in the Northern Territory during the last six months, it was interesting to note that when I met with people from small business this was not an issue that was raised with me. It was not raised when I asked them what changes in particular they would like to see to the Workplace Relations Act. What they did raise with me, though, was the increasing burden of the GST and BAS compliance. What they did find was lack of assistance for small business in other areas such as liability insurance. On a trip to Alice Springs earlier this year, I met someone from a small business assistance office who was based there who said to me that the biggest problem for employers in the Northern Territory was in fact the introduction of the GST and the time that was required to complete the associated paperwork. When I asked that person, representing small business in Alice Springs, what he thought was the biggest hurdle for small business and where did, say, dismissals rate, he clearly said: `Way down the ladder, Senator, way down the ladder.' It was not an issue that he was concerned about at all. NT employees do not have any other unfair dismissal laws to turn to for protection.
As Senator Collins said, the government has attempted to put this bill through this chamber many times. There is no evidence to support the claims that the federal unfair dismissal laws have acted as a significant brake on employment growth. Exclusions from the unfair dismissal laws are already significant and the case for further exemptions, specifically directed to small business, fails to take this into account. The current unfair dismissal laws give substantive rights to the individual employees—not just the trade union movement but all employees across the board.
Back on 20 February this year, the member for Solomon, David Tollner, spoke in the House of Representatives in support of this bill. I am not sure what evidence he had to support this bill, given that in the Northern Territory for 2000-01 there were only 257 applications before the courts regarding unfair dismissal. In light of the large number of unfair dismissal applications in this country as a whole, 257 is a very small problem. But Mr Tollner had to rely on only one business in Alice Springs—and my knowledge of Alice Springs would tell me that it is probably some place that predominantly employs backpackers. In his speech, he referred to the fact that this business had to budget for $10,000 in additional payments to departing employees in order to insure themselves against the possibility of these applications. There is no law in this land that ensures that businesses have to do that and, I would have thought, with only 257 applications in the Northern Territory in a year, that is probably not a logical course of action for that business to have to take. But it is interesting to note that the member for Solomon, a seat which covers Darwin and Palmerston, when talking about unfair dismissal laws—or, as this government would say, fair dismissal laws—and the rights of employees to seek redress if they are dismissed, had to go outside his electorate in the Northern Territory to the electorate of Lingiari, which his party does not hold, to find the only example to substantiate his claim.
The issue I put before the Senate tonight is this: the dismissal provision in the Workplace Relations Act has not been raised with me in a significant way by small business. It is not one of the major issues that they want to see this government deal with and make reforms of this nature on, but if this bill were to pass the Senate it would unfairly disadvantage a significant number of employees in the Northern Territory who are employed by the significant number of small businesses that we have in the Top End.
Question agreed to.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-06-27,"—The measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 2002 and the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Amendment Bill 2002 include a requirement for quarterly superannuation contributions, a reduction in the so-called surcharge tax rates by 30 per cent, provision for children's superannuation accounts, an increase in the deduction limit for the self-employed, and an increase from 70 to 75 in the age up to which working members of superannuation funds can make personal contributions.
First I turn to the issue of the lack of equity in the surcharge reduction. A number of these measures are benign enough and, while they do little more than make some minor changes rather than address some of the significant issues and problems with the superannuation system, we do intend to support some of them. However, we will not support the government's intention to reduce the superannuation surcharge tax on contributions by 30 per cent over the next three years, at a cost of $370 million. The surcharge tax cut is highly inequitable. It only affects those on surcharge tax incomes of over $90,527. Let me repeat that: it only reduces the tax for persons earning over a surcharge tax income of $90,527 in 2002-03—a group that represents approximately three per cent of the working population.
What needs to be remembered is that the surcharge tax on contributions is the Liberal government's very own tax, which they introduced in 1996. They broke their promise coming into the 1996 election not to introduce new taxes. Mr Howard promised on behalf of his party on 1 February 1996:
We are not going to increase existing taxes and we're not going to introduce new ones.
That is a very clear promise—which was broken six months later when they announced a tax on superannuation and, to compound it, made an attempt to defraud the Australian public and call it a surcharge. At the time, the government justified the surcharge tax as an equity measure. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, stated in his budget speech on 20 August 1996:
The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer.
A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners. For a person on the top tax rate, superannuation is a 33 percentage point tax concession while a person earning $20 000 receives a 5 percentage point tax concession. High income earners can take added advantage through salary sacrifice arrangements that are not available to lower income earners.
The Government is remedying this situation.
...	...	...
For high income earners the superannuation contributions will still be highly concessional but are more in line with concessions to middle and low income earners.
He went on to say, when discussing the fairness aspect with Mr Alan Jones on 21 August 1996:
Well if they're paying 30 per cent on their marginal tax rate, they'll still get an 18 per cent break. Now I think that's pretty good, but I've got to tell you there'll be a lot of people out there quaffing their wines down in Pitt Street today that won't like it.
With the fairness principle that underlines the surcharge tax it would be hard to disagree. For high-income earners, the differential between their top marginal rate of 48.5 per cent including Medicare levy and the standard 15 per cent contributions tax is significant. So what has changed since the government introduced the surcharge tax that would make it suddenly so appropriate to slash the rate by 30 per cent over three years? The answer is: very little, except that those Pitt Street wine quaffers that Mr Costello, the Treasurer, was willing to stand up to in 1996 have obviously won the day just six years later. 
Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, confirmed this during his 5 November 2001 superannuation policy launch, when he said:
We recognise the need for some change and reform in relation to that surcharge and I believe that this will go a distance towards meeting the concerns that have been expressed throughout the community about certain aspects of the impact of that particular measure.
One of the biggest problems—and this is commonly acknowledged—with the way this government has tried to hide the fact that the surcharge was a tax has been the extreme difficulty for superannuation funds to implement it administratively. In terms of administration costs, the surcharge tax was unacceptably expensive. In its first year of operation, superannuation funds incurred as much as 30 per cent of the revenue paid as associated administrative overhead. While that estimate reflects implementation as well as ongoing costs, ongoing costs are themselves onerous. To this must be added the collection costs incurred by the Australian Taxation Office, which are considerable, and significant employer costs.
This tax is Australia's most inefficient and costly tax to collect. The administrative burden of the surcharge tax means that all fund members meet increasing costs, regardless of their incomes. One way or another, the associated monitoring, collection and compliance costs must be met, and are likely to reduce the overall accumulation of all fund members, not just those on behalf of whom the surcharge is levied. Reducing the rate of the surcharge does absolutely nothing to redress this situation. This is one of the perverse impacts of reducing the surcharge. You do not do away with the administrative cost; you in fact add to it. You do not solve the quite legitimate concerns about administration. And, at the same time, you do not solve the added administrative costs that have been added to those persons who are not surchargeable— who are not paying the particular tax.
Let us look at superannuation in the year 2002. Where do we find ourselves today? We have the highest taxing Treasurer since Federation and solid economic growth, and yet all this government can produce for 2001-02 is a budget deficit of $3 billion. We know we cannot turn to this government to come up with decent policies to help fund the retirement incomes of anyone except a relative few.
They took away the three per cent government contribution in 1997—and I think this is particularly important to emphasise. It was this government that refused to make the government contribution to superannuation of three per cent. In 1997 they abandoned that commitment. In doing that, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, effectively cut by a quarter the superannuation retirement incomes that Australians would have collected at some point in the future when they retired. This was despite the fact that the costs of these were factored into the forward estimates even after the very significant cuts that occurred in 1996. That is the reality we face today. We know that there is a tight budgetary situation. Labor accepts that circumstance. We know this government failed to deliver the three per cent government contribution to superannuation. We have to prioritise. We have to do the best we can. We have to target these sorts of measures. If there are to be tax reductions, they have to be appropriately targeted.
That is why Labor has put forward a fairer option for superannuation. Labor's plan is to cut the contributions tax, and it has been announced—it was announced by our leader, Mr Crean, in his budget response. We believe it is the best way to deliver higher retirement incomes to millions of working Australians. Labor has proposed two fairer options, and urges the government to redirect the Treasurer's superannuation tax cut away from the few and to all superannuation fund members who pay the contributions tax.
The Treasurer, Mr Costello, believes it is impossible to cut the contributions tax burden. He said in a radio interview on 22 October 2001:
It's pretty complicated. The taxing of contributions on the way in started back in the mid eighties ... and I think now that it's started that's going to always be with us ... it's still better to put money into superannuation, than to take it as income. But that system having commenced 15 years ago would be incredibly complicated to unravel now.
That is from the Treasurer who has introduced the most complex tax seen in recent times. I am not talking about the GST here; I am talking about the so-called surcharge tax. We do not agree with the Treasurer. We know that cutting the contributions tax can be done with a minimum of fuss, as confirmed by the many industry representatives who have spoken to us over the last few months. Labor has proposed it. We now have an opportunity to implement a fairer proposal which will improve the budget and boost retirement savings. But this chance will be lost if the government gets its way with these unfair changes. Labor's alternative propositions are: option 1, cut the superannuation contributions tax for all Australians who pay it from the present 15 per cent to 13 per cent or, option 2, cut the tax to 11.5 per cent for people aged 40 and over. Either option would add many thousands of dollars to retirement incomes. Both are economically responsible.
As an example, Matthew is 20 and earns $40,000 a year on average over his career. He receives an extra $7,128 in a retirement nest egg under option 1 and $4,748 under option 2—Labor's options. Matthew would receive nothing under the Liberal government's proposal to reduce the surcharge tax. Another example for someone already well into their working life is Heather: she is 40 and earns $60,000 a year for the rest of her career. She would receive an extra $4,069 under option 1 and $7,122 under option 2. Heather would receive nothing under the proposal to reduce the surcharge tax. 
These examples are in present values so they reflect the value in today's terms. The benefits will be substantially more in the dollars of the future. These outcomes provide a powerful incentive for Australians to invest in their own future, helping us to cope with our future needs. The Labor package for a fairer superannuation system is revenue neutral. This is achieved by opposing the reduction in the superannuation surcharge tax and the proposal to allow the splitting of superannuation contributions, which effectively doubles the 2002-03 reasonable benefit limits of $1,124,384 for pensions or $562,195 for lump sums, which we expect to see in another superannuation bill in the spring sittings.
In addition, Labor will not support expensive changes to the Commonwealth public sector schemes that the government has proposed. After the evidence presented by the department responsible for the changes to Public Service superannuation, the Department of Finance and Administration, whose officers admitted during budget estimates they had little idea about key aspects of the current arrangements or the alternatives, there is really no other choice but to oppose the changes. They did not seem to understand the comparative costs of the fees and charges of the CSS/PSS, presently nil to members, compared to the general market. They had a self-confessed lack of understanding and familiarity with the largely detrimental experience of UK public servants regarding the privatisation arrangements undertaken by the wildly zealous ideological Thatcher government some years ago. 
The department admitted they had not even undertaken a study, evaluation or benchmark of the relative costs of administering CSS/PSS as compared to alternative funds, and they were unable to rule out a reduction in superannuation entitlements for public servants as the matter would be made the subject of negotiation from agency to agency. It is really quite frightening to listen to the evidence at estimates from Finance and from Treasury. Any public servants must really be wondering at the level of knowledge of these issues within the departments responsible for overseeing these sorts of policies.
The government attempted to discredit the ALP's plan. They did not like it because it meant they had to start arguing that a tax cut to the select few was better than a tax cut to millions of working Australians. They chose a different route: they went with what they thought would be much easier. They argued that Labor had allegedly got the figures wrong. We had the Prime Minister early on 17 May saying:
You save about $50 million a year out of the surcharge if you lock that back, but I am told it is about seven times more than that, about $350 million, in order to fund a cut of two per cent in the contributions tax.
What he forgot to say was that his surcharge reduction would quickly climb to a cost of $200 million a year and that Labor were offering other cost savings to fund their proposal. Then the Treasurer released Treasury costings later that afternoon—all done on an accruals basis. That was rather hypocritical given that the Treasurer constantly refuses to refer to the budget for this financial year as being $3 billion cash in the red. 
The figure for cutting the contributions tax had also suddenly jumped from the one the Prime Minister was touting earlier that day of $350 million. One might think that the Prime Minister had access to some of the best advice the government could muster but apparently not. While it took all day, the Treasurer was able to get to a figure, from the figure the Prime Minister had given earlier that morning, for a two per cent cut that was $150 million more than the Prime Minister had suggested that morning which was $505 million. But Treasury ignored the full savings of the ALP plan and the fact that our tax cuts for all were to be phased in from 1 July 2003. We never said we were going to start on 1 July 2002 or that we could give the full tax cut in the first year, as clearly evidenced in my press release of 16 May. It was to be phased in just as the government planned to phase in their tax cut for those earning more than $95,000. During the estimates process, Treasury officials admitted that they had made mistake after mistake in that 17 May costing and yet they still refused to hand over the revised costings they gave the Treasurer when they realised just how wrong they had it. 
Another measure in this bill relates to the Liberal government's proposal to require the payment of superannuation contributions on a quarterly basis. There is a cruel sting in the tail with this measure. It will exclude tens of thousands of casual, part-time and seasonal workers who are currently covered by superannuation. I know my colleague Senator Hogg will deal with this in greater detail. There is absolutely no reason for excluding thousands of casual employees who are currently covered. 
I will deal with this issue in greater detail in the committee stage. A recent issue of public note has been the theft and fraud case involving Commercial Nominees—the first of its type in the last 10 years. It is an important case because it sets a precedent for the future as to how theft and fraud cases will be compensated. Under the current SI(S) Act there is a provision for up to 100 per cent compensation where theft and fraud has occurred. This has not happened in this case. The minister has provided for 90 per cent compensation allegedly on the basis of the need for moral hazard to be recognised. The minister advanced that argument in the Senate during question time. 
Superannuation is compulsory, is tax concessional, has limited access until age 55 to 60 and is very long-term savings for retirement. Labor believes passionately that, given the nature of superannuation and its central place in Australia's retirement income system, where theft or fraud occurs then full compensation should be paid. There should be no cutting of compensation below full compensation. The stated reason that 90 per cent compensation was provided by the minister related to some need for moral hazard. Apparently it was claimed that HIH victims received 90 per cent compensation. My information is that many victims of HIH received 100 per cent compensation. Some reference was made to the United Kingdom experience where 90 per cent is apparently what is used there. 
This is Australia. In the United Kingdom superannuation is not compulsory; in Australia it is. In Australia superannuation will form a far greater proportion of Australian's retirement income than it will in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom analogy is just not right. I do not think the minister should be put in a position to determine a level of compensation once the threshold of theft and fraud prima facie has occurred. I think it is unreasonable for the minister to be in that position. What will be next—50, 60 or 70 per cent, who knows?
Fortunately, theft and fraud is very rare in the Australian system, and that is because of the regulatory framework. Unfortunately, in this case APRA was found wanting, at least to some degree. I cannot put all the blame on them, but certainly to some degree they were found wanting. It is very rare for it to occur in Australia. But where it does occur—the hundreds of people in Commercial Nominees, a very small proportion of Australian superannuation fund members—full compensation should be paid. It is very traumatic for these individuals who have worked all their lives, saved hard for their retirement and cannot go back into the work force in many circumstances. Full compensation should be payable. ",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-06-27,"—I rise to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 2002 and the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Amendment Bill 2002. Superannuation is a tax effective investment but it is complex and subject to frequent change, as evidenced by the number of occasions it comes before this parliament. More of these changes are before us tonight. From next Sunday the superannuation guarantee, which requires all employers to provide a minimum level of superannuation for their employees in each financial year, will rise to nine per cent of earnings. Superannuation increases the available pool of national savings and is about providing secure living standards for Australian employees. Superannuation provides for an ageing population and provides for a better standard of living in retirement. For this reason the Australian Democrats strongly support the principle that employees' superannuation rights must be protected and control strengthened. 
The issue of quarterly payments has been around for some time. Quarterly payments were originally proposed in the 1992 super guarantee legislation but, of course, they were deferred at the time due to administrative complexities and compliance reasons. Currently, the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act requires employers to make one SG contribution on behalf of their employees on 28 July each year following the end of the financial year. This has been the case since 1994 and has created a number of problems for the employees, some of which include situations in which an employer delays making the payment until the last possible date. In those circumstances, the employee loses up to 12 months earnings on the contribution. It is also likely that business closures mean employee entitlements can be lost completely. If an employer becomes insolvent, the average full-time employee stands to lose $3,970 in superannuation for just one year. This could compound over time: after, say, 10 years to $7,000, after 20 years to $18,000 and after 30 years to $42,000.
The present system represents both an actual and a potential loss of benefits to many thousands of Australian employees, particularly those in part-time and casual employment. Whilst it is pleasing to note that the ATO reports a compliance rate by employers of more than 90 per cent, the remaining 10 per cent represents a very significant number of Australian workers. Typically, these employees are those with the least access to financial resources that might be needed to pursue defaulting employers. 
The Australian Democrats support the policy intent of quarterly payments to ensure that employee entitlements to employer superannuation contributions are paid in a timely manner. As with other entitlements, the longer the gap between an entitlement arising and the entitlement being due for payment the greater the risk that for one reason or another the entitlement will never be paid, or be lost to the member. Indeed, we believe there is a strong case for monthly payments. We note that many, particularly larger, employers—currently about 85 per cent—already pay their required contributions monthly. 
Monthly payments would reduce the risk of default and further mean that contributions start earning interest earlier. Accordingly, I will move a second reading amendment, which I have circulated, urging the government to introduce monthly payments for superannuation guarantee. However, quarterly payments will at least reduce the loss of investment returns for employees whose employers currently remit contributions to a fund only annually, in arrears. It will reduce the loss of superannuation contributions for employees whose employer gets into financial difficulties and reduce the number of instances where insurance cover may lapse due to lack of regular contributions.
This change is really about requiring about 15 per cent of employers to pay at least quarterly. Regrettably, what it does not do relates to the issue of unclaimed superannuation guarantee vouchers. We believe that at some stage the administrative provisions need further review to reduce the number of persons who miss out because of unclaimed guarantee vouchers. The Australian Democrats support the move to quarterly payments but we do not support the change to the minimum eligible threshold from $450 per month to $1,350 per quarter. This element of the bill directly penalises low income casual and part-time workers, the very workers who will need every cent of superannuation that they can get. Casual employment is becoming more prevalent in the economy, particularly for younger Australians, and for some women it is the only form of employment available to them. These employees may well miss out on superannuation guarantee contributions. It does not seem to us to make sense to hit this sector of the community just to save costs for employers. The witnesses to the recent committee hearing into this bill pointed out that employers may manipulate employees' hours of work to minimise their obligation to pay the guarantee. We strongly oppose that change. 
Coupled with the surcharge reduction, which is now, I note, not part of this bill, this is a package of measures that do not do much, we think, for low income earners whilst assisting wealthy Australians. The $300 million advantage to wealthy Australians should more equitably be extended to a broader section of the community. While we note, as I said, that the surcharge has been excised from this bill, it will no doubt be presented to this place at a later time and we give notice now that the Australian Democrats will not support that measure.
The Democrats welcome the extension of the deduction limit for contributions for self-employed persons. We note that the current $3,000 limit has applied since 1988. Currently, most self-employed people make the $3,000 contribution only to gain advantage for the full deduction. Increasing the limit to $5,000 does redress some of the disadvantage that deduction limits place on self-employed people when compared with employees whose superannuation contributions are fully deductible up to the age based limits. It will bring the self-employed person into line with an employee on a salary of about $55,000 who receives the guaranteed contributions of nine per cent of income. The self-employed people who take advantage of the increased limit will receive a big boost to their lump sum on retirement.
Preservation rules were intended to ensure that superannuation is used for retirement purposes only—hence the present age limit is 65, on or after which contributions generally cannot be accepted. Currently, 12.3 per cent of Australia's population is over 65. The Australian Democrats recognise that, as the current population of baby boomers age in a healthier manner and the proportion of those over 65 grows, many older Australians will want to work longer and make financial provision for their extended life expectancy. We support the change that this bill provides that gainfully employed members of funds can now make personal superannuation contributions up to the age of 75. We do have concerns that there is potential for this to be used as a tool for wealthier Australians to store wealth which will not be used for their retirement but rather salted away as inheritances for family members. In our view this is at odds with the basic precept of superannuation. Accordingly, we will be moving amendments to limit the capacity of high income earners to benefit from taxation deductibility of superannuation for other than retirement purposes.
It is with similar caution that we view changes in the bill that allow parents, grandparents and other relatives and friends to contribute up to $1,000 per annum into a child's superannuation account. It is a fairly minor element in terms of costings—supposedly $42 million over four years. However, we also note that most of the detail about how these accounts will operate will be in regulations that are not yet before the parliament. The Democrats support in principle this element of the bill to the extent it provides a tax effective savings vehicle for children. In reality, however, there will be few Australians who have the disposable income to put away $1,000 for superannuation for children. Parents struggle daily with mortgages and raising families, and the economic reality is that they are more likely to require money to put away for children to fund university education or to assist with house deposits. Despite the noble intention of this bill the Australian Democrats believe it should be tempered with caution to minimise the opportunity for wealthy Australians to manipulate the tax advantages of funds intended to support retirement for other purposes. We will propose a cap on the number of children to whose super account a person can contribute.
I could not conclude my speech on superannuation without referring to the failure of this government to use this and other opportunities to give gay and lesbian Australians equal rights to superannuation benefits. The definition of `spouse' in existing superannuation law continues to be held to be gender specific, recognising only heterosexual relationships where a man and a woman are legally married or in a de facto relationship. The use of the term `spouse' in superannuation legislation has the effect of excluding a surviving member of a same sex couple from receiving the benefits provided. Reform of superannuation to recognise the partnership of same sex relationships is long overdue. This government chooses to remain in the Dark Ages; it chooses to continue to disadvantage same sex surviving partners as compared with opposite sex surviving partners. Of course, we think this directly contravenes standards of human rights for those of the same sex who undertake a permanent commitment to a shared life.
The Democrats repeatedly proposed amendments to superannuation legislation to end gay discrimination on superannuation matters, but the coalition and Labor senators have consistently voted to defeat those amendments. Claims by the government and the opposition that broader legislation is needed to cover all gay and lesbian superannuants is laughable and talk of superannuation law reform is shallow, given that neither party takes the prime opportunity offered by Democrat amendments to ensure that same sex partners have automatic rights to claim similar taxation treatments on the funds of a partner who dies before retirement.
The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 2002 is not the most relevant for putting up amendments in this respect. I do give notice now that the Democrats will be moving amendments to the surcharge reduction legislation when it comes along and to other legislation where it is relevant. I move the following second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate is of the view that:
	(a)	requiring employers to make at least quarterly superannuation guarantee contributions on behalf of their employees does not provide for full protection of employee entitlements against business failure;
	(b)	a more frequent contribution payment for businesses would:
	(i)	strengthen employer compliance with the superannuation guarantee and assist with protecting employee entitlements against business failure, and
	(ii)	contributions would earn more interest in the fund as they would be invested sooner; and
	(c)	the Government should redraft the provisions of Schedule 1 to provide monthly contribution periods and forwarding of superannuation guarantee funds”.
Friday, 28 June 2002",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2002-06-27,"—As my colleague Senator Sherry indicated, I rise to speak specifically on the superannuation guarantee charge paid by employers and, specifically, the reduction from an annual payment to a quarterly one. One of the things that I addressed in my first speech in this place was the issue of security—security when you are in your youth, security when you are at work and, of course, security when you are retired. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 2002 goes to the very issue: it attacks the retirement income prospects of many people in the workforce.
When we quizzed the officers of Tax and Treasury at the hearing on this bill recently, we found a number of things that were quite alarming indeed. The consultation that they had prior to the government making its decision—surprise, surprise!—was only with employer organisations. There was no consultation with employee organisations whatsoever. Having listened to the employer organisations, the government then arrived at a very skewed, biased and distorted set of conclusions. Of course, whilst bringing forward the payment from an annual one to a quarterly one, they set out to move the qualifying threshold from $450 per month to $1,350 per quarter. I understand that the minister justified the change from $450 per month to $1,350 per quarter on the basis that the quarterly payment would increase compliance costs—for a number of small employers throughout Australia.
The evidence at the hearing showed that this is complete and utter nonsense, and that is the only way it can be described. When the officials were pressed, we were told such great comments that they came to this conclusion by just a `general feeling'. I wonder how much air they sniffed. Maybe when they arrived at this decision they had been in the same smoke-filled room which certain people on the coalition benches occupy from time to time. But only certain people on the other side would know about those things, as some of my colleagues over there would realise. I also found out that it was probably a hunch. It was really a surprise to me indeed that such a decision could be made—that stretching the $450 per month to $1,350 per quarter would lead to a reduction in compliance costs—with no foundation being established by the Treasury or tax officials. It showed just what a stitch-up, what a deal, this was.
All the government will achieve by pushing out the $450 per month to the $1,350 per quarter is to cut out the eligibility of about 100,000 employees to superannuation. That was based on evidence given to us by the ACTU. When I tried to press this issue at the committee inquiry, none of the witnesses before the inquiry could give me any definite number of how many people would be affected. But 100,000 employees seems to me to be a reasonable figure indeed. The people who are going to be affected are casual workers, seasonal workers and piece rate workers. These are people who are in the most precarious forms of employment in our community, the people who are most vulnerable and need to have superannuation such that they can establish a reasonable retirement income. Given the level of income that these people are paid, any level of retirement benefit is not going to be of any great magnitude.
As a matter of fact, the actions of the government fly completely in the face of the need for a retirement benefits policy for our ageing population. What we see in the government's attitude in this instance is absolute policy nonsense. There is no policy at all. What they are doing is saying that they need retirement policies on the one hand, but they are then putting into operation initiatives such as this which take superannuation away from a large number of people in the workforce. Many of those people are on low incomes, many are women and many are young people. Further pressed at the inquiry into the bill, I found that there was no modelling done to determine the impact of pushing the threshold out from the $450 per month to the $1,350 per quarter. It was as intellectually and mathematically rigorous as multiplying the $450 per month by three.
I just could not believe it when I read the Hansard. If anyone wants to read the Hansard, it makes a quite comical read. This move to just multiply the $450 per month by three and come up with $1,350 was designed to fulfil the wish list and fantasies of the National Farmers Federation and a few retailers who did not want to pay super at all, who wanted to deny their employees—people, as I say, who are in casual employment, who are seasonal workers—the right to superannuation.
—Did they front up to the committee to put their case?
—No, they did not, Senator Sherry. Let us face it: when you look at organisations such as that, they do not want to pay wages, let alone super or anything else. So the government have got this wrong in a policy sense. The government are out, of course, to punish those people who are most vulnerable—the people who are poor. There was no evidence of additional cost to employers paying the SG quarterly. The vast majority of employers now pay the SG on a monthly basis and are happy to do so. Of course, we saw here a tawdry move by the government which was going to remove from a number of people the benefit and the right to superannuation.
Employees, by the move now to have their SG paid on a quarterly basis as opposed to an annual basis, as Senator Allison rightly said, will find that their money begins to work for them earlier and they will also find that they will be protected from loss of superannuation where an employer's business fails. The very people who should be helped by superannuation, who need to be helped, are not helped by that part of the sting in the tail, as Senator Sherry described it, where the $450 was multiplied by three and became $1,350.
We heard evidence—again, it was not modelled; it was hypothetical evidence—that someone could earn $600 one month, $600 the next month and then in the third month earn nothing at all. Because they failed to earn the $1,350 over the three-month period, they would be denied their right to superannuation, whereas currently, if that were to remain at $450 per quarter, at least for two of those quarters, they would receive nine per cent on the $600 for each of those two months, which is at least a reasonable contribution, whilst it is not the greatest contribution, towards a reasonable retirement benefit for them. Whilst it will never reach any great magnitude in terms of the superannuation that some people at the high-income end of town will receive, it nonetheless does contribute in a positive way to a retirement income policy for those people.
The most that could be said of the government's initiative here is that one must applaud the move from annual to quarterly, but one must condemn, soundly and roundly, the move from $450 per month to a quarterly figure of $1,350. I understand that an amendment will be moved which will ensure that people are not denied their reasonable and proper right to the superannuation benefits that should be made available to them and that should be protected by this government, rather than being cut to pieces because people are being made ineligible to receive superannuation under the SG.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I appreciate that time is short. In the interest of saving time, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a second reading contribution to the debate by Senator Buckland.
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
I rise to speak tonight on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No.2) 2002 and the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Amendment Bill 2002.
Both Bills were referred to the committee on the 19th June for inquiry and were to be reported by 26 June 2002.
These Bills deal with very significant concerns regarding superannuation. The Bills were referred to the committee because there was a concern that they failed to provide satisfactory solutions in the superannuation system.
Labor's concern of course is that the average Australian would receives an adequate and equitable retirement income which would to some measure lend weight to improving national savings.
The purpose of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 2002 is to implement five measures aimed at manifesting the overall attractiveness, accessibility and security of superannuation, while the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Amendment Bill 2002 aims to amend Superannuation Guarantee Charge Act 1992, in order that the Superannuation Guarantee Charge be imposed on a quarterly basis.
The majority of the committee recommends that the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Amendment Bill 2002 be agreed to however, the majority of the committee also recommends that the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 2002 not proceed in its current form.
It is vital to note that as a majority, the committee recommends that the amendments to reduce the rate of the surcharge and the changes to the SG threshold be removed from the bill because of the inequity that it will create.
The change would encourage employers to roster their casual and part-time workers to ensure they earned less than $1350 over the quarter. Under the current SG arrangements casual and part-time employees would at least get SG for 2 months out of the quarter.
Workers would essentially lose $90.00 in employer contributions for every $1000.00 they earned.
The casual and part-time workforce constitutes millions of Australians of which 72% are women.
Labor does not support this change to the minimum wage levels.
The Surcharge Rates
It was noted that the proposed reduction in the surcharge rate would result in $370 million per annum in revenue.
This will effectively provide a considerable tax cut to the highest 3 per cent of salary earners. The surcharge tax cut is a highly inequitable measure.
It is really quite incredible that the budget cuts are being made to services for some of the most underprivileged Australians and that at the same time the government is proposing a tax cut which only affects those on surcharge tax incomes of over $85,000 a year.
In other words a tax cut to the highest 3 per cent of salary earners.
The Labor Party and the committee did not support this tax cut for the wealthy.
It was deemed more suitable and more equitable by the committee for the $370 million cost of the surcharge reduction to be directed to a reduction of the superannuation fund contributions tax.
This measure would prove to be more equitable and would consequently apply to a greater number of people especially those in the lower income brackets.
It was proposed by the ALP on 16 May 2002 to introduce a fairer cut to the contributions tax for all Australians who pay the tax by 2 per cent or 3.5 per cent for those aged 40 or above.
Quarterly Payments of the SG & Monthly Reporting
Quarterly Payments of the SG & Monthly Reporting was another issue that was dealt with in the committee.
It was recommended that employers should be making the SG Contribution more frequently rather than annually; ie on a quarterly basis.
The justification for making such frequent contributions would be to primarily assist in protecting employee entitlements against business failure and in the process earn more interest in the fund because the investment was made sooner.
On the whole the more frequent the contributions will lead to more compliant small business employers, who in turn will become more compliant in making payments of the SG consistent.
The majority of businesses, particularly the larger and medium sized establishments already do make quarterly or monthly contributions but it is essential that smaller business owners become regular SG payers.
The Superannuation deputy commissioner, Mr Leo Bator, said industries including hairdressing, security firms, panel-beaters and cafes had been identified as areas of significant non-compliance for superannuation contributions.
It is necessary that this be addressed as many employees are left without their entitlements.
Deduction Limits for the Self-Employed
Increasing the deductions limits available for the self-employed would provide more opportunity for savings for retirement.
The arrangements made applicable to the deductions available to the self-employed remain different from those available to employees.
Superannuation Contributions for Children
This measure that supports better access to superannuation for children would develop an important savings culture for young people.
It should however be noted, that this scheme would have very little appeal for the lower income earners. It would in the main be accessed by the more well off in the community.
Age Test for Contributions
The proposal to increase the age for making personal contributions assists the ability of older workers to save for their retirement.
Many older workers have however, not had the advantage of a full working life under the compulsory SG system.",SENATE,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2002-06-27,"—I thank honourable senators for their participation in the debate. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 2002 and the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Amendment Bill 2002 give life to many of the superannuation policies that this government was given a mandate to deliver. A significant proportion of the policies outlined in the election document `A better superannuation system' are contained in this legislation.
Superannuation is, as we all recognise, a vital element in planning for a comfortable and secure retirement. The government is providing for a superannuation system that gives accessibility, security and safety to all Australians. These bills introduce amendments to the superannuation guarantee law so that employers will have to make superannuation guarantee contributions for their employees on at least a quarterly basis. Currently, an employer has until 28 July, following the end of the financial year, to make the required level of superannuation contributions or be subject to the superannuation guarantee charge. 
The new regime will provide much more certainty to employees. More frequent contributions will create higher superannuation benefits because of compounding interest, a lower risk of workers losing superannuation entitlements if a company falls over and more timely evidence of noncompliance making it easier for the ATO to detect those employers who are failing to pay, and will lower the risk that a member's death and disability insurance where it is provided by a super fund might lapse between annual contributions. Furthermore, the bills require employers to report to their employees the amount and destination of their SG contributions. This will encourage employees to take an interest in their superannuation and alert them to any noncompliance sooner.
As has been raised in the debate by each of the speakers, it was originally our intention in this legislation to translate the current $450 a month threshold to the equivalent amount of $1,350 per quarter. This change would have aligned the threshold with the requirement to make superannuation payments quarterly. The government believes this is a sound, commonsense measure which would ease the compliance burden being placed on employers by the introduction of a quarterly payment system. However, there have been some reservations expressed by industry groups over the past weeks, and the government will be agreeing to moves by the Senate to retain the current $450 a month threshold. I understand that a government amendment has been circulated to this effect.
There are, of course, some other measures contained in the bill and I will deal with them very briefly. Other measures both support and strengthen retirement incomes policy. Firstly, workers aged between 70 and 75 will be able to make personal undeducted contributions to superannuation. The government recognises with this measure that many people choose to work beyond 70 and should therefore be able to contribute to superannuation. Secondly, not only are we looking after older workers in our community; we are encouraging the youngest members of our society to start planning for their futures. Contributions will be able to be made by third parties on behalf of children who are under the age of 18 and who otherwise do not receive superannuation support. Thirdly, the self-employed must always be supported in their endeavours. These bills increase the fully deductible amount available to the self-employed for personal superannuation contributions made to complying superannuation funds or retirement savings accounts. Self-employed people who claim an income tax deduction for personal superannuation contributions will now have an increased limit where full deductibility is available for the first $5,000 of contributions, plus 75 per cent of the excess over $5,000, up to the taxpayer's age based deduction limit. The measures in this bill do deliver important changes to make superannuation more accessible, attractive and safe. 
Senator Sherry, in his contribution, has discussed the surcharge at length, and I think Senator Allison mentioned it. All senators are aware the government will be moving an amendment to remove the surcharge reduction from this bill. However, I remind senators that the surcharge reduction is only one of a suite of measures to make superannuation more attractive and more accessible. No doubt we will have that debate on another day. Finally, Senator Sherry raised the issue of the amendment to the act to pay 100 per cent of an eligible loss. The government will not be supporting the ALP's amendment and I wish to spend a couple of minutes on explaining why. Their proposal that the government have no discretion but to pay 100 per cent of an eligible loss clearly indicates that the ALP do not understand the basics of internationally recognised financial regulation principles and, indeed, I would say, their own history in limiting restitution to 90 per cent. Standard internationally recognised practice is to place a cap on payments or to provide a percentage based level of compensation.
The Howard government's policy in this area is consistent with international best practice. It is well understood in financial markets around the world that 100 per cent guaranteed outcomes do not encourage prudent behaviour. This is the concept of moral hazard that seems too difficult to grasp for those on the other side. Moral hazard relates to the propensity of superannuation fund trustees and other officers of financial institutions to behave in a riskier way by putting members' balances in jeopardy. It is a well-known concept in all sophisticated financial centres; it is a term of art. By placing a very generous limit which, it must be stated, I in fact determined in relation to the Commercial Nominees matter, we are taking account of the moral hazard issue. We are encouraging those operating in the financial industry to exercise due care and skill. The Labor Party appeared to understand this concept in the early 1990s. After the failure of two life insurance companies due to fraud—Occidental Life and Regal Life—the ALP Treasurer at the time, Mr Keating, issued a press release in January 1991 concerning arrangements for the protection of policyholders. Mr Keating said:
In those cases where levy support is proposed to be provided to reduce a loss that might be borne by a policyholder, the amount of payout would depend on the nature of the policy and whether the payout is as a result of the policy maturing, death or other circumstances, but would not exceed 90 per cent of the total claim under the policy.
When the ALP introduced legislation to enable compensation in relation to Occidental and Regal, the legislation limited restitution to:
(a) not more than 90% of so much of an amount due and payable by the eligible company under a life policy as is not excessive;
(b) not more than 90% of so much of an amount due and payable by the eligible company in respect of the surrender of a life policy as is not excessive;
(c) liabilities in respect of administrative expenses reasonably incurred by the eligible company in meeting liabilities covered by sub-paragraph (a) or (b) ...
I do have a responsibility to those superannuation fund members who have suffered as a result of fraud or theft by fund managers and trustees. I also have a responsibility to the Australian taxpayer and to be fiscally responsible with taxpayer funds. We simply cannot put the Australian taxpayer at such extreme risk by guaranteeing, without discretion, 100 per cent of every loss that arises through fraud or theft or by guaranteeing, without discretion, business performance. Appealing as the notion of zero risk may be, we must remember that government money is taxpayer money and that every bailout imposes financial burdens on others.
In the case of the eligible loss arrangements, compensation increases the burden on other superannuation fund members who, through no fault of their own, have to pay the assistance through an industry levy. That does not mean that the government fails to understand the great financial difficulties that arise from fraud and theft of funds. That is why the government has gone beyond the level of compensation recommended by the independent Wallis review. The government has determined recently in relation to Commercial Nominees that investors should be paid 90 per cent of their loss. This is a generous determination, particularly given that fees and charges of the replacement trustee were treated as part of the loss. Indeed, you could argue that if you paid 100 per cent of the amount lost by the fund, you could not then have any discretion to pay any more for the fees.
Labor is now proposing a policy of 100 per cent guaranteed compensation that is contrary to legislation that Labor itself put in place when it was in government. In proposing that the responsible minister should have no discretion, it is clear that that is not a policy and is certainly not a position that is supported either by international best practice or by previous precedents that I mentioned the other day in relation to HIH.
 (Senator Bartlett)—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Allison be agreed to.
Question negatived.
Senator SHERRY (Tasmania) (12.22 a.m.)—I move Labor's second reading amendment, which has been circulated:
At the end of the motion, add “whilst noting that the Liberal Government has withdrawn the proposed surcharge tax reduction for high-income earners from this bill, the Senate is of the opinion that the surcharge measure, along with the proposal to allow splitting of superannuation contributions and the closure of the public sector funds, should not proceed and that the Government should instead provide for a fairer contributions tax cut that will boost retirement incomes for millions of superannuation fund members to assist in preparing the nation for the ageing population.”
Question agreed to.
Original question, as amended, agreed to.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I am not listed on the speakers list and I am not trying to upset the flow of the chamber; I just think a quorum count at this stage of the night would be potentially difficult. I am waiting for my colleague Senator Conroy to come and make his contribution to the debate. He is on his way. We are dealing with the New Business Tax System (Consolidation) Bill (No. 1) 2002. Senator Conroy has a very impressive and extensive knowledge of this bill, and I am glad he is now here to inform us of that.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CONSOLIDATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-06-27,"—Thank you, Senator Sherry, for stepping into the breach, so to speak. The New Business Tax System (Consolidation) Bill (No. 1) 2002 arises from one of the main recommendations of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation. In essence, it seeks to implement a system which allows wholly owned groups to choose to be taxed as a single entity for income tax purposes. The existing grouping provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the intercorporate dividend rebate allow groups of companies to obtain the benefits of single entity treatment for some purposes. In other respects, however, the current income tax system continues to allow each entity to account separately for intragroup transactions and intragroup debt and equity interests. 
It is well known that this has led to some significant deficiency and integrity problems in the tax system. For example, the explanatory memorandum to this bill provides the following list of problems: compliance in general tax costs; double taxation where gains are taxed when realised and then taxed again on the disposal of equity; tax avoidance through intragroup dealings; losses cascading by the creation of multiple tax losses from the one economic loss; and value shifting to create artificial losses where there is no actual economic loss.
The Labor Party has consistently supported the principle of consolidation reform to address these problems within the existing system. We supported it at the time that the Ralph reforms were brought forward and we continue to support it today. In supporting it, our goals have always been to strengthen the integrity of the tax system and minimise compliance costs. In referring this bill to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, the opposition wished to explore the costings of the measure in further detail to see if the measure did indeed meet these goals. After all, the original costing provided in the explanatory memorandum was ludicrously lacking in detail for such a major measure. The full extent of the costing was a consolidation measure. It was expected to cost approximately $1 billion over the forward estimate period. This cost largely relates to the transitional concessions and the expectation that groups will be able to use their losses faster than is allowed under the current law.
The parliament was being asked to pass a $1 billion measure on the basis of a 50-word costing. That is $20 million a word. So I welcome the further information that has now been provided on this costing through the legislative committee process and, in passing, thank the committee for its informative report. I note that the year by year breakdown of the aggregate costing is $180 million in 2002-03, $370 million in 2003-04, $335 million in 2004-05 and $280 million in 2005-06 for a total cost to the revenue of over $1 billion over the forward estimates period. This total is fully $165 million more than the cursory estimate previously given in the explanatory memorandum. 
So yet again we see the extraordinary contrast between where the government wants to spend extra money and where it wants to extract savings. The government is happy to allow businesses an extra $165 million of tax concessions in moving to these new tax arrangements, without even blinking an eye or providing an extra word of explanation—or should that be an extra eight words of explanation, as per a previous calculation? But the government insists that it must cut disability payments in the pretence of fiscal rectitude, even though that savings measure will, at most, raise only double this amount. It is an extraordinary illustration of where this government's priorities lie in spending public money.
The Treasury information provided to the legislation committee shows that the main costs of the measure are from the faster utilisation of losses through their transfer into the consolidated groups. The opposition has been concerned about the departure from the Ralph Review of Business Taxation recommendations in the treatment of losses in this bill. In particular, we raised questions about whether these departures may have further increased the cost of the revenue beyond what was originally envisioned in the Ralph review. In this regard, we note the evidence from Treasury that the major departure from the Ralph review recommendations involves a relaxation of the entry rules for the same business test losses. A counterbalancing impact arises from the tightening of the entry rules for the continuity of ownership losses. The revenue impacts broadly cancel each other out. We welcome the assurance from the Treasury that the net impact of these departures is broadly revenue neutral. However, we expect a continuing watch to be kept on this potential threat to the revenue.
The opposition was also concerned that the measure could potentially provide a considerable tax break to companies which obtained a higher reset cost basis of the assets at the time of consolidation. The evidence provided in the hearing by the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury indicates that for this part of the measure the rules were intended to broadly replicate outcomes under the current law. Nevertheless, we remain concerned about the arrangements allowing this to be done on a subsidiary by subsidiary basis. This may leave open the possibility of conducting asset transfers in such a way as to generate artificially favourable tax outcomes. We would also expect a continuing watch to be kept on this potential threat to the revenue.
The opposition remains concerned that there appears to have been no quantitative attempt of the compliance implications of this bill with regard to both the transitional period and the longer term. I note that the transitional compliance costs are likely to have an impact through both the setting up of initial systems to consolidate taxation information for the group and the need to establish market valuations of assets on entry to consolidation. This is a very large and complex measure and represents a significant change in taxation arrangements. Under these circumstances, we would have expected more detailed quantitative work to have been done on the likely compliance impacts. I note that the explanatory memorandum admits:
14.15	Due to the magnitude of the consolidation measure, for large corporate groups, especially head companies, the start-up costs may be significant. 
Press reports suggest that these significant transitional costs could last for at least two years for these businesses. In addition, I have had repeated representations that these transitional costs will impact even more heavily on small businesses, although I recognise that this measure only affects a small proportion of the small business community. I note that these concerns about the impact on small businesses were also shared by the Taxation Institute of Australia in its submission to the legislation committee. In this regard, I commend the government's decision to begin to address these transitional costs through allowing the existing grouping provisions to operate in parallel with the consolidation regime until 1 July 2002. This extension to the grouping provisions will provide necessary and reasonable relief to small businesses in coping with this change, and we support it primarily on that basis. However, we urge the government to take the necessary precautions to ensure that the extension does not simply provide an extra year for larger businesses to arrange their losses in such a way as to generate artificially favourable tax outcomes on entry into consolidations. Given the government's proven form in imposing horrendous compliance burdens on business through its BAS debacle, we will be watching the compliance costs during the implementation of this measure very carefully indeed.
With regard to the long-term impacts of this measure to the revenue, we note the Treasury's view that the revenue cost from the consolidation of losses is expected to decline over time as the existing fall of carry-forward losses in exhausted. In contrast, the revenue gains from consolidation and related integrity measures which address the creation of artificial and duplication losses through intergroup dealings are expected to increase over time, in line with growth in the economy.
 The opposition would have preferred to have seen a quantitative forward projection of the costings to allow the parliament to judge the full impact of this measure on the revenue over time. We recognise that the principle underlying the measure is a long-term positive reform to the business tax system and that it is likely to deliver dynamic gains to the economy in the long term. We also recognise that not all of the elements of the Ralph review reforms will be revenue neutral in and of themselves, but it is not possible to make a fully informed judgment about any proposed trade-offs without full quantitative assessment of costs over time.
That brings me to the vexed question of the true state of the balance sheet on the overall Ralph business tax package. It is well known that the Labor Party has long supported genuine business tax reform in this country, even during times when the government cravenly backs away from it. Consolidation was a key part of the package of business tax reforms agreed between the then shadow Treasurer and the then and now Treasurer—some things do not change—in November 1999. Labor made it clear at the time that our support for the package was unequivocally based on the condition that it was revenue neutral. As the Leader of the Opposition stated in his letter to the Treasurer:
... Labor is willing to pass the business tax package if it pays for itself. Labor will hold the Government to its promise on revenue neutrality. We cannot accept a reduction in business taxation at the expense of individuals and families who will be bearing the brunt of a GST, nor the use of the Budget surplus to fund business tax reforms.
We stand by these principles and will apply them to the overall package of business tax reform as it is brought forward by the government.
So it seems a straightforward question then to ask: what is the current state of the balance sheet on business tax reform? The shadow Treasurer recently asked the Treasurer this question in the House during the debate on this legislation. There was no answer. I asked the Treasury the same question during the recent budget estimates hearing. Again, there was no answer. So I am taking the opportunity once again to ask the government in this chamber to release the detailed costings on the progress of the overall business tax reform package as soon as possible. Stop making excuses that you do not know what to include and what not to include. Start with the specific measures committed to by the Treasurer in his two-stage response to the Ralph report in 1999, and give us an up-to-date costing on those. Then add in separately any extra measures since then. Release the lot, and make sure when you do so that these costings include not only the impact of any general taxation measures but also the myriad special concessions offered to particular companies and projects. It is time for some transparency on business tax reform. If, as we suspect, the tax concessions for business have been delivered rather faster than the measures designed to ensure that they pay their fair share of tax, then the Australian people have a right to know.
I now turn to some matters of process with regard to how this consolidation measure has been submitted to parliament. We have been waiting a long time for this reform to take shape. After all, it was announced with great fanfare as part of a new tax system package back in August 1998, with a proposed start date of July 2000. By the time of the announcement of the results of the Ralph Review of Business Taxation in September 1999, it had already been deferred, with the promise being given instead that it would come into effect in July 2001. Then, come March 2001, we heard from the Treasurer that it had been deferred yet again, this time to start in July 2002.
I am a little surprised that, despite having the benefit of a gestation period of 3½ years, the government has only managed to introduce this bill in the parliament a matter of six weeks before it is due to come into effect. Of course, this is wholly consistent with the contempt with which the government is now accustomed to treating the parliament—six weeks for the parliament to scrutinise nearly 200 pages of legislation which is of fundamental importance to the future of business tax reform in this country. When you get to the fine print, the legislative timetable actually gets more absurd, not less. The legislation committee heard that the full detail of this measure will require a further two tranches of legislation to be presented to parliament. For example, critical rules on the valuation of assets on the formation of a consolidated group are not contained in this bill and will instead be contained in subsequent legislation.
I understand that the second tranche of legislation on this measure was introduced in the parliament this morning, and that it represents a further 300 pages of legislation. So perhaps the parliament should have been grateful to have had six weeks to review the first tranche. After all, we have been presented with only a single day to review the second tranche. Of course, the third tranche is yet to come.
This all seems eerily familiar to me. This seems awfully like another `Ralphing' in the offing. After all, at the time of the Ralph review, Labor indicated that it would support the package, with the condition that the measures, not then as yet before the parliament, particularly the revenue raising measures, would be implemented as stated and in full. The Labor Party was concerned that any slippage on these measures in the future could expose the government in terms of its commitment to maintaining the integrity of the tax system.
To be charitable, merely taking a further 2½ years to deliver on the consolidation as part of the agreement probably does not constitute real slippage by the government's usual standards in business tax reform. After all, some of the other measures have never materialised at all. But you can understand, Madam Acting Deputy President, why we would baulk at the suggestion that we should pass this bill now and that we should accept the subsequent bills on an act of faith.
We reiterate our in-principle support for this bill. We also reiterate our support for the proposed starting date of 1 July 2002. However, we cannot support the passage of this bill until such time as the subsequent bills are also available for scrutiny in the Senate. We have heard no evidence as to why a proper scrutiny of the subsequent bills, in conjunction with this bill, should in any way affect the proposed start date of 1 July 2002. Accordingly, I move:
Omit all words after “That”, substitute “further consideration of the bill be postponed until an order of the day for the second reading of bills determined by the Senate to be associated with the bill is called on”. ",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CONSOLIDATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-06-27,"—The New Business Tax System (Consolidation) Bill (No. 1) 2002 is part of the new tax system, and it has its origins in the August 1998 statement and the Ralph report which accompanied it. August 1998 is pretty well four years ago, and the Ralph report did indicate that a major reason for the proposed changes was the removal of high tax compliance costs where each member of a group has to individually comply with tax laws while also passing losses and profits between members of the group of commonly owned companies. It was also indicated that a consolidation regime would allow members of the consolidated group greater flexibility in the way they could operate compared to the current grouping rules.
Missing from that brief description is a major consequence of the consolidation measures; that is, by allowing greater flexibility as regards the tax affairs of entities within a group—and that is an option; you are not required to become a group—and freeing it up, you actually free up the market somewhat and you make available corporate entities which can move ownership, hopefully into hands that can better manage those companies and operations. So it is a beneficial activity from a market point of view.
In the inquiry that Senator Conroy and I participated in, the Treasury officials acknowledged that as a significant benefit of this bill; however, they could not quantify the effects of it in terms of additional revenue or productivity or economic growth or any other measure that you might use. However, I concur with them: I think the result would be a positive for the market. It is one of the reasons that the Labor Party and the Democrats supported the government's initiative and the Ralph recommendations right from the start.
The question of losses, either grouped or ungrouped, is a difficult one to assess. Treasury provided us with figures in their evidence that there are about $80 billion worth of losses in the market. I am not quite sure how they arrived at that figure; I assumed they had gone along to the Australian Taxation Office and asked it to consolidate the accounts and tell them what was there. But perhaps they have other methods. I have no reason to doubt it. The question, to which no-one really knows the answer, is: how much of that $80 billion is clogged up? You will always have a natural level of losses which must exist within the corporate world but the difference between what I would call the natural level and that $80 billion is an amount which acts as a market impediment—it is a structural impediment to the full operation of the market. It is that which represents the danger to revenue. Losses in companies eventually wash through. They are set against revenue or in some way utilised over time so once again you would be dealing with a timing effect.
Let us assume for argument's sake that, of the $80 billion, $20 billion was the overhang that would be sorted out by a more fluid and flexible consolidations regime. If that $20 billion hit you in year one it would pretty well wipe out most of the corporate revenue for that year and would be a very difficult matter for the government to deal with. Treasury have indicated that their own calculations of the revenue cost of an accelerated utilisation of those losses—because that is what is going to happen—is around $1 billion. I have no idea how you would know that, and both Treasury and parliament have experience with being wildly wrong on those sorts of estimates—that is not a criticism; it is just an incredibly difficult exercise. So the parliament and the government would take some risk with these issues; however, all the parties that have reviewed this do believe that sort of risk is worth taking for market activity purposes.
So you then move on to the question that Senator Conroy posed in his speech, and that was the hook that the whole business review hung on—the hook of revenue neutrality. I always think the idea of revenue neutrality in a particular budgeting period is a bit overstated because quite often there are lagged effects as a result of market integrity or taxation integrity efforts. Whilst those effects may not be revenue neutral in the budgetary period available for examination over time, the benefits are greater than the front end costs. However, Senator Conroy does make the point that a $1 billion hit over a budgetary period, if expensed as a result of savings made in welfare, education or social costs, makes parties on this side of the benches a little nervous, frankly, especially when the government is making a great play on having a go at people in the disability sector or the lower income sector.
However, having said that, you have to address as a parliament the issues of taxation and market integrity. If you just sat with it, those losses would still be in there as a kind of treacle in the machinery of corporate taxation structures. I retain the view, and I gather from Senator Conroy's remarks that he retains the view, and our parties retain the view that this bill is an appropriate instrument even given the risks that we face. If there is that overall approach then the next issue is one of process and whether there are greater risks facing us with the arrival of two further major consequential pieces of legislation which attach to this. I do not share Senator Conroy's criticism of it taking a few years to get to this stage. I simply think that the consultation embarked upon was probably worthwhile. I do not really criticise the Minister for Revenue for producing it six weeks ago. What I am nervous about is having my face pushed against the windowpane of 30 June, when I will be quite happy to retain the start-up date of 1 July 2002 but I would need to be assured as to the legislation that is going to come with or follow this bill.
This bill does allow wholly owned groups to choose to be taxed as a single entity for income tax purposes. It is painted as likely to be first utilised to effect by the bigger end of town. I do not think that is a negative. That is a market reality. But it is certainly open to be used productively in the smaller business sector, although I note that the Digest does point out that the Institute of Chartered Accountants is concerned that smaller businesses may struggle a bit with whether they should take it up or not and what the likely cost to them would be. The measure does have the claimed purpose of reducing compliance costs and strengthening the integrity of the tax system, and I think that claimed benefit is true. I am not so sure that the estimated benefits for small and medium sized businesses are more marginal. My own experience of the sector is they have commensurate losses locked up in their own structures, so I would be interested to see if that prognosis turns out to be true.
Consolidation will strengthen the integrity of the tax system by reducing tax avoidance through intergroup dealings, through attacking loss cascading through the creation of multiple tax losses where there is only one economic loss and through value shifting to create artificial losses where there were no economic losses. And this consolidation measure is a business and productivity incentive. I think the productivity measures are very difficult to estimate, so I am really guided by the expectation rather than any modelling of that sort. I wish to hear what the minister has to say about the process. I am very alert to the lobbying we have received from some pretty high-powered people, which I am sure we have all been subjected to. Not you, Senator Conroy?
—We are at the bottom of the food chain!
—I see. Okay—well, that your colleagues in the other place might have been subjected to. It is a measure which obviously matters a great deal to certain businesses and business groupings and they would feel uncertain about committing money now, even with the warm noises that I hope I am making about my attitude to the bills and the warm noises that I thought I heard Senator Conroy make on behalf of the ALP. I think it highly unlikely, Minister, that if the bills were delayed until the complete package was available, you would find anyone changing direction—highly unlikely. I think the previous commitments on the record by me on behalf of the Australian Democrats three years ago following the business review taxation inquiry and throughout the process of considering what can be broadly described as the Ralph business review process make it so unlikely that we will make a U-turn as for me virtually to give a guarantee on the matter. But there is this issue of do you tick off something when you have not seen the other legislation?
I do not think I can say much more than that. You are caught, Minister, with a financial year end when you do not have all your ducks in a row: all three pieces of your legislation all prepared, all reviewed by committees and all ready to rock and roll. So I would be very interested to hear your response. ",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CONSOLIDATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2002-06-27,"—I am very grateful for the warm noises that I have heard from senators. I will concentrate just on the process argument because it obviously is of significance to business. There is very strong business support for the consolidation measures due to the significant ongoing compliance cost savings from removing existing tax consequences for intragroup transactions. We all know, and I think it has been very well canvassed, the benefits to business. I think the real issue here is that the first tranche of the legislation has been available, at least the explanatory memorandum, and the consultations started back in February, so this has really been out there in the public domain and has been the subject of almost unprecedented public consultation.
Because of the hour I will not go on about it but it is very important to say that, following the release of the February draft, public feedback sessions were held nationally by the ATO, 23 sessions were held in the CDB and regional areas, 468 members of the public participated, 47 written submissions on the legislation were received, and nine walk-through sessions have been conducted by the ATO in major capital cities and regional locations. These have attracted an attendance of in excess of 1,000 members of the public. This legislation is very well understood and well accepted in the business community. The whole purpose of this consultation and transparency—if I can say through you, Madam Acting President, to Senators Murray and Conroy—has been to ensure the smoothest possible implementation of the measures by business. It is arguably the most important business tax reform measure since probably the 1970s, and to hold it up where there is no fundamental opposition to the measure itself but for some other reasons or concerns about process is disappointing. 
A prime ingredient to ensure a smooth implementation is certainty. No doubt they are the representations that you are referring to, Senator Murray—that business wants certainty. They will all be getting on with entering into contractual arrangements from 1 July, and to be put in a position of some uncertainty as to whether the consolidation rules affect these transactions I think will significantly impact on their certainty in negotiating these matters. It is a very risky decision, and very significant, to delay passage of the bill.
The second tranche of the consolidation is included with a number of other measures, including the introduction of the general value shifting regime and demerger tax relief measures. There are concerns about linking the passage of the New Business Tax System (Consolidation) Bill (No. 1) 2002 to a number of further bills which may include other important tax measures and even further uncertainty.
I will say in conclusion that, while both Labor and the Democrats obviously do support the principle of consolidation—and that is welcome because it will minimise compliance costs and strengthen integrity—I am sure the business community might think that these words ring a bit hollow if the opposition parties are intent on delaying this measure for what I would say is no good reason. It is very difficult to have it both ways—to support the measure in principle but to prevent it in practice—particularly when business is way ahead of us here. Business has had the legislation since February. It is understood well; it is wanted; it has been waited for and, in my submission, there is no good reason to hold it up.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CONSOLIDATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-06-27,"—by leave—I appreciate that the government has attempted to address the concerns by circulating its proposed amendment which addresses the question of assent and when it would be granted. I appreciate that genuine offer by the government. The difference between the government's amendment and our amendment is simply this: in light of the extra information from the next bill and subsequent bills, if we need to amend the existing bill, we are unable to do so because it will already have been passed and we cannot revisit it. The substantive difference between how we deal with it is that if, in the view of the parliament, we need to amend the first bill, it has already gone. That is what will happen if we go with the government's amendment as opposed to Labor's amendment, which allows us the flexibility to perhaps deal with an issue that arises. If we could find a more satisfactory way, we would happily do it. 
We have consulted with the Clerk's office about trying to find the best possible way to give us the maximum flexibility. It has been indicated that this is the best way we can come up with. If Senator Murray has an alternative, I would happily consider it on behalf of the opposition. Again, I appreciate the government's attempt to address this as well. It is really just a question of the process rather than the substance of the debate. I will sit down and maybe Senator Murray might want to seek leave to make a statement as well.",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (CONSOLIDATION) BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,45,1,speech

If the consequent legislation, or part of it, directly relates to this bill, I would have thought it falls into the area of relevance. The Clerk is there and he knows far more about process than I will ever know but, if that were possible, it would satisfy Senator Conroy's approach.

The rules are very much in this bill, but how the formation case proceeds is in the next bill.

Unfortunately, we have had written binding offers previously, which Senator Murray has also been given. I joked with him in the Senate hearing of the committee that he had been given a binding offer about entity taxation on two separate occasions and we are yet to see any legislation.

Firstly, I gain some comfort by the government's own proposed amendment because that delays the assent until one of the other two bills is dealt with.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-06-27,"—Given the time of day, I am happy to incorporate my remarks.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Labor supports the principle that the tax system should be simple to apply, consistent with fairness and other objectives.
These simplified imputation system bills are designed to make the franking of tax paid on dividends to shareholders less complex. Labor's introduction of a franked dividends system during our last period in government was a major reform that helped to extend ownership of shares to a wider section of Australian society.
These Bills make some incremental improvements to the Labor designed system and we support them.
There are four major elements to the Bills:
·	the flexible franking and new anti-streaming rule;
·	permission for private companies to frank retrospectively;
·	the simpler franking account structure; and
·	consistent treatment of franked dividends received by entities.
The proposed new anti-streaming rule requires distributions of dividends made within any “franking period” (generally six months) to be franked “to the same extent”; and that the ATO be notified if the level of franking varies between franking periods by more than 20%.
The permission for private companies to frank retrospectively, allows companies to frank dividends up to four months after the declaration date. This means they will not have to finalise their franking amount before they can confirm their financial position.
The simpler franking account structure provisions should make it easier to accommodate changes in the company tax rate and remove the need to maintain different classes of franking account. This appears to be a genuine simplification.
The consistent treatment of franked dividends received by entities removes the distinction between individuals and other entities, which apply a `gross-up and credit' imputation, and companies, which receive an intercorporate dividend rebate for franked dividends. This should provide greater integrity and consistency as well as simplifying the imputation system.
Labor supports the Bills.

Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No 4) is made up of four distinct schedules.
The first two schedules are not controversial.
Schedule 1 to the Bill tightens some of the provisions of the thin capitalisation regime.
The Bill redefines the exemption from the thin capitalisation regime for companies with minor overseas operations.
It ensures that interest-free loans are considered as equity for the purposes of the regime.
At the same time, the Bill excludes some private assets and liabilities from thin capitalisation rules.
Labor supports this measure.
Schedule 2 to the Bill contains the trust to company roll-over provisions.
These provisions provide a concession on capital gains tax as it would apply to trusts which restructure as companies, so that where there is no change in the beneficial ownership structure of the trust through the restructure into a company, the transfer can be made without any capital gains tax impact.
Labor will not oppose this measure.
The Proposal in Schedule 3 to give temporary residents of Australia a tax exemption on foreign sourced income is extraordinary.
Labor opposes this provision.
If this becomes law, this would mean that temporary residents in Australia pay no Australian tax on most foreign-source income and capital gains, and their banks would be exempt from paying withholding tax on residents' interest payments on overseas borrowings.
The cost of this tax cut would be $200 million over four years.
We have a serious concern about the distributional effects of this tax cut.
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has already said that this measure is designed to attract “key personnel” for Australian companies.
In other words, it is a tax cut for corporate high fliers.
The foreign income tax cut is totally regressive.
Labor opposes the provision.
I foreshadow that Labor will be moving an amendment to remove this regressive tax cut from the Bill.
Finally, let me come to Schedule 4 of the Bill.
The schedule provides for legislative caps on the effective life of assets used for gas transmission and distribution, oil and gas production companies and companies operating aeroplanes and helicopters.
The Commissioner of Taxation has announced his determination on the effective life of a number of asset types; aeroplanes; helicopters; gas transmission and distribution assets; and oil and gas production assets, including offshore oil and gas platforms.
The provisions in the Bill would legislate a form of accelerated depreciation—in other words, would legislate a statutory cap on the effective life of these assets.
The cost to revenue of these caps is very significant, $1.9 billion over ten years.
Of course Labor does not oppose a legislative override of the Commissioner's ruling on effective life in principle.
However, the Senate needs to assess this very significant expenditure proposal carefully against other priorities.
As part of business tax reform, a whole raft of accelerated depreciation provisions for particular sectors, along with a range of other sectoral subsidies, were replaced by a lower corporate tax rate across the board.
A central part of that trade-off was that the old underlying depreciation schedules would be reviewed by the Commissioner of Taxation on an “effective life” basis.
As the Ralph Report said:
The accelerated depreciation/company tax rate reduction trade-off is the key issue.
Labor supported this sound reform.
We argue that investment should be driven by economic return, not tax advantage.
We are pro-market, not pro- any particular business interest.
It is a good reform and we supported it.
Frankly, these effective life caps have finally killed off the idea that the Ralph reforms would be revenue neutral.
Some of those companies that will benefit from this Bill are flagrantly double dipping.
Some of those companies told the Government, the Opposition, and indeed through the Business Coalition for Tax Reform they told the whole country that they supported a cut in the corporate tax rate to be funded by getting rid of accelerated depreciation.
Well here we are, just a few years later, and who would have thought it. Capital-intensive companies are walking around these corridors pleading for accelerated depreciation to be reinstated under the new badge of effective life caps and threatening to quit the country if they don't get their way.
There is a serious issue here about corporate responsibility.
The Government loves to apply mutual obligation to the poor and the weak.
This is a massive tax expenditure on the rich and the strong, and it comes with no strings attached.
A huge corporate subsidy like this should be conditional upon the corporations that benefit from it.
There should be commitments to jobs, to training, to apprenticeships.
Corporations must accept the responsibilities that come with a huge subsidy of this kind.
In conclusion, the Opposition is not opposed to the thin capitalisation provisions and the trust to company roll-over provisions of Schedule 1 and 2 of this Bill.
With regard to the effective life caps, I register the Opposition's serious misgivings about the process that the Government has followed and the substantive outcome that the Government has arrived at.
However it is not possible to unpick the provisions of the Bill and on balance the package is important to the national interest.
However the Opposition is completely opposed to the Government's $50 million tax cut for rich foreigners.
We propose an amendment in the Senate to oppose that tax cut.
Question agreed to.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-06-27,"—I am concerned about this scheme. It simply goes on and on. It is interesting to see that for the first time the Labor Party is flagging an amendment to chide the government over not doing more about renewable electricity generation as a viable alternative. That is a remarkable breakthrough. Not only did the mover of that amendment, Senator O'Brien, become very disparaging about the Sun Fund Bill, which I put before this parliament five years ago—which was to give landowners an option so that they could get 10 years of the diesel fuel rebate up front in order to have the capital to put in renewable energy such as solar and wind power—but Labor was the prime agent in blocking that measure then. So it is great that Senator O'Brien is now catching up and is beginning to see that this is the century of renewable electricity generation and that the fossil fuel century has ended. The Labor Party is welcomed into the new age.
I also want to mention Senator Winston Crane—he is not here at the moment—who was very much taken by the Sun Fund Bill and, I think, has had something to do with the fact that the government has made some steps toward accepting that there are better alternatives to burning fossil fuel. We still have, in this legislation, government subsidy for the burning of fossil fuels and, therefore, the promotion of greenhouse gas escaping into the atmosphere. Under this government, Australians are the worst per capita greenhouse gas polluters on the face of the planet. That is a terrible record. Instead of this bill, we ought to be having comprehensive legislation to promote energy renewables and energy efficiency in this country. That is what we should be debating tonight.
Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, you will remember that three days ago I moved and the Senate adopted an order for the government to produce a number of documents which would allow us to chart the nation's progress in greenhouse gas production and global warming. So far as I know, the government has not even had the courtesy to produce those documents or a statement to the Senate. After some effort, I have had one given to me by the minister and it is a curt and peremptory dismissal of a request for those documents. I would have expected a bit of courtesy and a little bit of information from the office of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. If the documents are not ready, I would have expected an offer for a briefing on where we are at, but there was none of that. Rather, there was a very curt dismissal, a rude rebuff to the Senate's order—in fact, no compliance at all—and a failure by the government to recognise that this is a serious matter, of great concern to many constituents. The government needs to keep the Senate and the country much better acquainted with its progress or lack of progress as we move towards the 10-year review of the Rio conference to be held at Johannesburg the month after next. I have a second reading amendment which has been circulated and I move:
Omit all words after “That”, substitute “further consideration of the bill be an order of the day for the day after the order of the Senate of 26 June 2002 for the production of environment and greenhouse gas emissions documents is complied with”.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL FUEL REBATE SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1,speech
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-06-27,"—I would like to respond to Senator Brown's amendment and throw myself at his mercy because it is true that I missed the fact that the Senate had passed an order that certain documents be tabled no later than 2 p.m. this day. 
—It's already 2 a.m. the next morning. You're 12 hours late, Senator Hill.
—Not only were the documents not tabled but an explanation was not given to the Senate within that time frame explaining the default, Senator Faulkner. I did think that Senator Brown was a touch unfair, however, when he characterised what followed from the grievous failure to comply with the Senate's requirement—that was, when he brought it to my attention, I acted promptly and sought advice from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage on how this failure to comply could have occurred. What I was told—I have informed Senator Brown of this and have received more detail as a result of following up further discussions he and I have had—is that each of the four documents, which are basically this year's reports on a series of different things, are still in draft form. They are expected to be completed before the parliament resumes. I am told by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage that they will therefore be available for tabling on the first day of sitting in the next session.
It is not normal practice of course—and I think Senator Brown would accept that—to table documents whilst they are still in draft form and have not yet been approved by the minister. But as I said to Senator Brown, as I understand it, each of them will be made public in any event, so if they are made public in the meantime, obviously we could make an effort to specifically bring them to Senator Brown's attention. But certainly I am instructed that I can give the undertaking that they will be available for tabling on the first day of sitting in the next session. I hope in those circumstances Senator Brown might be prepared to accept that as a reasonable outcome, notwithstanding the fact that we should have made such a statement before 2 p.m. this day.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL FUEL REBATE SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-06-27,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I have a not insubstantial contribution to make to the debate on the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme Amendment Bill 2002, but I am proposing to incorporate it, if that is acceptable. There are some short points that I will make in addition to that.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Senator O'Brien, you will need to seek leave to incorporate that.
—I seek leave to incorporate a contribution and I will add to it now.
—Leave is granted.
—Thank you, Senator Faulkner. I was hopeful I would have your support.
—I am sure you will get leave, Senator O'Brien.
—If Senator Faulkner wants me to do more than incorporate my speech, I am happy to do that as well.
—Leave is not granted if you do any more than incorporate.
—I thought that might be the case, so let's get on with it.
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
This bill seeks to amend both the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 to extend the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme to operators of retail and hospitality businesses in remote areas who use diesel fuel to generate electricity for their own use.
While the Opposition will not oppose this Bill, I plan to move a second reading amendment.
Because the rebate will only apply to businesses where there is no ready access to a commercial supply of electricity, it will principally benefit businesses in remote areas of Australia. Typically, businesses that will benefit from this rebate include caravan parks, tourist resorts and roadhouses.
If a drafting change to the Explanatory Memorandum is undertaken, it will indicate that to be eligible for a rebate the electricity generated by the fuel must be used at premises where a retail or hospitality business is carried on.
The fuel does not need to be used at the premises, however, it must be used nearby. In other words, the diesel generator does not need to be physically located on the premises of the business seeking a rebate.
This Government made an election commitment to this initiative and as such we will not oppose this Bill.
Madam President
The Legislation states that the level of rebate is to be at the same rate as if the diesel fuel had been used in primary production.
In the Second Reading Speech, the Minister advised that the rate is currently equal to the full amount of excise paid on the fuel, 38.143 cents per litre.
The Government has estimated that the introduction of this Bill will result in additional expenditure of approximately $20 million per year.
At first glance this may not appear to be much in the context of the Federal budget. However, it represents more than 52 million litres of diesel fuel per year.
52 million litres of diesel fuel, simply to get the Member for Kalgoorlie over the line.
It is hard to believe that this Government is giving up on developing renewable remote power generation alternatives such as photovoltaic arrays, wind turbines and hydro units.
It is shameful that this Government is happy to support the burning of 52 million litres of diesel fuel each year without investigating alternate energy sources.
Establishing renewable sources provides a long-term solution. They can continue to provide the energy year after year. They will overcome the need to burn 52 million litres of diesel fuel each year, year in and year out.
Renewable sources will also decrease the emission of greenhouse gases. Although not very large in the overall scheme, surely this is an opportunity to demonstrate that the Australian Government is committed to reducing the increase in greenhouse gas emissions.
Madam President
It is interesting to note that the extension of this rebate is only to retail and hospitality businesses. Why is it for these businesses and not all businesses in remote locations that have no access to a commercial supply of electricity?
Why is it not extended to isolated indigenous communities? Why is it not extended to remote manufacturing and construction industries? The Government gives no explanation for this.
It is yet another example of this government providing funds to mates, continuing their habit of dishing out unfocussed largess on the pretence of supporting `problem' regions or communities. This only creates busy but unfocussed local action, removes local control and stifles enterprising initiative.
When will the Government learn that it is its responsibility to support the process of being enterprising in regions and stop reinforcing a culture of dependency on Government handouts?
Providing the infrastructure to all in remote locations within Australia is a legitimate role of Government. It supports the process of being enterprising. It enables businesses and communities to take the initiative to develop their own solutions.
It enables communities to generate and implement new ideas.
Increased community capacity will encourage effective local leadership that can galvanise the enterprising strength of the local community from within.
It would bring the community together and make it worthwhile for the members of the community to provide their own social capital. It will increase trust in the communities. It will boost cooperative action and innovative outcomes.
It would assist in building vital networks and partnerships, in and between regional communities. By bringing people together it will enhance cooperation and the building of strong informal and formal networks and partnerships.
Instead this Government has continued their long standing tradition of providing largess to a few and dividing communities, partnerships and regions.
All this does is reinforce a culture of dependency on Government handouts.
Madam President
In a little cheapjack deal with the Democrats to get the GST through the Senate, the Howard-Costello-Anderson government introduced the Diesel and Alternate Fuel Grants Scheme and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme in June 1999.
The Democrats, in a vain attempt to restore a modicum of credibility after their disastrous marriage of convenience over the GST, pushed the Government to include sunset clauses in each of these bills. The sunset date was set at 30 June 2002.
30 June 2002 is fast approaching. The Government has done nothing about developing an alternative to these two schemes. As a consequence, we reluctantly agreed to an amendment to these schemes to extend the sunset date out to 30 June 2003.
The Deputy Prime Minister's alternative to these two schemes is an Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. So far neither we nor anyone else has seen what this Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme is going to look like.
We are eagerly awaiting the release of information about the new scheme.
Everyone in the transport industry is eagerly awaiting the release of information about the scheme.
So desperate was the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to control the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme that he wrote to the Prime Minister identifying the Department of Transport and Regional Services as the lead agency for the development of the scheme, and then, only days later, as the Acting Prime Minister he wrote back to himself confirming that his Department would be the lead agency.
If he were so keen to be in charge of the process, then you would think he would be doing something about it. What has been done so far? Nothing.
At the time of the original legislation the Howard Government said that the new scheme would maintain the equivalent benefits of the old ones. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson also said that the new scheme would “provide active encouragement for the move to the use of cleaner fuels.”
The Road Transport Industry needs to know the nature of the new Energy Credit Scheme as it is likely to impact directly on operating costs, decisions about capital investment, business expansion, markets and technological choices for their businesses and families.
I trust that the Government will give these interested Australians the opportunity to fully discuss the proposed Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme prior to the sunset of the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme.
Fuel Taxation Inquiry
Although you wouldn't know it from the Treasurer's less than enthusiastic launch of the Fuel Taxation Inquiry, many of the issues I have covered today have been addressed by the “Trebeck” report.
The Fuel Taxation Inquiry made a number of recommendations that establish a framework for the establishment of the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme.
It outlined design principles for the scheme including the introduction of a Business Fuel Credit Scheme for all businesses, not just those that are the favourite of the day of the Coalition Government.
It recommended that the Business Fuel Credit Scheme should replace the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, and it recommended mechanisms to develop the environmental component of the proposed scheme.
The Fuel Taxation Inquiry therefore provides the framework for this Government to implement its commitment to a Fuel Grants (Credits) Scheme. It has chosen to completely ignore the recommendations of the Inquiry.
It makes you wonder why the Inquiry was established at all.
Why did the Government spend almost four million dollars of tax-payer's money for an inquiry that they always intended to ignore?
Why did the Government invite almost 300 Australian organisations, businesses and individuals to prepare detailed and costly submissions to this Inquiry?
The Government robbed them blind.
The Government has set in train a process that has raised expectations. The response from industry clearly indicates that this issue is of the utmost importance to them.
This Government has dudded them.
It is clear that you called the Fuel Taxation Inquiry for cynical election purposes with no intention of a genuine review of fuel taxation issues.
In doing so this Government has plainly misled the Australian community.
—The opposition is not opposing this legislation. In relation to it, we say that the government ought to be condemned for its failure to deliver on its commitment to develop an energy grants credits scheme to replace both the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme and the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme; its failure to prioritise support for the accelerated take-up of renewable electricity generation as a viable alternative to diesel rather than extend the diesel rebate that would lead to long-term greenhouse gas reductions; and for conducting a fuel tax inquiry only for cynical and expensive election purposes, with no intention of a genuine review of fuel taxation issues. I will move the opposition's second reading amendment at the appropriate time.
—You will have to foreshadow it because Senator Brown already has an amendment before the chair.
—I will foreshadow that. In relation to Senator Brown's second reading amendment, I can indicate that the opposition hears what Senator Hill says in terms of giving an unequivocal undertaking that the return to order will be complied with on the next day of sitting. The opposition does not propose to adjourn the debate on this bill until that time, given that undertaking, and we will therefore not support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL FUEL REBATE SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-06-27,"—I have a very long and detailed second reading contribution and, in the interests of getting to bed before dawn, I seek leave to incorporate it. But I want to quickly indicate that the Democrats are extremely disappointed that we are having to deal with the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme Amendment Bill 2002. We will oppose it in its entirety. We will be supporting Senator Brown's second reading amendment, because this is not good for the environment and it is not good for the future of renewable energy or alternative fuels.
 (Senator Ferguson)—Senator Allison, do I understand that you are seeking leave to incorporate your speech?
—Yes, I am.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme Amendment Bill 2002 seeks to extend the diesel rebate scheme to include power generation by retail/hospitality businesses that do not have access to mains electricity. The Government says the bill is needed, particularly for remote tourism operators, although no evidence been provided to support this claim. Absolutely none. And the reason why no evidence has been provided is because there is none. We hear that the reason this bill came about is because of the pre-election campaigning of a roadhouse owner in WA. An outstanding example of pork barrelling, which will cost Australians $20 million per year. $20 million, which I'm sure most Australians could suggest a number of better uses for. Like more funding for education or health.
As my initial comments indicate, the Australian Democrats are extremely disappointed by the presentation of this bill. Despite what the Government says, this bill will result in the increased use of diesel fuel (adding to Australia's already woeful level of greenhouse gas emissions). It will further mean that there will be no incentive for the remote retail and hospitality businesses to switch to cleaner renewable or alternative fuel systems. We are informed that the payback renewable remote area power systems are only marginally cost effective now and that a rebate on diesel would effectively mean that there would be little if no price differential between diesel and LPG.
Now the Government, if it were genuinely committed to reducing the use of diesel fuel in remote communities, would be concerned that the extension of the diesel fuel rebate to remote retail and hospitality businesses will adversely affect the operation of their Renewable Remote Power Generation Program (RRPGP). This is a program which the Democrats negotiated in good faith with the Government and which is so far considerably underspent.
Most businesses, and this is understandable given their short term prerogatives, will not be persuaded to outlay considerable sums on a new renewable remote power system when diesel is going to be so cheap after this bill is passed. Why, for instance, would a roadhouse pay $180-200,000 for a 12-14kW PV system if diesel is going to be 38 cents per litre cheaper, and when the relative payback period for the new investment will now be that much longer? The low cost of diesel is already one of the main reasons that hybrid renewable or gas systems have not been taken up to the extent that we might have hoped.
The Australian Greenhouse Office, the Commonwealth's lead agency for dealing with greenhouse matters, agrees. In its submission to the inquiry on this bill, it stated that:
Reducing the effective price of diesel by 38.143 cents per litre for power generation by small retail/hospitality business may result in reducing the incentive for a small segment of consumers to take up renewable energy and alternative fuel opportunities, to lower greenhouse gas emissions. This is because the measure will increase the relative payback period for affected projects to recover the up-front capital cost of such new investment.
They further argued that:
The AGO estimates that the extension of the Diesel Fuel Rebate to small retail/hospitality businesses could reduce the potential target market for the Commonwealth Renewable Remote Power Generation Program by up to 21 million litres, or about 4% of total diesel fuel consumed, although accurate data on the diesel fuel used by these businesses is not available.
I found it very interesting that when my staff contacted those officers responsible for the delivery of the Remote Power Generation Program (RRPGP) in State Sustainable Energy Authorities none of them had been consulted about the bill by the Federal Government despite the fact that this bill will impact on their programs. One of the agencies heard word of the bill through a roadhouse owner who was interested in moving from a diesel only generator to a hybrid remote area power station with renewables until he heard that this bill was on the cards. Unfortunately, for this agency, roadhouses were to be their next target group under the RRPGP program.
How this Government can support this bill when it directly conflicts with its policy objective under the RRPGP program is beyond me. This policy objective, which the Government obviously needs reminding of, is “... to increase the uptake of renewable energy technologies in remote areas of Australia, which will:
1.	help in providing an effective electricity supply to remote users;
2.	assist the development of the Australian renewable energy industry;
3.	help meet the energy infrastructure needs of indigenous communities; and
4.	lead to long term greenhouse gas reductions.”
It is important to recognise that it is not just renewables like wind and solar that will be affected.
This bill will also adversely affect the uptake of combined diesel/LPG systems that like the hybrid renewable systems produce less greenhouse emissions and other air pollutants.
An example is the combined diesel/gas generator currently operating at the Palm Bay Hideaway on Long Island. The old, polluting diesel only generator was converted to operating on diesel and propane, with a substitution rate of 35% of the normal load. The savings are estimated to be in the order of $23.50 per day or $8,578 per annum. Those in the industry anticipate that before long the technology will be available to enable generators to run on 80% gas, and with even more greenhouse savings.
But, despite the fact that we should be encouraging innovation, the use of technologies that reduce our impact on the environment, the long-term viability of these systems is now under threat, because the economic pressure will be too revert to full diesel usage, with just the flick of a switch.
In their submission to the Economics Committee, Elgas, one of the companies involved in diesel substitution advised that “based on current Elgas customers' usage, including installations under negotiation, the expected impact of this Bill would be an increase in diesel consumption by 12 million litres by Elgas customers.” Further they argue that “Based on Elgas' estimated 45% market share, the increased diesel consumption would be 27 million litres. This would produce 29,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide from all LPG customers.”
Now, I understand that the ALP is going to support this bill even though they are fully aware of the effect it will have on the uptake of renewable energy and alternative fuels for electricity generation in remote areas. To quote from the ALP's environment spokesperson, Kelvin Thompson, in his second reading speech:
	Remote renewable power generation is a clear opportunity to replace fossil fuel generation with renewables, invest our regional infrastructure and provide a more sustainable future for our regions. It will then provide them with access to cheaper fuel and electricity costs, yet the government has failed to deliver on its promise of such investment. It shows that Prime Minister Howard and the government's professed greenhouse abatement commitment and their professed commitment to the sustainability of our regions are a farce. As a result, many of our remote retail and hospitality operations remain dependent on diesel power generation and they are the victims of increasing fuel prices.
Interestingly, the ALP argues that this bill is our fault and that they wouldn't be in this position if the Democrats had pushed the Government harder on the start-up of the Energy Credits Scheme.
But I'd like to remind the ALP that it was them, not us, that supported the extension of the start-up date for the scheme to July 2003 instead of July this year.
Indeed, it's all very well for the ALP to sit back and say that it's all the Democrats fault. This is a very convenient excuse. Because the truth of the matter is that the ALP is of a like mind with the Government on this issue. If it wasn't the ALP wouldn't support this bill and wouldn't have supported the extension of the start-up date for the Energy Credits Scheme. It's my view that the ALP's support for this bill, like the Government's was made some time ago, and that this bill is unfortunately a fate accompli.
Their rather loosely veiled strategy is to attack us so that their own hypocrisy will not get as much attention. But this isn't working. The environment groups and the alternative fuels groups can see through this. Those who appeared at the hearings will know that the ALP was so disinterested in the issue of how this bill will impact on the uptake of renewable energy and alternative fuels that it did not ask one question at the Committee hearings. Not one.
In my opinion this is a very sorry episode. The only glimmer of hope I take is the knowledge that we now have the ALP's full support for the implementation of an Energy Credits Scheme. We look forward to them joining us in pressuring the Government to develop and implement the scheme poste haste.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL FUEL REBATE SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I want to make a few remarks about the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme Amendment Bill 2002. I was all dressed up and ready to deliver a 20-minute speech, but I will bring it down to about five minutes, given that it is now 2.20 a.m. and the pressure is on to complete our deliberations.
This bill does extend the diesel fuel rebate to include diesel used for power generation at remote roadhouses and hospitality and tourist businesses which have to generate their own electricity because they are not on the grid. The diesel is much more expensive there than elsewhere where it is used for power generation. It corrects an anomaly created by the GST which left mines and farms eligible to claim the rebate, but not small businesses on the remote highways of Australia, who do a great job for the travelling public. Those roadhouses are places the travelling public relies on in case of being stranded due to floods or cyclones. They form an essential part of the infrastructure for the travelling public and the business owners ought to be encouraged to go to these very remote locations unhampered by an additional, unfair impost.
This was an issue encountered during the Labor Party's fuel inquiry last year, which I chaired. I recall one publican from a remote location who said that his diesel bill was bigger than his brewery bill. In other words, it cost more to chill the beer than it cost to buy it. I would particularly like to acknowledge the assistance of a couple of people at the inquiry: Mrs Helen Tees from Widgiemooltha, an hour's drive south of Kalgoorlie on the Goldfields-Esperance Highway, and Mr Bob Bongiorno from Balladonia, 930 kilometres from Perth, out on the Nullarbor, who made the seven-hour return trip to put his case on diesel fuel to us in Kalgoorlie. I would also like to acknowledge the Hon. Julian Grill, former WA state member for Eyre, and his successor, John Bowler MLA, who also fought hard for their remote constituents on this issue and who must share the credit too. 
In the case of Bob Bongiorno, who drove for seven hours to speak to us, he said it was because of the shameful incompetence that he and Helen Tees received from their federal member in the House of Representatives, Barry Haase. Mr Haase's sole interest seemed to be, at every opportunity, to use it as a political football and to somehow blame Labor for the government's flawed fuel taxing regime. Indeed, when this bill was debated in the other place, he did not even speak on it.
I am very pleased that Labor has forced the correction, because I believe it was pressure from us that forced the correction of this injustice for those living in remote localities in Australia. There was pressure particularly from Kalgoorlie. That provides us with some encouragement to make sure these small businesses are safeguarded in the future.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL FUEL REBATE SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2002-06-27,"—I seek leave to incorporate my speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I rise to speak on the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme Amendment Bill 2002.
The amendments to the bill are aiming to extend the eligibility for the rebate to retail and hospitality businesses that use diesel to generate power when they do not have access to mains electricity. This was announced as an election promise by the Coalition government during the 2001 election campaign and will benefit small business operators in remote areas of Australia by providing a rebate on the customs or excise duty paid on diesel and like fuels used by them to generate power for their own use.
The extension of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme originated from the recognition of some of the difficulties suffered by small outback tourism operators. The National Party's policy document Securing Australia's tourism future states:
Another measure which will help tourism operators is the extension of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. A re-elected Coalition government will extend the eligibility for the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme to small retail/hospitality businesses producing their own electricity from diesel, provided there is no access to grid power. Businesses such as caravan parks, tourist resorts and road houses will benefit from the Scheme ...
This measure compensates such businesses for the considerable costs of power generation in regions where there is no access to the power grid and where excise imposts can disadvantage isolated communities. This government had constantly indicated its commitment to rural and regional Australia, including those people resident in isolated communities. The government does this by providing a rebate of excise or customs duty on fuel used by retail and hospitality businesses—not just small retail and hospitality businesses—to generate power for use in the business after 1 July 2002.
It is worthy to note that this is the second extension to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme by the Coalition, since it came into government in 1996. The introduction of the New Tax System in 2000 saw an extension of the old scheme of rebate from agriculture, fishing and mining to rail and marine transport, as well as bush nursing homes, hospitals, aged people's homes and the like.
At a time of budgetary constraint, and in a time of surplus budgets, the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, may have been seen as an easy target for Treasury to cut, but the truth is the government sees its value and have in fact extended this tax rebate, it plays a vital role in reducing the costs structures of rural and regional Australia. Not only does the rebate scheme provide major benefits to rural and regional Australians through the lowering of transport and production costs but it also improves Australia's competitiveness in the export market, and export competitiveness is the lifeblood of the rural community. Fuel is probably one of the largest costs for families and business in rural and regional areas.
The Coalition, while being fully committed to the scheme, are only too aware a tight administrative control over the accounting procedures is necessary so that the scheme runs effectively. I know this often leads to complaints from users that the system has more red tape than is necessary, but it is important to keep the integrity of the scheme before the taxpayer and, in particular, those who do not use the scheme. It is important that the scheme does not lapse from a tax incentive to a tax evasion. That is why we moved to make several worthwhile administrative changes following the 1996 Audit Office report on the abuse and misuse of the system.
So, while the government will come down hard on misuse scheme, we are committed to the scheme because we know, as they would be aware, fuel pricing is what is known as an `inelastic' price. In other words, if the price of fuel goes up, the usage does not automatically fall; likewise, if the price of fuel goes down, it does not mean that the usage of fuel automatically goes up. It is with this in mind that the importance of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme can be fully understood. Therefore, it is imperative that rebates are provide on such an `inelastic' cost to those people and businesses that provide the Australian domestic market and also export market consumer products. 
Alternatively, the record of the Opposition when in government from 1983 to 1996, saw fuel as nothing more than something to be feasted upon, something for the Treasury coffers. It was the Labor Party in government that introduced indexation on petrol and diesel. We abolished indexation. And it was the Labor Party who increased petrol and diesel excise as a discretionary budget measure. Worse, this was at a time of budget deficits which they tried to plug.
In contrast, this government has not once increased the excise level of petrol and diesel. We do not see fuel as a way of meeting budget demands. We resisted the temptation to use fuel taxes to support our budget surplus aims. I believe it is a credit to our economic management and to the ongoing efficiency and competitiveness of the rural sector as a result.
As for the minor party in the Senate, the Democrats, we know only too well their stated policy is to abolish the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. The Democrats have a somewhat genuine concern regarding the environmental effect of diesel fuel production and greenhouse effect, but their solution is extreme. We believe there is a balance to be struck between a genuine concern for the environment and the reality of the use of diesel.
I rely upon the second reading speech of the parliamentary secretary who introduced this bill in the other house when he said:
The government is indeed committed to introducing the Energy Grants Credit Scheme by 1 July 2003. The scheme will maintain entitlements equivalent to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme while providing greater incentives for cleaner fuels...government is strongly committed to increasing the use of renewable energy in Australia as a way of meeting our increasing energy needs without adding to our greenhouse gas emissions. To this end we have committed over $300 million for renewable energy support focused on three areas. Key achievements include the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target—world first legislation—that guarantees that enough new renewable electricity is generated over the next 10 years to supply the residential needs of a city of four million people. This initiative is being achieved by establishing an innovative market in renewable energy certificates and is expected to deliver in excess of $2,000 million of new investment in renewable energy in Australia.
As part of an agreement made with the Democrats at the time of the introduction of the New Tax System—read GST—improved emissions standards for petrol and diesel vehicles have been introduced with the Diesel and Alternative Fuel Grants Scheme and Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme being combined into the Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme to commence in July 2003. It is worthy to note this agreement was an effective result-driven use of the Democrats' use of their numbers.
The new standards will means that emissions rates from oxides of nitrogen and particulates in new medium to heavy duty trucks will be 50 per cent and 90 per cent lower respectively after 2006 than in today's vehicles.
I reiterate the essence of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. Road and rail transport tourism is the very lifeblood of rural and regional Australia. It moves produce to markets and it delivers the necessities of life. Thus, the cost of this transport impacts heavily on the price of that produce on domestic and international market and on the cost of virtually everything needed for day-to-day life. Cheaper fuel means lower costs which, in turn, mean enhanced prospects for our exports and a dampening on the cost of living for regional and rural Australians.
It is with great enthusiasm that I recommend this bill to the Senate.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-06-27,"—I rise to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2002. I have here a most detailed and informative speech for members of the Senate.
Government senators interjecting—
 (Senator Ferguson)—Order! Would members please leave the chamber or continue their discussions elsewhere.
—I had hoped to read it tonight—don't tempt me.
—The hour is late, Senator Forshaw.
—I realise that. In fact, one of my constituents who has a great concern about the way in which the government is managing the EMDG scheme was going to be waiting up tonight to listen to this speech. But as this is not on broadcast he has probably gone to bed, so in the interests of time I seek leave to have my remarks incorporated in Hansard, and I invite you all to read them tomorrow.
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
Austrade and the Government have announced that there are insufficient funds available to pay in full all the claims assessed in the current year. In response to a question from Stephen Martin in the House yesterday (Wednesday), Minister Mark Vaile said that 28% of grant recipients (about 900 businesses) would only receive 75.62% of their second tranche entitlements.
The $150 million EMDG budget cap is administered under a split payment system for applicants whose grant entitlements are determined to be in excess of $60,000. These companies receive $60,000 when their `provisional grant entitlements' are determined. Subject to the amount that remains in the $150 million pool once all applicants' initial payments have been made (and Austrade's admin costs, capped at 7.5%, are deducted), the balance of the applicant's entitlement is paid at the end of June.
For the last few years, there have been sufficient funds available to pay out all applicants in full. In fact, last year Austrade returned about $7 million in unused allocation to the Government. Unfortunately, those funds aren't rolled over into the next year's budget. This year, the Austrade budget is short by about $11 million.
As a result of the budget shortfall, all companies receiving in excess of the $60,000 will have the second payments (their remaining `provisional grant entitlements') reduced. For example, a firm with a provisional entitlement of the maximum $200,000 will only receive a net $165,868.
There are a number of direct consequences of this situation. Firstly, about 900 firms will now receive less than their full entitlement, an entitlement based on meeting Austrade's stringent legislative and investigative EMDG requirements. This will directly impact on the amount of funding they will have available to commit to export marketing. Many will have put plans into place for the current (and future) financial year(s) in the reasonable expectation that full EMDG support would be available.
Secondly, there will be flow on effects in future years. The EMDG budget is capped at $150 million (about to be increased to $150.4 million) until 2005/06. Based on the current year experience, and changes that will apply from this year that will increase access to the Scheme, it seems certain that the budget allocation will be insufficient for every year from now to 2006. Meanwhile, the Government and Austrade are still promoting EMDG as providing up to $200,000 in funds when they know that it will be almost impossible for anyone to receive that amount.
Several reviews of EMDG (including the most recent one in 2000) established a direct connection between the level of export marketing expenditure and levels of export sales achieved. With the certainty of EMDG support removed, companies will be less inclined to spend on export promotion, leading to smaller export sales. Firms contemplating discretionary export marketing activities—such as an overseas visit, participation in a trade show, or appointment of a representative office—will be less inclined to commit these funds to such risky endeavours if they can't be sure that they will receive EMDG support. Consequently, fewer export sales will result, to Australia's economic and social disadvantage.
These were the specific findings of the Austrade Board in their Review of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme (June 2000). Many findings were based on extensive econometric analysis undertaken by Professor Ron Bewley of the University of NSW.
Let me quote a few extracts from the Review of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme produced by the Austrade Board in June 2000 to illustrate those findings.
Firstly, at page 15 the Review said:
... the Board also notes that the lower level of funding that accompanied the 1996 changes means that there has been a reduction in expenditure on export promotion by grant recipients and in additional exports generated compared to what would have occurred without the changes.
On page 16 the Review also commented:
Business clearly stated that certainty was a key factor that contributed to effectiveness and that business should be able to plan export activities on a reasonable expectation that some reimbursement of costs will occur. The less certainty exporters have, the less the grant will act as an incentive.
On the same page the Review said:
The cap on funding set at $150 million per year may result in the diminution of the value of grants for more than 1,000 grant recipients each year over the period to 2005/06. The Board considers that the returns from the Scheme are such that the best outcome would be for all grantees to receive the full value of their entitlements.
The Board clearly recognised the problems that would be caused by exporters receiving less than the full value of the grant payment. At page 59 of the Review they said:
While difficult to estimate, it is likely that, under the scenario, described previously, over 1,000 firms each year would see the value of their gradually diminished over time. The Board, in considering the consequences of this, noted the findings of the PWC report.
This evidence suggests strongly that although they have not been guaranteed the full amount of the possible grant, applicants at all stages appear to fully expect to receive the grant payment and spend on export promotion accordingly.
It is the Board's assessment that once exporters begin to expect to not receive the full value of the grant payment they will make adjustments to their export promotion expenditure. This is likely to reduce the amount of additional exports generated compared to what would have occurred if the grant was paid in full.
Unfortunately, the findings of that Review have come to pass. This Government has allowed the success of this great scheme, and therefore the contribution of many exporting business to the Australian economy, to be jeopardised by their failure to support the EMDG scheme",SENATE,<title>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-06-27,"—Mr Acting Deputy President, I also want to seek leave to have my remarks on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2002 incorporated in Hansard, but I want to seek some advice from you first. I have a second reading amendment. In the context of incorporation, how might that be dealt with?
 (Senator Ferguson)—You can seek leave to incorporate your speech and then move the amendment.
—I seek leave to have my speech incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
I rise to speak in favour of the bill and to suggest some additional changes.
The EMDG Scheme has been in operation since 1974 providing funds to small and medium size businesses in order to assist them with the cost of promoting and developing export markets.
A range of industries, small and medium, have already accessed these funds.
While we would commend to the Government, the need for investment in small export businesses, the Australian Democrats believe that it is also vital that there is also long-term investment in health, education and the environment.
My colleague Senator Bartlett has previously raised the matter of inclusion of exemptions in the assistance package recognising these same concerns.
The amendment I will move today is an attempt to do the same. The Democrats want the Export Market Development Grants Scheme to represent a more comprehensive collection of community values.
Currently, the scheme allows support of businesses that export products made from native forests.
Currently the scheme also allows support of industries that develop, produce and export fossil fuels—therefore increasing our greenhouse emissions. Such a scheme should not be used to assist business operations which could cause long-term environmental damage.
Although there is no indication that fossil fuel exports comprise a major part of the Scheme, grants to the fossil fuel industry have occurred. The Australian Democrats believe this practice must not continue into the future.
Currently, the scheme provides no ethical framework for assessing grant applications. This means exporters of guns are just as likely to be funded in the same fashion as exporters of educational software.
This situation demonstrates that there is a need to have an ethical framework within which the funding decisions are made.
Accordingly I put forward a second reading amendment to reflect this, and has already been circulated in the chamber.
Having said that, it is important to remember that the program has changed in structure and orientation. It is not set in stone.
And with each review, the focus of the scheme has been modified to assist SMEs and improve the effectiveness of the scheme as a trade stimulant.
We are aware that the Scheme itself has been operating for over 25 years. It has obviously been successful at many levels, but the Australian Democrats believe it is time for such subsidy schemes to become smarter and more representative of community concerns and values.
Regarding the amendment in front of us to increase the minimum grant from $2500 to $5000, I believe this offers a welcomed increase in support for businesses who are able to access this scheme.
By most accounts the EMDG Scheme has been a success. Recent reviews indicate that the Scheme has helped develop an export culture, has assisted businesses establish products and reputations and has resulted in an increase in export earnings.
The Australian Democrats believe further increases in export opportunities are to be commended and supported.
Again, the Australian Democrats will support the passage of this amendment bill.
—I move this second reading amendment, which has been circulated in the chamber:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate is of the opinion that export market development grants should not be used to facilitate the depletion of fossil fuels, the logging of native forests or the promotion of unethical business practices”.",SENATE,<title>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1,speech

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-06-27,"— I have some remarks to make on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2002 and I seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The speech read as follows—
The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 2002 furthers the Government's strategy of encouraging and assisting Australian businesses into the international marketplace.
The government has continually made the Export Market Development Grants scheme more accessible and more attractive to small business.
In 1997, we:
·	reduced from $30,000 to $20,000 the minimum expenditure required to access the scheme
·	gave the tourism sector access to the full 50 per cent grant rate, and
·	limited the scheme to firms with annual turnovers of under $50 million in order to better target EMDG funds to small business.
Then, last year, we extended the scheme for five years, and—after a thorough review—made it even more “small business friendly” by:
·	allowing small businesses on limited budgets to access the scheme—by reducing from $20,000 to $15,000 the minimum expenditure required to access the EMDG scheme
·	recognising the important role of family run businesses in our exporting community—by reducing the period that related family members need to be employed in a business before their travel expenses are eligible
·	cutting red tape—by removing the requirement that intending first-time claimants must register with Austrade before applying for a grant
·	giving firms more options in terms of the activities that may be claimed under the scheme
·	and increasing the scheme's relevance to our tourism industry—by giving Professional Conference Organisers and similar businesses that engage in “foreign delegate boosting” access to the scheme.
These changes, along with Government's sound management of the Australian economy, have helped Australian exporters achieve bumper export figures.
In 2001, Australia exported $154 billion worth of goods and services. That was an eight per cent increase on the previous year, which itself was an increase of 25 per cent on the year before that.
The policies that we proposed in the 1996 election campaign have taken our export effort from $99 billion in 1996 to $154 billion in 2001—a 54 per cent increase.
And it is important to note that behind these big numbers are real people and real businesses— businesses that are entering export markets, winning sales and, most importantly, creating jobs for Australians.
The EMDG scheme is a key plank of the government's strategy to encourage small businesses into the export marketplace, and is playing a major role in delivering on our commitment to double the number of Australian exporters by 2006.
This bill further increases the contribution of the scheme to these goals by increasing the minimum grant from $2,500 to $5,000.
While the increased minimum grant will be available to exporters in all years of the scheme, it will be of particular benefit to smaller firms that are claiming EMDG grants for the first time.
Small businesses often find themselves in a difficult situation. They usually have very limited budgets and are not in a position to spend much on overseas travel and other export promotion activities. With this amendment, a first time EMDG applicant will need to spend only $15,000 over two years in order to receive a minimum grant of $5,000.
This bill will increase the scheme's impact in encouraging more small businesses to invest in export, and thus contribute to a more globally competitive and prosperous Australia.
I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-06-27,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002 is a very important piece of legislation. The Australian Democrats have proposed certain amendments to the government this day on this bill. I am instructed by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations that the amendments go at least part of the way towards what might be a compromise outcome that would be acceptable to the government. He indicates, however, that the matter does need further attention. It cannot very easily get that further attention at 3 o'clock in the morning. Therefore we would propose that it be adjourned until the next day of sitting. In saying that, obviously we are disappointed that the bill cannot be completed tonight because, in responding to an unsatisfactory situation that has developed in recent times, we were very anxious to find a legislative solution before this parliament rose. But in these circumstances, and being prepared to accept the Democrats' proposals as an attempt to find a constructive way forward, Mr Abbott has indicated that he would wish to reciprocate in a constructive way and therefore proposes at this time that the debate be adjourned and that further consideration be an order of the day for the next day of sitting.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-06-27,"—The background of this legislation was a round of amendments in respect to the Migration Act that were implemented by the former minister Mr Gerry Hand when he was minister for immigration in 1992 in the Keating Labor government—and a very fine minister he was too. Minister Hand at that time sought to introduce a complete code to guide immigration decision makers. The aim was to give immigration decision makers certain rules that they needed to follow to give a valid decision. It is clear from former Minister Hand's second reading speech that in his view and parliament's view they were creating an exhaustive code. However, in the High Court case referred to as Miah—the same name as my daughter, although I suppose it would be appropriate to give it its full title of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ex parte Miah—which was decided last year, the view was taken by the court that if parliament thought in 1992 it was introducing an exhaustive code to guide decision makers in the immigration area it had failed in that endeavour and, in particular, it had failed to exclude the common-law natural justice hearing rule. If you look at the High Court case, one can say the High Court effectively invited parliament to relegislate and clarify the matter if it really was parliament's intention to create a clear and exhaustive code for immigration decision makers. This Migration Legislation Amendment (Procedural Fairness) Bill 2002 represents a response to that invitation.
The bill is largely technical in nature. It relates to codification of decision making powers. The Labor Party's approach to this legislation has been laid out in a very full and comprehensive manner by our shadow minister, Ms Gillard. I would invite those who require further detail on this matter to examine her contribution on the second reading debate in the House of Representatives. I should make it clear that the Labor Party think good decision making in this area is to have fast and fair processing and, to achieve fast and fair processing, codification of the obligations of decision makers is a good thing. The former Labor minister Mr Hand thought it was a good approach, and Labor's view on the question is unchanged. Labor support codification of the obligation of decision makers to achieve fast and fair decision making in this area.
The Labor Party support codification of the obligations of decision makers. We do not think that there should be endless appeal rights. We understand why the government wants to clarify the question of whether or not the common-law hearing rule survives outside the codification of the obligations of decision makers in the immigration area. We do understand why the government would be viewing with some concern the fact that various single judges in the Federal Court have announced different versions of the law in this area. That is not a desirable result. In that respect we think that prudent and better decision making lies in waiting until the decision of the full Federal Court is available so that we know whether or not this legislation is needed and whether or not it is in an appropriate form. There is not the urgency that the government has stressed in respect to this matter. We think that the approach and the reason for dealing with it in the House of Representatives and the Senate is of an obvious political nature, to attempt to milk whatever they can out of the broader debate that has been occurring in the refugee area. Nonetheless we recognise that clarification in this area is required, and the Labor Party are supporting the legislation.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,52,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-06-27,"—I should indicate in advance that anything I say now is no personal reflection on Senator Sherry. But here we go again: three o'clock in the morning; another migration bill ripping away rights from people who wish to have any sort of appeal on any decision relating to migration matters. This is obviously directed at refugees, as is everything this government does. As Senator Sherry did correctly say, that is the reason this is being pushed through. There is no urgency. There is no reason why this needs to be brought forward tonight—along with many other bills we have dealt with tonight—other than political purposes. It is purely for the sake of wedge politics. But the fact is that we are here debating it, we vote for this and it becomes law. What this bill does is remove the opportunity for people to appeal against a migration decision—not just a refugee decision, any migration decision— if natural justice is not followed.
Senator Sherry quite correctly said that back in 1992 former Minister Hand and the parliament introduced, along with a whole range of other things, a code of procedure that some say was intended to replace natural justice. That may or may not have been the intent of the parliament at the time. I am willing to concede that it possibly was. That was 10 years ago. The number of migration bills that have been through this place in the last 10 years—almost all of which have removed people's rights on grounds of appeal on such an unbelievable range of issues— would stagger people if they knew the truth.
Since that time, it is a basic fact that if a person, a member of the Refugee Tribunal or the Migration Review Tribunal, makes a decision that is so unreasonable that no reasonable person could have made it—for those of you who like legal jargon that is called `Wednesbury unreasonableness'—you cannot appeal about that. If somebody makes what is basically an insane decision, an unreasonable decision that is so unreasonable that no reasonable person could make it, you cannot appeal about that. That is the way it has been since 1992, even though that principle existed way before former Minister Hand.
Just last year we had a privative clause brought in, attempting—none of us know how effectively yet—to remove the opportunity for people to appeal to the courts any decision on any migration matter, including refugee matters, on anything but the most unbelievably narrow grounds. As the shadow minister quite rightly said in her speech in the House of Representatives a couple of days ago, nobody knows how that is going to be interpreted. There is significant full Federal Court consideration being given at this moment to this decision and to this whole area, and of course, as always, it may subsequently be appealed to the High Court. Nobody knows what the law is in relation to this.
This goes back to the fundamentally disgracefully flawed decision the Senate made in September last year—without reflecting on that decision, other than to say it was completely stuffed—to let a whole range of migration bills through without proper scrutiny, without recognition of what they were doing and without any subsequent follow-up about what that meant. It is always awful getting technically legal, especially at 10 past three in the morning, on things like privative clauses. They are the sorts of things that lawyers love, because they can all argue about what they mean. We have already had individual decisions by various Federal Court judges about what the privative clause that was passed last September means.
I should point out to the Labor Party that they opposed that privative clause, that removal of appeal rights in a whole range of areas, for more than two years. There was a comprehensive Senate committee examination into that, and as part of that examination Labor looked at the clause and said, `This is a bad idea. We don't support it.' It never came up in the Senate for debate. Minister Ruddock just would not bring it on and left it sitting on the backburner, bubbling away, while he was doing all his other stuff like vilifying refugees, turning up the heat one notch at a time on the whole migration issue. We had an unequivocal report from Labor members of that committee and me saying: `This is a bad idea. This is removing fundamental components of justice. This is undermining the rule of law.' Even though we had this unequivocal report, eventually the political heat post-Tampa got so bad that the Labor Party not only rolled over on all the stuff to do with the Tampa and everything else but rolled over on everything else that had been sitting there, which they had opposed for years, including the privative clause.
Because we are all in politics, even though I acknowledge all of the people that criticise the government's approach to refugees and criticise what Labor has done to refugees, I also acknowledge to some extent the pure political reality that if Labor had at that time said, `No, we oppose all this,' they would have got wiped out. I acknowledge that; it is a political reality. Given everything you have done before, including the flip-flop on the border protection bills post-Tampa, my assessment—based on nothing other than my own political judgment, which probably is not worth anything of great significance—is that you would have got wiped out. So, in that sense, I guess you made a political decision. That is what people do, particularly when they are in larger parties; I acknowledge that.
I agree with the view that is sometimes professed amongst people about the approach to refugees that, if Labor had just finally said `enough is enough' two weeks out from the election, you would have got creamed. You should have said `enough is enough' three years before the election, particularly at the crunch time when temporary protection visas were introduced in 1999. At that time, I moved to disallow temporary protection visas and Labor senators in this place—as I have reminded them since in debates—said, `This temporary protection visa policy is stupid. It is not going to work. It is terrible; it is appalling; it is dumb, but that is the government's problem and we will support it.'
That date in 1999 was when you lost the last election. If you had stood firm then and had the opportunity to argue that consistently for three years, based on facts, you would have had a fair chance when this Tampa thing arose. But even that far back, in 1999, the political judgment was such that that decision was made—against some advice, including some in the shadow cabinet who, I know, argued that that should not go through. The decision was made; we all make decisions and that happens. But that decision was made then, and I think that that is when you lost the election.
Nobody could have predicted the Tampa, of course, and nobody could have predicted that the coalition would have plumbed the depths so low—even I did not believe it. I did not believe that the Prime Minister would be willing to cause that much destruction, that much suffering, that much pain to the most vulnerable people on the planet, purely to win an election. But my political judgment was obviously wrong. Now I know we have a Prime Minister who will go that low. Now I know we have a Prime Minister who is the most disgraceful Prime Minister we have had, over more than 100 years, because of what he has done. Now that you know that, you are still letting him go and putting this—
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Order! You should withdraw those reflections on the Prime Minister.
—That is based on the advice that you have received?
—You should withdraw them unequivocally, Senator Bartlett.
—You are advised that way?

—I will withdraw any remark I have made that is unparliamentary, because I have the greatest respect for this parliament. I have no respect for this—
—Thank you, Senator Bartlett.
—Thank you. I have no respect for the Prime Minister in terms of what he has done in this regard. What has been done needs to be made clear. Without taking a point of order against myself, I am possibly going slightly beyond the subject matter of this bill except insofar as it relates to what the Senate has already done.
We have had lots of good speeches tonight. I am not trying to be disingenuous in saying that I was enriched and uplifted by the valedictory debate, which a lot of people may have thought was self-indulgent but which I thought reinforced the immense value of what people do here from all parts of this chamber. I did give a very faint indication of that in relation to Senator Cooney and all the Labor Party senators. Senator McKiernan has great expertise in refugee law and migration law. I do not agree with him on a number of aspects, but I have immense respect for his understanding of it, and I concede without the slightest hesitation that he has a better knowledge of it across the board than I do.
If you look at the report of the Senate committee into this bill that we are debating now, all the Labor senators recommended that the bill not proceed at this time, although not necessarily for the reasons I am putting forward—I acknowledge that as well. The shadow minister, Ms Gillard, earlier this week moved a motion in the lower house in relation to this bill. I do not bother watching what happens in the lower house very often. After the member for Werriwa's contributions and others in the last couple of days, I am even less inclined to pay any attention to the lower house. It is no wonder that it is called the lower house. Ms Gillard spoke quite well about this bill and some of the issues involved. She moved a motion in the lower house and I have a motion which reflects that almost word for word. Only one thing is different. The lower house had to request that the government defer this bill until the crucial full Federal Court decision comes down. I can understand them moving that because obviously the opposition do not have the numbers and they just put forward a request. Almost word for word I have circulated that amendment, and I now hereby move that amendment:
Omit all words after “That”, substitute:
	(a)	the Senate notes that:
	(i)	immigration matters should be determined in a fast and fair manner;
	(ii)	a five person Full Court of the Federal Court commenced hearing on 3 June appeals from five decisions of single judges and that these appeals will determine a central issue dealt with in this bill;
	(iii)	the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has conceded that it is not certain that the bill is needed to achieve its end of ensuring that the common law natural justice hearing rule is excluded from immigration decision making; and
	(iv)	the passage of this bill prior to the Federal Court decision may confuse the law in this area and cause more delays and uncertainty; and
	(b)	further consideration of the bill be an order of the day for the day after the decision of the Federal Court on the matter is delivered.
Instead of requesting that the government defer the bill, the Senate—which obviously has the power and the numbers—can ensure that further consideration not occur at least until that decision of the Federal Court is delivered.
Those who are on the Senate committee— and again I do not want to get into complex legal arguments about this—heard about this privative clause, this Hickman guy from the 1940s. I am sure that he is not alive anymore. He would be astonished that his name lives on forevermore because of some obscure court case to do with some meat tribunal or some damn thing back in 1945. How it applies is so unclear. We passed this last year. As with so many things we passed last year leading up to the election, we did not know what we were doing. None of us knew what the impact was. None of us know now what the impact is. We still have not had a proper consideration of the impact of what we passed last year. We can get lots of lawyers giving us letters here and there, but we still do not know what the hell we did last year.
We did it—as I am sure all would concede at least privately if not publicly—for political reasons. The Democrats opposed it for political reasons at the time, although also for procedural and legislative reasons. If we are going to pass a bad law, at least we have to know how bad the damn thing is before we pass it. The government do not even know what they did. They probably wanted bad law; they might not have wanted very bad law. We probably got extraordinarily appalling law—and we do not even know if we have got it yet. We will not even know for another year or two, until we finally get a High Court case about what the hell this privative clause means.
Senator Abetz is a person with some legal expertise. He can probably give us an exposition on what he thinks the Hickman clause—the privative clause—means. That will be interesting but we can get the highest QC in the land and every High Court judge individually to tell us what they think it means, but we will not know until they have handed down a decision. If you cut away everything else, what this bill does is remove the right for people to appeal a decision on any migration matter, and it does not apply just to refugees—to all those evil, horrible queue jumpers the government wants the whole country to hate. In any migration matter you will not be able to appeal against a decision made by the tribunal, the review tribunal or the department, even if they do not follow natural justice.
If they do not follow natural justice, bad luck; it does not matter. Natural justice: who cares? We do not need that in migration law! Who wants that stuff? That is inconvenient. They have replaced it with this thing called the code of procedure which is clearly not even remotely like natural justice. This inverts the minister's pathetic language about `refugee plus' or `processing plus' or `sugar on the candy' or some rubbish. It is the opposite: it is not natural justice; it is like Z-grade natural justice; it is unnatural injustice. It is the most pathetic, tiny, constrained thing.
I acknowledge that that is what was passed in 1992. So many things have happened since then, including restricting the right to appeal on virtually everything. But you still want to remove natural justice, despite the fact that you cannot appeal on virtually anything any more, including unreasonable unreasonableness. That is what you want to put through now. It is quite possible that if courts decide that the privative clause is as narrow as the government would like, not only could you exclude natural justice but you could exclude even this code of procedure that is supposed to replace it. If the decision maker does not follow it, there is no opportunity to appeal. It is a joke!

Leave granted.
Senator Crossin's speech read as follows—
FAMILY PAYMENT SYSTEM 
In this Budget the Government had an opportunity to make family payments easier for families, but instead they have retained the impractical and burdensome income estimation test which resulted in 665,00 overpayments in relation to 1.8 million families. The average debt after the Government was forced to put in place a $1000 tolerance level was $1040. The Govt could have revised the test to meet the circumstances of contemporary families, with many employed in casual work and large numbers of women moving in or out of the workforce in a given year. Instead, the Govt has dug its heels in and ordinary Australian families will continue to carry the burden of administration, having to crystal ball gaze in relation to their income over the next year.
BABY BONUS & PAID MATERNITY LEAVE
In relation to understanding the lives of ordinary Australian women, this Budget clearly fails. What we have is the much touted baby bonus. I'd like to say this about the Government's Baby Bonus: it's not much of a dividend unless the family income exceeds $50,000. And it won't deliver anything to women who have to return to work or those women who are having their second or third child. There is no mention of what working women in Australia deserve and need: a national maternity leave scheme. In this Budget, the Government has failed to accept the recommendation of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner and the ranks of blokes in the Coalition who are lining up to oppose it is growing. These include Abbott, and Minchin “middle class welfare” as well as Hockey's ambivalent attitude (he says small business won't employ young people). But so far this Govt hasn't shown much interest in shaking off the embarrassing tag of being one of the last two industrialised countries to bring in a national scheme or to show some real commitment to equality for women in this crucial matter.
CHILDCARE
Childcare: so low a priority that it doesn't even feature in the Minister's women's budget statement. This budget provides
·	no new places to ease the crisis in family day care & outside school hours care
·	no new investment in early child hood development
·	no initiatives to solve the staffing crisis in child care
·	no response to the Government's own Child Care Advisory Committee Report crying out for a long term plan in child care
·	no children's health, wellbeing or protection initiatives.
I know that in my electorate there is a definite shortage of after school hours places. The Minister recently admitted that the Government's policies have to this shortage. It was recently confirmed that the $35 million of debt which has occurred because of overpayments made under the old childcare system could have funded over 4,000 children of low income families for After School Hours Child Care for at least 5 hours per week if the Government had not created a massive debt problem.
I'm sure that with the school holidays now upon us, many of my constituents who are working parents would appreciate some of those places which the Government has failed to provide in this Budget.
DISABILITY
Disability services: With this Budget, the Govt has crudely attempted to blackmail the Parliament in a way never seen before.
“Pass our changes to the DSP”, the Minister for Family and Community Services said, “or the States and Territories won't get the growth money under the Commonwealth State and Territory Disability Agreement we promised them two years ago”. I am pleased that the Minister withdrew her threat in this chamber earlier today but I am disappointed that this Government's “new” position is really unchanged in relation to the DSP. They still want two classes of disabled people—one of which will be out on the dole queue with a lot less money. The Labor Party does not oppose welfare reform and we want to do everything we can to help people participate but we will never accept that taking $52 a fortnight out of a disabled person's helps him or her to participate.
Senator Collins's speech read as follows—
I rise tonight on the last sitting day before the parliamentary winter break to speak on a particular aspect related to the appropriation bills.
The measure in this budget to push people with a disability off the disability support pension has been one of the most malicious and disturbing policy directions of this Government in recent years.
Fortunately, the Opposition and the Democrats made it clear that this measure would not pass the Senate, and it was not taken any further.
But sadly, today, during Question Time, the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, announced that a new bill restricting disability support is just about to enter the other place. And from her brief comments it would appear that she has again missed the fundamental principle of equity. But I will wait to see the detail of that bill. Possibly, I suggest, she could consult a little wider that the accountancy unit within the Department of Family and Community Services with this new piece of legislation.
But, while the Government's first proposal appears to have been abandoned, it is important to record what has transpired over the past few weeks.
The Government tried to dress up its budget measure as being one of helping disabled people engage more with society and the Australian workplace. Noble sentiments, but when the proposal was looked at in the cold hard light of day, it became clear that this was primarily an exercise in cost cutting and budget trimming.
Under the Government's budget measure, thousands of people were going to be living under a threat of being removed off the disability support pension. This threat would hang over people's heads for years, causing stress and anxiety, as it would take the department quite a while to assess everyone to see if they were fit to work 15 hours a week.
People who were assessed as able to work the new minimum level would find themselves on the NewStart Allowance: the government payment for unemployed people. Unfortunately, the NewStart Allowance has a stricter means test and a greater compliance burden. People are expected to look for up to 10 jobs a fortnight and fill out a dole diary. And for all this, the allowance is at its best $52.80 per fortnight less than the disability support pension. At its worst, disabled people could be left a couple of hundred dollars out of pocket each fortnight.
But the hardship would not stop at fortnightly payments. A person with a disability assessed able to work fifteen hours a week and moved to the NewStart Allowance would also lose access to a range of support allowances. Travel, phone and medicine allowances would all be removed.
I would like to point out to the Government that the word `support' has been intentionally placed within the title `Disability Support Pension'. It's there for a reason, and the reprehensible and reckless behaviour of the Government in targeting people with a disability in this budget is something they should seriously reflect on.
In the early 90's Labor replaced the Invalid Pension with the Disability Support Pension. It was a program that connected people to training programs and other support mechanisms with an aim to help people be engaged in society and community as much as possible. The word `support' was an apt description of what Labor in government created. Such a program stands in stark contrast to the mean-spirited, bureaucratic nightmare that the Government has been pushing recently.
And that leads me to my next point. Madam President, the most breathtaking aspect of this policy debacle must be the lack of intellectual scrutiny that has been applied to the policy proposal.
It was only days after the budget that the Opposition was starting to say that the mechanics of the proposal did not meet up with its publicity. And it was not long before it became clear that the Government had missed a whole group of people with a disability who were currently working fifteen hours or more in business services, or shelter workshops to use the previous jargon. This group, which is estimated well over 10,000 people, was going to suffer severe financial hardship under the proposal.
When this oversight was brought to the notice of the Minister for Family and Community Services, in Question Time, she proclaimed that “the Prime Minister has made it clear and I have made it clear that the gate on that policy discussion has not shut”.
You could practically hear the media pounding their way to the Prime Minister who had to deny that the Government was doing a policy backflip.
But over the ensuing weeks it became obvious that the gate was wide open. During Estimates, it came to my attention that over 81 % of DSP recipients received on average $84 of private income per fortnight, above the disability support pension. When I asked Department officials how this group of people would be impacted by the proposed policy change, the question had to be taken on notice.
And again, Senator Vanstone stated that the gate was not shut on policy development in this area.
However, as the mistakes, flaws and community opposition have taken their toll, even the Minister saw that this proposal was a millstone for the Government, and the matter had gone quiet until today.
In closing, I want to make a point to the Government. The Opposition will not tolerate blunt and poorly crafted measures that victimise and traumatise vulnerable groups in our community. Australians have a strong sense of equity. We don't kick people when they are down, and this is what the Government's budget measure was doing.
NewStart was never designed for people with a disability. It is a payment for short-term benefit recipients who have the capacity to move off the payment and into full-time work. Placing people with disabilities, who by definition cannot participate in work full-time, onto the NewStart Allowance will leave them on a very low earnings, which they will barely be able to live on and can never hope to escape from.
Senator Vanstone said today the Labor is not interested in hearing anything the Government has got to say in the area of disability support. That is categorically untrue.
Labor's offer to discuss DSP reforms with the Coalition stands. It's time to move on. We are happy to work on a legislative framework that optimises participation for people with disabilities, consistent with the principles established in the McClure Committee.
But Labor will not be backing the dismantling of the social safety net or advocating a two-tier system that offers different level of support and hope to people who are doing it tough in our communities.
Senator George Campbell's speech read as follows—
I rise today to speak on the Budget. I wish to comment on two elements of the budget:
1)	The government's unprincipled attack on the nations poor, and 
2)	Its complete lack of vision in industry policy.
This is the greatest taxing and spending government in Australian history, which is extraordinary given how little it actually does for those who need it most.
On the other side of this chamber is a government who have attacked our public institutions, our children's educational opportunities, those who have been left on the scrap heap by economic rationalism and now they seek to scapegoat disabled pensioners and the sick.
Apparently this government thinks it's OK to blow $3 billion on foreign currency markets. It's OK to hand out interest free loans of $138m to mates like Comalco and to give $125m with no strings attached to Rio Tinto. But it's not OK to live in a wheelchair, or suffer an injury while working. No—because under this government's view of the world you're obviously a bludger if you possess those characteristics.
I warn the Australian public not to get sick. I warn the Australian public not to suffer a genetically inherited condition. Because this government won't be there to help you.
But it will be there to impose penalties on your welfare benefit or to provide you with inappropriate assistance to get back into a job. The Government didn't get away with it his time, but it will be there next time to try and slug you every time you need painkillers or anti-histamines or contraception.
Labor was committed to blocking the Government's proposed changes to the PBS and the Disability Support Pension from the start. They are unfair, unjust and inequitable. They are against everything Labor stands for and they show this Government's true colours.
Just look at the details of what the government was proposing, and look closely at the shallow nature of their arguments:
You'd have thought Peter Costello had had a conversion to socialism and sustainability the way he was carrying on about inter-generational equity in the budget. But he wasn't talking about an investment in our future.
Peter Costello was merely using inter-generational equity as the latest ruse to divert attention from what his Budget razor gang was really doing—attacking our most needy and the few government services still available to them.
The Inter-Generational Report (IG Report) is a limited document that the government is manipulating to achieve its proposed budget cuts.
If economic growth over the last 40 years is repeated over the next 40 years, the Australia's GDP will quadruple in real terms. It will be least double today's real per capita GDP. This would create ample opportunities to support a generous PBS scheme well into the future.
But don't take my word for it. We need look no further than the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development to see evidence that the imagined future health care crisis of the government is exactly that. Imagined.
In 20 years time Australia will only just be reaching the age dependency levels several European nations like Belgium and Italy are experiencing now, and which Japan has experienced for some time. Are their budgets being slashed and burnt? No. And they weren't being slashed and burnt 20 years ago either.
Going back to the IG report, it shows Australia's total age related spending in 2045 would be in the vicinity of 22% of GDP. That is LESS than the CURRENT spending in the Czech Republic, Denmark and Sweden, with New Zealand not far behind.
The way you achieve inter-generational equity is to invest in the future, not to slash and burn programs that are popular and that work.
A good start are things like properly funded public schools, well resourced universities, world-leading research and development, high speed and readily available internet connections, and a health system that gives incentives to healthy lifestyles and guarantees universal care. Jacking up the cost of medicine is a short term and damaging cure to the problems a Treasurer might have with their bottom line.
This government has not acted to protect inter-generational equity in six years of office. We should not believe them now.
The PBS was never meant to be about some imaginary `balance' of contributions between the government and individual citizens. Indeed, the whole point of our universal health system is to recognise that a body such as government with $170 billion in income a year has a lot more resources than a family on $40,000 a year to pay for medical treatment.
Just have a look at what cowards they really are. Instead of calling a spade a spade, in the budget papers this government called their thwarted price hikes for prescription medicine: “realigning patient co-payments and safety nets”. What absolute nonsense. A price hike is a price hike is a price hike.
If there are problems with PBS it is not with patients. It is with the approval process multinational drug companies have to undergo to get their products onto the scheme. Jacking up prices isn't going fix the problem of an inappropriate drug being placed on the scheme, potentially costing hundreds of millions of dollars to government each year.
And if PBS is meant to make people well, how is it going to do that if citizens are avoiding using necessary medicines because of cost and then landing themselves in hospital—at great public expense—because their conditions was not addressed at an early stage?
If we're going to go down the path of balance, then the government should commit to reducing contributions to PBS when it saves money through efficiency gains, or when outlays on drugs fall. That's a true representation of a `balanced' system, but we hear nothing of the sort from this lot in their mean-spirited attempts to undermine universal health care in this country.
If there such a lack of money floating around and there really has to be cuts to the health budget then, why was PBS the first program to be lined up against the wall? I would like to know if the government considered the ballooning cost of the 30% private health insurance rebate when it sought to save money in the health budget. Billions of dollars a year—not all of it going to needy middle income families—is spent on this Howard Government initiative. And I wonder who needs the money more. Millionaires in Double Bay on premium private health cover or working families struggling to pay for essential medicine for their sick kids or themselves.
While this government bankrolls another $107 million—on top of the extra $20 billion or so it has already promised—to the Defence Department in 2002-3, it doesn't seem to care about how it is consistently failing job seekers.
The job seeker account is one policy that really takes the cake in terms of being a total waste of time.
I find it offensive that as a representatives of the jobless in this chamber, that the Australian Government thinks giving $11 over 12 months— that's right, less than a dollar a month—in some way helps people to find jobs.
$11 will buy you just one return train fare from Campbelltown to Sydney. It gets you two hours in an Internet cafe. And it buys you 1/3 of the cheapest tie on sale in Grace Bros. or Myer.
If the Government gets its way and you happen to have been shoved from the Disability Support Pension to the Job Network, then $11 will probably get you half a cab fare to a job interview. This policy is a disgrace.
To get access to the big bickies—$935—you have to wait twelve months. Twelve months is too long for the long term unemployed to have to wait for decent support in the quest for meaningful work. Twelve months is too long for a disabled person with expensive medical overheads to wait before they have a shot at boosting their income.
But at least after this Budget we can we own more guns.
If you're lucky enough to be a multinational company you won't have to wait twelve months for anything though with this government—they hand you the cash to fatten your bottom line. But just as small players like ordinary people get dudded in health and welfare, small and medium enterprises get dudded by this Government's industry policy too.
Let's look at the impact of the Government's policy on the manufacturing sector and industry generally since it was first elected in 1996—particularly their appalling decisions to simply cut off a number of vital programs over the last year. These are cuts that have left hundreds of companies wondering what on earth this government is doing.
They promised 200 000 new jobs. The net result was a loss of 88 000 jobs—$5 billion has been cut from industry assistance.
Backing Australia's Ability is a furphy. It is Back-loaded to 2004-5 and much of its promises are merely loans rather than extra funding grants.
Our Research and development investment is less than half the OECD average. Expressed in percentage terms, in 14 OECD countries R & D worked out at 6.6% of manufacturing value added, while in Australia in 1999 it came to 3%.
This government has halved the money going the Export Market Development Scheme, and all this is before we even look at the mess Industry Minister Ian MacFarlane has been presiding over.
Everywhere you turn this government seems to have managed to stuff up another industry program, cut us out of another export market, left another company's funding application sit on a desk for months.
Regional Australia, Departmental cuts, R & D start, EPICS and PICS, TCF cuts, Rio Tinto and Comalco.
I had an unfortunate wake up call to the Government's attitude to regional manufacturing when I conducting several regional tours earlier this year.
Yes, regional manufacturing has some excellent success stories. Yes, there are indeed signs of strong growth. But no thanks can go to the government on this front.
In the absence of any resources or desire to seek out the needs of small and medium enterprises looking to break into tough global markets-these companies have had to band together and fend for themselves. That's right—with basically no government assistance grassroots networks are forming to share the skills, the training and the contacts necessary for our companies to compete overseas. They would be able to do it a lot quicker, and lot easier if this government was prepared to come to the party.
When it's targeted correctly more government support = more jobs = more growth = more security. The Pacific Solution won't provide lasting security to Australian families, but some decent forward thinking industry policy might.
The recent Budget Estimates hearings for the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources reveal a stunning lack of resourcing to one of our most vital departments.
Let me run through the facts:
·	167 jobs cut or to be cut in the coming months—that's 10% of the whole department—gone.
·	$128m cut from annual department funding—another 10% simply not there to assist industry development.
The government is also proposing to double the number of Exporters operating in Australia. And what are they doing to achieve that? Giving an extra $400,000 a year to the Export Market Development Scheme.
The government is giving just 2 cents from every Australian's tax bill to further develop our export potential. It's a joke Madam President.
For the uninitiated R & D start is a program providing funding in advance to small companies needing to expand research and development. Or at least it was.
But in January 23 this year the Government was told that because of the usefulness of the program all money allocated to it, would be spent well before the end of the financial year. What did this government do?
·	Did it deliver the $40m extra funding needed to invest in Australia's long-term economic growth? No.
·	Did it let companies know so they could factor this information into their budget considerations? No.
·	Did they develop a timeline for renewing application processing? No. This government chose to simply keep the public and industry in the dark about their stuff-up.
·	And what happened when they finally went public in late April? For the first time 115 companies found out that this government had left them high and dry, with no advice or support to address the situation.
·	And did we get a solution in the Budget in May? No.
It's a similar story wherever you turn in industry policy these days.
The Printing Industry Association of Australia certainly has some choice words about the Government's budget and policy priorities. A letter from the Printing Industries Association to the Minister protesting at the Government's decision to break their 1998 election and GST compensation promises by ending two Printing Industry Competitiveness Schemes said it all.
They've lost “confidence and trust in the government ... Not only was the decision to prematurely terminate the schemes made without any industry consultation, but no coherent or cogent justification was given. This compounds the damage done when your government terminated the Book Bounty scheme in a similarly abrupt manner.”
And they've got good reason to be angry. 41 companies, including many from regional areas, will lose $3million because of the cuts to the PICS and EPICS schemes.
The Printing Industry has a friend in the Australian Meat Council who've condemned the Government's blase approach to our agricultural trading relationship with the USA.
“I'm speechless,” said Dennis Carl, a director of the Australian Meat Council “As far as I'm concerned the Minister isn't taking this issue seriously.
Beef's not the only thing the Government isn't taking seriously. Or at least that's the message they've given to TCF manufacturers who've just been told their
- Market Development Program
- Technology Development Fund and the
- National Framework for Excellence in Training HAVE BEEN AXED.
If that's their idea of a smooth transition to free trade in TCF, I'd hate to see how they treat industries they don't like. Or perhaps we need only to look to jobseekers to answer that question.
Unlike the TCF industry, Rio Tinto, who rake in an after tax global profit of over $1.5billion annually—and brought union bashing to new levels in Australia—are being looked after nicely by the Government.
They're getting $125m with few questions asked for a project that will make them a packet. No dividends will be returned to the government for their outlay. If that's not enough, Rio Tinto's subsidiary, Comalco is getting a $138 interest free loan not repayable for at least 25 years.
Nice work if you can get it.
But that sums up the 2002 Budget, really. Money for rich companies. Money for guns and tanks—but nothing for those who want to invest in a knowledge nation and Australia's economic future. And nothing for those who need it most.
Senator Conroy's speech read as follows—
I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03, Appropriation Bill (No.2) 2002-03 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2002-03.
These bills provide us with an opportunity to assess the Government's performance in fiscal management and its honesty with the Australian people.
Prior to the election the Treasurer promised a surplus. In his own words:
“We are giving a guarantee that we will keep the budget in surplus, yes we are.”
What he has delivered is a deficit of $3 billion in 2001-02.
In fact, the budget will be in cumulative deficit over three years.
The deficit is the direct result of the Government's pre-election spending spree.
And the deficit comes despite deep cuts to health and welfare payments.
Proposed changes to the Disability Support Payment arrangements would have cut the support of hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities by $52 per fortnight by 2004-05.
Proposed changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would have resulted in the cost of essential medicines rising by 30%.
Labor opposed these changes and we also opposed the Government's proposal to give a tax break to high-income earners on their superannuation.
Instead Labor proposed viable alternatives that achieved the same outcome but shared the burden for the Government's past fiscal mistakes more evenly rather than targeting the poorest and most vulnerable Australians.
The Government claimed that proposed cuts in health and welfare payments were justified by the War on Terrorism.
However, the numbers just don't add up.
The Government is cutting $2.6 billion from the health and welfare budgets but spending $2.3 billion on the War Against Terrorism and Border Protection.
But the fiddles don't end there.
The Treasurer has long extolled the virtues of accrual accounting saying it would result in:
“more transparent and informative public accounts”.
The Treasurer committed the Government to achieving fiscal balance—that is balance based on the accrual method—over the economic cycle.
However, in this latest budget the Treasurer has chosen to focus on the old measure of the budget balance: the cash balance.
Why? Because it looks better than the fiscal balance.
On this measure the Treasurer has only delivered a budget deficit of $1.2 billion in 2001-02.
Why is there a deficit?
The budget balance is inevitably be influenced by cyclical factors.
Revenues will rise and expenditure will fall during periods of strong economic growth and the reverse will occur when the economy slows.
That, at least, is the theory.
The Treasurer has waxed lyrical about the strong economic performance of the Australian economy.
He has raved about the resilience of growth in the face of global weakness.
Yet despite the fact that Australia has enjoyed a decade of growth....
Despite delivering this budget in a year when the economy grew by 4 per cent...
The Treasurer has delivered a deficit.
To achieve a deficit against a background of sustained growth is an extraordinary achievement.
Even using the Treasurer's preferred measure-the cash balance-the deterioration in the budget is remarkable.
In 1998-99, the Treasurer estimates that the 2001-02 budget would show a surplus of $14.6 billion.
Yet by the time the budget was brought down, it had collapsed into a $1.2 billion deficit.
The deterioration is not cyclical.
It is not the result of an unfavourable economic environment.
Rather it is the result of an explosion in spending in recent years and in particular in the run-up to the last election.
And it gets worse.
The Government has delivered a deficit despite the fact that it is the highest taxing Government in Australian history.
Data provided by the Auditor General to Senate Estimates confirm that Peter Costello is the highest taxing Treasurer of all time.
Peter Costello seeks to hide this fact by arbitrarily excluding the GST from his budget in breach of Australian Accounting Standards.
When GST is added back in, the real tax take in 2002-03 is around $200 billion dollars.
Commonwealth taxes now account for 25 percent of the economy's output.
In other words, one dollar in every four generated by Australians each year goes to the Treasurer's coffers.
Taxpayers are paying more in income tax today than they were before the income tax cut that was meant to compensate them for the GST.
What's more, the budget would still be in deficit in the next financial year was it not for three accounting fiddles.
First, the Budget Papers state that “Defence has rephased $150 million of its specialist military equipment acquisition program from 2002-03 to 2003-04.”
When Finance officials were asked at Senate estimates what this meant they explained:
“Essentially it (expenditure on specialist military equipment) has been shifted from 2002-03 to 2003-04 “It is $150 million off (expenditure in) 2002-03”?
Secondly, Finance officials were also asked at Senate Estimates what was meant the budget decision to “reschedule” the roads budget and they explained that:
“It is a deferral of expenditure. It is $200 million in 2002-2003”?
Thirdly, the Budget Papers also states that $40 million of welfare reform measures had been rescheduled, including the working credit measure.
All three measures-$150 million of spending on specialist military equipment, $200 million of spending on roads and $40 million of spending on welfare reform measures or a total of $390 million-were election commitments contained in the Charter of Budget Honesty that the Government has now broken.
More importantly, were it not for these $390 million of broken election promises and budget fiddles the Government would deliver a second budget deficit in 2002-03.
I would like to talk now about asset sales.
It is a common misperception that asset sale proceeds have no direct impact on the budget bottom line.
This is true of proceeds from the sale of financial assets such as Sydney Airports.
However, the proceeds from the sale of non-financial assets such as property and land are treated as revenue and therefore do directly impact the budget bottom line.
The proceeds from such sales have amounted to around $10 billion over the last six years.
And these sale proceeds went directly into the Treasurer's coffers.
The Treasurer has sold off our assets for a $10 billion windfall and yet he has still managed to deliver a deficit.
And of course the disastrous mismanagement of the property sale process has been well documented.
Only last week an Auditor General report highlighted the Government's appalling mismanagement of its $15 billion Defence property portfolio.
The report revealed that the Government is selling and then leasing back properties when it has no idea on how much they cost to operate.
How can the Government make sound commercial decisions about these sales, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, when they do not know what it costs to maintain the buildings?
The Audit Office also raised this issue in December 2000, but the Government has done nothing to fix the problem.
This is not new.
The Government often ignores warnings from the Auditor General at great cost to the taxpayer.
For example, they failed to respond to his concerns about the management of currency risk raised in May 2000.
By this point the Defence Department had incurred losses of almost $3 billion as a result of adverse currency movements.
The Government failed to respond and Defence has since lost another $800 million.
This is more than the entire cost of the war on terrorism.
If you need an explanation for the proposed savage cuts in the health and welfare budgets, you need to look no further than the Government appalling management of foreign currency risk.
$3.8 billion dollar of currency losses later, the Government finally responded to the Auditor General's recommendations this year.
The Auditor General recommended that the Government adopt an overarching policy to manage foreign currency risk and end automatic appropriations to agency budgets to compensate them for currency movements.
What we actually got was a non-policy.
The Government argues there is no need to manage our foreign currency risk because we have a natural hedge.
A natural hedge means that assets and revenues in US dollars are broadly equal to expenses and liabilities, so that any movement in the exchange has no meaningful impact on the budget.
The only problem is there is no natural hedge.
If there was a natural hedge on revenues and expenses, the $3.8 billion of currency losses could never have been incurred.
Senate Estimates revealed that the Government's US dollar liabilities managed by the AOFM are currently almost $18 billion.
Compare this the net foreign exchange reserve assets of $7 billion reported for May in the latest Reserve Bank Bulletin.
There is no natural hedge.
When taken together with the Treasurer's $5 billion of gambling losses on foreign currency swaps, total losses due to currency mismanagement amount to almost $9 billion.
It's getting easier to see how the Treasurer has run the budget into deficit.
One of the key implications of the Government's poor fiscal management is higher interest rates.
The Prime Minister himself made the argument on October 25th last year when he said:
“I do not believe we should go into deficit and we won't go into deficit if we are re-elected. Once you start with deficits they get bigger and bigger ... you end up with higher interest rates, higher unemployment”.
Well the Government has delivered a deficit.
And the Reserve Bank has raised interest rates and the expectation is for further rate rises in coming months.
Research presented at Senate estimates explains just why families were feeling under financial pressure even before the Treasurer tried to slug them with a 30% increase in the cost of essential medicines.
Deutsche Bank calculated the interest payments Australian households would have to make if the official cash rate rises to 6 per cent.
6% is the level suggested by Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane in his recent testimony to the House Economics Committee.
The research showed that at 6% interest rates, Australian families would be paying a larger share of their income on their mortgage than at any time in the past 15 years.
And the reason for this is because Australian families are now carrying more debt than at any other time in Australia's history.
National Accounts data for the December quarter 2001 shows that household debt had soared to almost $560 billion.
That's an average of $78,000 per household in Australia compared to $41,000 when the Government first came to power.
And the level of debt compared to household income stands at a record 119 percent.
The bottom line for Australian families, Treasurer, is that under your management Australians now owe more money than they earn each year.
And they are soon likely to be paying more of their monthly budget on mortgage payments than at any time in the last 15 years.
I would now like to move on to what the Treasurer fondly refers to as “below the line”.
One of the more interesting revelations in this year's Budget Papers is the Government's secret plan for the use of the proceeds of asset sales, including Telstra.
On the face of it, the Budget Paper's suggest that the Government will use asset sale proceeds to pay down debt.
And this implies that the Government bond market will virtually disappear by 2005-06.
The Treasurer has long maintained that sale proceeds will be used to retire debt.
As recently as his post budget address to the Press Club on May 15 he said:
“the proceeds of Telstra ... would allow the Commonwealth to completely retire all of its debt. That is, the Commonwealth would not be carrying any debt”.?
He went on to say:
“we have always said that our programme is to retire debt”.
And to ensure he had made his point, the Treasurer said:
“So the forecast surpluses would be applied to debt retirement and the proceeds of asset sales, if that were to proceed, would also be applied (to debt retirement).”
However, Senate Estimates revealed that the Treasurer is considering quite a different option.
The Treasurer is considering using asset sale proceeds to buy other assets and keep the bond market alive.
Treasury officials said..
“A necessary consequence of maintaining a bond market around the current levels or at any particular level would be the accumulation of assets”
When asked about the type of assets that would be considered they said:
“You might move into equities ... and you would have to make a decision whether you were going to restrict your activities to, for example Australian or international assets, and ... about whether you were prepared to take an open foreign currency position or not”.
So the Government is considering whether the sell its shares in Telstra to buy shares in other companies.
And some of these companies could be international.
So the Government may sell its shares in Telstra and end up buying shares in Microsoft.
The Southern Cross Syndicate that bought Sydney airports this week is considering a public float of the company.
So in the future, the Government may end up once again owning shares in Sydney Airports ... and in Qantas and in the Commonwealth Bank
The Treasurer has argued that asset purchases are only one option being considered.
However, as the Treasurer's own Parliamentary Secretary, Senator Campbell admitted to Estimates:
“It is an issue that is before the Treasurer at the moment”.
And as the Treasurer's own departmental officials admitted, the Budget Paper's already assume that the Government will have a very substantial asset portfolio.
You have to dig deep, but on page 12-10 in Budget Paper No. 1 there is a line item in the table Interest and Dividend Revenue” which rises from $500 million in 2002-03 to over $2 billion in 2005-06.
When pressed at Senate Estimates, officials admitted that this was based on an assumption that assets would be accumulated over the forward years.
When pressed at to how big an asset portfolio, they did not challenge a suggestion that on a 5% rate of return, $2 billion in income suggested a $40 billion asset portfolio.
The Finance Minister has, however, seen the folly of the Treasurer's plan.
In response to a question without notice in the Senate, Senator Minchin made it very clear that he does not believe the Government should even be considering the purchase of assets, in particular shares.
He said:
“... it is my view that it is highly unlikely that the government would ever be in a situation where it would be investing in other market shares. That I think is a most unattractive option, and entirely inconsistent with our whole approach to debt reduction and management of Commonwealth government finances. We don't want to be a shareholder, that's the whole point.
Of course for Labor the issue of what to do with the proceeds from the sale of Telstra does not emerge.
The Labor party remains committed to retaining public ownership of Telstra.
The only issue for Labor is how to ensure a competitive telecommunications market for all consumers and businesses.
Finally I would like to turn to an issue that emerged in the Budget Papers that has serious implications for the accountability of Government and transparency of the budget process.
The Auditor General's recent report on Agency Banking showed that the mismanagement of the incentive scheme introduced to encourage agencies to outsource their banking had cost taxpayers $150 million over three years.
Worse still, in its third year of operation, the Finance Department attempted to hide their mismanagement of the scheme and its mounting losses by simply not making an appropriation for the scheme in 2001-02.
To achieve this the Department employed creative accounting techniques that would have made Enron and WorldCom blush.
To get the offending transaction off the books, they simply transferred the appropriation to an account called the Crown.
The Committee asked what exactly the Crown was and no adequate answer was forthcoming.
This establishes a dangerous precedent whereby agencies could avoid seeking an appropriation for government expenditure that they are not keen to explain ...
And in doing so avoid scrutiny and accountability of the use of taxpayer's money.
Fortunately, in its most recent Portfolio Budget Statement, the Finance Department has seen the error of its ways and included an appropriation for interest payments.
The Crown-whatever that was-has disappeared from the Department's Portfolio Budget Statement.
And the Committee sought and received an assurance that the Crown will not be used in this way again.
However, it was with great concern that I read the Auditor General report on DASFLEET tabled today (yesterday if after midnight).
The report savages the Government's management of the sale and leaseback of Commonwealth vehicles.
Settlement of the dispute cost taxpayers over $20 million plus a further $11 million in legal and management costs.
But the report also noted that the funds were not separately appropriated for but paid from a standing appropriation.
Is this another example of Finance bending the rules in order to avoid drawing attention to its mistakes?
I assure you that this is a question that I will be putting to the Finance Minister and in due course Finance officials at Senate Estimates.
However, the report notes:
In conclusion
The Treasurer guaranteed a surplus before the election.
He delivered a deficit.
And the budget would still be in deficit next year were it not for his accounting tricks.
And the deficit comes despite proposed deep cuts in expenditure targeted at the most vulnerable Australians.
Labour has proposed viable alternatives that would not alter the overall outcome but would share the burden for the Government's mistakes more fairly.
The Treasurer blames the War on Terrorism for the deficit.
But the numbers don't add up.
The real reason was the vote-buying spending spree prior to the election and the Treasurer knows it.
The Government has delivered a deficit despite 10 years of economic growth.
Mr Costello has delivered a deficit despite being the highest taxing Treasurer of all time.
Despite grabbing one dollar in every four generated by the Australian economy.
Despite a $10 billion windfall from non-financial assets sales which the Treasurer has frittered away.
Of course, $3.8 billion alone has been lost through currency mismanagement.
$800 million after the Auditor General had warned the Government to take action on this front.
$800 million is more than the entire cost of the War on Terrorism.
In May the Finance Minister announced a non-policy for managing currency risk that relies on the flawed premise that there is a natural hedge.
Minister, there is no natural hedge.
And this takes no account of the Treasurers own $5 billion of losses gambling taxpayer's money in international currency markets.
What is the implication of the deficit?
As the Prime Minister himself explained before the election: higher interest rates and higher unemployment.
The Reserve Bank has duly raised interest rates and further rises are expected.
If cash rates reach 6%, as the Governor has suggested, Australian families will have to set aside a higher share of their monthly budget to pay for their mortgage than at any other time in the last 15 years.
The Senate Estimates process also revealed the Treasurer's secret plan to break his promise to use asset sale proceeds to pay down Government debt.
The Treasurer is instead considering using the proceeds to build a massive portfolio of assets that could encompass international shares.
The Treasurer is considering selling Telstra to buy Microsoft.
The Finance Minister disagrees with the Treasurer arguing the `Government should not own shares ... that is the whole point of selling Telstra'.
This is not an issue for Labor who remains committed to retaining a stake in Telstra.
The only focus for Labor is delivering competitive and efficient communications services to consumers and business, in particular those in rural and regional Australia.
The Government's financial management record now lies in tatters.
The Government's dishonesty now lies exposed.
Labor is committed to ensuring that it is the Government, not low-income earners and the sick, that are held to account.
—On behalf of Senator Conroy, I move the following amendment on sheet 2573:

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-06-27,"—I have no comment on the amendment, but I seek leave to incorporate a speech which was circulated three hours ago—people have probably forgotten what is in it—on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2002-2003, the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2002-2003.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
As we come together to vote on these bills tonight we demonstrate that we are not blocking the budget, but making a better budget.
These Appropriations bills authorise the Minister for Finance to issue the required funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to enable the ongoing activities of Government.
In passing these Bills we pass what is widely referred to as supply. We are not obstructing the operations of the Government. We will be allowing them to go on with the core activities of Government.
However, we will be performing the role people expect us to when they vote Democrat in the Senate. We will scrutinise the Governments strategy, expose its flaws and protect the vulnerable from a Government that has already become arrogant with its power.
While we will pass these bills I want to lodge our philosophical objection to a number of things continued in these bills. We will address these concerns, and where necessary stop their implementation when they come before the Senate in other legislation.
In any budget there are the macro issues of the nation's economic settings and the micro issues of particular measures and initiatives.
This budget revealed that the Howard/Costello Government abandoned its commitment to macroeconomic settings in its pre-election fluster. It went on a huge spending spree in the lead up to the last election that turned the budget to a $3 billion deficit in accrual terms.
Mr Costello would have us believe that this is due to the tragic events of September 11, but the War on Terror accounts for just 10% of that deficit. The majority of the deficit is due to the Government's election pork-barrelling.
This is despite the fact that Government revenue is running at 38% of GDP, up from 32% of GDP when they came to office. These numbers—when combined with the growth rates—mean that this Government is spending in the order of $40 billion more per year than they were they came to power. And still we are in deficit.
Deficit spending at this time of the economic cycle is irresponsible, and Australians are wearing the costs in the form of increased interest rates. And they will be paying the costs for some time. Interest rates are set to continue to rise by as much as 2% over the next 2 years.
These interest rates will hit doubly hard because the Governments approach to spending its huge revenue was to encourage the expansion of household debt, rather than to invest in our future.
The Treasurer has failed in is role of providing oversight to the financial matters of the nation as we watch an explosion in household debt. As interest rates rise, this debt will become crippling for many Australians.
As a result, the Australian Democrats advocate fiscal responsibility. We consider that recurrent spending should be in surplus in these boom times. We would consider making important capital investments in Australia's long-term future, but recurrent spending should be in surplus.
However, the Australian Democrats have very different views to the Government on how this surplus should be achieved.
This Government has repeatedly robbed the least well off to pork barrel marginal voters.
This Government ran up a huge deficit in the lead up to the election, and now it wants the poor, the sick and the vulnerable to pay for it.
The priorities of this Government are very clear. On the one hand, we have tax cuts in the superannuation surcharge for those earning over $85,000 per year. A handout of $370 million over four years to Australia's wealthiest 3%.
And, yet, the Governments major cost cutting measures, increasing PBS prescription co-payments hit concession card holders.
Department officials acknowledged in estimates that about half of the $1.1 billion dollars raised by the measure will come from concession card holders.
Concession card holders are pensioners, low income people and health care card holders.
The Government acknowledges that the co-payments rise is just a revenue raising measure. It will do nothing to address the deeper issues of the PBS. Can you think of a more regressive, more unjust revenue raising measure?
That is only the beginning. Then we have the restrictions to the eligibility criteria for the disabilities support pension. They want to pay for tax cuts to the superannuation surcharge for people on $85,000 by cutting the benefits to marginally employed disabled people.
To keep our election promises, the Australian Democrats must stop these measures. We are not doing it here in the Appropriations Bills, but we will do it in other issue specific legislation.
Instead, we suggest the Government meet its fiscal responsibilities by reigning in the disastrous Private Health Insurance Rebate.
The Private Health Insurance rebate has comprehensively failed to achieve its goal of expanding private health insurance coverage, increasing coverage by less than 3% in the first 18 months of operation.
The bulk of the $10 billion scheme has become a handout to the wealthiest one third of Australians. A 10% cut to the massive scheme would cover the co-payments rise, but Mr Costello won't hear of it.
Australians have choices about how we reign in this Government's electoral spending spree. The Australian Democrats will make sure it is achieved by tackling the big issues, and not through bandaid solutions that hit the sick and the poor.
Then there is the War on Terrorism.
The security and border protection expenditure sounds a lot if you aggregate the costs over five years, but it is still only one quarter of the costs of the Private Health Insurance rebate.
This Government has taken three buckets of money. One small bucket and two very large buckets. The Government has said they are all because of the War on Terrorism.
The small bucket is the actual costs of the War on Terrorism. There is $194 million being spent on military commitments resulting from the September 11 attacks. We support this funding. It is vital that if we send troops into the field, we resource them.
Then there is a much bigger bucket, $1.3 billion for making Australia safer from
terrorism.
We will look at all of these expenditures one by one. If the Government's priorities are anything like their Anti-Terrorist legislation, Australians should be very afraid. The focus on increased security is prudent. But it is vital that in protecting ourselves from terrorism, we do not sacrifice everything we are trying to protect.
Then we come to the third bucket of security money. This to prevent asylum seekers reaching our shores. This bucket does not belong with defence spending. It belongs with our social policy discussions. The Howard/Costello Government are trying to convince Australians that the most pressing problem facing Australia at the current time is the trickle of women and children in leaky boats. They act as if our problems are not long term unemployment, or environmental degradation, or poverty or suicide. It is a few thousand terrified people asking for our help.
The Australian Democrats are appalled that this is how the Howard Government is going to squander the fruits of the economic boom. Not only are they not investing in our future. They are actively undermining it.
They are attacking Australia's social fabric. They are propagating the myth that refugees are Australia's biggest threat. They have replaced hope with fear.
This is a vital time in Australian history. We have a once in a generation opportunity. When the Howard Government squander this opportunity, it is not just a cost for now. They are costing us the opportunity to set ourselves up for the 25 years to come. The Treasurer's attempt at vision proved that had none. This is the time that we should be healing our social fabric and tackling the big challenges of our age, making bold inroads into our environmental crises and equipping ourselves for a rapidly evolving world.
I will finish by acknowledging the positive measures in the Budget that the Democrats welcome. Some of them are actually initiatives we proposed.
These include the Government's increased benefits for the aged, for some veterans and for most war widows.
The Australian Democrats have welcomed and support the introduction of guaranteed minimum levels of service in the Job Network.
And we acknowledge greater funding for e-security, which recognises the increasing need for a safe and secure electronic operating environment for both the private and public sectors.
The Democrats welcome the increased capacity for the Health Insurance Commission to identify `doctor shopping' for inappropriate medicines, as well as fraudulent PBS practices by pharmacies.
There are funds to improve patient access to radiation oncology services in rural and regional areas and extra grants to drug treatment organisations.
Overall, there are not a lot of positive measures and that is not only disappointing but surprising.
We pass these Appropriations Bills tonight, but we will do the job we were elected to and reform this budget as it comes through the House in other Bills.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,53,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2002-06-27,"—Madam President, I also seek leave to incorporate a speech on the second reading debate.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
I would like to make some brief comments tonight in relation to one particular aspect of the Appropriations Bills that is of great importance to the Australian book printing and publishing industries.
I would like to congratulate the Government on its decision earlier today to restore funding to the Enhanced Printing Industries Competitiveness Scheme, or EPICS.
This decision has been warmly received by the book printing industry, which regards the EPICS program as a “strategically successful scheme.”
It is a key means by which the industry can reposition itself in the very competitive international market by investing in:
·	new technologies
·	R&D
·	infrastructure development
·	industry analysis and market development, and
·	training and skills development.
Investment in each of these areas is essential if Australian companies are to gain a more secure foothold in the emerging knowledge management domain—and our book printing industry is no different.
As Senators may recall, the EPICS program was a key plank of the Book Industry Assistance Package that the Government and the Australian Democrats negotiated as part of our agreement on the GST reform package in 1999. The Government agreed to put this assistance package in place to safeguard the book printing industry against any negative impacts that the tax reforms might have on the price of Australian books.
As part of the GST negotiations, the Democrats received a written undertaking from the Prime Minister to the effect that no changes would be made to the tax agreement without prior consultation with our Party.
The EPICS program was instituted in 2000, and some $48 million was allocated to be spent over the next four years on projects that encourage innovation, business development and skills formation in the Australian book printing industry.
So on behalf of the Australian Printing Industry, the Democrats welcome the Government's decision to stick to this agreement and honour its commitment in terms of the EPICS program.
By reinstating the promised funds for the EPICS program, the Government has acknowledged that in the broader Budget picture, the potential benefits to be reaped from the full implementation of the EPICS program far outweigh the marginal and very short-term monetary benefits associated with its axing.
On behalf of the Democrats, I would like to extend the Party's thanks and congratulations to the Australian book printing industry, and Mr Gary Donnison of the Printing Industries Association of Australia in particular, for their efforts to highlight just what would be at stake if the EPICS program was not allowed to run its full course, and why the Government needed to reconsider its decision from Budget night.
I am conscious of the need for brevity tonight, but I think it is important to refer to some of the reasons why the Government has made a very wise decision today, and one which is in the long-term economic interests of this country.
Firstly, I would like to remind Senators of the size and value of Australia's book production and printing industry:
·	it is made up of 6,000 companies and 120,000 employees;
·	it is larger that the car and TCF industries combined; and in comparison to these industries
·	book producers and printers receive relatively little direct support from Government.
At the time that the Budget decision to cut funds to the EPICS program was taken, AusIndustry was considering a total of 74 applications from 41 companies.
Each company had invested significant amounts of money and other resources to undertake the research and financial planning that was required to lodge a strong application under the EPICS program. The printing industry estimated that collectively, these 79 companies had invested $3 million in their applications to the program.
In addition, AusIndustry had committed funding to the tune of about $28 million for 300 projects, some of which are underway.
So the sudden halt to the program that was announced on Budget night had serious financial consequences for a number companies, and cast a dark cloud over the future economic viability and employment capacity of others, particularly in regional Australia.
And all of this at a time when the industry was just beginning to invest in new infrastructure, strategic business plans and technological innovation (in part as a result of EPICS) that would help Australia become the centre of high-quality book production in the Asia-Pacific region.
I want to refer to one example of a company that had applied for funding under the EPICS program and had a great deal at stake as a result of the premature axing of the program. The example of CCH that I want to refer to tonight is not exceptional—it just demonstrates the position that most of the 79 companies that had lodged applications found themselves in on Budget night.
CCH Australia has operated in the Australian market for over 30 years and has particular expertise in the publication of legal books. It also has a long-standing relationship with McPherson Print Group for the provision of all of its print requirements.
Under the EPICS scheme, CCH intended to undertake a corporate Business Plan as well as a major internal change process, which it referred to as “Next Generation Publishing”.
The purpose of the CCH Business Plan was to draw together the existing business plans operating in each of the publisher's divisions, so it could better co-ordinate all decision-making processes across its divisions. A further intended benefit was the relocation to Australia of all printing being done offshore for its Asia and New Zealand subsidiaries. This would have amounted to more than $20 million worth of new business for local printers each year.
The “Next Generation Publishing” component of CCH's application was costed at $1.5 million over 9 months, and aimed to develop a common framework for content creation and delivery across all of its divisions in the Asia/Pacific region. The overall benefits expected from NGP were better quality content; shorter updating and production times; and easier reuse of content.
CCH's application for funding of the Business Plan was lodged in October 2001 and for NGP was lodged in April 2002. Whilst I note that CCH's applications did not reach the AusIndustry approving committee prior to Budget night, and therefore have not been funded, I think the reinstatement of the EPICS program gives the company hope that its plans may yet win Government support.
But, up until tonight, CCH felt that it was actually worse off than it was 2 years ago when the EPICS program was first introduced. It had expended many hours and considerable resources in the development of these two funding applications— only to have the program pulled at the critical moment.
CCH was forced to put the plan to repatriate the printing being undertaken in Asia and New Zealand “on hold”—knowing that without the injection of EPICS funds, it simply could not embark on the scale of investment required to make it a leader in the domestic industry.
It is when you closely examine how the untimely withdrawal of the EPICS program would have impacted on individual companies like CCH that you begin to get some picture of just how valuable its restoration will be to the book printing industry and the Australian economy.
And I want to point out that some of these rewards will take time—they are medium to long-term investments. EPICS is a program that cannot be judged and evaluated in the space of one budget cycle—and I hope that Government will not go down this road.
Conclusion
The Australian economy can expect to benefit handsomely from the repositioning the Australian book printing industry so that it is technologically smarter and more internationally competitive. It is these qualities that will put the industry on the trajectory from small to medium enterprises, to best practice world leaders. And it is programs like the EPICS scheme that are instrumental in making this transition happen.
That is why the Democrats welcome the Government's decision today to restore funding to the EPICS program today.
However, we would like to flag our intention to continue discussions with the Government about the importance of also restoring funding to the Printing Industry Competitiveness Scheme or PICS, which was cut from the Budget.
This subsidy scheme was introduced in 1999 to help partly offset the tariff-inflated prices of paper and paperboard used in the production of books, in recognition that books imported into Australia pay no such duties and therefore have an unfair competitive advantage. The amount of money we are talking about here is about $6 million over the next twelve months, which I think is a modest amount to fulfil the Government's commitment to the industry to develop a stronger, sustainable printing industry.
But these are discussions that will occur in the near future and in the spirit of good faith that led to the restoration of funding to the EPICS program.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-06-27,"—I seek leave to incorporate a copy of my adjournment speech.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Tonight I stand to again speak to the Senate about the crisis in Zimbabwe. Many of my parliamentary colleagues are acutely aware of my personal interest in the turmoil that is wreaking havoc with the lives of millions of Zimbabwean citizens and its economy. I thank many of them for the efforts they have made in the interests of Zimbabwe. They know as I do that the Shona, N'debele and other peoples of Zimbabwe deserve much better than they are getting from their leaders.
Zimbabwe is far distant from Australia but we are intimately tied to it because of the many Australians who have friends and relatives who are desperately trying to survive events in that strife-torn country. We are intimately tied to it because as international citizens we cannot and must not ignore the human rights abuses that occur and have occurred there. We are intimately tied to it because of our support for international condemnation of the racist corrupt murderous and incompetent Mugabe regime. Lastly we are intimately tied to it because of our nation's commercial interests.
The catalyst for this, my fourth adjournment speech on Zimbabwe is yesterday's deadline for 2443 commercial farmers in Zimbabwe to stop farming or risk being jailed under the country's compulsory land acquisition laws.
I am a supporter of land reform in Zimbabwe, and the Zimbabwe opposition has a proposed programme that would achieve land reform, and retain the capacity of Zimbabwe to not only feed itself, but export food—a previous capacity that the Mugabe regime has destroyed. The importance of productive commercial farms to Zimbabwe's economy cannot be underestimated. Previously Zimbabwe's commercial farms allowed it to feed itself and generate very large sums of vital foreign exchange through significant exports. Two years ago I asserted that if existing commercial farmers were forced to leave the land, Zimbabwe would lose its ability to feed itself and to earn much of its foreign exchange. That has happened.
Now let's deal with Mr Mugabe's real motives for his land campaign. The following communication is reportedly accurate: For obvious reasons I will not name anyone.
“The new owners of Zimbabwe's commercial farms are not farmers at all. They are not graduates from our agricultural schools and colleges. They are not young men and women who are ready to toil under the baking African sun tending crops and livestock. The new owners of Zimbabwe's farms include the following people: Vice Presidents Muzenda and Msika; the Ministers of Transport, Industry, State, Energy, Defence, Higher Education and Youth; the Deputy Ministers of Health, Employment Creation, Justice and Local Government; the Mayor of Bindura and ex-Mayor of Chitungwiza; six MPs; five Permanent Secretary's; four Governors; four District Administrators and two Provincial Administrators. From our armed and security forces are the Com-missioner of Police, his deputy and the ZRP official spokesperson. The Head of the Prisons service, chief prison officer and his deputy, two retired army generals, six brigadiers, a colonel, major and wing commander. From our judiciary beneficiaries so far named include the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, three lawyers, one attorney and one retired Judge. From the state owned television service, beneficiaries include ZBC Chief Correspondent Reuben Barwe, anchorman Supa Mandiwanzira and Head of Sports Admire Taderera. The VIP beneficiaries have got farms ranging in size from 300 to 1200 hectares which include the houses, infrastructure and equipment.
The list of Zimbabwe's new commercial farmers is a Who's Who in Zanu PF. It is a list of the people who have been at the forefront of what has been called Zimbabwe's Third Chimurenga. Our government got back into the power on the promise of land to the people and now we can see exactly which people they were talking about.
Nearly 200 people have lost their lives in this Third Chimurenga. Thousands of others have been tortured, beaten, burned and raped and are refugees in their own country. Six hundred thousand people are already surviving on donor food and our government says seven million refugees face starvation.”
It must be acknowledged that Zimbabwean land rights issues are complex. There is the profoundly unfair, historical and race based colonial context. Zimbabwean blacks were precluded from individual ownership of productive farming land. Secondly, although dryland farming does require large acreages, many farms had under-utilised land on them. Thirdly, land redistribution since independence in 1980 has not satisfied land hunger at all, since it has largely benefited elite members of the ZANU-PF party rather than black Zimbabweans living in crowded communal lands in the country.
The revelations contained in the quoted communication are cause for alarm and again highlight Zimbabwe's badly designed Constitution that provides few constraints on power and little accountability. I will remind the Senate that in May 2000 Transparency International rated Zimbabwe on its Corruption Perceptions Index a 4.1. The index relates to perceptions of the degree of corruption as seen by business people, academics and risk analysts, and ranges between 10 (highly clean) and 0 (highly corrupt). The 2001 index rated Zimbabwe at 2.9 and I shudder to think what rating it will be allocated in September when this year's results are collated.
To assist the Senate in its understanding of the very real threat Zimbabwean citizens must face I will now quote correspondence received from another resident. It reads:
“Zimbabwe has allowed itself to run out of food stocks completely. It's left the supply situation so long that it is no longer physically possible to get enough food into the country to feed the people. The private sector, which played such an important role in 1992, is very much weakened by price controls, rampant inflation and demotivated management that it is not in any position to help significantly.
The government itself has a national debt that now exceeds twice that of the GDP, is struggling to cope with existing obligations and certainly does not have the resources to pay for what is needed in any serious way. Foreign exchange receipts have fallen by 40 per cent and there are no resources available for imports on the scale required.
We have insulted our friends and supporters abroad so that even the Scandinavians have given up on us and said we are beyond redemption. We have violated every rule of good governance in the book and are a pariah state by any measure of the word. In the past two years we have destroyed a commercial farming system that was the pride of Africa 20 years ago and the huge resources of these thousands of farms lie idle and destroyed.
Now suddenly the cold dawn of reality. This week supplies of the last remaining foodstuffs in free supply, wheat and bread, has been cut by 5O percent to try and eke out stocks which were about to run out despite repeated assurances from our genius of a Minister that `stocks are enough'. I fully expect that this will be the trigger of massive, nation wide food shortages on a scale we have never seen before. Before you blame the weather for this, or accept Mugabe's facile explanations in Rome, we have full dams, no water shortages, plenty of grass in most areas, rivers are still running and if our farms were working, the capacity to feed ourselves from irrigated land alone, if this was required. In fact all the crops that were grown under normal conditions—tobacco, soybeans and cotton are all yielding between 70 and 90 per cent of their potential. This is not a repeat of 1992 in any way and attempts to draw parallels do not do justice to the situation.”
To quote the headline of an article in the June 8, 2002 edition of the “The Spectator”—DON'T FORGET ZIMBABWE. The Spectator asserts that, “It is now on the brink of starvation with six million in need of food aid ... the reason so much of black Africa is a disaster is nothing to do with colonialism or droughts. The trouble is the despotic behaviour of Africa's rulers. It suits Mbeki and its suits Blair, quietly to forget about the horrors of Zimbabwe. They must not be forgotten.”
The challenge for our government and its citizens is to ensure that we do not forget.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Zimbabwe</title>,Adjournment,58,1,speech
