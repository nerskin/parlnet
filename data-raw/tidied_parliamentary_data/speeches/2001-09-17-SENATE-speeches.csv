The Department has outsourced the following activities:
·	Property management services; 
·	the preparation of FBT returns;
·	after-hours security services; and
·	switchboard services.
It should be noted that the Department was part of Cluster 10 with respect to its IT activities. Following the Humphry Report in December 2000, the Department has developed its own outsourcing strategy which it will implement over the next 12 months. 
The Department has recently undertaken a tender process for the provision of a number of corporate services. As a result of the tender process, the Department decided to retain the provision of these services internally. 
The Department does use consultants and contractors from time to time to assist in various corporate activities such as the preparation of financial statements and the provision of staff training and development programs.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Attorney-General's Department: Salaries</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,2,1,answer
