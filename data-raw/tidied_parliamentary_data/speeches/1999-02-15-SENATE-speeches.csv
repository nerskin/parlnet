"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-15,"—The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  does almost nothing to enhance the Commonwealth Electoral Act. It is highly partisan and it is politically motivated. It was first introduced into the Senate in May last year on the eve of the election with so many of its measures devised with the sole intent of manipulating electoral law so as to provide advantage for the coalition.
In particular, the bill incorporates the Liberal Party's long obsession and paranoia about unsubstantiated electoral fraud, measures to disenfranchise large numbers of electors and massive increases in electoral funding and disclosure thresholds to allow large sums of money to go undisclosed. Yet, 
 despite the government's best efforts and a lot of encouragement from the Liberal Party's Federal Director, Lynton Crosby, they just could not manage their legislation program well enough to get it in before the last election.
I would like to take this opportunity to flag that the opposition will be moving amendments designed to end once and for all the Liberal Party's chances of exploiting any real or apparent loopholes in the Commonwealth Electoral Act with regard to dodging full and transparent electoral funding disclosure. I am talking in particular about the Liberal Party's most recent money laundering vehicle, the Greenfields Foundation.
The Liberals, of course, are notorious for their devious attempts to rort the disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act. Where there is a will there is a way, and we want to make sure that there is no way that the Liberal Party can dodge full and transparent funding disclosure. I believe we have had some success in exposing Greenfields for the rort it is, and we have also been successful in placing enough pressure on the government to address recommendation 10 of the March 1998 report of the AEC into funding and disclosure—that is, to broaden the investigative powers of the AEC in dealing with and determining whether or not an organisation is an associated entity.
Of course, the AEC has recently utilised these powers for the first time to serve a notice on the Greenfields Foundation on 15 January 1999. I note that Greenfields had one month to appeal that notice. If they have not done so by today, we can assume that the AEC will be able to access the information it requires. I look forward to the results of the AEC's investigations.
However, while those government amendments were sufficient for the purpose of broadening the investigative powers of the AEC in pursuing suspected associated entities, they have not gone far enough in closing the loophole. In brief, our amendments tighten the definition of associated entity; they close the loophole in the event of the loan being forgiven, ultimately becoming a gift; and they prevent loans from being received from anyone other than a registered financial institution unless certain information, such as terms and conditions of the loans, is disclosed.
Let me go to the legislation in detail. Items 1 to 9 deal with the provision of elector data to members, senators and political parties. The electoral rolls and habitation indexes are currently provided either in print, on tape or on disk to members, senators and political parties under section 91 of the Electoral Act. We do think it is useful for parliamentarians to have access to further information such as the elector's date of birth and salutation details in order to more accurately address constituents and target information more directly. 
There currently exists a range of permitted purposes for which information from the electoral roll and habitation index may be used. They include such things as any purpose in connection with an election or referendum, the monitoring of the accuracy of the information contained in a roll and the performance of a member or senator in relation to their constituents. The government is proposing to add a new permitted purpose—that of research regarding electoral matters. This measure will be supported by the Labor Party.
However, given potential privacy concerns, the sensitivity of this information and its value to commercial marketing companies, it 
 is important that sufficient penalties exist for misuse of such information. The government's proposal to increase the penalty to 100 units—that is, $11,000—is a step in the right direction. However, we believe a more severe penalty should be imposed.
On behalf of the opposition, I will be moving an amendment to increase the number of penalty points to 1,000 for disclosure or using electoral roll information for a commercial purpose. This would currently attract a fine of $110,000—a sum which would more accurately reflect the value of the information provided to politicians. The disclosure of this information to marketing companies could offer enormous commercial advantage and it is essential that a penalty exists to act as a serious deterrent to such commercial advantage. We believe that 100 penalties units, or $11,000, does not do that. We hope that $110,000 will.
Items 10, 18, 29, 36, 49, 59 and 69 provide that prisoners are not entitled to enrol or vote. The Commonwealth Electoral Act currently prohibits anyone serving a sentence of five years or longer for an offence against the law of the Commonwealth or of a state or territory, or who has been convicted of treason or treachery and has not been pardoned from being entitled to have their name placed on, or retained on, any roll or to vote at any Senate election or House of Representatives election. The Labor Party will be opposing item 10 which prohibits a person serving a sentence of imprisonment for any offence against the law of the Commonwealth or of a state or territory from voting or from remaining on the electoral roll. We will propose in its place amendments to tighten the current provisions.
It should be noted that denying the right of all prisoners, irrespective of sentence, would present a breach of our obligations under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 25(b), as well as the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights 1948, article 21, which was recently re-signed by the current government. I would also draw to the Senate's attention recent developments in Canada where the Canadian Federal Court held that 
 the disenfranchisement of prisoners was unconstitutional. The government indicated during Senate estimates last week that no legal advice had been sought on this matter and whether the proposed measure would be subject to challenge in the courts as unconstitutional.
Denying all prisoners a vote would mean a person sentenced to eight weeks in gaol coinciding with an election period could not vote, yet another prisoner sentenced to two years in gaol coinciding with a favourable electoral cycle would be able to vote. Parliament has previously accepted that certain classes of prisoners should not be able to vote, and we do not oppose parliament's previous view. It is possible to distinguish between major and minor crimes, as the parliament has previously done. We believe that the five-year rule should remain but that it should be somewhat tightened so that, if any prisoner is being continually imprisoned from the return of the writs of the previous election to the issuing of the writs for the next election, their vote would not be admitted to the count.
Items 11, 12, 14, 28, 30, 31, 53 and 54 provide for the early close of the rolls. As we said in our Senate minority report, these clauses represent an extremely undemocratic, crassly partisan and cynical approach by the government of the day. They signal the government is willing to entertain mass disenfranchisement. Evidence given shows that 80,000 new enrolments occur in the one-week period before the close of the rolls in an election period. Depriving these people of a vote adds nothing to the democratic process. It is no coincidence that the government believes that coalition voter support amongst new enrollees is not strong.
Each election, there is a rush of people who either apply to get on the roll or who need to update their change of address. It is often not until an election is called that many people consider their election enrolment. Evidence given by the AEC to the Senate committee shows that a majority of the 320,000 notify a change of address at the last available opportunity. Further, about 80,000 new enrolments occur once the election is called. Closing the 
 roll so quickly would disenfranchise a large number of first-time voters, most of whom would be young people. The restriction of three days for change of advice prior to an election will be massively distorting. It could lead to more than 200,000 people voting as at their previous address, which would be completely contrary to the spirit and intention of the Electoral Act.
The legislation also inserts a postponement period during which names cannot be added to or deleted from the roll as a result of enrolment applications. The postponement period commences at 8 p.m. on the day of the closure of the rolls until close of polling, if the AEC is satisfied the applicant has previously been an elector. However, for new electors, the postponement period commences at 6 p.m. on the date of the issue of the writs until the close of polling. This means that no new electors can get on the roll once the election has been called. The rationale is that the new proof of identity and other crosschecks for new electors will take too long to carry out and will not make the three-day limit. So those 80,000 new voters who apply to get on the electoral roll when an election is called will all be disenfranchised. That is a travesty, and we will be opposing this measure.
Items 13, 15 to 17 and 19 to 27 deal with enrolment reform. The coalition have had a long, and what I would call paranoid, obsession with the issue of electoral fraud—as if the only reason they failed to win elections between 1983 and 1996 was supposed massive electoral fraud. We all want accurate rolls, and the opposition believes strongly in the integrity of our electoral system. However, when questioned in the Senate inquiry, the AEC could not provide any evidence that the electoral rolls are rorted, nor can the Liberal Party come up with anything other than vague innuendo.
These provisions seem to be based more on a potential for electoral fraud rather than on any actual cases. They will lead to an enormous rise in bureaucratic procedures and will cost $3.9 million annually. Such funds would be better spent on habitation reviews. The AEC gave evidence to the Senate committee 
 regarding new enrolment procedures being currently adopted. These procedures will substantially reduce any possibility of fraud.
The opposition will also be opposing measures providing that an elector must re-enrol within one month of moving to a new address. We think this would disenfranchise a number of voters, particularly itinerant electors. Previously, people were required to reside in their new electorate for a period of one month before being eligible for enrolment in that electorate. They then had 21 days to notify the AEC of their change of enrolment. This cuts that time back to only four weeks.
However, a much greater concern exists for itinerant electors. Item 17 seems to actually eliminate the entire category of itinerant electors. Item 17 states:
. . . Subject to subsection (9), a person ceases to be eligible to be treated as an itinerant elector under this section as soon as the person becomes entitled to be enrolled for a Subdivision.
The other items in this group of amendments provide that a person becomes entitled to be enrolled for a subdivision immediately with no one-month waiting period. Therefore, an elector would cease to be treated to be an itinerant elector as soon as they moved elsewhere. We raised this anomaly during the debate in the House of Representatives and the minister provided a response on behalf of the AEC. He said:
. . . while the proposed amendments would appear to severely limit an elector's ability to claim itinerant status in the application of the current provisions, the AEC has based the determination of eligibility not solely on the length of residency at a particular address but on whether that address is considered to be a permanent address of the elector—that is, one to which the elector has a fixed intention of returning to live on a permanent basis rather than just a temporary abode for a fixed period of time. The AEC advises that it will continue to adopt this approach in considering applications if the proposed amendments are passed into law.
We just do not think that is good enough, frankly. It is not a sufficient response to a problem that the AEC would have missed but for the opposition's alerting them to it. We will be opposing the measure.
A range of other measures relying on as yet unseen regulations will also be opposed by the opposition. They include: witnesses to enrolment applications must be electors as prescribed by the regulations; the lodgment by hand of enrolment applications with a prescribed person—for example, post office or semi-government organisation; and verification of identity and citizenship for enrolment with at least one original form of proof of identity documentation.
The provisions also rely heavily on the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' records, and their accuracy. We fear that not everyone will have records of their citizenship. An example may be someone whose parents were made Australian citizens, and they were on the certificate but may not have a copy of that certificate.
The success of these proposed changes would be dependent on these regulations that the Senate committee and the parliament are yet to see; nor have we been approached to give input into their make-up. We have said since May last year, when this was first introduced, that we are not able to support these provisions until we are satisfied that the draft regulations are acceptable.
Items 44 to 46 increase the funding and disclosure thresholds. The Liberal Party have a lot of form when it comes to pushing the limits with electoral funding and disclosure. The Liberal Party have a history of sidestepping the disclosure provisions of the Electoral Act for party political reasons. And now they are taking advantage of their numbers to massively increase the electoral funding and disclosure thresholds in the knowledge that it will allow huge sums of money to be donated without disclosure.
Item 44 increases from $1,500 to $10,000 the amount above which a donor to a political party must furnish a return for the financial year, and item 45 increases from $1,500 to $5,000 the amount received from a person or organisation that political parties are required to disclose during a financial year.
The Labor Party will be opposing these items. We believe that these increases would allow for significant sums of money to go without disclosure, particularly when com 
 bined with item 46 which provides that the $5,000 figure does not have to be made up of individual amounts of less than $1,500. Even the Australian Electoral Commission conceded the problems with these measures. During the Senate inquiry into the legislation the head of funding and disclosure at the AEC conceded the following:
The way that a donor can make such a large donation without being disclosed is by donating up to the threshold to each state and territory branch of a political party. So, for a party that is organised nationally in every state and territory plus with a national secretariat, you are looking at nine separate identified parties, in effect, for disclosure purposes.
He went on to say:
A donor can make separate donations to each of those parties. Because they are not aggregated across the party across Australia, only within each state and territory, they will not be disclosed. So. . . they could donate $4,999 a year to each state and territory branch of a political party and go undisclosed. That would add up to just short of $45,000.
The AEC also conceded that there were a number of other ways in which donors could split their donations so they would not be disclosed; for example, by each member of a family or a company donating up to the disclosure limit. Or another scenario may see a donor donate $4,999 to individual candidates. For example, if all the 37 Victorian seats attracted such donations from a single donor, that would add up to $184,963, undisclosed.
Items 44 and 45 are basically another attempt by the coalition parties to weaken disclosure. That is a policy that they have consistently pursued for the past 15 years. The coalition parties' tacit approval of the Greenfields Foundation rort does nothing to inspire confidence in the arguments they have brought to bear in the case of these clauses. The Labor Party have always advocated very tight and transparent funding and disclosure provisions, and we will not allow these items driven by the Liberal Party national secretariat to undermine the integrity of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.
In item 46 amounts of less than $1,500—an increase from $500—need not be counted when calculating disclosure amounts. We 
 believe that those amendments to item 46 are sensible, and they are supported by the opposition.
There are a number of minor and non-controversial measures that will be supported by the opposition. They include: items dealing with assisted voting; items dealing with the preliminary scrutiny of declaration votes; the repeal of section 332, already covered by section 328; and items dealing with the failure of delivery of postal ballots.
While there are a few minor measures proposed by this legislation that are sensible and non-controversial, as I said at the outset, overall it does very little to enhance the integrity of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. In fact, it is a highly partisan piece of legislation. Many of its measures have not been proposed or advocated by the Australian Electoral Commission, and some are actually opposed by the AEC.
The AEC's submission to the Senate inquiry into the bill before the election made the following points. In regard to the entitlement of prisoners to enrol and vote the AEC said:
The AEC makes no comment on the policy relating to this issue. . . there will be some practical difficulties in implementing this policy.
In regard to the use of elector data they stated:
The AEC has no view on the policy to provide salutation and date of birth details to Members, Senators and political parties, or to allow for the use of elector data for research purposes.
In regard to assisted voting they stated:
The AEC has not been on the public record about this issue. However there could be some difficulties experienced in some polling places. . . 
In regard to thresholds for reporting of donations the AEC stated:
The AEC advised against such changes in a submission to the JSCEM inquiry into the conduct of the 1996 federal election.
As I mentioned earlier, further opposition was expressed by the AEC at the Senate committee hearing.
I will be moving the amendments I have outlined when we get to the committee stage to ensure the integrity of the Commonwealth 
 Electoral Act. I urge the Senate to support the amendments. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-15,"—This is the first piece of legislation that I have had carriage of since I was given the portfolio of electoral matters for the Australian Democrats. I look forward to working in this area with the rest of the Senate in a constructive way for some time.
With this legislation, as with all electoral legislation, we in this chamber find ourselves in the unusual position of being both the legislators and also a major interest group. It is a position that the Democrats openly admit. However, we cannot underestimate the position of trust that is vested in us here when dealing with what is, for all intents and purposes, the basic machinery of our democratic system. It is obviously important that we do it in a way that is seen to be as fair and impartial as possible.
Having said that, the Democrats remain sceptical about most of the measures in the  Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  and are disinclined to support this legislation. As has just been outlined by the previous speaker, many areas of this bill give rise to great concern for the Australian Democrats as well. Broadly, it has been stated that this legislation is seeking to minimise electoral fraud as well as removing the right of prisoners to vote. It makes a number of other administrative changes which are potentially very far-reaching, such as changes to the disclosure provisions.
 Just a moment ago I spoke of being cynical about the motives behind this legislation. That cynicism was only strengthened when I read the House Hansard on this bill where the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, Mr Slipper, had this to say in his second reading contribution:
The purpose of the legislation currently before the chamber is to ensure that when the result is declared following an election, that result as declared represents the intention of the Australian people as cast on polling day.
If that had been the case in the 3 October poll last year, Mr Slipper would be on the opposition benches. As we all well know, despite 51.3 per cent of the population voting against 
 it, this incumbent government has been able to cling to power because of its dominance in a handful of marginal seats. In terms of the principle enunciated by Mr Slipper, the 1998 federal election was the low-water mark for Australian democracy. The Democrats would like to see an examination of changes to the Electoral Act which will stop that problem occurring, rather than some of the other measures that are contained in this legislation.
In real terms, the term of this government has been underwritten by an electoral system that fails to deliver representation to over two million Australians, which is the equivalent of denying representation to all the voters of South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. This bill does nothing to remedy that situation. Indeed, in some parts, it only exacerbates that situation. The Australian Democrats have made a career out of amending legislation to make it and the government open and operate with integrity and honesty. Electoral law and transparency in funding and donations to political parties is a fundamental part of that.
This legislation deals with measures to enable greater information from the electoral roll to be provided to various people. Most contributors to the debate in the lower house and, I am sure, most senators would desire to keep the electoral roll and its use restricted to people who can be said to have a genuine interest in that information. The proposed amendments, which allow the provision of electoral data to members, senators and political parties, would be particularly attractive to commercial marketing companies. The amendments in this bill relate to giving federal MPs and all registered political parties the details of electors' dates of birth and salutations. I am not sure whether people would be terribly worried about their salutations being made available, but I am quite sure that a number of Australians would be concerned about their dates of birth being made available not only to members of parliament but also to every registered political party.
The Democrats do not support the extension of this information—and for very good reason. One needs only to look at who and what 
 is registered as a political party to see there is a long list of parties, many of which are barely known to the Australian public let alone to the people behind them. Many people would be concerned about that sort of information being made available to organisations that are barely known and, in many cases, difficult to even get in touch with.
Not the least of those political parties that would get access to this extra information is Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, a party that many people from all sides of politics have been concerned about in terms of their lack of accountability in their structure and their quasi-commercial operation style. Throughout this debate, there has been the talk of not allowing commercially sensitive material to fall into the hands of people who may profit from such information. The Democrats support moves to extend the penalties for such misuse, as contained in the foreshadowed amendment mentioned by Senator Faulkner. It is right and proper that we are intent on preventing any commercial entity from gaining an economic advantage through the electoral roll of this country.
Another aspect of this legislation deals with the expansion of donations. The previous speaker has again outlined very clearly why the provisions contained in this legislation would leave major holes in the intent and operation of the disclosure provisions that have been put in place over many years. Let us not forget that part of what has driven that need and that desire for greater accountability and greater openness in terms of who funds political parties in Australia is the desire of the public to know such information.
 It is no secret to say that public confidence in political parties is very low and trending further downwards. Measures such as this, which seek to make it easier for donors to hide their donations to political parties, can have no other effect than increasing the level of cynicism amongst the Australian public. Surely that is something that none of us would wish to encourage.
Another serious aspect of this legislation that the Democrats are greatly concerned about is the move to curtail the ability of people to enrol or to change their existing 
 enrolment once elections are called. Again, as the previous speaker outlined, this has the potential to disenfranchise up to as many as 80,000 new voters whenever an election is called. The rationale behind such a measure—the need to prevent electoral fraud—has not been proven, despite extensive investigation by a number of parliamentary committees. With such a lack of evidence of any widespread electoral fraud, there can surely be no justification for producing an amendment which will clearly disenfranchise such a huge number of Australians. This will affect mainly younger people—people we are trying to encourage to get involved in the political process—many of whom, to the detriment of our democracy, are feeling more and more disconnected from it.
There are a couple of measures, mainly minor administrative matters, in this bill that the Democrats are willing to support. If the bill gets to the committee stage, I will indicate those measures then. However, we believe that, on the whole, as the bill contains sufficient negative and serious measures, those few measures that are positive should be removed and put in another piece of legislation rather than being tacked onto something, the vast majority of which is, in the Democrat's view, completely unsupportable. For that reason, we believe that this bill should be voted against at its second reading stage.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-15,"—The Greens oppose the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998. The outcome of the provisions, the amendments, incorporated in this legislation would be to leave this country less democratic, and to leave the country's citizens with less equality in their approach to the ballot box and, indeed, more vulnerable to the approaches of the political parties—and in all cases this would be discriminatory.
Firstly, this legislation contains provisions that would allow electors' dates of birth and salutations—that is, titles such as Mr, Ms, Miss, Mrs, Dr, and so on—to be made available to political parties. The caveat there is that there would be provisions to ensure that no-one gets an economic advantage or allows 
 the information to be passed on to business interests.
Questions need to be asked at the outset. Are not the political parties in themselves business interests? Are not members of parliament interested in the business in which they are engaged? There is no dividing line between the role of parliamentarians and the fact that they are sustained by the public purse on good salaries and provisions with amenities and staff. The aim of approaching electors in a discriminatory fashion through groupings based on their dates of birth, their particular interests perhaps relating to their ages, or their salutations is to particularly inveigle those voters in a more honed down way, in a more market research based way, if you like, to gain favour to help politicians and parties to stay in power.
It is an insidious process, and I defy anybody in the Senate to say where the demarcation line is beyond which we will not go in the future if this process continues. This measure should not be allowed. It simply is a stepping stone to further measures whereby incumbent politicians and parties who are represented in the parliament gain an advantage in a political system which is already very much lopsided in their favour.
I note that the ALP will support this provision. But that speaks volumes in itself because, in particular, it will help the major parties in the business of getting to the electorates in a way in which people who are not already in the parliament have no chance to get to them. It will help those major parties to get to electorates with, no doubt, selective information—because all politicians and members of parliament do that—and to put themselves in an advantageous position. We ought not allow this legislation because, through this measure, we would be putting forward a matter of self-interest, and I do not think that should be the case. We, the Greens, will strenuously oppose it.
The next measure, which the ALP does oppose, is the provision for prisoners who are serving sentences of less than five years to be struck off the roll; effectively, to be denied a vote. It has already been pointed out that this provision is discriminatory in that those 
 prisoners who happen to be in gaol serving short sentences—maybe as short as a month—at the time the Prime Minister calls an election will lose their vote. Those who are serving a month just before that or who get a sentence of a month after that or, indeed, have suspended sentences for the same crime will not lose their vote.
It is already wrong that the laws of this country discriminate against long-term prisoners in taking away their vote. It is easy to have a reaction which says `vengeance is ours; we ought to be denying prisoners basic civil rights'. But it is muddle-headed at best, and it is bad civic practice; it is bad for the whole of the community when you analyse it fully.
Let me put a couple of specific points about this. Firstly, it is up to the courts to judge people and penalise them by sending them to prison. That is where the penalty should start and finish. It should not be up to us to be legislating in a general way to take away the rights of people who go to prison—in particular, basic civil rights and the right to vote. If this were being done in a proper fashion, we would be handing to the courts the right to deny prisoners the vote. I believe that it is being done simply because the coalition has looked at the demographics and the voting patterns of prisoners and decided that prisoners do not vote for the coalition, by and large—
—They vote against incumbents.
—and incumbents, as Senator Ray says, so, `Let's deny them the vote.' That is what this is about. It is not about getting a better rehabilitation rate. It is not about protecting the wider interests of society against crime. It is about getting political advantage.
As to what this might do for society at large, there is a strong case to put that if you deny prisoners the right to vote you send a message to them that society has rejected them. You take away—and I have been in prison on a number of occasions—the tendency there is to discuss politics, like all other people in society do, and to feel part of the process, and therefore to feel the want to get 
 back into society and to continue to be part of that process as wanted and full citizens.
It is a muddle-headed amendment, but it becomes worse when you look at who is in prison. In this country, unfortunately, the statistics show that, from detention centres for young people through to prisons for adults, indigenous Australians are incarcerated at somewhere between 10 and 20 times the rate of other Australians. Whatever the seat of that discrimination—and I would say it has a lot to do with the taking of the lands, the destruction of culture and the robbing of hope from the indigenous people in this country, allied to the extraordinary poverty in general the indigenous people live in compared with the rest of the community—this denial of the vote is going to hit indigenous people at a rate 10 to 20 times that of the rest of the community.
It is racially discriminatory. I would like to hear arguments from the other side if they disagree with that. The Greens will be moving an amendment to the legislation to ensure that the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 has precedence over these amendments—in other words, to ensure that if there is racial discrimination it is challengeable in the courts. This legislation is subsequent to the RDA and, if we do not do anything, it will escape the aegis of the RDA. I want to make sure that that does not happen. I would put it to all other members of the Senate that they support this amendment, because we do not want to extend the discrimination there is in this country against indigenous peoples, particularly in the fundamental matter of their having the right to vote.
Until the referendum in the sixties there was a shameful history of universal denial of the right of Australia's indigenous population to vote. This legislation echoes back to that shameful history. This legislation is going to take away the rights of indigenous people disproportionately. It is racially discriminatory, therefore, and we need to make sure that that discrimination is expunged. I put it to the government, in particular, but to all senators that they support the amendment that I will be moving to make sure that the Racial Discrimination Act has aegis over this legislation.
The matter of early closure of the rolls was referred to by both previous speakers. In short, some 80,000 young voters are likely to be unable to cast a vote at future federal elections where the Prime Minister says, `We are having an election three weeks from now. The writs will be issued tomorrow.' The information is that, given the opportunity, some 80,000 people would enrol in the week. What does this mean? If you average it out, about 500 voters in each electorate would lose their right to vote. They will be stymied by this amendment being brought in here for quite clear political motives. There were some five electorates at the last election decided by less than 500 votes—Bass, Dickson, Herbert, Eden Monaro and Hinkler.
Clearly, in any election there is real potential for the result in marginal seats like those to be altered by this measure, and therefore who wins government in a close election. You cannot tell me that the officials in the coalition party offices have not been pouring over this legislation to see that that is the result, and that is the totally wrong basis for bringing forward amendments to the way in which this country works at election time. This is not free of political bias. These are politically biased electoral amendments which have the aim specifically of keeping the coalition in office at any future close election. Nothing could point to that more than this particular means of disenfranchising tens of thousands of young Australians, many of whom will be young Australians on the move, many of whom will be poorer young Australians. I have no doubt that the analysis at coalition head offices was `likely in the main not to be coalition voters'.
The final matter I want to speak about is the provision to raise the requirement for the disclosure of donations to political parties upon individuals from donations of $1,500 or more to $10,000 or more. Once again, this is a measure to help cover the donations going to the major political parties, particularly the coalition. It is designed to increase the opportunity for major individual donors particularly—although it need not necessarily be individuals; it can be from the corporate sector—to put, as Senator Faulkner showed 
 the Senate, much larger donations, donations of over $100,000 spread out through the states, into the party political coffers without that being revealed to public notification and therefore public analysis.
This goes totally against the spirit of electoral disclosure legislation. It is a move towards protecting people who make donations to political parties. I have said this before, but I will say it again: people do not make large donations to political parties without having in mind favour in return. That particularly applies to the corporate sector. And if it applies to big donations in big amounts, it applies to smaller donations in smaller amounts. I only have to point to the fact that somewhere between half a million dollars and $1 million coming from the woodchip companies to the big political parties per annum is enough to sway both of the big political parties to support woodchipping in wild forests in this country, though all the opinion polls show that 70 to 80 per cent of the Australian electorate does not want that to happen.
I only have to point out as well that it is irresponsible for executives or boards of corporations making donations to do so without expecting a result. That is not a proper way to be using shareholders' money. There is a lot of deliberation behind large donations to political parties. But, in particular, the government of the day is expected to return a favour, and in the main it does return a favour. That, Mr Acting Deputy President, is against the interests of the average Australian. I believe it is corrupt and corrupting not to call a spade a spade.
We have, at least, in this country moved to have these donations disclosed. But this amendment is a move in the opposite direction—to start to reintroduce the veil of secrecy, to start to cover up the approach to political parties by people with money in their back pockets to curry political favour. We start to move back to the large brown envelopes, brown paper bags, with money inside, with no name ever registered for the public to look at. It is anti-democratic. It goes against the interests of the average Australian—that 
 is, it is against the public interest—and we will be opposing it.
I again say that there is little to commend this legislation at all. In almost every respect it is against the wider public interest. It is against the average Australian's interest. It is therefore democratically negative. I also believe is racially discriminatory. We will be moving to at least try to ensure it is not. In particular, we will be testing the government, who I am sure will say it is not racially discriminatory, by putting forward an amendment which they should not have any trouble with if that is the case.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-02-15,"—I have listened with interest to the contributions of Senator Bartlett and Senator Brown on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 , and I commend them on their speeches. There is no doubt that in the late 19th and early 20th centuries Australia led the world when it came to electoral reform. Many of the innovations that occurred in Australia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are now the political norms around the globe. I think we can look back with pride at our country's history in this regard. For instance, I think we were the second country in the world to enfranchise women, one of the first countries in the world to pay our MPs and one of the first countries in the world to set up a proper electoral roll system. Certainly we were the first country in the world to introduce a properly controlled secret ballot—so much so that even in the United States in the 1990s the secret ballot there is referred to as `the Australian ballot'.
So in that early part of our formation around Federation, we led the world. We can also say that at a federal level throughout that history for the most part we have had a very fair electoral system. For instance, unlike states, there has been very little gerrymandering in the federal process since Federation. The only major criticism that exists is that malapportionment was embedded into the system and was only rooted out in 1983-84—it took that long to get rid of malapportionment from our system.
But if you look at the history of the Liberal Party, remembering the Liberal Party was founded around 1944-45, you will see that they have an absolutely disgraceful record in regard to electoral reform at a national level. Between 1949 and 1983 they let this current Electoral Act ossify. They did virtually nothing in the way of improvements. They took the attitude: this is a system that might favour us, any change will not favour us so we will leave it as it is. For instance, in the 1966 federal election—this is only 30-odd years ago—we had electorates in Melbourne of 28,000 and 29,000 voters and two other electorates with 140,000 voters because the Liberal Party would not apply themselves to think about electoral reform and update the previously existing act.
The only real change they made in that time was the introduction of a 5,000 square kilometre provision, introduced by the Fraser government. And this was just to entrench malapportionment in this country. This was to favour country electorates—not even provincial electorates, because they put a size in—so that there would be some sort of bias within the electoral system from which they could take political advantage. This is the Liberal Party of Australia, which regularly accepted that the Senate informal vote would be well into double figures and there was no need to do anything about it. Why? Because it suited their self-interest.
It is true that most political parties approaching the electoral system always put self-interest at the front. I think one of the great moves made by the first Hawke government was to set up the joint select committee to look at our electoral system, to review elections, and to bring forward recommendations. They have not always had unanimous consent—there are some issues of principle that will always divide political parties—but that committee, since its inception in 1983 to the current day, has brought forward many sensible bipartisan suggestions that have been incorporated in the Electoral Act and justify some sort of claim at the moment that we still have one of the best electoral acts and democratic systems anywhere in this globe.
But we did have to tackle the more contentious areas of electoral reform, for instance, public funding. Senator Brown mentioned before he does not like the dependence of political parties on donations; neither do I. Public funding, at a national level, has helped relieve that burden enormously and probably constitutes 70 to 75 per cent of Labor Party campaign expenditure in any federal campaign. I am not sure whether there would be much difference in the Liberal Party, although their corporate fundraising goes much more to supporting their own administration rather than campaigning. But the Liberal Party oppose public funding.
Of course, the National Party always went one step further. They opposed it on moral grounds. I ask the Senate: can anyone recall the Liberal or National parties not taking public funding? After every election, can you imagine Lightweight Lynton over at Robert Menzies House saying, `Here is a cheque for $12 million, I will send it back. I do not want public funding, we oppose it.' The National Party opposes public funding on moral grounds but they always take the money. They oppose public funding, but the real core of their opposition—and at least you can say the Liberal-National Party are being consistent—is that they have always opposed disclosure of donations. The only trite argument they can come up with is, `If the Labor Party in government knows who donated to us, they will persecute us.'
Anyone who has examined the record of this government and its petty Nixonian persecutions of the last three years would know it is much more likely to come from that side of the chamber. Right through the 1980s, when disclosure laws came in and were tightened up, the Liberal Party opposed them. They set up their Free Enterprise Foundation and they set up the McCormack Foundation to channel donations through so that they would never be revealed. This parliament has faced a constant battle to try to catch up with the latest chicanery of the coalition in terms of disclosing donations. They used to say once, `It does not matter about donations because our politicians never know about them.' They said their politicians had no role in fundraising but, in 
 the weeks before a federal election, what do you think former Prime Minister Bill McMahon did? He visited every boardroom in Sydney. He was known as `the vacuum cleaner' because, once he had been through, there was no money for anyone else's political donations. That was always the grand farce of the Liberal Party, that their upper echelon people did not know where the donations were coming from. Here in this  Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  is at least part of that aspiration—the lifting of the threshold on donations from $1,500 to $10,000 in terms of party and up to $5,000 in terms of individuals. What have they got to be ashamed about? Are they ashamed of their corporate donors or of their individual donors? What have they got to be ashamed about? Why not have them on the public record and why not have it at a reasonable level? People say, `Why have any level at all?' That is simply a processing issue: you only really record the relatively significant donations.
What we know about the coalition is that when they were getting into financial strife in 1996, they had to devise a new method to bring money in. They used the old Greenfields Foundation trick—essentially, I think, to hide who the donor was. Once they got caught out on the loan and the similarities and whether it was an associated entity, they finally—at least on the surface—came clean and said, `I am sorry. It was Ron Walker who donated the money.' Ron Walker apparently donated $4.6 million to the Liberal Party to get them out of debt and then assigned the debt, in their terms, across to Greenfields. Who is the federal treasurer, to be donating that sort of money? He happens to be the absolute beneficiary and current mendicant of the Victorian state Liberal government, because they have put all their dough into the casino. It has not fired up terribly well and they are constantly requesting concessions from the Victorian state government. I reckon Ron Walker's $4.6 million is a bit mean, because he has basically got at least $73 million in concession out of one state government decision. If you percentage that out, he has not even paid his 10 per cent to the deduct box. He has not even done that. This 
 bill, in miniature if you like, reflects the constant coalition objection to disclosure. They will continue it by trying to put forward this bill here.
This government has had two electoral bills so far. The first one really fits the description of a bipartisan bill. We virtually all agreed with what they put in it. I think it was sensible for the government to divide that bill from its more contentious bill because the other one was able to go through in time to operate in the last federal election. I must commend the Electoral Commission—and I hope this will be passed on—for getting the Senate results by computerisation this time. It was a revelation. They were much quicker and much easier to follow. I think they did a terrific job in getting those Senate results out. I am not speaking out of personal interest here, because I have never actually had to run in the death seat—at No. 3—and to worry about it. I have always believed in being on top of the ticket and dragging my colleagues through on my own personal vote rather than necessarily having to expose myself to the death seat.
—Five weeks is a long time.
—Senator Patterson, speaking from the heart, may, I think, have been in the death seat at one election. You would agree with me, Senator Patterson, that that was a good reform. I also suspect it saved a lot of money.
But when you come to the bill itself, as other colleagues have mentioned, it does have some very odious aspects. I take a slightly different attitude to Senator Brown and the Democrats and even, probably, Senator Faulkner, on the question of prisoners voting—only because I have got form on this! Back in 1983-84, when I was on the joint committee, I believed one to two years was a fair cut-off point. It was arbitrary, there was not a lot of science to it, but I thought that was a reasonable cut-off point in terms of prisoners having rights.
Provided people know before they commit crimes that if they are sentenced to more than two years gaol they will lose the right to vote, it is not double jeopardy. Later that was 
 moved out to five years without much consultation with me. I am not sure I would have supported that. The points being made in this chamber today are absolutely valid. This particular cause does not have fair application. If someone is fined and cannot afford to pay the money and has to spend six weeks in gaol, they do not get the vote. If some other character facing the same choice forks out the $10,000, they do get the vote. Where is the fairness in that?
Several speakers today have said: what happens if you are committed for a vicious assault and you serve two years in gaol but you actually started serving that sentence on 10 May 1996 and you got let out on 10 May 1998? You can vote in the federal election. Where is the fairness in someone who serves two years and gets the vote but someone else serves six weeks over a maintenance order they cannot afford or a speeding fine they cannot pay and they lose the vote?
I think Senator Faulkner summed it up when he said to leave the five-year provision as it is but disqualify a further group to bring it back to more like the 1983 reforms where, if you are continuously in gaol from the issuing of writs to the return of the writs, you do not get a vote. That seems to me a very fair compromise. Why don't we adopt that? You could not get on the redneck talkback radio shows and blow this up as an issue. 
Senator Brown gave an eloquent defence of prisoners. Do you know what is going to happen, Senator Brown? You are going to be blackguarded on talkback radio. The old rednecks are going to rip you to shreds. They are not going to properly run the articulate arguments you put here today; they are going to distort them and use them as political capital against you and anyone else who expresses these views because they are arguing a very emotive issue.
Prisoners are not just there to serve time. Prison is about—we hope—rehabilitation, playing a role in society. As such, we should encourage them to take their civic duty. I disagree with Senator Brown when he said that he did not think prisoners voted Liberal. My experience in looking at figures from mobile booths in prison is that they vote 
 against incumbents. If it is the Labor government, we cop a thrashing because they see us as responsible for putting them there. I have not seen many in the mobile booths voting Green. So I think it is very noble that you have come in here to support their rights. Really, it should not be blown up as a redneck issue.
There will have to be compromises made in terms of the parliament determining who has a right to vote and who does not. I think about a two-year period is the fairest possible period. If we want to make it five and exclude those who are in prison continuously between the issuing of the writs and the return of the writs, then I think that is a good compromise.
The real rort in this is closing the rolls 24 hours after the writs are issued. Does anyone here know why the one-week period is there? I agree with it. Who pushed it hardest? Which senator from this chamber on the joint select committee actually pushed this harder so we have a 33-day election? The reason why we have a 33-day election period is that we have a one-week period for people to get on the rolls. It was not Senator Richardson or Senator Ray; it was former Senator Carrick. Having had that fixed timetable for elections, he argued—and we agreed with him—that you need a week to close the rolls.
Why have the coalition included closing the rolls 24 hours after the writs are issued within the legislation? The fact is all people should enrol the moment they turn 18. We know that. I should not smoke. I know that, but I do. Young people put off enrolling because it is not at the forefront of their minds when they turn 18. Can you think of many 18-year-olds who wake up on their 18th birthday and start thinking about going on the roll rather than the party that night? What triggers them to go on the roll is when an election is called.
We have evidence that 80,000 new people enrol before elections. Their enrolment is triggered by the election. This government wants to deprive every one of them from having a vote. That is pure demographics. They have done their polling. This is a group that even now they are not doing well with. The coalition will punish them and get an 
 electoral advantage out of it. The by-product of that is there are another 323,000 people who, having moved address, regularise their position in that one week. When Senator Brown talked about 500 per electorate, this extends to a much higher figure.
They will vote but they will vote in the wrong electorate because of this legislation. They will not be taken off the roll because they have not changed address; they will just vote in the electorate they were in previously. That is not about cleansing the roll. That is not about representation. Surely you can give them that week to move to their proper address. That should be encouraged. Again, the coalition and the hatchet men up at Menzies House have worked out that they may get some minor electoral advantage out of this, and therefore they should support it.
This leads them then to the more draconian sections of the bill, on identification. This falls short of having to do a DNA test to get on the electoral roll. It goes back to outmoded regulations that existed in the fifties. The philosophy of the AEC in the 1980s is very easy to sum up. They used to say: easy to enrol, easy to vote. That was their philosophy. It is not anymore but not of their own volition, I might add; it was of this government's volition. I think it is a very sad thing that they have to bring in these sorts of regulations.
I want to finish on one other note that is not in this bill. When people reflect on our Electoral Act and our electoral system, I want them to think back on the reforms brought about in the 1980s as to the distribution of electoral boundaries, because it is in this area when you look around the globe you see that Australia, at a national level, leads the world. I would say that we have the fairest redistribution system—or redistricting, as they call it in the US—anywhere around the globe. It was basically a combined effort between the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the Democrats at the time to bring in a whole series of reforms—and it was independent people doing this—that, in the end, has given us this particular system.
When you look at the problems that exist even today in the United Kingdom, with 
 malapportionment, to gerrymandering in the US, to arguments right around the globe about the drawing up of boundaries, you will see that those reforms put in place in the 1980s still stand the test of time today. They are still the best anywhere around the globe. This shows that this parliament, when it applies itself in a bipartisan way, can produce electoral legislation that is envied by others.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-02-15,"—I rise as the Democrats' privacy spokesperson as well as the youth affairs spokesperson. I am aware that the Democrat concerns with the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  have been most eloquently outlined already by our new electoral matters spokesperson, Senator Bartlett. I will only speak briefly on a couple of matters, in particular the issue of privacy and the details proposed to be provided in relation to salutations and date of birth details. I believe that that is a major privacy concern for this parliament and for the community. The Democrats, with our long-running commitment to ensuring the rights of individuals and that private information is kept safe, have led the campaign to extend privacy laws to the private sector. But that is a debate for another day.
In this context, we have already raised our grave concerns about this information being provided, for a number of reasons. It not only relates to privacy implications such as when it comes to salutations—whether it is to do with providing information about a person's status, such as married, professional or otherwise—but also can be argued against as being elitist. Apart from that, the details proposed to be provided are a major privacy concern, given that these details are often sufficient for banks or other organisations to identify a customer by phone and to release account balance and other information. So there are broad-ranging privacy implications as a result of the legislation before us.
I thought it was interesting that Senator Ray suggested that, at the rate we are going, we will need a DNA test in order to qualify for registration on the electoral rolls. I might add for the interest of the parliament that that will 
 not happen before this parliament at least debates or considers or passes the Democrats' private member's bill in relation to genetic privacy and non-discrimination—another area where we have failed blatantly to ensure that people's personal information (in fact, their most personal information: their DNA, their genetic make-up) is safe.
In relation to, as the previous speaker referred to, one of the major rorts of this bill, I refer to the change in the registration requirements and the reduction in the amount of time between the issue of the writ and the close of the rolls. Clearly the Democrats oppose that measure quite strongly. This effectively closes the roll on 6 p.m. on the date of the issue of the writ for new enrolments or three working days after the issue of the writ for those updating their enrolment because of the change in their circumstances.
We believe this can have quite a deleterious effect on especially new and younger voters—not necessarily the same category—who will potentially be disfranchised by this measure. We know that there were more than hundreds of thousands of new, young voters who were eligible to vote for the first time at the 1998 federal election. This figure is significant for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that the federal government won the 1996 election by less than 100,000 votes. Clearly, this is a significant number of people who will be disfranchised.
Despite the power of their vote, many young Australians are not necessarily familiar with how the voting system works. I do not necessarily think that that is something restricted to young Australians. I suspect there are a lot of people in our community—I am sure we all encounter this in the lead-up to elections and during campaign periods—who ask for more information about how the voting and electoral system work. But, in particular, new voters, younger voters, are sometimes unsure as to how to vote or how to make their vote reflect their voting intentions.
We believe this bill will exacerbate this situation. We believe that for that reason it is quite an affront to the Australian democratic system. The Australian Democrats are strong 
 advocates of a compulsory voting system. It is a tradition that we value very strongly. It is a tradition we believe strengthens the democracy in which we live. It ensures that participation is at its highest possible in all state and federal elections.
However, there are recent figures that show that voter turnout has fallen by almost one per cent between 1993 and 1998. When we examine those figures, this bill seems to further restrict, not increase, participation. We have a record of voter participation which stands in stark contrast to voter turnout in other Western democracies where the political system is one most similar to our `Washminster' model but not necessarily a compulsory system. Places like the United Kingdom and the United States are two examples. In the United Kingdom in 1993 and 1996 some 22 per cent of enrolled voters turned out to the polls. This fell to 96.20 per cent in 1996—I might clarify those figures—and 95.33 per cent in 1998. So that was 96.20 per cent in 1996 and 95.33 per cent in 1998. So that is a small reduction, but a reduction in voter turnout nonetheless.
This is a trend. We should be reversing that trend. How do you reverse that trend? Obviously education plays a role. I do commend the government's recent attempts to introduce or bolster civics education in this nation. I think it has been shamefully overdue. I recognise that a lot of the money that has been put aside by the relevant minister is actually not new funding but funding that was held over from the last government. I think it was the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who allocated funds towards a civics education program in this country. Nevertheless, that is beginning to happen.
However, I note that, as far as I know, apart from some of the Australian Electoral Commission first-time voter information, mostly in the form of advertisements and other appropriate propaganda, the Australian Democrats are the only party that produce a non-partisan guide for first-time voters specifically aimed at young voters, new voters, that looks in a non-partisan fashion at how the voting system works. For example, it looks at proportional representation and looks at how preferences 
 are distributed. It answers some of those very basic questions that a lot of Australians, young Australians in particular, are not familiar with. I do commend to the chamber the So it's your first time booklet. I wish other political parties would see fit to produce similar broadsheets. I would hope that the Australian Electoral Commission will continue to provide funding for first-time voters.
We are unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, where political parties and advocacy groups spend a lot of time and money mobilising young and first-time voters with campaigns like `Choose or Lose', `Lead or Leave' and the MTV `Rock the Vote' campaigns—a whole range of strategies designed to mobilise young people. Thankfully, we don't have to mobilise young people in the same way, but we cannot afford to be complacent. The administrative measures before us today will act as a disincentive to young voters and new citizens—to new voters generally.
Potentially 80,000 people are disfranchised. Again, we have yet to see any evidence that demonstrates that this will necessarily lead to a reduction in fraud. I do not think we have seen justifiable evidence that fraud would be minimised in any way as a result of a reduction in the amount of time between issue of the writ and the close of the rolls. We should be doing everything we can to ensure that new and young voters participate in elections at a state and federal level—at all levels of government—ensuring that they are valued citizens and that their concerns are taken seriously.   
Editorials and shock jocks love headlines which suggest that young Australians are particularly apathetic about, are not interested in, the workings of government. We should be wary of confusing cynicism with apathy. Our own Senate standing committee, formerly Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, which you would be more than familiar with, Madam Acting Deputy President, has conducted a couple of inquiries into the issue of citizenship. Its finding was quite the contrary—that a majority, I believe over 80 per cent, of school age students are particularly keen to know more about the work 
 ings of their democracy. They want to know more about how parliament operates. They want to know more about how they can be politically interested and active. The best way to foster that, to encourage that, is to provide education at both a school level and a general community level.
I commend to the chamber those reports and organisations like the YMCA and the CCF, who are working on a daily basis to ensure that young people are introduced to our democracy and that they understand how the voting system works. Measures like the one before us today will do little to ensure that young people have an understanding of the way the system works or that they are registered to vote and can exercise that very powerful right. So on those grounds I am concerned about the legislation before the chamber today, both because of the privacy implications and its impact on new, first-time and, in particular, young voters. We should be doing everything in our power to ensure that young Australians are empowered and understand the right to vote and the power of their vote. This bill, with some of its measures, does exactly the opposite.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,0,1
"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-15,"—There are a number of provisions in this legislation which are non-controversial. There are some points in it that we can support. There are, however, some major areas of division between the two sides where we cannot find common ground. I will go through each of these in turn. They basically come down to three of the principal parts of this proposed legislation. Firstly, there is the question of disclosure, which I will have more to say about in a moment. Then there is the question of the integrity and the encompassing nature of the electoral roll. This legislation attempts to wind back measures which have given Australia one of the best electoral rolls in the world, and the Electoral Commission a very accurate document. If these measures are carried through they will certainly disfranchise a large number of people.
The other question is the vexed question of gaols. We heard Senator Ray make a number of statements about gaols. He said that originally, in 1983-84, the then Joint Standing 
 Committee on Electoral Matters investigated this proposal and came down with the view that a person serving two years or more should not be entitled to vote at elections. He said that some time during the late 1980s this was changed and the benchmark became five years: if a person was serving five years they lost the right to vote. In all the court cases I have followed, in the ones that I have seen, and when they are reported in the newspaper, the judge does not say at the end of it: `You are not only sentenced to so many years but you have lost the right to vote as well.' I don't know that it is a big issue amongst a large number of prisoners.
But in any democracy, if a person is denied the right to vote we should be clear and precise as to why we are doing it. I do not think the principles in this legislation come to grips with that debate. I agree with Senator Ray; it is an issue that we have set arbitrary limits on before. At least some of the comments he made about a person who would be in prison for the whole of a period of a particular parliament being excluded from the right to vote probably have some merit and could be looked at.
But this legislation is about excluding a group of voters who, it is thought, will predominantly vote Labor. Senator Ray made a few comments. He said that he didn't think that prisoners voted Green. He said he thought that they probably voted against whoever the government was at the time. I now need to declare to the chamber that I was a state member before I came here, as everyone knows. I actually had a gaol in my electorate in the 1989 state poll, and the only box I lost in that state poll was the Yatala Labour Prison box. So I conducted my own investigation afterwards. I wanted to find out why I had lost the box. The Robert Ray theory, which he announced here today, was that it was because at the time we were in state government.
But I must tell the minister, who is finding some mirth at this, that we found out that the sorts of people in prison who actually did vote were more the white-collar criminals—the lawyers and accountants who could not 
 keep their hands out of the till—and they were much more likely to be coalition voters.
—Sounds like Labor lawyers to me.
—There may well have been some Labor lawyers in there; there may well have been some lawyers doing hard labour, Minister. But, at the end of the day, the white-collar criminals in goal continue with the same voting patterns that they have always had. To disenfranchise all prisoners, regardless of what the person is sentenced for, the length of time of that sentence and the severity of the crime, is, I suspect, a principle which is dedicated more to taking people off the roll rather than making the democracy inclusive.
I suspect that this legislation is only part of this debate—that, in fact, we need to look at this much more thoroughly. Maybe we should look at the suggestion that has been made today regarding a person who is in prison for the whole of a parliament. I do not know that that actually satisfies all of the conditions. I suspect a prisoner, who may well have been in for an entire parliament, is not voting for the government that they have had but is voting for the government that they are going to get in the future. Again, I think that is an unsatisfactory condition.
I would like to refer to the other parts of this legislation. I think the question of the closure of the rolls is a rather interesting one. The last election was called at about 8.30 or 9 o'clock on a Sunday morning. That was when I was made aware of it. The 33-day mechanism leading up to the poll—which was conducted in October last year—then took place. If this legislation goes through, that process could be truncated somewhat—certainly at least in respect of getting people on the rolls. In fact, unless I am wrong about this legislation, instead of having the entire next week through until, as I understand it, the Monday of the second week for persons to go on the electoral roll and to sort out their electoral enrolments, what would happen is that that process would actually be complete early in the first week.
So if an election is called early on a Sunday morning, by the early part of that week it is 
 going to be too late to change enrolments, it is going to be too late to get on to the roll. Indeed, what is going to happen is that the roll that will be used at the subsequent poll will not be an accurate and fair representation. There have been figures given in the Senate today that as many as 300,000 people in one form or another will be affected by this process. On previous figures, at least 80,000 will be closed off. 300,000 or more persons will be voting in an electorate in which they currently do not live. They will not be able to vote in the electorate where they will be living for whoever is in government and whoever will be representing them in the near future.
I think that is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs, and for it to be put to the Senate shows the cynicism of this. In fact we on this side of politics have taken the view that this is simply a cynical exercise to take out as many Labor votes as possible. Indeed, it probably could have quite an impact. The results at the last federal election were determined by only a handful of votes in quite a large number of seats. From memory there are something like 10 seats that will fall or stand at the next election with only something of the order of 600 or 700 votes in each one of those electorates. So a measure like this can have a significant impact, and I think it would be a shame to see the rolls treated this way.
Other senators have made comments about the question of privacy. I am not going to go into that. I want to talk about disclosure, but I think the clock is going to close me off and I will do that at a later hour today. But I just want to say here and now that this legislation is a miserable and miserly attempt to try to win a handful of votes or, more precisely, exclude a handful of votes that are not in the interests of the governing parties. As a consequence, the Labor Party will not be supporting those measures. I shall have more to say at a later hour today on the question of disclosure and Greenfields. In the meantime, I have asked Greenfields to send me a loan application form because I am shopping for a housing loan too, and they have the best conditions I have seen.

That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Friday, 5 February 1999, of Neville Thomas Bonner AO, a senator for the State of Queensland from 1971 to 1983, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Neville Bonner's life was one of extraordinary treatment. He was born in the most humble of 
 circumstances. He was orphaned at the age of nine. During his earlier working life he worked as a dairy hand, stockman and carpenter. Ultimately, he entered the federal parliament when he was chosen to fill a casual vacancy in the Senate in 1971. He was then elected to the Senate a further three times and served as a Queensland senator until 1983.
As is well known, he was the first Australian Aboriginal to serve in the federal parliament. A Jagera elder, Neville had a lifelong commitment to recognition for Aboriginal people and was outspoken on Aboriginal rights. He served on many committees and in various offices of this Senate. After he left the Senate, he was named Australian of the Year for outstanding personal achievement and for efforts on behalf of the Aboriginal people. He was appointed an Officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia in 1984.
His remarkable life was well chronicled by his grandson Mitchell Kunde at his funeral service last Friday. As he expressed it better than I would be able to, I seek leave to incorporate a copy of that eulogy in the Senate Hansard. 	Leave granted.
The eulogy read as follows—
A few months ago, I accompanied my grandfather on his last official engagement to the men's reconciliation committee dinner in Brisbane. Grandfather was presented with an award in honour of his outstanding contribution to the process of reconciliation. When he announced that to be his public swan song, all 550 men, without exception, rose to their feet and gave a deafening acclamation, many with tears in their eyes.
More recently, the state government honoured my grandfather by naming a large and impressive government building in William Street, Brisbane, `The Neville Bonner Building'. On Monday, in his honour, the flags flew at half mast on all state government buildings.
The outpouring of sorrow throughout the nation since his passing last Friday has been astounding. And here today are gathered Her Majesty's representatives, our Prime Minister and our State Premier, past and present state and federal parliamentarians, leaders of commerce, clergy of all denominations, elders of Aboriginal tribal `countries' from across this land, and those he loved and served so willingly—the people of the State of Queensland.
So who was this man who could walk with kings nor lose the common touch. . .  

Neville Thomas Bonner was born on a government issue blanket under a loan palm tree on Ukerebagh Island at Tweed Heads, on 28 March, 1922. His mother was visiting from her Jagera country. He was the grandson of `Jung Jung', the last fully initiated member of the Jagera tribe, whose tribal `country' takes in the entire watershed of the Brisbane River. Neville Bonner, by right of inheritance was the elder of Jagera country.
His early life was that of a fringe-dweller, and he experienced hunger and cold, cruel racial discrimination, despair and a lack of schooling. When he was 11 years old, his mother died and he was taken into the care of his maternal grandmother. When he was 13, his grandmother took him to Beaudesert where he received his only formal schooling for one year. Neville Bonner was of necessity, self-taught. He was always a strong advocate of education for all young aborigines.
The following year Neville Bonner's grandmother died and the young Neville Bonner began working on a dairy farm. At age 15 he became his own man and he hit the road with a swag. Over the years he worked on banana plantations, ring-barking and scrub felling. He became an expert cane cutter and later worked as a rough-rider and stockman. Then he rose to a position as head stockman on various large cattle stations. This is where his attachment for his trademark R.M. Williams boots began.
In July 1943, he married the now late Mrs Mona Bonner. In 1945, after the birth of their first son, who became very ill, Neville Bonner and his little family moved to Palm island Aboriginal community Queensland. It was on Palm Island, realising the plight of his people, that he became actively involved in community affairs. He learned about racial `togetherness'—that indigenous Australians could trust the non-indigenous Australians and to a certain extent be guided by them.
He rose to the position of Assistant Settlement Overseer, responsible for the administration of a work force of 250 people. But after 15 years he left Palm Island, motivated by the desire to further the cause of `togetherness'. He brought his wife and, by this stage 5 sons and 2 foster daughters to live at Lake Manchester where he managed a dairy farm for three years.
He finally settled in Ipswich, the heart of his Jagera country and he became involved in an organisation known as the Ipswich Coloured Welfare Council which he saw as doing something positive to help Aboriginal people. Neville Bonner felt that he could achieve worthwhile results for his people through this organisation. Since his time on Palm island Neville Bonner had been committed to the notion of justice and the advancement of his indigenous people through the common sense approach. He was always strongly opposed to violence as an answer. 

Another member of the Ipswich Coloured Welfare Council was my grandmother—Mrs Heather Bonner. Eventually this organisation became affiliated with OPAL—the One People of Australia League—of which Neville Bonner later became state president for 7 years, then patron, then life member.
In 1966 he established his own boomerang manufacturing business under the name `Bonnerangs'. The business produced authentic boomerangs handcrafted from the roots of the black wattle tree. He also made nullah nullahs, bull roarers and other artefacts.
Following this, in 1968, he commenced work with the then Moreton Shire Council as a bridge carpenter.
In 1969, Mrs Mona Bonner passed away, and Neville Bonner threw himself wholeheartedly into his cause of the advancement of indigenous Australians. Around this time he became a member, reportedly the first Aboriginal member of the Liberal Party and he had a remarkable rise through the party ranks. In May 1971, Neville Bonner won the endorsement to the casual Senate vacancy in Queensland and when he flew to Canberra on the 15th August 1971 he had $5.00 in the pocket of the only suit he owned. When he was sworn in as a senator later that day, he became the first Aboriginal member of the Australian Federal Parliament.
The following year, two important things happened. Firstly, on 29 July (1972), he married my grandmother and secondly, in December he was overwhelmingly elected as a senator by the people of Queensland.
In 1976 Senator Bonner was the first Aborigine to introduce his own private member's bill, entitled `Aborigines and Islanders (Admissibility of Confessions) Bill 1976 into the Australian Parliament. Also, he was the first back-bencher to introduce a government bill and carry it through all stages, namely the `Aboriginal Development Commission' Bill. He served and chaired numerous Senate committees and also sat as president of the Senate on occasions.
Senator Bonner was appointed a life member of the Queensland Young Liberals movement in January, 1978. Life membership of the Liberal Party was later bestowed upon him.
Neville Bonner remained a senator of Queensland for 12 years through four elections. A large painting of `Senator Neville Bonner' displayed in Parliament House, Canberra, is a tribute from the nation to the first Aborigine in the federal parliament of Australia. Buildings valued at $9m, named `Bonner House' and `Bonner Court' located in Canberra are another tribute, this time from the Aborigines of Australia. On the 26th January, 1979 Neville Bonner was presented with the Australian 
 of the Year award by the Australia Day Council. In July of that year a biography by Angela Burger titled `Neville Bonner' was published.
In the 1983 elections, Neville Bonner stood as an independent Senate candidate and narrowly missed re-election.
In January 1984, Neville Bonner was honoured by the award of `Officer in the General Order of Australia' (AO).
When he left politics Neville Bonner took up a position on the board of directors with the Australian Broadcasting Commission which he held from 1983 to 1991.
He was then appointed by the Queensland government as senior official visitor to state correctional centres. Upon completion of 6½ years as senior official visitor, in January 1997, Neville Bonner undertook full time duties as chairman of the Queensland Indigenous Advisory Council. In this role he was responsible for advising the Queensland government and the Minister for Families, Youth and Community Care, on all indigenous issues.
In 1996 he was awarded a doctorate of the University—Griffith University, by his friend Chief Justice MacRossan. The following year Neville Bonner was involved in a landmark sittings of the Children's Court of Queensland when the then Children's Court President, Judge Maguire, invited him to jointly conduct court proceedings at the Aboriginal community of Cherbourg.
And last year Neville Bonner was made honorary adviser to the Queensland police service.
Throughout the course of his official duties, Neville Bonner always made time to be actively involved in a number of worthy associations and organisations. He was:
Honorary Vice President of National TOC H (Inc)
The patron of World Vision from 1976-1990
A member of the Mayor's task force, for the Ipswich campus of the University of Queensland
A member of the Purga Aboriginal Elders Committee
A member of the Council of the Griffith University
Foundation member and director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy
The Chairman of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Committee of the Griffith University
The patron of Rivermount College at Yatala
A Deputy-Commissioner of the Queensland Aboriginal Land Tribunal
The patron of One People of Australia League
And, the patron of Community Aid Abroad. 

Throughout his parliamentary career, as patron of World Vision, and also privately, Neville Bonner travelled the world visiting 27 countries. He met with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth (II), presidents of the United States of America and other world leaders and yet he remained such a down to earth gentleman, a man who delighted in the simple pleasures of life. When he enjoyed better health, his main sources of recreation were public speaking, listening to country music, a round of golf at the Rosewood Gold Club or feeding the magpies in his backyard at West Ipswich just down the road from here.
Neville Bonner was an extremely humble man. He would not have been comfortable with the praise which has been given him since his passing. He once said that he would like to be remembered as `A good man who tried his best and did his best'. . . with respect, that is greatly understating his contribution.
Neville Bonner served all people, irrespective of their colour, class or creed, to assist in bringing about the true togetherness of all Australians with ethnic identity retained where desired. From desperately humble beginnings, and with determination, dedication, great dignity and distinction, Neville Bonner fought tirelessly his whole life for justice for his people and the togetherness of all Australians. His achievements against incredible odds, have assured him a place in history and in heaven.
Neville Bonner made a truly outstanding contribution to this country but more relevant to me personally, he lived his entire life as a shining example of racial harmony.
He is survived by his wife, Mrs Heather Bonner, 5 sons, 2 daughters, 2 foster daughters, 31 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren.
When Neville Bonner married my grandmother in 1972, I became a part of this large multicultural family and he shared his love equally, without favour, between us all. Considering his many achievements outside his family life, one might wonder that he had any time for us at all—but he did. And I have great memories of our Christmases in the park and at his home, birthdays and other special occasions. Grandfather was one of those special people who profoundly touched the lives of everyone he met. . . but to have him as my grandfather was such a special privilege.
It has been said that Neville Bonner was a role-model and an example to Aboriginal people, but, by the way he lived his professional and family life he should be an inspiration to all people. And today I pray that every Australian will learn the spirit of togetherness from the life of this remarkable man—a genuine Australian legend—my grandfather.
—From my own personal observations and I think in the unanimous 
 view of all, Neville was an extraordinary man and his life was a lesson to us all: the way he overcame personal adversity; the inspiration he offered to all who refused to be shackled by disadvantage; the guidance he offered on values, in particular tolerance and compassion; and the way in which he accepted disappoints without bitterness. In terms of a lesson, his legacy particularly lies within indigenous issues.
To Aboriginal people he said: be proud of your heritage, Aboriginality, language, culture, values and spiritual knowledge; recognise the special capacity of Aboriginal people to enrich the total Australian society; do not accept that you are of necessity disenfranchised within that broader society; you are entitled to full opportunities and benefits of that society and the responsibilities which come with that opportunity; accept the personal effort which will be necessary to achieve your full potential; and it will not be easy, as Neville personally demonstrated.
To non-Aboriginal Australians he urged the mirror image: appreciate the unique history of Aboriginal Australia; recognise that embracing Aboriginal heritage will enrich Australia; appreciate the disadvantage suffered by continuing generations of Aboriginal Australians arising out of dispossession not just of the land but of a way of life and the responsibility that flows to help overcome that disadvantage; and accept the legitimacy of Aboriginal people to the broader aspirations of all Australians. 
At his funeral service, Neville was spoken of as a bridge builder. Today we call that reconciliation. Whilst Neville made a unique contribution to reconciliation, he would recognise the extent of the unfinished business. Neville's life and example have motivated many individuals to work a little harder towards achieving genuine reconciliation. That is an impressive legacy in itself. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Heather, and to his large family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bonner, Mr Neville Thomas, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-15,"—On behalf of the opposition, I wish to support the condolence motion that has been 
 moved by Senator Hill on behalf of the government and to associate the opposition with it. The Labor Party and opposition senators express very deep regret at the death of Neville Bonner. He was not only a distinguished senator but also an elder of the Jagera people. Neville Bonner will always have a place in Australian history as the first Aborigine ever elected to the Commonwealth parliament, but more than that I think he will be remembered for the very significant contribution he made to our nation. I do not think there was any doubt that he was a great inspiration to many others in the community.
While I entered the parliament well after Neville Bonner lost his Senate seat, I certainly was fortunate enough recently to be able to share the floor of the House of Representatives chamber in Old Parliament House with him at the Constitutional Convention at the beginning of last year. I suppose it comes as no surprise that we were on opposing sides of the debate at that time and on opposing sides in politics but, like so many others, I will remember his address to the convention. I do not think there is any doubt that his address at that convention was one of the most passionate and memorable that was delivered in that forum.
As Senator Hill has indicated in his speech on this condolence motion, Neville Bonner was born in 1922 in a blacks' camp on an island of the Tweed River in New South Wales. His parents died when he was still a young boy. He was raised by his grandparents and, I am told and I have read, it was from his grandfather that he learned his heritage and beliefs and from his grandmother that he learned to appreciate education. Regardless of those very difficult circumstances surrounding his early childhood, in later life he certainly became a most effective parliamentarian and a very respected member of this parliament.
Also as a young adult he decided that he would very much take a course of standing up for himself and standing up for all indigenous Australians. In 1970, he made history by becoming the first Aborigine to contest a Senate election. He was placed third on the Queensland Liberal Party ticket at that time. He was not elected but in 1971 was chosen to 
 fill a casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin. So Neville Bonner did become the first Aboriginal person to be elected to the federal parliament, and he went on to serve in this place until 1983. During the period he was a senator, I do not think there is any question that he did work tirelessly for the welfare of Queenslanders. He gave a lot of his time to issues like indigenous health, housing and land rights. He very much became a very effective advocate for justice for and understanding of indigenous people.
He was also an outspoken senator who, at times, felt that the proper course of action on an issue of principle was to cross the floor, and that was mainly on issues of great significance to indigenous people. Later in his political career, he was dropped to an unwinnable position on the Liberal Party Senate ticket in Queensland but went on to contest the 1983 federal election as an Independent. I think he received around 90,000 votes in Queensland, not enough to get him over the line and win him a Senate seat but, nevertheless, a very significant indication of the level of support there was for him in the community.
Australia at that time lost a fine representative from the parliament but, after leaving politics, he continued to fight for the equality of indigenous people and respect for Aboriginal culture, and I think it is fair to say that, in Neville Bonner, here was a man who was an inspiration for very many Australians. On behalf of the opposition, I join with the government in expressing our sincere condolences on his death and our sincere sympathy to his wife, family and friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bonner, Mr Neville Thomas, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"Boswell, Sen Ronald",NP,1999-02-15,"—I rise to associate the National Party of Australia with the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. We were all very saddened when we heard of the passing of Neville Bonner, although it was not a surprise to us. Shortly after the Constitutional Convention, it was announced that he was having a life and death struggle with cancer. He won another 12 months of life, but 
 he succumbed to that battle a couple of weeks ago.
Neville Bonner will be remembered warmly not only because he was a senator and because he was the first Aboriginal in parliament but also because he filled those roles with dignity and tried to bring together the two cultures. Madam President, you were at the funeral with many of us last week and you could not have failed to be impressed by the blending of the two cultures: the many Aboriginal people and the many leaders of the white community coming together to pay respect to this great Australian.
He was a great Australian. As his grandson said in the eulogy, he was born on a government issued blanket under a tree on an Aboriginal reserve. He had one year's schooling. He was brought up by his grandparents. He spent a great deal of his life on Palm Island with his first wife. But, with all these setbacks in life, with one year's schooling, he came into this federal parliament where very few people do not have at least one, two, three or four degrees, and he represented Queensland. It is ironic that, in political life, 1983 was the time of the National Party Senate. I believe that I actually replaced Neville, because the National Party ended up with one more senator and the Liberal Party ended up with one less.
I met him from time to time around the traps, at the various significant political rallies and Constitutional Convention rallies. I met him at the Queensland Governor's house where he and I were invited for dinner on some occasions. He certainly never carried any grudge against me, and I never heard him ever say anything derogatory about the Liberal Party.
For someone with so little schooling or education, he made up for it with a great deal of determination. He was determined that he was going to represent Queensland, and he did it well.
It is a remarkable story. He went from a dairy farm to one of the biggest cattle stations in Queensland where he became head stockman. He then married an Aboriginal lady, went up to live on Palm Island, had five sons and adopted two daughters. I was told by his 
 family that he went to Palm Island because he believed that he would get better health treatment for one of his children who was sick. From there he went down to Ipswich where he became a bridge builder. Sir James Killen made much of that in his eulogy at the funeral on Friday, and how he built bridges between the white and black communities.
I believe that Neville Bonner will be well remembered in Australia. He has carved out a unique place in history. His name will be remembered. From 1971 to 1983 he represented Queensland. Some would say that maybe he was a little bit before his time in what he did for the Aboriginal community, but he certainly built that bridge across the two communities. Nowhere better did we see it than at his funeral where there were white people. His adopted grandson from the white part of the family gave the most wonderful oration about the deeds of his step-grandfather. Some of his family sang, others recited poetry and one son even played the didgeridoo as we all marched out of the funeral.
I know it is very unusual to say that a funeral is spectacular, but this was a spectacular funeral. Both the black and white communities gave Neville a great send-off. I am sure he would have been looking down on us in the church last Friday and would have seen so many of his friends from parliament and so many of his indigenous friends, and his wife and all his family. I think there are about 130 great-grandchildren; it is a very extensive family, many of whom have been adopted as is the custom of Aboriginal people. Many of them were there; many Aboriginal people were there.
I extend my condolences to his family, his extended family, the Aboriginal people who were there in such great numbers, and all his friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bonner, Mr Neville Thomas, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,1999-02-15,"—I also rise to support the condolence motion. I would certainly extend the thoughts, prayers and support of the Democrats to the family of Neville Bonner.
I have known Neville Bonner for 30 years and during that time I have known and respected him deeply. I would like to say that he was my friend. I believe he was, but it is 
 very easy to say that someone is your friend; it would be better if they would say that you were their friend. I do not lightly claim friendship, but I do believe that we were close friends.
Neville Bonner was a controversial person, but you need to understand what and who he was against the background of Queensland politics over the last 30 or 40 years, because that is the only way you can understand where Neville was coming from.
In the end all of us would have to say that Neville was his own person. We sometimes say that of people, but if it was ever true of anyone, it was true of Neville Bonner. He was never owned by anybody, certainly not the Liberal Party, the conservative side of politics or the radical or conservative sides of the Aboriginal movement. It was impossible to put him in any category. That is why I was reticent about easily claiming that he was my friend.
We first met through OPAL, which was an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander welfare organisation which began in the 1960s and still operates today. We need to understand some of the background to OPAL because that helps us to understand Neville Bonner. It was set up in the early 1960s with the support of the state government and originally to counter alleged communist influence in other Aboriginal organisations, such as the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders.
In fact, it is a fascinating story that I might tell some time and shows how FCAATSI, as it was known, was sidelined at one stage in order for the state government to ensure that OPAL would be set up. The state government, the National Civic Council and various people were involved in the sidelining, but we do not have time for that story today.
OPAL really was set up to counteract the subversive influence of people like my friend Senator Margaret Reynolds, who was very active in the federal council as an alternative organisation. As far as I am concerned, any idea that Senator Reynolds is subversive would be very much tongue in cheek. But, nevertheless, as one of the people in the 
 federal council she was seen to be so in the 1960s.
It was in the context of Queensland politics that Neville Bonner became President of OPAL in 1967, some years after it was first inaugurated. If the state government felt that Neville Bonner was going to be a safe president, they discovered, as I think everyone who knew him discovered, that he could not be owned by anybody—or controlled by them for that matter.
 I myself had been a member of OPAL, first of all in the early 1960s in Mitchell, then in Cloncurry and then in 1972 as a director on the board of directors for a couple of years. Neville soon showed, however, that he was not controlled by anybody, not by any state government or by anyone else. OPAL began to be a much more independent organisation under his presidency.
 There was one incident that I was involved in which underlined his independence very well. When I was the secretary of OPAL in Cloncurry, we had an Aboriginal railway worker who applied for membership of OPAL but was rejected. So I went to my friend former Senator Stan Collard and said, `We have to find out what this is about.' He arranged for me to have an interview with Pat Killoran, the then Director of the Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs.
I then discovered that every application for membership of OPAL had to be processed through the special branch of the police department. I talked to Mr Killoran, who nodded his head, mumbled in his beard and said things about trade unionists, communists and so on, which we were very used to in Queensland in those days. That was given as some sort of reason for refusing the membership of this particular Aboriginal man. I appealed to Neville Bonner as president of OPAL, and his response was something like, `What nonsense.' That Aboriginal railway worker's application was then approved. Neville was very much an independent person.
When Neville Bonner became a senator, I invited him on a number of occasions to address youth groups for which I was responsible. In 1974 he came to speak to the youth 
 group in the Sandgate parish where I was the minister. Heather and Neville came to dinner at our place before we went to meet with the youth group. I remember how delighted my small daughters were that Heather brought along—somehow or other she knew about young girls—a box of beads and other jewellery. My daughters have never forgotten that. They think Heather and Neville Bonner were the best people in all the world. But that was the sort of kindness that both Neville and Heather demonstrated so often to other people.
I remember during the dinner that I thanked Neville and Heather for giving up their time and I remarked that they must have many invitations to dinner. Neville said to me then that he was rarely invited to the homes of white Australians. I was very sad about this, but I hope that, in the years following, there was a change to the lack of invitations.
In 1982 during the Commonwealth Games, I remember how hard Neville Bonner worked to try to stop the protest—which, I might add, I approved of; I was in disagreement with him. But I was so impressed with the tremendous dignity of his appeal to his own people and to others of us who were involved in those protests that he certainly made me stop and rethink the position I had taken. That was the kind of effect Neville had on people, even when you disagreed with him.
In 1991, as the chaplain at the Queensland University of Technology, I organised an interfaith celebration as part of the multicultural festival and invited Neville Bonner to come and represent the spirituality of the Aboriginal people. I was impressed by the way in which he welcomed the contribution and the rich diversity of the many faiths which were represented at that particular celebration. Neville was unashamedly a Christian but he was not an exclusive Christian. He was one who had not a narrow understanding but rather a broad understanding of the spiritual dimensions of life and of the wide diversity and cultural richness of all the people who now make up the nation of Australia. That was underlined by his participation on that occasion and by his welcome 
 to all of those people at that multicultural celebration.
 In 1975, as I pointed out this afternoon in asking a question of the Special Minister of State, Neville Bonner was instrumental in having a resolution passed by this Senate which was a significant resolution, given that it was passed in 1975, long before the gains of Mabo were achieved. Let me, as part of this tribute, read the resolution again:
. . . the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, and urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership of the said indigenous people and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land.
I was thankful that the minister said he would take seriously this wording in the consideration the government gives to the idea of another question during the referendum on the republic. I believe Neville Bonner set for us a precedent and a platform for a real, honest and proper recognition of Aboriginal people in this country. Wouldn't it be great if we were able, in some way, to use the wording of the resolution which he had passed in 1975 as a suitable memorial in honour of the late Senator Bonner?",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bonner, Mr Neville Thomas, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-02-15,"—I rise to support Senator Hill's motion of condolence on the death of former Queensland Senator Neville Bonner. Anyone who is the first of any group to take a big step such as being the first Aboriginal person to represent their state and the first Aboriginal person in federal parliament is very courageous. 	 Reading through the biographical details of the political life of former Senator Bonner, you get a small taste of the difficulties that may have been part of not only his life but the life of numerous Aboriginal people, many of whom did not have the ability or the position to speak out as strongly as he did. Even though he held a prominent position, I noticed that there were two occasions published on which he was refused service in a hotel simply for asking for a beer. On one occasion two parents withdrew their daughters from a debutante ball because they 
 were being presented to an Aboriginal senator; the parents were adamant that they would not allow their children to be presented to a black person.
It would have taken an extraordinary person with an extraordinary amount of composure to deal with these kinds of setbacks. But, from what I hear, from what I have seen and from what I have read, he was that kind of person. He was able to continue to do the job that he believed he had to do.
In 1973 Aboriginal justices of the peace were appointed to sit with magistrates and judges in all cases involving Aboriginal defendants. Neville Bonner did that because of an element of personal concern about a member of his family. However, even today in 1999, a close friend of mine in Western Australia is still finding difficulty, as an Aboriginal justice of the peace, in being treated as an ordinary human being while trying to do the job that he believes is so important in being able to be there and available for Aboriginal people when elements of the law do not understand the particular problems. To quote Senator Bonner, `Aboriginal culture and customs usually weren't understood by courts, though they might play some part in an Aboriginal defendant's action.' That was recognised by Senator Bonner in 1973. He was a voice for a people whose voice is still not being heard by many people today.
A couple of the people who have spoken to this condolence motion have mentioned former Senator Bonner's political courage in taking action based on his beliefs on a particular issue—even if his party was voting differently. This was not just demonstrated on issues of Aboriginal rights. There was at least one occasion when Senator Bonner crossed the floor on the issue of human rights in East Timor regarding a request for a full inquiry into the deaths of the journalists at Balibo.
I believe that former Senator Bonner made an extremely important contribution to Australian politics, and it is extremely significant that from 1 July we will have Senator-elect Aden Ridgeway taking his place as the next Aboriginal senator. Although we know that there is a long way to go, I think we all owe 
 a debt to the courage and tenacity of former Senator Neville Bonner in taking that first step. So, on behalf of the Greens (WA), we warmly share in the motion of condolence.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bonner, Mr Neville Thomas, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"MacGibbon, Sen David",LP,1999-02-15,"—I had the privilege of serving with Neville Bonner for seven of the 12 years he spent in the Senate, and so I support this condolence motion this afternoon. Few people have started life with more disadvantages than Neville, but that was not a hindrance to what was a very successful and productive life.
He took his place here as a Liberal senator for Queensland in 1971. He was a very conscientious senator, well known and well liked throughout Queensland. Through those years we did many a visit together around Queensland. One in particular I remember with pleasure was a visit to Fraser Island to inspect the logging and forestry practices in what would prove to be a very long lead-up to the cessation of logging on the island.
Neville's greatest contribution to the community was, however, as an Aboriginal leader, particularly after his parliamentary career. Unquestionably, he was the best and most effective Aboriginal leader this country has seen. And that was very much a consequence of his personality and his character.
It would be remiss of me to only refer to his activities as a senator and an Aboriginal leader. He was very committed to serving his community. He was a commissioner for the ABC and a senior visitor to prisons in Queensland, amongst his other duties.
Neville was naturally a quiet person. Not for him the shouting, blatantly aggressive confrontationalist approach in human relations. He always had the courage of his convictions, which he maintained with dignity. He always chose his words carefully, and those words were words of reasonableness and moderation. Above all, the sincerity with which he approached everything shone through. It was these qualities, so often lacking in public life today, which made him the respected figure that the nation mourned last week. To his wife, Heather, and his wide family, I extend my deepest sympathies.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bonner, Mr Neville Thomas, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"Parer, Sen Warwick",LP,1999-02-15,"—I rise to support the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill. Today we are mourning the death and celebrating the life of a remarkable Australian, Neville Bonner, who passed away on 5 February and who was honoured last week with a state funeral because of his life's work and service to the Australian community. A former Liberal senator for Queensland from 1971 to 1983, Neville Bonner served in this place drawing much admiration.
It is no secret that Neville grew up under hard conditions. Born on 28 March 1922, his beginnings were, to say the least, meagre. He was born on a government blanket in a camp under a palm tree that stood among the lantana on Ukerebagh Island just off the Tweed River. His mother died when he was a boy and he was raised by his grandparents. It was a difficult start to life, a life that was to be filled for Neville with many challenges, difficulties and triumphs. Yet his early life circumstances would form the foundation of his strong sense of fairness, justice and compassion. The qualities of this man forged during his youth would last a lifetime.
Neville was a good orator and an avid reader despite only receiving one year of formal education at the age of 15, where he excelled by graduating three grades. By the age of 18, he packed his swag and set off on his early working career, which took him to many parts of Queensland. Over this time he tried his hand at dairying, ringbarking and scrub-felling and as a meat worker and a stockman. It was while he was working at Palm Island that his leadership skills began to emerge. Managing a large work force, he formed several committees to serve local needs, and he lived on Palm Island for some 17 years with his first wife, five sons and two foster daughters.
On his return to Brisbane in 1960, Neville established a manufacturing business in Ipswich producing boomerangs. In 1961 he joined the Queensland division of the Liberal Party. His interest in community affairs was increasing, and in 1965 he joined what Senator Woodley referred to as OPAL, the One People of Australia League, becoming its state 
 president in 1967. He had by this time closed his manufacturing business and was working for the Moreton Shire Council as a bridge carpenter, a skill he acquired on Palm Island. This was alluded to by Sir James Killen in his eulogy of Bonner the bridge builder, meaning not just physically building bridges but as a bridge builder in other aspects of life in his career.
Sadly, in 1969 Neville's first wife, Mona, died. Then in 1970 he made his first run for office, contesting the 1970 federal election as No. 3 candidate on the joint Liberal-Country Party Senate ticket. Though his first Senate bid failed, he was selected in 1971 under section 15 of the constitution to fill a Senate vacancy caused by the resignation of Dame Annabelle Rankin. Neville Bonner won his preselection convincingly on the first ballot from a field of seven candidates, and he was re-elected to the Senate three times until 1983.
Neville Bonner was a conservative Liberal. He knew his own mind, he knew what he believed in and he knew what it took to succeed. He had an unshakeable faith in his core beliefs, and he knew that reward for his people and for all Australians lay in patient, steady and prudent challenge using the due process of law and the political system. For his quiet outspokenness, he suffered at times the ridicule of both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, preferring to follow the wisdom inside passed down to him from many generations.
A Jugarah elder, Neville Bonner was outspoken on Aboriginal issues, never losing touch with Aboriginal law, beliefs or traditions and always ensuring that future generations were educated and mentored in the ways of Aboriginal custom. A man of great integrity who stood up for his own convictions never toeing any political line to buy friend or favour, he saw himself first and foremost as an Australian, an Australian who had ancestral responsibilities, an Australian who had community responsibilities. He never let up despite illness or other setbacks. He was a gentle soul who always showed a cheerful and peaceful demeanour which was indicative of his positive attitude to life.
As you know, Madam President, Neville Bonner was the first Aborigine elected to parliament. Ever cognisant of his early years, Neville Bonner was highly interested in matters of indigenous significance, yet he was adamant that he would be a senator for all Queensland saying:
But I am to represent the State of Queensland and my loyalties and responsibilities will be to the people of Queensland.
A strong believer in tradition and the responsibility of office, he professed a concern for his country, its people and the quality of life that Australians could enjoy. This is clearly articulated in his maiden speech, when he reminded us that he was educated in the school of hard knocks, with his teacher being experience. He pledged as a senator to play his role which his state of Queensland, his race, his background, his political beliefs, his knowledge of man and circumstances dictate. This he said he would do through the grace of God to the benefit of all Australians.
From the moment he stepped into the political arena as a Liberal senator, Neville Bonner became one of Australia's best known politicians—no, I guess you cannot say `politician' because Neville always wished to be referred to as a parliamentarian. He achieved this great success because he was true to himself and was listened to by the broader community, which is testified by his significantly increased majority in three successive elections. His service and interest in the Senate included but were not limited to areas related to health, housing, education, employment, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander matters and employment.
In the parliament he brought an Aboriginal voice to the heart of the nation, speaking out on issues to close the divide between black and white Australians. It was a voice we will hear in our hearts forever because he knew how to temper truth with dissension. Neville Bonner was always a modest peaceable man. He was a man you could not help but like, and his success was always through his own endeavours. He was a gentle man. He stood by his principles. He was a passionate man, having no fear to sincerely follow his heart. 
 And he was a loyal man, never forgetting his purpose.
His life of public service and concern for his fellow man endured throughout his life and, despite his recent illness, Neville Bonner continued to champion causes. Many will remember his high involvement in last year's Constitutional Convention, taking up a position with the Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy. In fact, his life after leaving the Senate was full of public service and recognition, such as his appointment as a board director of the ABC; he was awarded the Order of Australia in 1984; a senior official adviser to Queensland Prisons from 1990-97; chairman of the Indigenous Advisory Board from 1997; and honorary adviser to the Queensland Police Service on indigenous issues in 1998. He was also a patron to a number of organisations and readily gave advice to a number of community organisations.
Neville Bonner was much loved and highly regarded in the Liberal Party. He was a good speaker and quickly rose through the Party political ranks from his membership of the One Mile Branch in the Oxley-Ipswich area to area chairman, member of state executive and then to Senator for Queensland. In 1978 he was awarded special life membership by the Queensland Young Liberal Movement and was subsequently made a life member of the Liberal Party of Australia.
Neville Bonner's path from a poor youth to an adult of public distinction was no accident. He worked hard, used his experience as a learning curve and knew not to carry any hate or bitterness in his heart. This was very much part of the secret of Neville's success. I draw your attention, Madam President, to one particular comment in his maiden speech to this chamber which had a perennial ring of truth when he spoke of acceptance and equality, saying Australia:
. . . will be a grand country only when those who sit in this Chamber, and in another place, really and truly believe in this aim and work to achieving it. I believe we should forget our petty differences and really work for those who put us here and have entrusted the nation to our hands. 

I was one of the thousand or more from all walks of life who attended Neville's funeral last Friday, as did you, Madam President, and other senators in this chamber. I think it was referred to by somebody, maybe Senator Woodley, as a `grand occasion'. I have to say that Neville Bonner would have been extremely proud of the part played at his funeral by his children, his grandchildren and his nieces. This is a time of painful sorrow made worse by the loss of Neville's son Patrick last July from bone cancer. To his wife, Heather, his children and grandchildren, I extend my deepest sympathy at this time of great sorrow.
—Hear, hear!",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bonner, Mr Neville Thomas, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-02-15,"—For those of my generation, Neville Bonner was an outstanding Australian, a legend in his own time and a household name. Nothing I can say in this condolence motion will further add to the recognition, respect and admiration that was given to this great man. I will very briefly comment on a couple of minor but very personal experiences that I had with Senator Bonner.
I was always so proud that Neville Bonner was a Liberal—and, to a degree, it reinforced my commitment to the Liberal Party as a party for all people. I was ever so proud of the party when Neville Bonner came to be elected as Australia's first Aboriginal parliamentarian. He always used to emphasise in those early days—and I was only a bit of a kid then—that he was `a Senator for all Queenslanders'. He was always very proud of his Aboriginality, but he emphasised that he was in the Senate as a Queensland senator and he was there to represent all of Queensland.
I remember when I was a bit of a young thing, still floating around in my home town of Ayr, I had a flat that had become renowned for the parties that used to be held there—this was before I was married, of course. And I remember Neville Bonner coming to town one day in his travels as a Liberal Senator for Queensland and he stayed in my flat. I always thought that that showed what a great man he was—he did not really 
 care where he stayed, and he was as happy to stay in my flat, even with its reputation for wild parties, as he was to stay anywhere else. He was that sort of a person, and you could relate to him. I barely knew him, but he called on me because he knew I was involved in a very small way in Liberal politics and I was so pleased that he did that and was able to stay with me overnight.
The other incident is a little amusing, but it showed what a great man Neville Bonner was and what great respect people had for him. I was in the Apex Club, which is a young man's service club. We were having our North Queensland convention in Innisfail—I think it was in the cultural centre, which had several big auditoriums in it—and 200 or 300 young men were attending. On the Sunday morning—this was after a heavy Saturday night, as those things tended to be—we were discussing fairly mundane business when, suddenly, there was a bit of a stir at the back of the hall and in strode Neville Bonner with a couple of minders. He walked straight up to the front table. In the middle of whatever we were discussing, the Apexians stood as a person and applauded him so warmly. He got to the top of the table and sat down. The chairman of the meeting looked at him and he looked back. The chairman eventually got up and whispered to him and it became obvious that Neville Bonner had come in, quite uninvited, to the wrong room in this centre. 
Never to be outdone, Neville, with a bit of encouragement from the audience who started clapping him when that was explained, got up and gave a 10-minute off-the-cuff address about his role and the role that service clubs played. It was a warm experience for both the Apexians and, I think, for Neville Bonner, that he was so well-regarded and such a significant figure that he was able to get away with what would, for other people, have been an embarrassment. I am happy that Neville Bonner got his life membership of the Liberal Party in recent years. It is, indeed, great recognition for a great Australian. I am honoured to have known Neville Bonner and I extend to Heather and his family my condolences.  ",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bonner, Mr Neville Thomas, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-02-15,"—Madam President, I was honoured to be with you and other honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives at the funeral of Neville Bonner—this great Australian. I was also honoured to have served with him in this parliament from 1975 until the election of 1983. Neville Bonner said, in his first speech to this parliament:
Too long, too long, we have been crying out and far too few have heard us.
Although Neville Bonner knew, and his heart cried out for his people, he did not at any time attempt to undermine the fundamental institutions of a democratic society to achieve that end. He worked with one and all to achieve that objective. Even though he was criticised on the one hand by certain militants and on the other hand by racists, he sought and pursued the goal of what is right. He hungered for what is right. Very often, he would talk about his people and the years gone by.
On a personal note, my young children, on the odd occasion when they came up to Canberra, were fascinated by Senator Neville Bonner and they learnt a lot from him. He took the time to talk to them. On their behalf, I am so grateful that he did take that time because it reinforced in them the importance of achieving justice for the Aboriginal people of Australia.
He did not attempt to undermine the institutions of a democratic society. He did believe that a critical mass of moral virtue was indispensable for the proper functioning of a democratic society. He believed, very firmly, in the transcendence of individuals in society over the government—in other words, the government was not there other than to act in the best interests of those who are governed. The basis of that was his belief in the inherent dignity of every human being. He realised it to be untouchable by the state because it was God-given.
He not only exercised his functions as a parliamentarian, as was described here a moment ago, on behalf of the Aboriginal people. He did so for all citizens of Australia. And not only Australia but also others in the world who experienced persecution, racial 
 discrimination and the thuggery of dictatorships. He went to refugee camps in Kampuchea. When he came back he expressed that these were the worst living conditions he had seen human beings subjected to. Here was a man who had been through pretty poor sets of living conditions where he was brought up, but he came back and said that he had never seen anybody living in such deplorable conditions. He also criticised government on the Timor matter. It is interesting to note that he was a person before his time.
I would like to congratulate the Liberal Party for their foresight in nominating Neville Bonner, which could not have been terribly easy in Queensland in those days. I think they deserve recognition on the occasion of this condolence motion for Neville Bonner. Unfortunately, in 1983 Neville Bonner got third on the ticket and decided to stand as an Independent. If I recall correctly, in 1983, before the election, I had something to do with the balance of power situation. Had Neville Bonner been returned, Neville and I would have exercised that, no doubt very responsibly. The Democrats benefited from Neville's defeat in that regard. I am not saying that you campaigned against Neville, but that is the fact of political life.
But he did not go out with too bad a result. On that occasion, as an Independent, he got 92,000 votes, almost 100,000 votes. Somebody says: why did he not get elected? I have heard people talk about the number of primary votes I got too. But I wonder who of those elected from the second position in political parties got more. Unfortunately, despite getting nearly 100,000 votes, he did not get in. That did not deter him. There was no lasting bitterness. He was prepared to forgive, as he forgave that person for refusing him and two of his friends a drink in the pub. He was a man, poor in spirit, whose essential humility came out. He was a man who mourned for what happened to his people. I just hope and pray that he and his family—I pray for Heather and for all of the extended family—are comforted.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bonner, Mr Neville Thomas, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
"O'Chee, Sen Bill",NP,1999-02-15,"—As someone who had a passing acquaintance with Neville Bonner, I do not 
 intend to delay the chamber long, but I think it is appropriate to make a few observations about the impact that former Senator Bonner could make on my generation and people of my generation. I remember as a young boy our family would make not infrequent excursions to Murwillumbah or northern New South Wales and when we drove down the Tweed River my parents pointed out to me the island on which Neville Bonner was born. It was a significant fact to them, and it was made a significant fact to me. The reason why they did it was to say to me that people from humble beginnings could in fact rise to greatness. That was undoubtedly the case with former Senator Bonner. He was a great Australian.
The fact that I would remember it so many years later shows the impact that Neville Bonner could have even on the formative mind when one did not necessarily understand exactly what a senator did. People of my generation growing up in  Queensland knew that Neville Bonner was a significant man, a significant Australian. That, I think, is testimony to the enduring nature of his legacy, because for my generation Neville Bonner was a real live character who strode the political world with greatness.
The other observation I make is that Neville Bonner from time to time came to Canberra and you would see him in the dining room or you might come across him in Queensland. He might talk to you or you might be at a meeting with him. He always had a wonderful capacity for self-effacement, which I find is a rare characteristic in politics and one which I find very endearing. It was undoubtedly part of the success that he had as a person that he could be so self-effacing, that he never took himself too seriously, but at the same time he never undermined the credibility of what he was saying. To achieve that requires a rare balance that few people actually attain.
Neville Bonner was also a man who, when the occasion demanded, could make very incisive observations about a particular situation or about a particular problem that was present at the time. Those observations were made not off the cuff and without forethought; they were made clearly from a great 
 degree of consideration. He thought through a problem before he spoke about it. Therefore, when he did speak he could be so much more effective.
Sadly, we will not hear former Senator Bonner speak any more, but I think the legacy he left will last with Australia for many years to come, if not for generations to come. So for that I think we should all be very grateful. To his widow, Heather, his children, his grandchildren and his larger extended family, I offer my condolences and also my thanks that we had the services of Neville Bonner in creating a better Australia.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Bonner, Mr Neville Thomas, AO</title>",Condolences,3,1
The PRESIDENT,N/A,1999-02-15,"—As has been mentioned, I had the opportunity to join many of you in attending the service of thanksgiving for the life of Thomas Neville Bonner in Ipswich last Friday. Many things have been said about his life. I shared just 22 months of being a senator while he was still here and he befriended me during that time—something that I valued greatly.
In the service there was a letter written by Dr Belinda Penglis Stebbing. His granddaughter, Roxanne Venner, I thought with great courage, was able to sing I will sing the wondrous story, not an easy thing to do on such an occasion, I would suggest. There was the eulogy by his grandson, Mitchell, which Senator Hill referred to, and the Jagera Funeral Chant, which was played to us and introduced by his grandson, Thomas Bonner.
But it was the poem by Margaret Armstrong (Daylight) that I particularly related to on the day and I think a number of others at the service would have also. She had written it quite recently. With the concurrence of the Senate, I incorporate in the Hansard record the poem `Uncle Neville', which she had written and which she read to us and in which she refers to a number of things but, in particular, in referring to her uncle says, `My special friend'.
Leave granted.
The poem read as follows—
Uncle Neville
You came into my life when I was just a child
A face so gentle and caring with your golden smile 

I can remember when we would go on the OPAL camps
You were always there to comfort and support us; you are our little champ
Many years have passed and you have watched me grow
Someone in my heart to be proud of, for it was you who did show
How to have respect for all and believe in who I am
A proud Aboriginal woman because into my life you came
You went on to do brilliant things and look what you have achieved
Our very first Parliament member even though you grieved
You have always tried your best to bring a better life to all people
Because in your heart you were chosen by someone special
Many awards you have received but you didn't ask for much
Because my Uncle Neville I believe you, have that magic touch
Now as silver hair lines your graceful face
Lined with dignity and so much grace
Your pain should be mine to bear
Because you have always helped me in my despair
May the spirit of our Mother Earth give you strength on your special journey
For a star will shine in heaven to guide me in my learning
My special friend I know in my heart you can bear the pain
Then one day we shall walk hand in hand together once again
For in our Jagera Land you will always have your place
I know, in my heart I shall cherish precious memories of your dear loving face
Written by Margaret Armstrong (Daylight)
30th January 1999
Newtown, Ipswich

I thought the service of thanksgiving was a splendid occasion to recount for all of us the life of Thomas Neville Bonner, from his humble beginnings and for all of the things that he achieved, speaking of him as many knew him—though I did not—sitting in a particular corner of the lounge room of his house where people would come to see him, to talk to him, as it was put, to sit at his feet and listen to what he had to say. Although I had not been there, I felt I could envisage that scene. I could imagine and wish that perhaps 
 I had had the opportunity to be there. I offer my condolences to Heather, to his children and grandchildren. I invite honourable senators to stand in silence to signify their assent to this motion.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-02-15,"—by leave—I move:
Omit `18 February', substitute `8 March'.
It is worth while to give a little background to this amendment moved by me on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. The bills under consideration in the motion and subsequent amendment are the Telstra privatisation bills. When the matter was referred by the Selection of Bills Committee late last year, two full days of hearings were originally set down. Those two full days of hearings, one in Canberra and one in Sydney, were truncated at the wishes of the government, despite me, on behalf of the Labor Party, raising a series of concerns principally going to the scheduling of witnesses and the ability to hear from all of the witnesses in one day as opposed to two. Nonetheless, the hearing days were truncated from two days to one day.
The one day scheduled was for 3 February here in Canberra and the agenda for the day that was circulated some days beforehand indicated that the hearing would conclude at 4.45 p.m. On that basis, I and other senators made arrangements to return to our home states on the 5.30 p.m. planes. Early in the afternoon, some time after lunch, it became quite clear that, because of extensive questioning by the senators present and comments made by the various parties, the business on the agenda would not be concluded on that day.
I had a couple of preliminary and then final discussions with the chair of the committee, Senator Eggleston, and indicated to him that this was a problem as the Labor Party wished to engage in extensive questioning of both the department and Telstra and that there appeared to be insufficient time for that course 
 to occur. Accordingly, I suggested to Senator Eggleston that the matter be adjourned at 4.45 p.m. at the scheduled close of business and the matter be reconvened today in Canberra, Monday, 15 February. Senator Eggleston agreed to that course of action, and I vacated at around 4.45 p.m. or 4.50 p.m. to catch my plane back to Perth. Adjourning the hearing on Wednesday, 3 February, Senator Eggleston said in conclusion, at page 77 of the Hansard:
It is proposed to have another hearing on the morning of 15 February.
Later on he said:
In any case, I have advised that there will be another hearing on the 15th. I thank everybody for attending today and close this hearing.
Those comments by Senator Eggleston reflected the discussions that he had with me, being the permanent representative of the Labor Party on the relevant committee. I indeed returned home to Perth that evening on the understanding that the matter would be set down for 8.30 this morning or some time today.
Last night I went to the airport to board the plane to come to Canberra at 5.00 p.m., as scheduled, on the VIP flight out of Perth which is put on for members of parliament and staff in that state. We boarded the plane and on the plane prior to take-off we were advised by the pilot or his representative that the rudder had broken down and the plane would not be able to take off. We immediately vacated the plane. Some members got on the midnight horror out of Perth last night and others got on the early plane at 6.00 this morning. 
As a consequence, it was not physically possible for me to be in Canberra this morning at 8.30 to participate in the discussions on the Telstra bill and hear from the department and Telstra. I left a message to that effect with the secretary of the committee via the security system of the parliament at around 10.00 p.m. eastern standard time last night: firstly, I would not be able to be at the committee meeting in Canberra this morning and, secondly, I asked that it be brought to her attention that, if a permanent representative of the ALP was not present, the meeting would 
 not necessarily be quorate and should not proceed.
On arriving in Canberra today at around 2.30 p.m. I was advised that the meeting had gone ahead this morning, that there were two or three government senators present—one of them was late and could not make it. There was one representative, Senator Allison, from the Australian Democrats and neither I nor Senator Bolkus was able to attend. I think Senator Carr attended and made a few comments. The pertinent point to make is that the meeting was non-quorate. It started late and finished early, and the ALP did not have any opportunity through their Senate spokesperson to ask important questions of both Telstra and the relevant department.
I understand that the committee is going to reconvene tomorrow evening some time after 8.00 p.m, although I have not been formally advised of that fact. Nonetheless, if the meeting does proceed tomorrow evening, it leaves us with only one day or a maximum of two days to draft our report, give it to the secretariat and have it tabled in this place by the close of business on Thursday at around about 5.00 p.m.
In this discussion there are major issues at stake—something in the order of $14 billion or $15 billion of taxpayers' money. The issues are clear: privatisation, USOs, competitive tendering, the cost of capital, consumer protections and the desirable regulatory regime to look after Telstra in the future. These are complex issues. They raise major policy matters and, as we all know in this place, the Senate is very evenly divided on the progress of this bill.
The ALP report, when it is tabled, will obviously guide the deliberations of many senators in this place and it is important that we have sufficient or adequate time to prepare our report, for me and Senator Bolkus to discuss it and get the report writing done. Two days is simply inadequate and insufficient to draft a lengthy minority report, putting forward the position of our party for the future of the debate on that issue in this place. 
The delay—if it is properly characterised as delay—has been occasioned, one, by govern 
 ment actions, two, by government agreements to adjournment and, three, by acts of God. If the hearing is going to go ahead tomorrow evening, I will be available. We seek to have the opportunity to ask important questions of Telstra. We seek to ask important questions of the department. We seek something more than 24 hours to review the Hansard and to prepare our draft report. Accordingly, the amendment that I have put forward is to delay the report by the committee from this Thursday until the first sitting date when we return, which is Monday, 8 March.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Committees,5,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-02-15,"—If ever there was a debate where there was a huge element of hypocrisy involved, it is this one. The fact is that the Senate reference was first provided to the committee in early December with a report date of 15 February. In other words, more than two months were available. Hearings were originally scheduled, as Senator Bishop said, for 2 and 3 February. On 3 February, when it was quite clear that Telstra was there ready, willing and able to give evidence, for one reason or another the committee managed to ensure that they did not reach Telstra until late in the afternoon. Senator Bishop at no stage has indicated any reason why he was not prepared to sit beyond that time.
—He had an appointment at quarter to 12 at night, did he?
—He has not said he did.
—Like you. You did.
—If he had to go and ring his wife, as I did, that might be a good reason and he would advance it. But he has not, and that is the point. All he did was get up and walk out, leaving Telstra there ready, willing but unable to give evidence. What is critically important is this: although it was agreed that the committee would then resume on the 15th, which is today, that was followed up by a request by the chairman to Senator Bishop. Bear in mind that Senator Bolkus has never been near the place, so Senator Bishop has effectively been the only ALP senator involved, even though Senator Carr, no doubt on instructions from the union, has been 
 required to attend. Senator Bishop has been the linchpin on this.
Senator Bishop was asked whether he would be able to participate on 8 February by the committee chairman and indicated that he could participate initially but then informed the chairman that he would not be able to participate but gave no reason. Late on 5 February, as a result of further attempts to persuade him to be available, he indicated that he would in fact be in Perth on 9 February. It was proposed that he could participate by conference call. Senator Bishop indicated that he would be available to go ahead for a conference call but he would not be able to agree unless he got approval from the shadow minister for communications. It has been perfectly clear that there has been a pattern of obstruction and a deliberate attempt being made on a regular basis to stall proceedings.
As I understand it, Senators Bishop and Allison have worked in tandem. Senator Allison has made it clear that unless Senator Bishop is there she will not be there even though she has a capacity to make a quorum if the Liberal members are in attendance. If she chooses not to, then once again it is back to Senator Bishop. Hearings were called on two days last week. The meetings did not proceed due to a lack of a quorum because both Senator Bishop and Senator Allison declined to attend, as I understand it, without providing reasons but simply said that they could not attend.
A further hearing was scheduled, as we know, for 8.30 this morning. The facts again as I am informed are that the VIP was certainly cancelled but everyone else of relevance was able to get the commercial flight later that night. Why is it that Senator Bishop did not manage to get that commercial flight? Again, he has not given a reason why; he just said that, because the VIP flight was cancelled, he came over the next morning. But everyone else who was on the VIP flight, as I understand it, did come over, including Mr Smith. What is highly relevant is that Mr Smith was heard saying to Senator Bishop prior to the departure of the VIP that he would be able to use the fact of the cancella 
 tion of the VIP flight as a reason for not attending the hearing this morning.
—What is your source? Who said that?
—A direct source. I have had that evidence.
—Yes, but who?
—I am not naming them for your benefit. Let Senator Bishop deny it.
—Typical! You never name the source. You just make it up.
—No, I am not making it up at all. It would be utterly improper.
—You always repeat private conversations in this chamber. You are notorious for it.
—For what?
—For repeating private conversations.
—It is very interesting that you should say that, Senator Ray, because I listened very carefully to see how far Senator Bishop would go. Senator Bishop made a very special point of telling us about conversations he had had with Senator Eggleston and proposals and agreements that Senator Eggleston had made and rung him with. In other words, Senator Bishop is perfectly happy to put on the record the discussions that have occurred about availability. I would not under any circumstances, and I do not believe that anyone in this chamber would, come along and fabricate a conversation that did not exist for the purposes of advancing the argument. That is what is called a classic verbal. I can assure you that that is not the case here.
The fact is that Senator Bishop himself has provided no reason why he could not have caught the commercial flight. It is very convenient, isn't it, that the one person who is going to be required to make a quorum was the person who could not get the flight over last night? Why? We have not heard. He did not give us a reason. All he said was something about an act of God. He said, `Because the VIP flight was cancelled, therefore I didn't come over until today.' He did not say, `Therefore, I could've got the commercial 
 flight but didn't.' That is what has happened, you see.
Again, as I understand it, and Senator Bishop can contradict this if he likes, it was an agreement made last week that if the government allowed the committee hearing to proceed today Senator Bishop would guarantee that the reporting date would be Thursday—that is, the 18th. Reluctantly, that may be a date that we have no choice but to accede to because of the fact that, by one means or another, this committee has only managed to have one day of hearing between early December and 15 February. If that is the fact and the meeting had to take place today, then I can understand why you would argue for a report date of Thursday.
But if that is right, if you agreed last week, if you guaranteed that if there was a hearing today you would allow the committee to report on Thursday, what possible justification have you now got for seeking to move it to 8 March? It is because Mr Smith, who is calling the shots, is basically saying: `Do whatever you can to string this out as long as possible and make it as difficult as you can.' The fact is that with all this nonsense about, `We want to hear arguments, we've got important questions to ask', there is virtually nothing new third time around.
If you look around the world you will find that the arguments in favour of privatisation and the arguments about consumer protection and USOs have all been canvassed endlessly. You have had more than two months to read them all up. You have no doubt written your draft report already in any event, because we know you are implacably opposed to everything that is contained in the bill. So what possible justification can there be for stringing it out? It is simply because you hope to get political advantage from making it all too difficult: `With a bit of luck this will run into the debate on the tax package' and `Suddenly they won't able to take a full hearing on Telstra if we can string it out for long enough.' It is so obvious I would have thought Senator Bishop would have great difficulty in keeping a straight face arguing for yet another adjournment. 
Those are the facts of the matter. There is no justification for extending the reporting date beyond this Thursday. You have agreed, as I understand it, to be there tomorrow night, presumably for the reason that you have no choice because the Senate is sitting. You were here last week, or could have been, because we had estimates on. For one reason or another we have got to the stage where you had a short hearing this morning, you will be able to complete the hearing tomorrow night and you have then got until Thursday to produce the report. If you somehow want to extend it beyond that date for another two weeks or more, then the inevitable inference will be drawn by everyone else—
—The next sitting day.
—Not the next sitting day at all, but more than a fortnight, another 18 days—all for the sake of stringing it out. If it is only one sitting day, what's wrong with the Thursday? The Thursday was all right last week. Nothing has happened to change that, other than Senator Bishop choosing to absent himself from this morning's hearing. We rectify that by having a hearing tomorrow night but no, here we have, late in the afternoon—no doubt again on instructions—Senator Bishop informally advising us that he isn't going to go along with a decision that had been made even today to proceed with that report.
Senator Bishop interjecting—
—You knew. You didn't attend the committee meeting, as I understand it, today at lunchtime.
—I didn't get here till 2.30.
—Again. Senator Bolkus wasn't there, I presume.
—He was on the plane with me.
—Yes, I see—all very convenient. You don't have to be into conspiracy theories on this one. The facts speak for themselves. If ever there were a case of circumstantial evidence creating overwhelming inferences, this is it. You knew that the report date would be this Thursday. You choose to announce to us informally late in 
 the afternoon that you are going for the eighth. I don't suggest that you came up with that. Once again, it was acting on instructions.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-02-15,"—I speak in support of Senator Bishop's amendment. Senator Alston makes aspersions about my interest in this matter. It should be quite clear that I have participated in all three inquiries on this question. I have pursued matters, I think, as thoroughly as one is expected to do in this place—
Senator Alston interjecting—
—And with a keen interest in the issues, Senator Alston. This is a substantial question concerning the issues that have been raised in this matter, not the histrionics that you want to pursue here today.
Senator Bishop has thoroughly pursued some of those matters. He was prevented from appearing before the committee this morning and asking questions as a result of an aircraft breakdown in Perth. The ridiculous notion that you are trying to put to the Senate that somehow or another he was involved in making sure that the plane didn't get here, that he was capable of engineering a breakdown—
—I take a point of order. We don't mind robust debate, but it is an infantile insult to anyone's intelligence to suggest that I was accusing Senator Bishop of having arranged for the VIP flight to be delayed. In no way, shape or form did I say it. Senator Carr is simply insulting our intelligence if he persists with it.
—There is no point of order.
—What we have seen here is the government's attempt to push through this bill without proper discussion. The implications of this bill are quite profound. We have already heard of the amounts of money involved. That in itself makes it a significant bill. There are substantial policy questions. Many issues remain unresolved. Today, for instance, Telstra revealed their deep concern about aspects of the govern 
 ment's legislation. Only one question was allowed to be asked on that point owing to the limited time available. That is clearly a matter that needs to be pursued. There are a range of issues that I placed on notice and that I would like to see answers to. They require the attention of the Senate in some detail. The government's legislative program spells this matter out. The government doesn't intend to pursue this matter as of next Thursday. The opposition is proposing that there be an extension of time to allow for proper consideration of and debate on these matters.
Senator Alston talks about a range of meetings that were called last week. During the estimates sessions a number of meetings were called last week without consultation with the opposition before those meetings were set down. I had a series of notes put across my desk about meetings being called and then subsequently cancelled as a result of the government's actions in that regard.
The opposition is proposing that there be an extension of time to allow us to examine these matters and properly consider them. I have seen Senator Harradine at a number of these committee meetings. I would be very surprised if he were of the view that there has been filibustering or an attempt not to pursue these questions with the thoroughness with which they deserve to be pursued and which is appropriate. It ought to be understood, even by Senator Alston, that these are matters that cannot be quickly flicked under the carpet to allow his sweetheart deals to be organised in such a way as to prevent proper debate in this chamber
When the bill is introduced, there will be proper discussion about it, but there ought be a proper report from the Senate committee on these matters. There ought be a proper evaluation of the evidence that has actually been put before us. That is the critical issue that we have before us.
Senator Alston is only too happy to reveal what he considers to be his interpretation of various private conversations that appear now to have occurred around this country. He talks with great expertise about the issue of verballing. I do not have your legal training in such issues, but the practice is quite apparent. You 
 are quite capable of presenting to this chamber your version of events, which is every bit as consistent as the pattern of police verbal from the lowest forms of police operators that I have heard about. Frankly, that is what you are talking about here. Your attempt to verbal Senator Bishop is beneath contempt. Your attempt to abuse the process of this parliament is beneath contempt.
The senator has pursued this question diligently and thoroughly and he has tried to exercise his duty conscientiously. You have sought to abuse that. You have sought to abuse his goodwill, and he has learnt the hard way about what it is like to deal with people like you, Senator Alston. I am sure the level of cooperation in the future will, of course, be informed by this experience.
What is being proposed here is a very short extension of time on the preparation of the committee report. It is entirely appropriate, given the gravity of the issues that are under debate. What we have seen by this government, on the other hand, is an attempt to truncate public discussion on this issue, to prevent proper debate on these matters, to reduce the number of days available for consideration of the submissions that have been put in from two days to one day. Bear in mind, the submissions were called over the Christmas period when there was very limited opportunity for people to submit. Nonetheless, I found the submissions that were presented very interesting. Senator Alston, you might find them tedious, boring and repetitive.
Quite frankly, given the urgency of these matters, it is appropriate that there be a proper discussion about the government's regulatory framework, a proper discussion about the impact of privatisation. Wherever I go in this country, there are grave concerns expressed about the impact of privatisation. Right throughout Victoria, people have lost their jobs as a direct result of your policies on privatisation. The policies of your government have led to a substantial reduction in the services provided by Telstra. Serious implications arise as a result of your selling off Telstra dirt cheap and the extraordinary plunder of one of the great public assets of this country.
These are matters that require substantial debate within the committee, and that has not occurred. Senator Bishop, I trust that an opportunity will be provided for you to prepare a decent report to this Senate. There should be an opportunity for this Senate to have a thorough discussion of the implications of this government policy, which is quite clearly wrong in principle, wrong in policy and fundamentally wrong in terms of the future directions this country is taking.
I will make one final point. I will never forget the way in which you sold off the first portion of Telstra—the sleazy arrangements you entered into to secure the passage of that bill through this chamber. No-one should ever forget one of the most disgraceful episodes that has ever occurred in the history of this parliament. The manner by which you secured that majority will be remembered, and ought be remembered, by everyone in this country.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Committees,5,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-02-15,"—I will be brief. I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Senator Lyn Allison, who was referred to by the minister in, I suggest, disparaging terms. We believe she was adversely reflected upon in his comments—suggesting in fact that she was somehow in cahoots or in league or in some kind of conspiracy with the opposition. We regard the minister's comments as a particularly cheap shot.
For the record, we indicate that last week Senator Allison was tied up in estimates committee hearings. Senator Allison, like all other Democrats, treat estimates committee hearings with some seriousness. I am not quite sure what the suggestion is—that somehow by being unavailable for another committee meeting, she was somehow in cahoots with the opposition on this particular issue. I am sure that Senator Allison will take the opportunity to respond to the minister's allegations, if you like, at a later stage. But let me say at this point that that adverse reflection was unfair, inappropriate and indeed a cheap shot.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee</title>",Committees,5,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-02-15,"—The strangest question here today is: why is the very busy Deputy Leader of the 
 Government in the Senate (Senator Alston) coming in and wasting his time on committee business? What prompts him to come down to the chamber? Bit bored up in the office, were you? Hadn't sewn your oats this week? Hadn't won an argument? Probably given in to the Prime Minister on a few more appointments. Needed to do something just to let it get out and off the liver. The fundamental question that you, Senator Alston, did not answer is why the initial hearings were cut from two days to one. This was not at the behest of the opposition, but was done by the government. The government controls the legislation committee. They cut the hearing dates down from two days to one day, which put all that pressure on. But imagine the amusement it causes on this side when Senator Alston criticises Senator Bishop for not being available for committee work. Where were you on Thursday night?
—Busy.
—Yes, busy. You could not attend the DOCA estimates even though you knew about them months in advance. But as soon as old David Barnett's name comes up, who broke the Senate 100 metres dash record? Senator Alston—straight down into the committee to defend the grubby political appointment.
But you did not even have the staying power, Senator Alston. It gets to 20 to 12 and you have to pack up because you have an appointment somewhere—you have to take an early mark. It does not end with you. We were all sitting around at foreign affairs at a quarter past four and, even though there had been weeks of notice, Senator Hill shoots through. So that committee had to be reconvened. These are committees you control and organise and we try to cooperate in terms of the government.
When was the last time Senator Alston got on the midnight special from Perth? Tell us that, Senator. When did you last get on the plane at midnight, go to Sydney and then come on? Never—yet you have the gall to criticise Senator Bishop for not doing that.
Senator Alston reflects on Senator Bishop's ability to write a minority report. Do you 
 know how you do it if you are a minister? You get hold of a copy in breach of privilege, you send it over to the department, they write the minority report and you give it to the dumb government senators to put in as your report. That is what you do. That is what Senator Alston did—absolutely.
This fight should have been left between Senator Eggleston, who can look after himself, and Senator Bishop. It did not need you to come down and verbal and put private conversations on the record like you always do. My advice to you, Senator Alston, is: just butt out and let them fight it out and we will get a result.
—I take it that Senator Bishop is not proposing to respond to anything that has been said.
—It appears not.
—I just wanted to clarify that.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It is not competent for the minister to stand up and address the chair like that. He knows it and he consistently abuses the processes of this place. Call him to order and discipline him.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,1999-02-15,"—by leave—I move:
Omit `18 February', substitute `8 March'.
It is worth while to give a little background to this amendment moved by me on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. The bills under consideration in the motion and subsequent amendment are the Telstra privatisation bills. When the matter was referred by the Selection of Bills Committee late last year, two full days of hearings were originally set down. Those two full days of hearings, one in Canberra and one in Sydney, were truncated at the wishes of the government, despite me, on behalf of the Labor Party, raising a series of concerns principally going to the scheduling of witnesses and the ability to hear from all of the witnesses in one day as opposed to two. Nonetheless, the hearing days were truncated from two days to one day.
The one day scheduled was for 3 February here in Canberra and the agenda for the day that was circulated some days beforehand indicated that the hearing would conclude at 4.45 p.m. On that basis, I and other senators made arrangements to return to our home states on the 5.30 p.m. planes. Early in the afternoon, some time after lunch, it became quite clear that, because of extensive questioning by the senators present and comments made by the various parties, the business on the agenda would not be concluded on that day.
I had a couple of preliminary and then final discussions with the chair of the committee, Senator Eggleston, and indicated to him that this was a problem as the Labor Party wished to engage in extensive questioning of both the department and Telstra and that there appeared to be insufficient time for that course 
 to occur. Accordingly, I suggested to Senator Eggleston that the matter be adjourned at 4.45 p.m. at the scheduled close of business and the matter be reconvened today in Canberra, Monday, 15 February. Senator Eggleston agreed to that course of action, and I vacated at around 4.45 p.m. or 4.50 p.m. to catch my plane back to Perth. Adjourning the hearing on Wednesday, 3 February, Senator Eggleston said in conclusion, at page 77 of the Hansard:
It is proposed to have another hearing on the morning of 15 February.
Later on he said:
In any case, I have advised that there will be another hearing on the 15th. I thank everybody for attending today and close this hearing.
Those comments by Senator Eggleston reflected the discussions that he had with me, being the permanent representative of the Labor Party on the relevant committee. I indeed returned home to Perth that evening on the understanding that the matter would be set down for 8.30 this morning or some time today.
Last night I went to the airport to board the plane to come to Canberra at 5.00 p.m., as scheduled, on the VIP flight out of Perth which is put on for members of parliament and staff in that state. We boarded the plane and on the plane prior to take-off we were advised by the pilot or his representative that the rudder had broken down and the plane would not be able to take off. We immediately vacated the plane. Some members got on the midnight horror out of Perth last night and others got on the early plane at 6.00 this morning. 
As a consequence, it was not physically possible for me to be in Canberra this morning at 8.30 to participate in the discussions on the Telstra bill and hear from the department and Telstra. I left a message to that effect with the secretary of the committee via the security system of the parliament at around 10.00 p.m. eastern standard time last night: firstly, I would not be able to be at the committee meeting in Canberra this morning and, secondly, I asked that it be brought to her attention that, if a permanent representative of the ALP was not present, the meeting would 
 not necessarily be quorate and should not proceed.
On arriving in Canberra today at around 2.30 p.m. I was advised that the meeting had gone ahead this morning, that there were two or three government senators present—one of them was late and could not make it. There was one representative, Senator Allison, from the Australian Democrats and neither I nor Senator Bolkus was able to attend. I think Senator Carr attended and made a few comments. The pertinent point to make is that the meeting was non-quorate. It started late and finished early, and the ALP did not have any opportunity through their Senate spokesperson to ask important questions of both Telstra and the relevant department.
I understand that the committee is going to reconvene tomorrow evening some time after 8.00 p.m, although I have not been formally advised of that fact. Nonetheless, if the meeting does proceed tomorrow evening, it leaves us with only one day or a maximum of two days to draft our report, give it to the secretariat and have it tabled in this place by the close of business on Thursday at around about 5.00 p.m.
In this discussion there are major issues at stake—something in the order of $14 billion or $15 billion of taxpayers' money. The issues are clear: privatisation, USOs, competitive tendering, the cost of capital, consumer protections and the desirable regulatory regime to look after Telstra in the future. These are complex issues. They raise major policy matters and, as we all know in this place, the Senate is very evenly divided on the progress of this bill.
The ALP report, when it is tabled, will obviously guide the deliberations of many senators in this place and it is important that we have sufficient or adequate time to prepare our report, for me and Senator Bolkus to discuss it and get the report writing done. Two days is simply inadequate and insufficient to draft a lengthy minority report, putting forward the position of our party for the future of the debate on that issue in this place. 
The delay—if it is properly characterised as delay—has been occasioned, one, by govern 
 ment actions, two, by government agreements to adjournment and, three, by acts of God. If the hearing is going to go ahead tomorrow evening, I will be available. We seek to have the opportunity to ask important questions of Telstra. We seek to ask important questions of the department. We seek something more than 24 hours to review the Hansard and to prepare our draft report. Accordingly, the amendment that I have put forward is to delay the report by the committee from this Thursday until the first sitting date when we return, which is Monday, 8 March.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Extension of Time</title>,Committees,5,2
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,1999-02-15,"—If ever there was a debate where there was a huge element of hypocrisy involved, it is this one. The fact is that the Senate reference was first provided to the committee in early December with a report date of 15 February. In other words, more than two months were available. Hearings were originally scheduled, as Senator Bishop said, for 2 and 3 February. On 3 February, when it was quite clear that Telstra was there ready, willing and able to give evidence, for one reason or another the committee managed to ensure that they did not reach Telstra until late in the afternoon. Senator Bishop at no stage has indicated any reason why he was not prepared to sit beyond that time.
—He had an appointment at quarter to 12 at night, did he?
—He has not said he did.
—Like you. You did.
—If he had to go and ring his wife, as I did, that might be a good reason and he would advance it. But he has not, and that is the point. All he did was get up and walk out, leaving Telstra there ready, willing but unable to give evidence. What is critically important is this: although it was agreed that the committee would then resume on the 15th, which is today, that was followed up by a request by the chairman to Senator Bishop. Bear in mind that Senator Bolkus has never been near the place, so Senator Bishop has effectively been the only ALP senator involved, even though Senator Carr, no doubt on instructions from the union, has been 
 required to attend. Senator Bishop has been the linchpin on this.
Senator Bishop was asked whether he would be able to participate on 8 February by the committee chairman and indicated that he could participate initially but then informed the chairman that he would not be able to participate but gave no reason. Late on 5 February, as a result of further attempts to persuade him to be available, he indicated that he would in fact be in Perth on 9 February. It was proposed that he could participate by conference call. Senator Bishop indicated that he would be available to go ahead for a conference call but he would not be able to agree unless he got approval from the shadow minister for communications. It has been perfectly clear that there has been a pattern of obstruction and a deliberate attempt being made on a regular basis to stall proceedings.
As I understand it, Senators Bishop and Allison have worked in tandem. Senator Allison has made it clear that unless Senator Bishop is there she will not be there even though she has a capacity to make a quorum if the Liberal members are in attendance. If she chooses not to, then once again it is back to Senator Bishop. Hearings were called on two days last week. The meetings did not proceed due to a lack of a quorum because both Senator Bishop and Senator Allison declined to attend, as I understand it, without providing reasons but simply said that they could not attend.
A further hearing was scheduled, as we know, for 8.30 this morning. The facts again as I am informed are that the VIP was certainly cancelled but everyone else of relevance was able to get the commercial flight later that night. Why is it that Senator Bishop did not manage to get that commercial flight? Again, he has not given a reason why; he just said that, because the VIP flight was cancelled, he came over the next morning. But everyone else who was on the VIP flight, as I understand it, did come over, including Mr Smith. What is highly relevant is that Mr Smith was heard saying to Senator Bishop prior to the departure of the VIP that he would be able to use the fact of the cancella 
 tion of the VIP flight as a reason for not attending the hearing this morning.
—What is your source? Who said that?
—A direct source. I have had that evidence.
—Yes, but who?
—I am not naming them for your benefit. Let Senator Bishop deny it.
—Typical! You never name the source. You just make it up.
—No, I am not making it up at all. It would be utterly improper.
—You always repeat private conversations in this chamber. You are notorious for it.
—For what?
—For repeating private conversations.
—It is very interesting that you should say that, Senator Ray, because I listened very carefully to see how far Senator Bishop would go. Senator Bishop made a very special point of telling us about conversations he had had with Senator Eggleston and proposals and agreements that Senator Eggleston had made and rung him with. In other words, Senator Bishop is perfectly happy to put on the record the discussions that have occurred about availability. I would not under any circumstances, and I do not believe that anyone in this chamber would, come along and fabricate a conversation that did not exist for the purposes of advancing the argument. That is what is called a classic verbal. I can assure you that that is not the case here.
The fact is that Senator Bishop himself has provided no reason why he could not have caught the commercial flight. It is very convenient, isn't it, that the one person who is going to be required to make a quorum was the person who could not get the flight over last night? Why? We have not heard. He did not give us a reason. All he said was something about an act of God. He said, `Because the VIP flight was cancelled, therefore I didn't come over until today.'

But if that is right, if you agreed last week, if you guaranteed that if there was a hearing today you would allow the committee to report on Thursday, what possible justification have you now got for seeking to move it to 8 March? It is because Mr Smith, who is calling the shots, is basically saying: `Do whatever you can to string this out as long as possible and make it as difficult as you can.' The fact is that with all this nonsense about, `We want to hear arguments, we've got important questions to ask', there is virtually nothing new third time around.

You have had more than two months to read them all up.

So what possible justification can there be for stringing it out?

 ment's legislation. Only one question was allowed to be asked on that point owing to the limited time available. That is clearly a matter that needs to be pursued. There are a range of issues that I placed on notice and that I would like to see answers to. They require the attention of the Senate in some detail. The government's legislative program spells this matter out. The government doesn't intend to pursue this matter as of next Thursday. The opposition is proposing that there be an extension of time to allow for proper consideration of and debate on these matters.
Senator Alston talks about a range of meetings that were called last week. During the estimates sessions a number of meetings were called last week without consultation with the opposition before those meetings were set down. I had a series of notes put across my desk about meetings being called and then subsequently cancelled as a result of the government's actions in that regard.
The opposition is proposing that there be an extension of time to allow us to examine these matters and properly consider them. I have seen Senator Harradine at a number of these committee meetings. I would be very surprised if he were of the view that there has been filibustering or an attempt not to pursue these questions with the thoroughness with which they deserve to be pursued and which is appropriate. It ought to be understood, even by Senator Alston, that these are matters that cannot be quickly flicked under the carpet to allow his sweetheart deals to be organised in such a way as to prevent proper debate in this chamber
When the bill is introduced, there will be proper discussion about it, but there ought be a proper report from the Senate committee on these matters. There ought be a proper evaluation of the evidence that has actually been put before us. That is the critical issue that we have before us.
Senator Alston is only too happy to reveal what he considers to be his interpretation of various private conversations that appear now to have occurred around this country. He talks with great expertise about the issue of verballing. I do not have your legal training in such issues, but the practice is quite apparent. You 
 are quite capable of presenting to this chamber your version of events, which is every bit as consistent as the pattern of police verbal from the lowest forms of police operators that I have heard about. Frankly, that is what you are talking about here. Your attempt to verbal Senator Bishop is beneath contempt. Your attempt to abuse the process of this parliament is beneath contempt.
The senator has pursued this question diligently and thoroughly and he has tried to exercise his duty conscientiously. You have sought to abuse that. You have sought to abuse his goodwill, and he has learnt the hard way about what it is like to deal with people like you, Senator Alston. I am sure the level of cooperation in the future will, of course, be informed by this experience.
What is being proposed here is a very short extension of time on the preparation of the committee report. It is entirely appropriate, given the gravity of the issues that are under debate. What we have seen by this government, on the other hand, is an attempt to truncate public discussion on this issue, to prevent proper debate on these matters, to reduce the number of days available for consideration of the submissions that have been put in from two days to one day. Bear in mind, the submissions were called over the Christmas period when there was very limited opportunity for people to submit. Nonetheless, I found the submissions that were presented very interesting. Senator Alston, you might find them tedious, boring and repetitive.
Quite frankly, given the urgency of these matters, it is appropriate that there be a proper discussion about the government's regulatory framework, a proper discussion about the impact of privatisation. Wherever I go in this country, there are grave concerns expressed about the impact of privatisation. Right throughout Victoria, people have lost their jobs as a direct result of your policies on privatisation. The policies of your government have led to a substantial reduction in the services provided by Telstra. Serious implications arise as a result of your selling off Telstra dirt cheap and the extraordinary plunder of one of the great public assets of this country.
These are matters that require substantial debate within the committee, and that has not occurred. Senator Bishop, I trust that an opportunity will be provided for you to prepare a decent report to this Senate. There should be an opportunity for this Senate to have a thorough discussion of the implications of this government policy, which is quite clearly wrong in principle, wrong in policy and fundamentally wrong in terms of the future directions this country is taking.
I will make one final point. I will never forget the way in which you sold off the first portion of Telstra—the sleazy arrangements you entered into to secure the passage of that bill through this chamber. No-one should ever forget one of the most disgraceful episodes that has ever occurred in the history of this parliament. The manner by which you secured that majority will be remembered, and ought be remembered, by everyone in this country.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Extension of Time</title>,Committees,5,2
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-02-15,"—I will be brief. I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Senator Lyn Allison, who was referred to by the minister in, I suggest, disparaging terms. We believe she was adversely reflected upon in his comments—suggesting in fact that she was somehow in cahoots or in league or in some kind of conspiracy with the opposition. We regard the minister's comments as a particularly cheap shot.
For the record, we indicate that last week Senator Allison was tied up in estimates committee hearings. Senator Allison, like all other Democrats, treat estimates committee hearings with some seriousness. I am not quite sure what the suggestion is—that somehow by being unavailable for another committee meeting, she was somehow in cahoots with the opposition on this particular issue. I am sure that Senator Allison will take the opportunity to respond to the minister's allegations, if you like, at a later stage. But let me say at this point that that adverse reflection was unfair, inappropriate and indeed a cheap shot.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Extension of Time</title>,Committees,5,2
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-02-15,"—The strangest question here today is: why is the very busy Deputy Leader of the 
 Government in the Senate (Senator Alston) coming in and wasting his time on committee business? What prompts him to come down to the chamber? Bit bored up in the office, were you? Hadn't sewn your oats this week? Hadn't won an argument? Probably given in to the Prime Minister on a few more appointments. Needed to do something just to let it get out and off the liver. The fundamental question that you, Senator Alston, did not answer is why the initial hearings were cut from two days to one. This was not at the behest of the opposition, but was done by the government. The government controls the legislation committee. They cut the hearing dates down from two days to one day, which put all that pressure on. But imagine the amusement it causes on this side when Senator Alston criticises Senator Bishop for not being available for committee work. Where were you on Thursday night?
—Busy.
—Yes, busy. You could not attend the DOCA estimates even though you knew about them months in advance. But as soon as old David Barnett's name comes up, who broke the Senate 100 metres dash record? Senator Alston—straight down into the committee to defend the grubby political appointment.
But you did not even have the staying power, Senator Alston. It gets to 20 to 12 and you have to pack up because you have an appointment somewhere—you have to take an early mark. It does not end with you. We were all sitting around at foreign affairs at a quarter past four and, even though there had been weeks of notice, Senator Hill shoots through. So that committee had to be reconvened. These are committees you control and organise and we try to cooperate in terms of the government.
When was the last time Senator Alston got on the midnight special from Perth? Tell us that, Senator. When did you last get on the plane at midnight, go to Sydney and then come on? Never—yet you have the gall to criticise Senator Bishop for not doing that.
Senator Alston reflects on Senator Bishop's ability to write a minority report. Do you 
 know how you do it if you are a minister? You get hold of a copy in breach of privilege, you send it over to the department, they write the minority report and you give it to the dumb government senators to put in as your report. That is what you do. That is what Senator Alston did—absolutely.
This fight should have been left between Senator Eggleston, who can look after himself, and Senator Bishop. It did not need you to come down and verbal and put private conversations on the record like you always do. My advice to you, Senator Alston, is: just butt out and let them fight it out and we will get a result.
—I take it that Senator Bishop is not proposing to respond to anything that has been said.
—It appears not.
—I just wanted to clarify that.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It is not competent for the minister to stand up and address the chair like that. He knows it and he consistently abuses the processes of this place. Call him to order and discipline him.

"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,1999-02-15,"—by leave—On behalf of Senator O'Chee, I give notice that, 15 sitting days after today, he will move:
That the Financial Management and Accountability Orders (Amendment) 1998, made under paragraph 63(1)(b) of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, be disallowed.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Financial Management and Accountability Orders (Amendment) 1998 made under paragraph 63(1)(b) of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997
The Orders established Comcover as a managed insurance fund, administered as a unit within the Department of Finance and Administration. Comcover will insure, or arrange insurance, for all 
 insurable losses for member organisations except employers' liability risk already covered by Comcare. It will be responsible for the collection of premiums, accumulation of reserves and payment of claims out of those reserves. The fund is intended to provide a dividend to the government at least comparable to industry standards.
The Act, however, does not appear to contemplate such a substantial operation and the second reading speech made no mention of it. Indeed, the second reading speech advised that Orders would be used for the day-to-day application of the principles of the Act, not to establish what appears to be a significant financial body. The Committee is particularly concerned about the effect of the Orders on agencies established by their own enabling Acts The Committee also noted that Comcare was established by detailed provisions of an Act, whereas Comcover was established by six lines of a legislative instrument
The Committee has had lengthy correspondence with the Minister on these and other important issues and has been briefed by officials from the Department of Finance and Administration. However, it still has concerns with the validity and propriety of the operation of the Orders and has written again to the Minister for advice. After the Committee has completed its scrutiny of the Orders it will make a detailed statement to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,8,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-02-15,"—On behalf of Senator Reynolds, I ask that general business notice of motion No. 101 standing in her name for today relating to the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights be taken as a formal motion.
—Is there any objection to this motion being taken as formal?
—From memory, that is unacceptable. It appears to restrict our working for human rights to the framework of the United Nations. I feel that, had we had time to discuss this with Senator Reynolds, she might have seen that.
—Can I seek leave to return to the placing of business and move a motion to defer this matter?
—I think you can do that, Senator O'Brien. With the motion not being taken as formal, you can certainly move that motion.
Motion (by Senator O'Brien, at the request of Senator Reynolds) agreed to:

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-15,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Senate to express clearly and firmly its opposition to any attempt to manipulate the Senate voting system in order to advantage the government of the day.
We have a situation now where on a number of occasions over the last couple of years members of the Liberal Party have floated proposals to manipulate the Senate voting system. The general thrust behind these proposals—they are all somewhat different—is to make it harder for Independent and minor party candidates to be elected into this place.
There is a little bit of history behind this now, as I have said, and it is important to note that this is quite recent history. There has been a very different view expressed in relation to the Senate voting system and also the issue of so-called Senate obstructionism since the Howard government was elected in 1996.
The first person to enter the fray was Senator MacGibbon, who in September 1996 proposed at the Liberal state convention in Brisbane that a party or Independent should be required to win at least 11.42 per cent of the primary vote in order to have a chance of winning election to the Senate. So any candi 
 date ought to ensure they meet that 11.42 per cent threshold. That was the first foray into this issue and, as I said, it was by Senator MacGibbon back in September 1996.
Then, in May 1997, the federal Liberal Party President, Mr Tony Staley, proposed in a speech to the National Farmers Federation that the Liberal Party should seriously consider amendments to the Electoral Act to curb the power of minor parties in the Senate. He is quoted as saying:
If the Senate Electoral Act remains unchanged, no popularly elected government has a hope of getting a mandate of its own in the Senate.
Mr Staley did not go on to outline what particular mechanisms he was supportive of in relation to manipulating the Senate voting system, but he made it absolutely clear what his commitment was in this regard. About the same time, around May and June 1997, we had the then federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb, also arguing very publicly for a change—in this case an absolutely open-and-shut case of a rorted Senate voting system. In an article in the Financial Review  on 12 June 1997 headed `A bad break from the Senate', Mr Andrew Robb said:
A simple act of parliament altering the system of voting for senators would allow any one of three options: a Labor majority, a coalition majority or a minor party controlled Senate. This could be achieved by splitting each state into six regions with each region electing two senators, one senator elected at each election.
That was Mr Robb's idea of how you put the fix in to the Senate's voting system to ensure that the government has a majority in the Senate. Now the last person from the Liberal Party to make a foray into this in a serious way was Senator Coonan, who in early February this year made a speech to the Sydney Institute and also had published in a couple of major metropolitan newspapers in this country her views about what she described as the overwhelming need for electoral reform in the Senate. She said:
The introduction of a formal threshold for Senate candidates is consistent with the principles of representative democracy. This is because no vote is wasted and no voter disenfranchised. An effective threshold system would continue to recognise the legitimacy of minority representation while enhancing the prospects for strength and stability 
 of government. It offers a solution to the rule of minorities that has characterised the Senate in recent years.
So Senator Coonan proposed a threshold without detailing what she felt would be an appropriate level for such a threshold. This has been, as you can see, quite a consistent theme from the Liberal Party over recent years. Of course, it only became the view of senior Liberals after the Howard government was elected in 1996. It is tied to the allegation that the Senate now is more obstructionist than it has ever been at any other time in its recent history.
It is true that governments of all political persuasions become frustrated with Senates they do not control. I would be the first to admit and acknowledge that both the Hawke and Keating governments were absolutely no exception to that rule. But you have to ask how obstructionist is the Senate that we currently sit in. Since the change of government in March 1996, the Senate has rejected a total of three government bills. You might care to compare that to the record of the coalition controlled Senate during the years of the Whitlam government. Let me quote Gough Whitlam in his book The Whitlam Government, and I commend the book. Page 737 states:
It is true that, throughout our three years, the opposition in the Senate used first its inherited and then its accidental majority to obstruct, delay and reject legislation in a way never experienced before or since.
He talks about accidental majority. He talks about issues that were canvassed just today in the condolence debate on ex-Senator Cleaver Bunton and, moving on from that issue, the replacement of Senator Bert Milliner by Albert Patrick Field. On the same page of this book, Gough Whitlam goes on to say:
In the first 71 years of the Senate's existence, it had rejected a total of only 68 government bills. During our three years alone, it rejected 98.
This is the level of the hypocrisy we hear from the Liberal Party. The truth is that, since 1996, the rate of Senate passage of legislation in terms of bills passed per sitting days has been 2.1, almost the same as it was in the previous parliament, 2.3. We have a situation now where we have never before had the 
 level of cooperation that this government has received from the opposition—and also, I think to some extent, from the minor parties—in accepting government proposals to deal with legislation and to extend the sitting hours of the Senate. We have a situation where the average time devoted to government legislation increased from 41 per cent of total Senate business time in 1995 to 60 per cent in 1998. We say that the charge of Senate obstructionism—which is the reason the Liberal Party wants to manipulate, rort and fix the Senate voting system—just does not stand up to a reasonable analysis.
Beyond that, we have from the Liberal Party, in arguing this case for change to the Senate voting system, a move to pollute the proportional representation system—which, I might say, is already based on one of the most unrepresentative bases you could imagine. We still have a situation where this chamber is incredibly unrepresentative, because you have as its basis equal representation from all the states. In the case of senators from the state of New South Wales, their vote is worth less than a 10th of the value of, say, the vote of a Tasmanian senator. That is a fact of life. This is an unrepresentative chamber, and why build upon that unrepresentativeness another artificial pollution and debauchment of the proportional representation voting system? We see no argument that can be sustained for that at all.
We do, however, say—and I think we have been very reasonable in this regard—that there is a case for examination of the Senate powers, particularly so we can have constitutional change to prevent the violation of democracy that occurred courtesy of the coalition in opposition in 1975 when they brought an elected government down. The coalition have an awful lot of form on this issue. Why is it that, during the whole period of the Hawke and Keating governments from 1983 to 1996, we did not hear one peep out of any of them about this particular matter? Of course, we have heard many senior Liberals lauding the Senate from opposition for their involvement in disrupting the then Labor government's programs. Take Mr Howard back in 1987. He lauded the Senate as:
. . . one of the most democratically elected chambers in the world—a body which at present more faithfully represents the popular will of the total Australian people at the last election than does the House of Representatives—
What hypocrisy from Mr Howard. At the same time, we had Mr Reith with his pledge of what the opposition would do. He said:
We will fight to ensure the maintenance of the powers of the Senate. The reality about the Senate is that it is one of those checks and balances against excesses of executive power by governments.
Again, what transparent hypocrisy from Mr Reith. What about Mr Fischer? A year later he proclaimed:
Both the Liberal and National Parties are totally opposed to destroying in any way the independence of the Senate or introducing artificial shackles on its powers which do not stand up to proper scrutiny.
Where are these voices today in support of Senator Coonan, Mr Staley, Senator MacGibbon and Mr Robb's proposals? You do not hear them.
A fundamental point to be made in relation to any manipulation, rigging or rorting of the Senate's electoral system—which is what the coalition is about—is this: it does not matter what you do to the voting system, if you only get as many votes as the Liberal and National parties got at the last election, you should not get and you do not deserve to get a majority in this house of parliament. Why should you have a majority of coalition senators when you can only get about 40 per cent of the vote?
How are you going to manipulate and rig the voting system for this chamber in order to see a system come forward which will mean that governments that poll so badly in Senate elections will find themselves in a different situation? This is hypocrisy. But if you really want change, if you really want reform, if you really want to do something about this Senate, have a look at the powers. That will give you the approach that the opposition has taken and will continue to take. But we are not going to get into the business of putting the fix in a system—however imperfect it is—based on an unrepresentative Senate that at least ought not to be polluted at the whim of coalition sena 
 tors when they find themselves in government. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Senate Voting System</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-02-15,"—I suppose, at least on a superficial level, I should either feel very flattered personally or a little bemused that Senator Faulkner believes that a matter that was raised generically for debate deserves such prominence as to be the underlying subject of an urgency motion. On a more serious note, however, it is disappointing, firstly, that Senator Faulkner should have so fundamentally missed the point of what I actually said about the broader issue of Senate reform; and, secondly, that the Labor Party is now such a policy free zone, so completely devoid of ideas and so completely devoid of policy that, on this first sitting day this year when there is an opportunity to debate some of the really serious issues that face this country, it is a little disproportionate that the most urgent issue that springs to mind is some far-off attempt to allegedly—and I say `allegedly' advisedly—manipulate the Senate voting system. I can only assume that Labor thinks that nothing the government is doing requires any other urgent scrutiny.
 Is the Labor Party really so brain dead, I ask, that the best it can do is to fabricate some perceived threat to the Senate voting system when it is not even government policy and it was the subject of a speech—for goodness sake—over the vacation? I know the ALP is not really interested in important issues such as the creation of jobs. It is not interested in a sensible review, which is what the Senate should be about, of the coalition's job creating policies which are presently before parliament.
 If it were interested in the job prospects of battling Australians, the ALP could do a number of things. It could pass the unfair dismissals legislation which, in the words of small business, is worth more than 50,000 jobs. It could, for instance, preserve the youth wages structure legislation which will protect the real jobs of 230,000 young Australians. Perhaps we could have a decent debate about what to do with the available work we have in this country, and what are properly 
 thought-out national goals on youth unemployment.
 Another thing the Labor Party could do would be to pass unamended in the Senate the government's tax reform package, which would not only add to the economic growth in Australia and boost jobs and job opportunities but also provide a fair and simpler tax system. My most profound disappointment with the motion is that Labor continues to oppose in the Senate a range of measures that will help with real and justifiable concerns that Australians do have about their future.
Secondly, I must say I do not oppose at least the sentiment behind the motion—I think it is entirely supportable. I would hope all senators would be opposed to any manipulation of the Senate voting system—or any voting system—in order to advantage the government of the day. If that is what Senator Faulkner thinks my proposal is about, then he seriously misrepresents my proposition.
 My proposition is that, with the current numbers in the Senate admitting not even the possibility for the foreseeable future of a government majority in the Senate, there is merit in considering ways of restoring at least the prospect of a government gaining a majority from time to time. It is, in my view, a perfectly legitimate matter to discuss; it is a perfectly legitimate matter for public debate. Were this to happen, it would need to be a clearly articulated policy adopted by government and taken to an election, otherwise it would be open to the allegation of self-interest—and that is certainly not what I am proposing.
The third reason why this motion is deeply disappointing is the breathtaking hypocrisy—Senator Faulkner talked a bit about hypocrisy and I am very glad to reciprocate—of the Labor Party on the broader issue of Senate reform. While privately, of course, many senior Labor Party figures agree that Senate reform is necessary, no-one on Labor's side has had the courage of their convictions to bring forward a clear proposal. That is not to say that Labor has been quiet about its desire for Senate reform, because not so long ago Labor was keen to abolish the Senate. It was 
 part of Labor Party policy to abolish the Senate.
Even Senator Faulkner did his bit last year, under our very noses, to try to lessen the influence of the minor parties by successfully moving a motion for the rotation of senators in the event of a double dissolution. That would have favoured lower ranking major party senators at the expense of minor parties.
—No, they supported it. They actually voted for it.
—Order! Senator Faulkner.
—Everyone voted for it. But, Senator Faulkner, during an MPI you said:
. . . the traditional arrangement favours minor parties.
And you were not in favour of that. You then said:
It ensures that they will receive a long-term senator as soon as they achieve quota. In a double dissolution election, this means that, provided they get over 7.69 per cent of the vote, they will receive a long-term senator, whereas a party which attracted 44 per cent of the vote may only receive two long-term senators. Such a result is inconsistent with the principle of proportional representation. Order of election and voting strength are different concepts.
I could not agree more. You continued:
Order of election simply reflects the order in which successful candidates reach quota. Voting strength more closely resembles proportional support for parties contesting the election.
Although the half Senate recount method is not perfect, it is a more accurate measure of voting strength. It is a more accurate measure of the will of the electorate than is the traditional method.
As I said, I could not agree more that, where the method of proportional representation does not deliver an accurate measure of voter strength, it is legitimate to at least discuss a more accurate measure of the will of the electorate.
Perhaps not surprisingly, I have been able to find many public statements made by Senator Faulkner and some Labor luminaries that suggest a strong desire for comprehensive Senate reform, even to reform of the voting system. For instance, former Senator McMullan in July of last year in the Courier- 
Mail was quoted as saying `a comprehensive high level and public examination of the Senate's future relevance and role is of critical importance for the future functioning of the federation'. He seems to be going a bit further than we are suggesting.
Senator Ray on 3 April 1994 appeared on the Sunday program. Admittedly, he was a bit more circumspect about voting, but he was no more reverential about the Senate when he there said, `I much prefer to approach it in the long term to reducing some of the powers of the Senate, because proportional representation is a great way of distributing representation, an appalling way of distributing power.'
Then, of course, there was former Senator Gareth Evans with his very memorable statement on proportional representation, when he said:
. . . you've got a situation where 50,000 votes are determining the capacity of a government with nearly five million votes to get on with the business of governing. You've really got something to ask yourself: is this really the way the democratic system is supposed to operate?
Former Senator Gareth Evans, on the abolition of the Senate, was also quoted as saying:
. . . if one believes, as I do, along with all good Labor men and women true, that the Senate ought to be abolished, or at the very least deprived of its capacity to destroy properly elected governments, there's surely no better forum in which to promote these insidious heresies than the institution itself.
Who could forget former Prime Minister Mr Keating? He reduced us all to `unrepresentative swill' and, on changing the Senate, said on 3 March 1994 in the Australian , `The Senate's voting system of proportional representation is a major and legitimate issue in our public and national life.'
I would not want to sell Senator Faulkner short, because he has had plenty to say about his displeasure with the Senate in the past. In fact, he said, `The ALP believed there was a strong case for a constitutional referendum to change the make-up of the Senate which gave an equal number of senators to each state, regardless of population.' Interestingly enough, we never saw a proposal for a referendum from Labor, notwithstanding that it had 13 years in which to bring it forward.
It is at some stage time to square the circle here. Any proposal for reform would need to improve the quality of government in Australia. Of course, while opinions differ as to how that might be gone about, what utter arrogance to think that we senators should not even ask questions about whether we can do better.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-02-15,"—It is a bit disingenuous of Senator Coonan to suggest that this is not an urgent matter; that, somehow or other, we should think that her proposals are just some idle things raised for us to ponder in our spare moments; and that, when we are in this place, we should just get on with some of the legislative proposals that the government and others have put forward.
The trouble is that, clearly, Senator Coonan's proposal is not the first, but in fact only the latest, in a very long line of similar proposals from coalition members over the last three or so years. At various strategic times, they have floated such proposals to undermine and threaten to gut the ability of the Senate to keep a check on the executive, on the government. And these proposals tend to coincide with times during which the government is trying to press through important pieces of legislation which it knows it does not have majority community support for. 
There is no clearer indication of the fact that the government does not have majority community support for its economic program than the fact that it received just 37.7 per cent, less than 38 per cent, of the vote in the Senate at the last federal election. As Malcolm MacKerras pointed out at a seminar on the weekend, that is actually the worst ever result for conservative parties in the Senate in the history of federation. So the coalition—on the basis of it getting its worst ever result from the Australian people voting for members of the house of review—is trying to argue some sort of mandate to push through whatever it desires, without any sort of check at all, any sort of consultation, any form of consideration of alternative viewpoints.
It is no wonder that, when the coalition is trying to push through a program from such 
 a completely tenuous position, suggestions such as this are raised to try to provide a smokescreen to draw attention away from its own incredibly weak position. Senator Coonan is not the first from the coalition to argue such suggestions—to gut the Senate and try to reduce its ability to be representative of the views of the Australian people. And these sorts of suggestions always come out at times such as this.
The simple fact is that under a proportional system—and the Senate, whilst not being perfectly proportional, is certainly well and truly in advance of the House of Representatives in being representative and proportional of the Australian public's views—if a party gets a majority of the vote from the public, if they have majority support from the public, they will get a majority of the seats. Malcolm Fraser proved that back in the seventies. The other simple fact is that it is very rare for any party to get the majority of the vote from the public, particularly in the Senate, because the public knows that the government needs the parliament to keep a check on what it is doing. That is, after all, what the parliament is meant to do.
The parliament is there to legislate. The government or the executive is there to propose legislation—two very fundamentally different roles that together with the judiciary underpin our entire system of government. That is why this is an urgent matter. It is not just some idle ponderings of an apparently high ranking and up-and-coming coalition member—so I read in the press. It is actually a proposal that strikes at the very heart of our system of government. I do not think you get anything more serious or more urgent than that. Our entire system of democracy as Australia was established, the principles of the constitution that the coalition are supposedly sworn to uphold and believe are greater defenders of than the rest of us, are being blown apart by proposals such as that which Senator Coonan puts forward. It is a deliberate attempt to try to disenfranchise significant sections of the Australian community to make their vote worth less than those people who do the so-called right thing and vote for the major parties.
It is pretty obvious what the motive of Senator Coonan and the coalition is in raising these sorts of issues whenever there is a significant piece of legislation coming forward. They have managed to get the orchestrated media chorus behind them, saying that the Senate should get out of the way, the parliament should get out of the way and let the government govern. Unfortunately, the government is still able to govern. I wish they would not do some of the things they are doing. The parliament is here to legislate, and the government should get out of the road and let the parliament do its job.
It is not surprising but nonetheless worth pointing out that suggestions such as this from the coalition were not raised when the Democratic Labor Party held the balance of power and supported the coalition. There was no attack from the coalition then, suggesting that they were unrepresentative and had undue power for a minority party. It is not surprising given the role that party played. It shows the hollowness of proposals such as these.
It is worth pointing out again that the previous parliament passed 427 pieces of legislation for the Howard government and I believe opposed only two bills. Ninety-nine per cent in anyone's language is not a bad average. Not many things can be said to have remained the same since Federation. In a fast changing world, the role and function of the Australian Senate, in particular, as a house of review and as an important house of the parliament keeping a check on the operations of government, endures.
There is one very good reason why the coalition or, for that matter, the ALP when in government will never have to worry about an obstructive Senate operating in a destructive way—the single occasion that it has done so was the well documented case of 1975—and that is because the Democrats have pledged never to block supply to an elected government. We believe it is important to be responsible, and we have made proposals many times to ensure that the Senate can operate in that way—well back to former Senator Michael Macklin in the 1980s proposing legislation to clarify the Senate's role to 
 ensure that it does not obstruct the government in such a basic way.
On such a basic matter as this, it is clearly and absolutely urgent that the Senate expresses its concern that any member of the coalition can freely float something that would blow apart the fundamentals of our parliamentary democracy and the system of government and that there be not a single voice of concern raised by their parliamentary colleagues in the coalition.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-02-15,"—There is no official coalition policy on voting systems in the Senate. What they do every now and then is they get one of their colleagues to go out and bell the cat on this particular issue. First of all, it was Mr Andrew Robb in the Bulletin , then Senator Minchin and now Senator Coonan is the designated hitter on this particular issue. It is a handy issue for an ambitious backbencher, albeit a junior one, to serve their political masters by making these suggestions.
The fact is that—and I think Senator Bartlett summed it up very well—they have lost three bills in three years. All I can say as a former manager of government business is that that is sheer luxury. Three bills out of 450-odd have gone down. When you consider what the government designated as their big bills—Wik, private health insurance, the one-third sale of Telstra, the industrial relations legislation—unfortunately, they have got all those bills through this chamber. What they have managed to do is build up the big straw man. They have built up the Senate as the bogey. Senate obstructionism is the reason for this government not performing well. It is all talk.
The fact is that there has been very little Senate obstructionism. No government has been given the privilege of the extra days, hours and weeks that this government has been given. We, coming out of government, understand the difficulty of a legislative program and we have cooperated in extending the hours, the days and the weeks—cooperation that we rarely received when we were in government. Nevertheless, we offer it because we believe this is a legislature that must deal with government business at a 
 reasonable rate. The only couple of times we have not cooperated is when the government has acted in a very unprincipled way to break previous agreements, and then we have dished out the punishment. The examples of that is always moving censure motions on general business and that sort of thing. Naturally, we use the devices of the Senate, as we have to, to punish the government to re-establish the balance of power in this particular chamber.
The ALP had to learn to live with not having a Senate majority for 13 years. We had to learn that we could not get everything through. I think the big difference between the Labor government and this government is, often having made that assessment in the cabinet room, we did not present things in this chamber that were going to be rolled on. Maybe we made a mistake. Maybe we should have bowled up a lot more stuff to this chamber, had the chamber reject it, and then we could have run the big Senate obstruction argument out there. But we used to make an assessment, especially Senator Faulkner and me. When issues came before cabinet, we often advised them, `This has got a snowball's chance in hell of getting through the Senate. Why don't we drop it now rather than go through all that effort and see it go under? Let's try to come up with alternative proposals.'
But what I really remember, of course fondly, between 1983 and 1996 is how often colleagues on the other side extolled the virtues of the plurality of the Senate, how they told us that the Senate was the real chamber and not the House of Representatives, how they thought a government not having a majority was a wonderful thing. They are all on record—the current Prime Minister, Mr Reith, a whole range of them—extolling the power of the Senate during the time they were in opposition.
And when the Australia card came to this chamber for the joint sitting, what did the coalition do? Even though it had been endorsed by the Australian people in 1987, they continued to oppose it. So all this argument that has come in that we need to restructure the Senate's representation merely comes through a frustration of unprofessionalism by 
 the current government that they do not have the patience and are not willing to spend the time to steer material through the Senate.
So what do they provide as an alternative? `Let's rort the voting system'—that is basically it, pure and simple; `Let's introduce artificial devices to try to eliminate minor parties.' I have never been accused of being a sentimentalist. I do not particular care for minor parties, especially the National Party, which is becoming a very minor party in this place. After 1 July, they will have four members. You would make up 25 per cent of the caucus of that party, Senator Brown. And Senator Bartlett is in a party that is going to be double the size of the National Party. So I really have to come in here protect the interests of the National Party, when Senator Coonan and others—
—Wait a minute, they won't even have party status.
—They will not even have party status—you are absolutely right, Senator Faulkner. So the poor old National Party is one of those minors that may get affected by this because they want maybe a 10 per cent threshold. Do you think Senator O'Chee got a 10 per cent threshold at the last poll? So if he had actually just survived his way through, under the old Coonan amendments to the voting system, boom,  out he goes. Sooner or later in Victoria, and it is not far away, the Liberals are going to be sick of carrying Senator McGauran and they are going to say, `No more joint tickets. Spend your own money. Get back here.' Senator McGauran has done it once, but he would not do it under this proposal because he would not get 10 per cent of the vote. When did the National Party last get 10 per cent of the vote in Victoria? You would have to have a really good memory to remember that.
There is, however, no pure system of proportional representation. It always involves some compromises on the way through, that is true. So the quota can, depending on the amount of senators elected, vary between seven and 14 per cent at the moment. So there is no absolutely pure thing. If it was absolutely pure, we would use Australia as a 
 total electorate and wreak the federation, and go to an Israeli-style PR election.
But, of course, politics is about more than representation; it is also about the distribution of power. And in the social compact and political compact we have in this country it is a combination of both that makes the system work. Too often we hear the minor parties only talk about representation and not about the distribution of power, which often leaves them in a position of all power and no responsibility. But that, again, is a function of the adversarial nature of politics that we all in this chamber can alter at any particular time we want to so that the minority parties would have no power whatsoever. It depends on the circumstances at the time. But one thing is certain: no-one on that side, no-one on the coalition side, is yet smart enough to come up with a system that will give them a majority in this chamber when they get 40 per cent of the vote. None of them are that clever. It does not matter what system you go to, you will not get a majority in here with 40 per cent of the vote.
Let's say we even went through the process of ganging up on the minor parties, put the fix in, put all these things in. What would happen? My bet is we would still have a hung Senate. The difference would be that there would be just a few less people with the balance of power than currently is the case. So what advantage would there be in shifting to that system?
What this debate should be fundamentally about is: what power should exist in the Senate? What should be the functions of the Senate? That is where the debate should shift to. It is the view of the Labor Party, in particular, that this chamber should not be able to block supply—not a relevant question at the moment, but it may one day be a relevant question again.
We in the Labor Party are also quite happy to look at what other powers this Senate has that may in fact be given up to assist in the efficient running of a government. But the power that no-one wants this chamber to give up is its power of scrutiny—its power to be able to scrutinise government actions, administrative actions and the behavioural modes of 
 coalition senators. That is what the government resents. You go along to estimates committees or raise issues in this chamber. They do not want to be benchmarked by community standards, they do not want their political actions tested and examined, they do not want government documents to be demanded and put the table that may disprove their political actions. That is what they hate about this chamber, not the legislative blockage. It is not about the time it takes to get legislation through. It is the fact that someone has the utmost cheek to examine their actions in detail. And that will only occur, we know, if there is a non-government majority in this particular chamber. Do you think it ever happens over in the House of Representatives, no matter who is in control? Do you think any minister is put under any pressure there? It is because they can use their numbers at any particular time.
Senator Coonan made the point that `The Labor Party will get involved in manipulation. Look at their attitude after double dissolutions.' The fact is the constitution gave this chamber the right to determine long- and short-term senators. We took the attitude that there should be a predisposed position and not an opportunist one taken after every election. And if that disadvantages minor parties, it is because they have such a massive advantage in the way proportional representation is currently allocated. That is why we take that particular action—not to particularly manipulate the system but to bring in something fair. It is a little like the old Sheridan saying: `I don't mind beating my head against a brick wall. Don't build one for that purpose.'

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-02-15,"—The first thing to say about this urgency motion is that it is not urgent at all. It is an irrelevancy and it is cutting no mustard tonight. I think the whole Senate wishes it would finish up.
Senator Coonan was quite right when she said you have given her a notoriety she may well not deserve. She made this speech outside the Senate to a private audience. It is hardly relevant to elevate it to an urgency motion in this Senate. Even Senator Coonan 
 would concede that it does not warrant an urgency motion in this Senate. You have simply debased matter of urgency motions. Okay, you could raise it in an adjournment debate, or in general business at best, but, as I say, it is an obvious sign that the opposition have no policy to bring into this Senate, so they are clutching at straws. They again rely on Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray to run the issues in this Senate. They never run policy issues. When are you going to wake up to the fact that those two are never going to get you into government? They may be good hit men but they will never get you into government. They will never, as Kim Beazley said, build a policy from the ground up—which is apparently the exercise you are now going through—or, as Mark Latham said, get you out of the rut. Even George Campbell has contributed to the policy debate in the Labor Party, but not Senator Faulkner, not Senator Ray—nor will they ever have the credibility to do so. You have got to wake up to that sooner or later, Senator; and don't you hitch your star to Senator Ray, either, because that way you will come down very quickly.
As I said, even Senator Campbell has contributed to the debate. He wants centralised wage fixing. He wants a more powerful Industrial Relations Commission. He wants super unions. They are all utterly wrong, idiotic policies of the past, but he is trying to contribute to the policy debate. Talking about the approach and the culture of senators on that side of the chamber allowing Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray to take over, and talking about seminar papers—Mr Latham had something to say about that. He said that there are two types of opposition:
The first represents what I would call scab lifting . This is an Opposition which sees its role as exploiting the change process. It tries to feed off the discomfort governments inevitably encounter in having to manage the consequences of economic and social change. It constantly tries to lift the scab off the wounds of change . . . Since 1996, federal Labor has been in scab-lifter mode.
The two leading scab lifters spoke here tonight. Never have they contributed to the policy debate for the Labor Party, nor will they ever contribute. You will rot in opposition while you let them lead your tactics. It is 
 an absurdity to bring this matter of Senator Coonan's paper up. Many would see it as visionary but, as Senator Coonan herself has admitted, it does not warrant an urgency motion in this parliament this evening. 
There is no argument from this side of the House with regard to the important role that the Senate plays. We believe it is a house of review. It deserves to check the legislation. We know only too well that, whoever is in government, legislation often comes up here which has been rushed. We have managed to fix it up. There is no trouble with that. We believe in the powers of the Senate as enshrined by the constitution. Those powers have allowed the Senate to block supply. That was an issue raised tonight, but we will not go into that old red herring of a debate. It is over with. The people spoke in the 1975 election. They spoke again in the 1977 election. That is a dead issue. It is something the Labor Party have never let go of and have never forgotten. But the point is, they do not even want a Senate. When I first came into this parliament Senator Button was the leader of the Senate. He was then followed by Senator Evans. They both stood on a platform of abolition of the Senate. Senator Faulkner is no different. You do not even want a house of review. So do not come in here and tell us that we are trying to subvert the processes.
Senator Faulkner, again, in his usual form—he is becoming very predictable in opposition—tried to put a bit of spice into this dull debate by using words, which I have written down, such as `rort', `fix', `manipulate', `pollute', `debauched' and `violation'. This is a typical approach by Senator Faulkner, who does not even want a Senate. He would abolish it, yet now he comes in here waxing lyrical about defending the rights of the Senate as a house of review. The coalition supports the Senate in all its constitutional powers. You do not.
In our second term, the opposition have obstructed—as they did in our first term—the legislation and the processes of government and the mandate we were given. Straight after the 3 October election, between 23 November and 10 December 1998, more than half the Senate sitting hours were dedicated to non- 
 government business. That is, around 60 hours of the 108 sitting hours was dedicated to non-government business. As a measure of the lengths to which the opposition parties will go to avoid a vote in this House and to avoid meeting their democratic responsibilities, let us go back to Saturday, 11 July—the Telstra debate—when the opposition pushed the Senate into a Saturday sitting. Not only did they cost the parliament extra tens of thousands of dollars by pushing the Telstra debate into a Saturday, but the whole morning was wasted on whether this Senate should say the Lord's Prayer or not. So do not say you do not filibuster and you do not obstruct in this Senate and you do not cost the taxpayers money by doing that.
Senator Coonan's paper was born out of that sort of frustration for the government, of not being able to achieve the mandate for which they had gone to the people in two elections. As for time taken to debate government legislation, all the records have been broken. Let us take the top three. The Telstra bill took 32 hours to debate. This does not count the months of lead-up with committees—which could have been hundreds of hours. Running second is the workplace relations bill, which took over 50 hours of debate in this House. That does not include the 50 hours of debate which Cheryl Kernot had with Peter Reith in his office, let alone all the committee meetings and hearings prior to that. But the record is the native title bill: 106 hours to debate this bill. You quote figures that say 90 per cent of the government legislation has gone through, or greater. But you have amended it, you have delayed it and you have made a great deal of it ineffective.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-02-15,"—I have only three minutes, so I will make some brief points. Firstly, this is an important matter. I congratulate the Labor Party for making it very clear that they are not going to support the clear effort of the coalition in government to degrade the standard of democracy which leads to the Senate being a more representative body for the people of Australia—on a one vote, one value basis—than the House of Representatives.
Senator Coonan used words to the effect that any proposal for reform should try to improve the governance of Australia. If she were true to that, the first place she would go to would be the House of Representatives, where we currently have a government with a majority elected by 40 per cent of the voters and where we have single member electorates, which means that an average of 50 per cent of people in many electorates around Australia do not have anybody whom they voted for representing them. The single-member electorate system is far less democratic than proportional representation, which we have here in the Senate.
When you look at Senator Coonan's proposal as it appeared in the press, you see that she is really trying to give a different voting status to those who vote for the big parties as against to those who vote for Independents and minor parties. For the first, your preferences count. For the second, if you are below the threshold she sets, your preferences do not count. The end result of this—Senator Coonan can try to deny this—is that her prescription would mean that I would not be in here, although I got eight per cent of the vote in my electorate, but she would be elected, although she got—and listen to this—0.0005 per cent.
She received less than one-ten thousandth of the vote that I got, but her prescription has me out and her in because I am in a minor party, the Greens, and she is in the big party, the coalition, which has some God-given right to a greater say in representation. That undercuts the whole tenet of democracy. That undercuts the rule that there should be one vote, one value. It is a flow-on indication of her vote to overrule the parliament of the Northern Territory on the matter of euthanasia in the Andrews bill that came before this parliament last year. One step into the pool of cutting democracy is taken and then the next one is taken.
I want to finish by again congratulating the Labor Party for standing up to this kite-flying exercise from the Liberal Party. It is not irrelevant, as Senator McGauran described Senator Coonan's move to fly kites. It is very important, and a great stand has been taken 
 by people on this side of the chamber. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Senate Voting System</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1
"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-02-15,"—In addressing this motion there are various questions I think we first need to have answered. Firstly, does this abject negativity set the scene for the rest of the year? For the sake of a good debating chamber, I hope not. Secondly, is this motion part of a conspiracy theory that we hear so much about in this chamber, particularly from Senator Faulkner, who moved this motion? Thirdly, where is the enlightenment coming from in this so-called repository for good ideas? Surely, this is an attempt to scotch it.
On the first day back we have an opposition which, I would have thought, would seek to take the initiative, to be positive, to endeavour to be productive and to enhance the workings of the Senate. But, no, we see no such creative thinking. Would it not have been a good thing to move a forward looking motion rather than such a negative motion? There seems to be an attitude around here that automatically there must be something wrong with a new idea. Senator Faulkner's dog in the manger urgency motion states:
The need for the Senate to express clearly and firmly its opposition to any attempt to manipulate—
Note the word `manipulate'; that was an unnecessary word, reinforced by a second point about a conspiracy theory, which seems to dominate so much of the Labor Party thinking of this day. It goes on:
the Senate voting system in order to advantage the government of the day.
The Labor Party when in government knew all about moving motions to advantage itself. There is a litany of those.
The first day back in the parliamentary year we see a priority in debate not on some of the great issues of the day but on a head in the sand type of motion. Let us ask why this matter arises today. It is not because of a party platform. It is not because of a statement from the Prime Minister. It is because of Helen Coonan's address to the Sydney Institute—a think tank organisation and an appropriate one in which to discuss such 
 ideas. It was not even an address to a Liberal Party branch or a convention.
The nerve of these people! They are worried about a good idea in case it develops, grows and is debated. What is wrong with this country? Are we frightened to debate new ideas, different ways of doing things? Let me say loud and clear: congratulations to Helen Coonan on raising this matter in detail. Naturally, I do not agree 100 per cent, but it was a great presentation on which to build debate, not to stifle it, which we are attempting to do today.
Let us look at the contrast between what the opposition is doing here and the rest of Australia. Right around our great country we have entrepreneurs with vision, operating successfully and forward-planning businesses. We have some of the very best scientists in the world creating new inventions, and our constituents are adapting to new ways of doing things. As a result, our products are becoming more marketable on the world scene and our service deliveries are becoming more innovative and cost effective. Australians everywhere have been matching and passing benchmarks for world's best practice. Yet here in this Senate chamber, where we and our constituents expect national leadership and something better of an opposition than what is presented here, we find such reactive thinking. The reactive nature of this opposition is rather worrying in a so-called enlightened world.
Were we not reminded in question time this afternoon by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Robert Hill, and the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Richard Alston, that in economic matters the ALP at present has no policies? Something has gone wrong. Regrettably, the Labor Party at the present time has a very negative attitude towards the Senate. I suppose that has gone on, but we are seeing it here again today reinforced in this motion. Manipulation is okay if it serves the Labor Party's so-called best interests. Remember Paul Keating in 1992 when he referred to the Senate as `unrepresentative swill'? Now proportional representation is a good thing. Also in a talk to students from the De La 
 Salle College, former PM Keating said, `We shouldn't have a Senate. It's an impediment to the smooth operation of the parliamentary system.'
Senator Coonan's thought-provoking document entitled The Senate—safeguard or handbrake on democracy is a pretty apt description. I think it is a pretty sound study, certainly on which to build a platform for further debate on how it could be reformed. Let us look at some of the positives of Senator Coonan's study. She said that the Senate is not a law unto itself. It must exercise co-equal powers within a system of responsible government that recognises the broad parameters of the government's right to govern and the overwhelming public interest in having a stable parliamentary system that is capable of managing day-to-day institutional conflict in a coherent way. What is wrong with that? Why not build on that sort of debate? Those issues are petty important.
She quite rightly points out that the introduction of proportional representation in 1948 entrenched a system that favoured minority parties and Independents. What is wrong with debating that? Why try to stifle that? It is a fact of life. But, because our time is drawing to a close, we must not stick our heads in the sand. We must think beyond the square and we must strongly attack what I believe in this motion is a dog in the manger attitude that we see as reactive, negative and, unfortunately, most untimely.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Senate Voting System</title>,Matters of Urgency,13,1

"Quirke, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-15,"—Before the debate was interrupted this afternoon I said I would have a few comments to make about the Greenfields Foundation. I think I told the Senate that I was recently looking for a home loan. I had gone around and had a look at the Commonwealth Bank and what they were offering. Their interest rate was, I think, about 5.59 per cent. There was a `honeymoon' rate for the first year—a rather interesting name. I had a look 
 at all the other banks. They were all blueing with each other but how much they are not going to charge me each month and what the interest rate is going to be and all the rest of it. But I have to tell the Senate that there is not any organisation that offers a deal like the Greenfields organisation. That is the best deal I have ever seen. I do not think there are even any set-up charges for the loan. I would like to find out about it.
I have taken the trouble to ask whether I can get an application for it, because I am told even that is free—whereas, if you go into the bank, you have to pay for the application form. What I have found out from the Greenfields Foundation is that you do not have to pay any set-up charges. In fact, all you have to do is ring Ron Walker and he organises the whole thing for you.
Ron loaned the Liberal Party a rather large amount of money. I believe it was $4.65 million. The loan went through a few different sets of hands and eventually turns up under the name of the Greenfields Foundation. We on this side of politics would like to know a bit more about that. We would like to know where the application forms are and the addresses of some of the directors of this show, and we would like to know how we can get on the bandwagon for such a favourable piece of treatment as this.
We note in this particular bill that there are changes, which we do not support, to the disclosure laws to make it very much easier for the Ron Walkers of this world to go around with their necessary brown paper bags, pick up money from a whole range of different sources, source that into the Liberal Party for administration, electoral purposes or whatever, and not have to go through any of the disclosure rules. As I understand it, the Labor Party has agreed that what was originally a disclosure requirement over $500 should legitimately become $1,500. As I understand it, we will not be supporting the proposals to lift that to $5,000 in the name of individuals and to $10,000 for corporations.
There are provisions in this legislation such that if you do this right and you strip the donations around to $4,999—if the legislation were to be passed—to every member of a 
 family and then you set up a couple of dummy companies, you can actually give a very large amount of money in political donations to political parties in this country. I think it is very unlikely that anyone is going to take advantage of these sorts of loopholes for the Labor Party. I think it is much more likely that this is going to take place on the other side of politics.
There is a smell about this stuff—there is a real serious smell in this bill—and the Greenfields Foundation is something which is not smelling too sweet for the government. We have been told, of course, that all this fundraising is kept at arms-length—and who are we to be cynical about that; why would we dispute this? There is not a great deal of transparency about these matters. In fact, we have found no answers at all in our inquiries about Greenfields through the Electoral Commission and the various avenues open to us in the parliamentary sense.
We are now finding that the proposal in this bill will greatly open up the potential for abuse, and that potential for abuse is something which I think all senators should be concerned about. I think it is impossible in a democracy to not keep a strict track of the record of political donations. I think it is essential. Where do you put the figure? The figure is probably much more accurately placed at $1,500 for single donations before disclosure has to take place than it is at $5,000 and multiples thereof. In all legislation before us, I think it is necessary for us to prove the integrity of our political system to our constituents. It is my view that this legislation does not do that.
I will not take up any more time of the Senate tonight—I have had a good go at this. I just wish to say that this bill has a number of pieces in it which I hope are firmly rejected in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-02-15,"—The most important provision in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  is section 245, subsection (1), which reads:
It shall be the duty of every elector to vote at each election.  

There has been a great deal of debate about that issue not only in Australia but around the world. The minister at the table has made his views clear and I have read learned articles written by him in various magazines over time, but I think—and I hope he takes this in the right spirit—he is quite wrong. I think a citizen is obliged to have a say in the sort of government that is to rule over him or her. In a democracy there is the idea that it is the people who speak, and it is only proper and right that the people should decide who constitutes the parliament that will rule the nation in so far as it passes the laws and keeps a proper scrutiny over the executive.
The social, cultural and moral values form more of the legislation that comes before this chamber than might be thought from a first perusal of it. The Senate is now dealing with a bill which, at one level, could be seen as a bill that deals with mechanics. The bill appears to deal with the machinery of elections—for example, the periods within which certain actions must be taken, the monetary criteria according to which notification about donations has or has not been given, the people who can witness an enrolment application and so on. Yet the reality is that these amendments, which seem to deal with figures, limits and criteria, are influenced markedly by social, cultural and moral values. If you look at items 10, 18, 29, 36, 49, 59 and 69 of the bill, then you will see what I mean. The first five of those items make changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the last two to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. They take away the vote from anybody who is serving a sentence of imprisonment at the time the election is held. This matter has been talked about today, and so it should be because it is a matter of great significance.
The fact that a person is serving a custodial sentence should not mean that it automatically flows that he or she is denied a vote in circumstances where otherwise he or she would have a right and a duty to vote. This is particularly so given the law that operates in the Northern Territory. In the Northern Territory people are now compelled to go to gaol for offences for which the rest of Aus 
 tralia would be visited with, at most, a fine and probably with an adjournment of the proceeding.
—An adjournment?
—As Senator O'Chee would know, there is a provision for adjourning matters for up to 12 months, which gives a person the opportunity to act well during that period and, if he or she does so, then the matter is dismissed. No doubt on the many occasions you have appeared for people, perhaps in Victoria, Senator O'Chee, you would have sought that adjournment.
This present bill says about anybody who has offended, no matter how light the offence, that that person should not have a chance to participate in the civil life of the country in any way at all. This is the concept of the civilly dead—the concept that says that anybody, whether he or she is in gaol for, say, an offence connected with drunkenness, a minor assault or whatever reason and no matter what the time, should not be allowed to vote. It denies the idea that people are a mixture of the dark side and the light side, a mixture of the good and the bad. It denies the idea that everybody has a chance for redemption. To simply say without proper evidence that people should not be allowed to vote simply because they are in gaol for an offence is going beyond what is decent. I corrected myself then to say `in gaol serving a term of imprisonment for an offence' because if a person is in gaol awaiting trial and has not been convicted, then he or she does have an ability to have a vote.
It is a dreadful thing to regard people as being completely divorced from society, as not being citizens, no matter what the quality and no matter what the character of the offence. As a decent set of people we should not allow that to happen. It does not happen in many of the other states. In my own state of Victoria, there is no bar to voting for people who are imprisoned.
The other thing I want to say about that is that people must be gaoled in the Northern Territory for an offence of theft, be it $5 or less. If a person should go to gaol for stealing or receiving $5 or goods of that value, then that amount of $5 must be a very significant 
 thing. But when you look to this bill, keeping in mind that this bill will take away from a person who has stolen $5 the right to vote, given that that is what this bill must do in terms of those people in the Northern Territory, why then do you switch your attitude to that sum in subsection 305B(1) and substitute $10,000 for $1,500? It might be worth while me going to that subsection. Subsection 305B(1) deals with donations to political parties and says:
If, in a financial year, a person makes gifts totalling $1,500 or more to:
(a)	 the same registered political party; or
(b)	 the same State branch of a registered political party;
the person must furnish a return to the Electoral Commission within 20 weeks after the end of the financial year, covering all the gifts that the person made to that political party or branch during the financial year.
If this bill is passed, $10,000 will be substituted for $1,500 so there need not be any disclosure for an amount of up to $10,000. So amounts up to $10,000 do not seem to be of great significance in this context, and yet, I repeat, an ordinary person in the Northern Territory stealing $5 will be visited with a term of imprisonment and will have their vote taken away. Why does this bill treat $5 in one way when an ordinary person off the street is charged with an offence and found guilty yet treat amounts up to $10,000 as being fairly insignificant—insignificant in the sense that they do not have to be disclosed—where a political party is concerned?
Where does the philosophy that leads to this sort of legislation come from? Before I go to that and the second reading speech, I will fill in another point. It is now going to be more rigorous and more onerous to register as a voter than it has been. If this legislation is passed, there will be new provisions as to how a person can register. In fact, they will have to find someone who can certify their registration, not in terms of it being correct but in terms of that person having signed it. This, it is said, will make the electoral roll more authentic. The justification is the last sentence on the first page of the second reading speech, which says:
There is increasing disquiet in sections of the community about the potential for electoral fraud and continuing scepticism regarding the integrity of the electoral roll as the current enrolment process is open to abuse.
There is no evidence at all as to what sections of the community are referred to in this second reading speech. In fact, the phrase `there is increasing disquiet in sections of the community' sounds like a mantra, a mantra which is not based on any evidence.
Indeed, a lot of this bill is based on a mantra. For example, the issue that I have been dealing with—the taking away of the vote because the person is serving a term in prison—looks very much as if it is based on the mantra that more and more is coming to pollute the political process in this country: law and order. Law and order is a thing that has been brought forward over many generations to justify action which is quite harsh and draconian, and this is no exception. It is the law and order mantra that is operating here. On the second page of the second reading speech it says:
The government agrees with the electoral matters committee when it states:
. . . that it is unacceptable that the most fundamental transaction between a citizen and the government—[that is] the act of choosing the government at a democratic election—is subject to a far lower level of security than such lesser transactions as opening a bank account, applying for a passport, applying for a driver's licence or registering for social security benefits, to name but a few.
One of the problems about that statement is the use of the word `transaction', as if there is some sort of contract, not even the concept of a social contract that Jean Jacques Rousseau might have come out with but more like a commercial contract—a transaction between the citizen and the government. Until now at least, I have never had the idea that an election is a transaction between the government and the citizen. I had a concept that a citizen gave a grant of power, if you like, to a parliament elected in a particular way. In fact, the citizen does not even elect the government of the country; they elect the parliament which in turn elects the government. 
I must say, it is a misconception and an arrogance on the part of the government to think that they are there, as it were, in some sort of commercial contract with the citizens. That is certainly not the sort of concept that the people in the 17th and 18th centuries would have talked about as being a social contract—that concept of power coming from the citizen and being given over to government. That is not the concept that is put out here; the concept that is put out here is one of a commercial contract that in some way can be treated as such, like a bank account and so on. It is a terrible concept for a country that believes in citizenship and the right of people to vote. The second reading speech goes on to say:
Under the act in its present form, it is remarkably easy to place on the roll a dead person's name, a false name, a non-citizen, or a person who is not yet 18. In addition, the enrolment could have a fake or false address.
That is creating a straw man to knock down without there being any evidence. There is no evidence, at least in this second reading speech, that would lead to the quite harsh conditions the person has to go through to vote. What is the answer to this, according to the second reading speech? It is this:
Accordingly, this bill introduces some of the recommendations of the Electoral Matters Committee report with respect to addressing the potential for electoral fraud.
That is interesting because, correctly so, it does not allege that there is electoral fraud; it talks about the potential for electoral fraud. It goes on:
The amendments relating to enrolment issues will provide:
. 	 for an upgraded witnessing requirement, whereby the witness must be an elector and be in a prescribed class of persons.
In a democratic society where everybody is equal, we are now going to have a special class of citizens who can sign a person's application to vote. There are going to be some people who can do that and other people who cannot. We are going to have categories set up amongst our citizens, and we are going to have those classes prescribed by regulations. 
In my view, an election, voting and the rights of citizens are absolutely fundamental. If they are going to be set out, they should be set out in primary legislation. But these people in this class are going to be distinct and raised above their fellow men and women, and they are going to be prescribed by regulations. Parliament will not get to say who they are going to be; the government will set out the regulations which this parliament can then allow or disallow. If it is so important, why should this category of person be prescribed by regulation? Not only that, the methods of verification are to be prescribed by regulation as well. This is a schizophrenic bill which treats the same sorts of issues, depending on which sorts of circumstances arise, as important or unimportant depending upon how the authors of the bill want the consequences to fall. It is a bill much in need of drastic overhauling.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-02-15,"—I listened to my learned colleague Senator Cooney speak on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  and, after reading the second reading speech, I think one could only come to the conclusion that this government must worry about their own legitimacy to rule. If what they say in the second reading speech is in any way true, one would wonder how many dead people, how many people with false names, how many non-citizens or how many people under 18—if this is the concern of the government—did in effect vote for them at the last election?
As my learned colleague has said, the only argument that is put forward for the major thrust of this bill is the argument of potential. One can argue potential ad nauseam until one becomes absolutely wrapped up in it to the extent that one loses sight of reality. If one read the minister's second reading speech on this occasion, one could very fast come to that conclusion. As Senator Cooney rightly pointed out, the minister claimed in the second reading speech that:
There is increasing disquiet in sections of the community about the potential for electoral fraud—
It does not say which way the electoral fraud worked. It does not say how it worked. It 
 does not say, as my colleague has said, who the culprits were.
Without even going too far into the second reading speech, one can only be concerned at the motives of the government. I can assure this chamber that in no way would I or my colleagues, I am sure, have anything to do with fraudulent practices. In these days of modern technology, I understand that many members of the House of Representatives take the time to find out who the new electors enrolled in their electorate are and to write to them to welcome them on to the roll, and in the process hopefully get some kudos. If there is this potential, or if it is even happening, one would soon become aware of false names, false addresses or persons who were not even 18 years of age. Even through the humble resources of a senator writing to constituents, one soon would become fairly aware of where the problems existed. So I think the government is skating on very thin ice in putting forward these major proposals in this piece of legislation.
As my colleague Senator Ray said earlier today, it is important that our system of government, which has stood the test of time, is one of the most respected in the world and that what we have put in place has been sound, has operated well and has operated to the advantage of the citizens of this nation. That is what the legislation is about. It is not about working to the advantage of any political party, whether it be either of the major political parties or any of the minor parties. We have a system that is respected. I believe that what the government is seeking to do with some of the principal parts of this legislation is to bring our system into disrepute.
The Australian Electoral Commission has always been hardworking. Its staff has been hardworking to ensure the integrity of the act, to ensure the integrity of the role and to ensure that the political parties, as best as they reasonably can, observe the act and its application. As parliamentarians, we must ensure that at all times we are open and transparent and that our political system is equally the same. A feature of our system is that it has been open and transparent, although that has been blotted by the 
 Greenfields Foundation, which has sought to darken that part of our political system.
 There are essentially three tenets that need to be followed when dealing with electoral reform. Firstly, we must have a system that is open and transparent, as I have already said. Secondly, the system must be an accountable one, and some of the proposals that the government are putting forward remove real accountability. And, thirdly, any system must be credible. One cannot draw any conclusion to the effect that what the government are putting forward in this piece of legislation, the principal points that they are seeking, are in any way credible.
 The electorate of Australia has shown the scepticism and cynicism of politics, mainstream political parties and in particular its politicians. That is something that I think we will all concede is out there very much in the community—cynicism and scepticism of the politics of the politicians and of the political parties. Hence it is no surprise that we see, as a result of the scepticism and the cynicism that exists out there, the rise of other political forces.
Those forces have risen and have emerged to the surface in Australia—one might argue, and I will come to that in a moment, that these forces are now beating a retreat—as a result of the cynicism and the scepticism not of the Electoral Act but of politicians, political parties and politics in general. In that respect, I speak specifically of One Nation. Whilst One Nation reels from the internal ructions that it is currently undergoing, the cynicism and scepticism on which it was built still remain.
Of primary concern in this piece of legislation before us is the thing that will increase the cynicism and the scepticism, and that is the increase in the donation disclosure thresholds. That will do nothing but encourage those people who are out there, who are already disaffected by the political system, by the political parties and by the politics of what is going on to be even more so disaffected. Whatever internal ructions are taking place within the One Nation Party will not in any way dispel the disaffection of those people. 
 The first provision I want to address is the extraordinary attempt to exclude a number of first-time voters—I believe in the order of 80,000. The provision, which I think is under item 11 and other items, will discourage people from participating in our political system by making it almost impossible for those people to enrol and to take part in any election that will be called. It will deny them basically their democratic rights.
The fact of life is that, if you are going to be beaten in an election at any stage, then you have to face up to the fact. Trying to change the circumstances, trying to alter the structural pattern of the potential voters out there, whilst it might have a short-term success will fail in the longer term. Short-term expediency has always been shown to be a failure. It will, undoubtedly, deliver in the short term but will be calamitous in the longer term. There is no doubt that a contrived result, as with malapportionment in the past or with today's principal changes which envisage cutting out some 80,000 first-time electors, only breeds disillusionment and disaffection.
 I think senators would agree that we all want as many people as possible to participate in the political process. Looking specifically at the change that will exclude some 80,000 people who enrol once an election has been announced in that week before the close of the rolls in a traditional period. As I understand the legislation, this will now all have to occur within the space of 24 hours. There is no fairness in that.
 Most young voters do not rush out to enrol for the first time. I have just been through the process where my son turned 18 in January. He is probably more politically aware than most of his other school friends who are in the process of turning 18. Part of his 18th birthday present was a registration card to vote. I think I know where his vote might go on the next occasion, so you don't have to worry about his vote, Senator Ellison. It may interest Senator Ellison to know that, even though that registration card was given to him as part of his birthday present, it still took between three to five days to get him to fill it in and to lodge it at the appropriate place. That is not because of any lack of awareness 
 of the political system or what politics is about; purely and simply it is because that is the nature of the way people are.
This attempt to restrict people's right to register to vote is, indeed, abhorrent. I think the government will regret the great disservice it is doing to so many fine young people in our community in cutting them off in such a clear-cut, severe and nasty manner. There is nothing that the coalition could do to offend young people more. Whilst the coalition may well think that many of these people would not vote for them, that is no reason to deny them their natural right to vote. If the government, as indicated in its second reading speech, is worried about the potential for electoral fraud with these new voters—that someone will rush out and plonk tens of thousands of these people on the roll—let me assure it that, if that were to be the case, it would be found out very quickly indeed.
The second group of people to be affected are those who have changed their address. As I understand it, there are roughly 320,000—and I have heard this repeated time and time again in this debate—who will have the sum total of three days in which to change their registered address. As I think was said by Senator Faulkner in his address on this issue, these people will be voting in electorates they no longer live in—and, of course, that will not be in any way a true reflection of the voting intentions of the people of Australia.
So we will have a distortion—a manufactured distortion—of voting patterns. That, again, leads to cynicism, leads to scepticism and, in the longer term, supports those people who have been disaffected by politics, politicians and political parties. That group of people who have changed their address—and there is a range of them: residents of caravan parks, seasonal workers, university and TAFE students who live away from home, low income earners who change address according to circumstances and work availability—will find that they are disadvantaged by the proposals to cut the rolls much earlier than has been the case under the previous legislation.
The fact remains that this legislation does nothing to assist young voters, first-time voters or those who are changing their place 
 of residence to get a legitimate vote to elect the government of their choice, regardless of whom the current government may think those people will vote for. Going through the second reading speech, you then find—as alluded to in the address by my Senate friend Senator Cooney, and I will try to use his words—`more rigorous and more onerous tests'.
If one looks at the second reading speech, the government talks about `one original form of proof of identity documentation'. How will we know that that is not a fake? There are fake drivers licences, fake birth certificates. So, whilst this measure may well speak with some good intention, it does not address the issue at all. As I understand it, out there in the community, people are buying fake drivers licences and fake birth certificates at will to cover their personal needs.
So what is said in the second reading speech does not take away any potential fraud—and I am not one who has been convinced by the argument that there is a great amount of fraud in this area. If we wanted to be honest about it and wanted a system which was free from any error whatsoever—and not that I would advocate this—we would have to tattoo a number on people's foreheads. That would be the most despicable approach we could take. But if anyone can come up with a system which is completely free of failure, then I will take my hat off to them.
But certainly what the government advocates in no way goes to serve that purpose. All the government seeks to do is alienate, disenchant and disenfranchise a number of people in our community—and for the grubby little political expediency that all those people may not vote for them. So it just wipes everyone out who has the right to vote. There is no justification whatsoever for doing that. Also, of course, it is a slap in the face for the young people of Australia.
I have run out of time for the other issues I was going to talk about. However, I believe that the nub of the issue is really that which my colleague Senator Cooney raised. We are speaking of electoral fraud, we are speaking of scepticism—and the government has done 
 nothing in this legislation to address those issues. The Greenfields organisation is just a further example of the way the government wants to hide the truth from the people. It wants to hide donations by lifting certain limits, and it wants to make it easier for people to flaunt the law—or at least the spirit of the law.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-02-15,"—The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 is an important piece of legislation. It is legislation for which this government has sought to secure passage for some 12 months or so. It was originally aimed at getting this legislation through the parliament prior to the last election. With that in mind, one has to examine the motives behind the bill and the devices that this government has sought to institute through this bill.
As I understand the situation, the problem essentially arose because the government was not able to organise its legislative program with sufficient efficiency to secure the intended designs of the Liberal Party political administration in these matters. If one looks at the detail contained in this bill, one can understand just how fortunate it was that the parliament did not consider these matters before the last election. If you examine the matters that come to the fore in this bill, you will see that in the first instance there is an attempt being made by way of this legislation to essentially introduce a very undemocratic piece of legislation. It has been described in the minority report canvassing these issues as a crassly partisan and cynical approach by government to seek the early closure of the electoral rolls in such a manner as to manipulate and gain a very short-term advantage in what the government believes will be matters to its strength in any election campaign.
This has arisen essentially because in recent times the Liberal Party has expressed considerable concern that other political organisations in the country are able to enrol more people in the electoral cycle, that they have been somehow outclassed in that manner and that the electoral drives that have been conducted by political organisations in this country are perceived by members of the government to be illegitimate. We have seen 
 this sort of argument presented by conservative governments all around the world. They are not happy to see a widespread enrolment of Aboriginal persons. As we see in the United States, the conservative forces there are unhappy about the widespread enrolment of various minority groups in the United States which are perceived to be a threat to the status quo.
Similarly, in this country there is a view being expressed—a long held view—that various groups in our community should not legitimately be on the roll. Conservative forces have the perception that we should not be encouraging people to be citizens of the country, that we should not be encouraging people to participate in the affairs of the country. It is always stated in such an underhand way as to suggest that there have been some irregularities conducted which would delegitimise the spreading of the citizenship entitlements to the electoral system.
The truth of the matter is that the Australian electoral system is internationally regarded as being of very high quality. The petty-minded attitudes that are expressed by some elements in the government about the extent to which persons are enrolled in this country and that citizenship has been developed and that people do participate in the electoral cycle demonstrate yet again the narrowness of the thinking that conservative entities have. I have heard Senator Minchin talk on many occasions about what he sees to be the importance of a voluntary voting system. At the heart of that concern for people like Senator Minchin is the fact that too many people are involved in the political process, that too many people are engaged in a discussion on public affairs and that too many people vote.
It is suggested to us that this means there have to be changes to the electoral system so as to prevent persons from participating in the electoral fortunes of this country. This is a very regressive point of view. It is an attitude that, frankly, demeans the parliament. Instead of encouraging people to participate and to take an interest in community affairs, they are restricting access to the decision making process and what appears to me to be essentially an unsubstantiated case that there has 
 been widespread electoral fraud in this country. It is aimed squarely at delegitimising the democratic processes in this country which from time to time elect people other than Liberals. It is all very well if they elect Liberals, but it is not such a good thing for this government if there are other political points of view represented in this chamber, for instance. We have heard this evening the sorts of views that have been expressed about the need to change the voting system in such a way as to exclude a range of views that might otherwise be represented here.
The other issues of concern here go to the use and the abuse of data that is collected through the Electoral Commission. This is a very important issue. I think the questions of privacy are fundamental to the way in which we all expect governments to treat information. With that in mind, while we support the need to ensure that there is appropriate knowledge of the nature of our electoral system so that the political institutions in this country have a firm grasp of the people that we are trying to represent—and that is contained in measures in this bill which the opposition are supporting—there are other issues which arise about the commercial abuse of privacy.
With that in mind, the opposition feels that the proposed penalties that this government is suggesting in this bill quite clearly are grossly inadequate. We are arguing that there needs to be much more substantial sanction against commercial operations which seek to abuse privacy. There is no substantive argument in this chamber about the commercial advantage that could be taken from the misuse of the electoral system for persons who want to use information contained in electoral rolls to make a quid.
This is no doubt in my mind that there are matters which require further attention, and the opposition's amendments go some way to ensuring that there is a proper sanction against the misuse of electoral data. I think the penalties that Senator Faulkner has proposed of a $110,000 fine for breaches of these confidentiality questions are appropriate and ought attract the support of senators right around this chamber. I trust that is the case, 
 but one never knows in this business and one is never surprised by what occurs here.
There is a very serious matter concerning this bill, and that is the failure of the government to face up to its obligations in regard to appropriate disclosure to protect the democratic ethos in this country, especially seen in the manner in which this government is seeking to increase from $1,500 to $5,000 the threshold for disclosure, which of course would see significant change in the amounts of money that would be required to be disclosed. Of course in that way we know once again in a very narrow, very partisan, very undemocratic and very cynical way this government is seeking to advantage itself by what it sees to be a short-term political advantage. And when we consider on top of that the advantages that come with tax deductibility, it is quite clear that this is, once again, an opportunity for the conservative political parties, who naturally do have an advantage in terms of their relationship with those that have wealth and power in this country and who have the capacity to fund electoral campaigns.
And there is a real concern emerging about the clearly, transparently devious devices that are being pursued by the coalition in regard to its fundraising activities—and I speak here of the Greenfields scam that is being organised in such a way as to ensure that the minimum level of disclosure is reported. I notice that the Australian Electoral Commission has finally taken steps to address these matters. I notice that, of course, there is an appeal mechanism available to the principals of the Greenfields outfit. They have not sought to exercise it yet; one expects they will but, again, one should never be surprised. I hope the Australian Electoral Commission is able to bring before this parliament and before the public detailed information on the way in which these scams have been organised by the Liberal Party to secure advantage for itself in the way in which loans are offered at minimal interest rates and in such a manner as to prevent the identity of the donors of those funds being realised to the public.
I notice in Victoria, where of course I have some interest, that the treasurer of the Liberal 
 Party has done extremely well, and of course has himself personally bankrolled the Liberal Party not so long ago in the loans he was able to secure from the National Australia Bank. That raised some serious issues, particularly given his associations with major events projects in Melbourne. I speak here of Ron Walker, the Liberal Party treasurer. I speak here of the association he has with the casino in Melbourne, and of course I speak here of his association with various international major events promotions, which are clearly aimed at securing very large sums of money.
One has every expectation that the questions being raised when these international events are promoted are linked to the capacity to donate to the Liberal Party, especially with Jeff Kennett obviously working in that way, and he is quite unashamed in his approach. Jeff Kennett in fact has no shame when it comes to discussing these sorts of issues. I trust that the Australian Electoral Commission will be able to get to the bottom of the Greenfields Foundation, and I trust there will be steps taken to prevent these scams operating into the future.
Finally, might I say that this bill contains what I think are some very serious attacks upon human rights, particularly on the rights of prisoners. Nowhere can I find in any discussion of Australian law—and I am not as learned as perhaps Senator Cooney is on these matters; I do appreciate Senator Cooney's strong representations to this chamber on these questions—that the conditions of punishment are part of the penalties that one has inflicted upon one for breaches of the law. So when it comes to the question of voting, I think every senator here is entitled to ask the question: why is it that this government proposes to remove the right to vote for some prisoners—and clearly those who are on very short sentences that happen to be confined in electoral time are prevented from voting—whereas others will still be entitled to vote? I do ask the question about whether this legislation is seeking to undermine Australia's commitment to our obligations under international law in terms of the provisions and protection of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I say to you that 
 this is a bill that clearly is designed to manipulate the short-term advantage to the government.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,1999-02-15,"—I take the opportunity in this adjournment debate to record my condolences over the death of His Majesty King Hussein bin Talal to the people of Jordan and to the members of the Western Australian Jordanian-Australian friendship association, which is led by Mr Jasser Samardali. There is no doubt that King Hussein was an important figure in the politics of the Middle East from the time that he assumed the crown at the age of 17 in 1952, which is quite a long time ago. In fact, his long uninterrupted tenure in the monarchy made him the longest-ruling monarch in the modern world.
King Hussein will be remembered as someone who made an outstanding contribution to world peace and who worked tirelessly and with great courage to bring stability and an end to fighting in the Middle East. For the record of the Senate, I would like to read from the editorial of the West Australian regarding the death of King Hussein in the paper dated 8 February 1999. It said:
King Hussein has been of monumental influence in reducing tensions in the region. Jordan has been for decades an important buffer between Israel and Arab nations such as Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia. He reputedly was the only Arab leader the Israelis could see as a friend.
After the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, he was instrumental in drafting the United Nations Security Council resolution calling on Israel to withdraw from all the Arab lands it occupied in the 1967 war in exchange for peace. The resolution has served as the benchmark for all subsequent peace negotiations.
In 1991, the monarch played a pivotal role in convening the Madrid peace talks and providing an umbrella for Palestinians to negotiate their future as part of a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. 
 After decades of secret contacts with Israeli leaders, King Hussein signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state in 1994. It was opposed by many Palestinians who had made Jordan their home after losing their lands to the Jews. But King Hussein stood his ground and the treaty was a major step towards lasting peace in the Middle East.
In conclusion, I record my respect for such a great man as King Hussein and assure Mr Samardali and the members of the Western Australian Australian-Jordanian friendship society that the memory of King Hussein has been honoured here in the Senate today.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>His Majesty King Hussein bin Talal of Jordan</title>,Adjournment,26,1
