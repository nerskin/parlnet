"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-17,"—by leave—I move:

That:

The provisions of paragraphs (5) to (8) of standing order 111 not apply to the Communications Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008 and the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings.
That, upon its introduction in the Senate, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 have precedence over all other business till determined.
I also table statements of reasons justifying the need for these bills mentioned in paragraph (1) to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statements incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.

The reasons read as follows—

COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS MEASURES) BILL 2008

Purpose of the Bill

The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the BSA) to give the Australian Communications and Media Authority (the ACMA) a discretion to consider late applications for renewals of community broadcasting licences that are made up until the expiry date of the licence. 

Reasons for Urgency

Currently the ACMA has no discretion to accept an application for renewal of a community broadcasting licence after twenty six weeks prior to the licence expiry date, regardless of the circumstances giving rise to the late application. 
There are in excess of 250 Community Broadcasting Licences currently issued by ACMA.  Despite the ACMA monitoring of renewal applications there is a real possibility of late renewal applications being received in the near future.   
There is a moderate to high risk that ACMA could be prevented through legal action from renewing a licence following a late application, even one lodged only a short period outside the 26 week limit.  Such action could be taken by someone wishing to take over the licence from the current holder in order to provide an alternative service, particularly if they had been an applicant in the original licence allocation process. 
If the proposed amendment is not made urgently there is a real possibility of good community broadcasting stations which provide a valuable public service unreasonably losing their licences.  It is the primary purpose of these amendments to avoid a situation where a community broadcaster, providing a valuable public service, could lose its licence as a result of a late application where the broadcaster can show good reasons why that application is late.
SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TRUSTEE BOARD AND OTHER MEASURES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008

Purpose of the Bill

The proposed bill:
makes minor amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 in relation to changes to the earnings base for superannuation contributions to comply with the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 from 1 July 2008;
makes consequential amendments to a range of legislation following the introduction on 1 July 2006 of a single superannuation board to administer the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) and the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan (PSSAP);
makes consequential amendments to the invalidity retirement provisions for employees and office holders contained in a range of legislation following the introduction of the PSSAP;
makes technical amendments to the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the Superannuation Act 1922, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 as a consequence of a new regime for managing legislative instruments provided for under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003; and
repeals the Schedule to the Superannuation Act 1990 which has been obsolete for many years.

Reasons for Urgency

The bill includes provisions which ensure that the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 comply with changes to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 that come into effect on 1 July 2008.  These provisions must therefore be in place before 1 July 2008 or the benefits provided under those Acts will not comply with the requirements of the Superannuation Guarantee framework.
—I want to make some brief comments about the importance of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 taking precedence. As the Deputy Prime Minister has indicated, the government regards this bill as key to delivering on aspects of our election commitments. We set out in detail prior to the previous election our approach on industrial relations. It was a matter well litigated. Despite the fact that some on the other side appear not to have understood this, the Australian people made their views in relation to this legislation and the government’s policy abundantly clear.
The government will proceed with this legislation. We expect this legislation to be passed prior to the Easter break. The Deputy Prime Minister has made it clear that this is a priority for us. It is a matter for the opposition. Is the opposition still slavishly tied to its failed Work Choices agenda or will it accept that the Australian people at the last election voted to abolish Work Choices, voted to remove this legislation and voted for Labor’s policy, which was set out in detail prior to the election? I want to emphasise that this was an issue that was well litigated and well traversed prior to the last election. There is a lot of talk in various quarters about mandates. Even the most cynical political observer would say that the government has a mandate on this issue. This was an issue which formed a key and central aspect of the previous election campaign and the months leading up to it.
I would like to also remind the chamber that prior to the last election the Labor Party released two very detailed policies. One was our Forward with Fairness policy and the second was the implementation plan. The bill that is being introduced into the chamber delivers on the commitments that this government made to the Australian people at the last election, and we look forward to its prompt passage through this chamber.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-03-17,"—by leave—At the outset, I indicate to the Senate that the coalition will not be opposing this motion. In fact, we have been working with the government to progress the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008. But two things need to be made clear here. Firstly, in the draft legislative program for the Senate, it was envisaged that the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 would be in the Senate by now. I appreciate the minister’s comment that there is a degree of urgency in relation to this bill—that is why we are not opposing the motion. But what I would say is that the minister could use her good offices to impress upon her colleagues in the other place that some speed is needed there. When you look at the speakers on this bill in that other place, the majority were government speakers. It was the time taken in the other place by the government that has caused the delay in the bill coming to the Senate. That should be made abundantly clear for the record. We, the coalition opposition in the Senate, stand ready to cooperate as much as we can. But the government has to get its act together in the other place in order to get the bill before us here in the Senate.
The other thing is that as a result of this other legislation has been brought on. The manager of government business and I have been working on the issue to get an appropriate order. I acknowledge that there has been a reordering of business because the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 was one which we have not yet had a chance to take to our party room for consideration. We requested that that be put down the list to give us that opportunity. It is a principle—and this is the second issue I raise today—that we normally allow legislation to pass through the respective processes of all sides of the chamber in order for their respective positions to be determined. We do not oppose the motion that the exemption from the cut-off be applied. But I simply restate the principle that, when bills are brought on, normally an allowance is made so that the respective parties can put them through their processes. In this case, the reason why we have to bring these bills on is because the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 is not yet in the Senate, and I have outlined the reasons for that. We do not oppose the motion. The government can be assured that we will continue to cooperate with them in any reasonable way that we can.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-17,"—by leave—The Democrats also will not oppose this proposal to allow the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 to be exempted from the cut-off. Nonetheless, the reason for the cut-off should be emphasised, and that is to prevent legislation from being rushed through without proper scrutiny. Workplace relations are, of course, immensely important politically. They were pivotal, I think we would all agree, in the last federal election. They are also immensely important in terms of the law and the impact it has on Australians—including the ubiquitous working families. That is a reminder to us all about the dangers of actually rushing through legislation without ensuring proper consideration of it.
I appreciate the new government wants to press home its political advantage and its political win in regard to this issue, but we do need to be careful that in pushing through legislation as quickly as possible and trying to force through the political gain we do not end up with legislation that is not as effective as it would otherwise be—even taking into account whether people agree with the policy aims of the government. I do get nervous when I hear the new government and the new minister, Ms Gillard, making noises very similar to the previous government about how they have got a mandate and they have to push this legislation through, they are not going to agree to any changes except, possibly, for technical amendments and the Senate should just get out of the way and let the legislation through—it does not sound terribly dissimilar.
I understand the political reason for that but let’s not forget that this is not just about politics; it is about what laws the people of Australia end up with. This legislation does not scrap Work Choices; it modifies some of it—it does not even scrap individual statutory agreements. I will not get into debating the legislation, but we will have a lot of spin and a lot of posturing over the next week. I am not naive enough to suggest that should not happen but I think that we do need to at least leave some part of our consciousness cognisant of the need to ensure the legislation is actually effective in a real-world sense in terms of what it achieves, rather than just effective in terms of the immediate political needs of the government.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Consideration of Legislation</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-17,"—by leave—I note Senator Ellison’s comments about the procedure and I thank the opposition for their decision to support this motion and their cooperation in relation to this bill. We look forward to their support and its speedy passage through the chamber.
One comment in response to Senator Bartlett: I appreciate the position which he is putting which, to be fair to him, is consistent with the position he has put regardless of who was in government. I would make the point in relation to mandate that I do not believe anyone in this chamber argues seriously that the former Prime Minister had a mandate to do what he chose to do with Work Choices. I do not believe the Australian people were told the detail of what that legislation would encompass. I suggest, by contrast, that the details of this legislation were included in significant part in Labor’s two election policies on this issue.

"Marshall, Gavin (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)",N/A,2008-03-17,"—It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death, on 14 March 2008, of the Hon. Clyde Robert Cameron AO, a former minister and member of the House of Representatives for the division of Hindmarsh, South Australia, from 1949 to 1980. I call the Leader of the Government in the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. Clyde Robert Cameron AO</title>,Condolences,1,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2008-03-17,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 14 March 2008, of the Honourable Clyde Robert Cameron AO, former federal minister and member for Hindmarsh, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
It was said on the occasion of his retirement from federal politics that Clyde Cameron was not only a giant of the Labor Party and the labour movement but also a giant of the Commonwealth parliament. Today we pay tribute to the life of one of this nation’s great political figures: a shearer who worked his way up to the front bench of the Whitlam government. The ALP and the labour movement were a major part of Clyde Cameron’s life, and over the past 70 years he played an important role in their history and controversies and, in turn, he played a significant role in the history of the nation.
The eldest of four boys, Clyde Robert Cameron was born into a poor family in South Australia in 1913. His father was a shearer, and one of the foundation members of the original Australian Shearers Union, while his mother was the daughter of a wealthy land-owning family.  Clyde left school at 15 to work as a rouseabout and a shearer. He travelled with shearing teams around Australia and New Zealand. However, it was the time of the Great Depression, and Clyde spent much of this period unemployed. When he was working he faced low pay and very tough conditions.
The experience of that struggle affected Clyde Cameron deeply and instilled in him a real class-consciousness and a deep commitment to the labour movement and the ALP as a vehicle for change. He was a true Fabian socialist and, while Australian society and politics changed dramatically over his long lifetime, he always remained committed and resolute in his political philosophy.
Unsurprisingly, Clyde quickly became active in his own union, the AWU, and was a regular stump speaker in Adelaide’s Botanical Park. He got his first full-time union job at the age of 25 when he was elected to the position of an AWU organiser. He was a successful organiser, and only two years later he found himself serving as secretary of the South Australian branch and as federal vice-president of the AWU. In 1946, at the age of 33, he became president of the South Australian branch—then the youngest president in its history.
Under Clyde Cameron, the AWU began a huge recruitment and organising drive that saw its membership more than double, and working conditions in its industry improved considerably by the time he was elected to parliament. A man of very committed democratic values, Clyde was well known for his fight for proper process in the AWU.
At the same time, Clyde was working his way up through the ranks of the Labor Party. From 1946 he served in three separate periods as president of the South Australian branch of the ALP. He was its representative on the ALP federal executive from 1970 to 1972 and was a South Australian delegate to the ALP federal conference from 1948 to 1977. In 1949 Clyde was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Hindmarsh, in the same election that the Chifley Labor government lost power. He served the people of Hindmarsh for the next 31 years, the vast majority in opposition.
Clyde once recalled how, when he was a young rousteabout, he would dream about making speeches in parliament denouncing man’s inhumanity to man. ‘I was so disappointed when I woke up,’ he said, ‘I wished I could go back to sleep again to carry on the dream.’ But when he finally made it into parliament he soon developed a reputation as one of the finest and funniest orators there, as well as being an aggressive political opponent. Clyde Cameron, with all due respect, hated the conservatives and made no attempt to hide it. As I said, unfortunately he spent 28 of his 31 years in parliament in opposition. But he was a leading figure in the federal ALP caucus, he played a major role in many of the political events that shaped the party’s history and he was regarded by many as a controversial figure but certainly one who made a contribution in every way.
Along with being an excellent parliamentarian, Clyde Cameron was a pragmatist. While he never swerved from his political beliefs, he also understood that in order for the ALP to win government it needed to modernise and to broaden its appeal. Clyde’s support for organisational reform was critical in paving the way to Labor’s 1972 election win and he was thereafter known in the party as one of the principal architects of victory.
At the age of 58, Clyde Cameron was appointed minister for labour in the new Whitlam government, a role he had spent his lifetime preparing for. He later, for a period, was also minister for immigration—one of my predecessors. The legacy from his 2½ years as minister for labour is impressive. He was responsible for pushing through the equal pay cases that brought an end to discrimination against women in terms of their pay. Significantly, it was Clyde who appointed Mary Gaudron to prosecute the cases before the arbitration commission. As senators would be aware, Mary Gaudron later went on to become Australia’s first female High Court justice.
Clyde also oversaw the improvement of pay and conditions for the Public Service, which, given some of his stances on the role of public servants, might be surprising. But he did do an awful lot to improve Public Service conditions, including increasing annual leave from three weeks to four, as well as the introduction of paid maternity leave and of flexitime, although he later claimed to have regretted that particular initiative. His other achievements as labour minister included wage indexation and, of course, trade union training. The Trade Union Training College at Albury-Wodonga was named after him, and he made an enormous contribution to the labour cause in that role.
His time as minister, like that of the Whitlam government he served, was marked by controversy. In 1975 he was transferred—I think that is the polite word—to the portfolio of Science and Consumer Affairs, after strongly resisting Whitlam’s attempts to move him out of the Labour and Immigration portfolio. Following the loss of the Whitlam government, he retired to the backbench. He stayed there until he left federal politics in 1980.
In 1982 he was awarded the Order of Australia and in 2006 he was awarded life membership of the Australian Labor Party. Unsurprisingly, Clyde Cameron remained active and outspoken well into his later years. He became an important political historian. He was particularly passionate about the history of the ALP and the period around the 1975 dismissal of the Whitlam government. He wrote several books on Australian political history but he also, importantly, recorded more than 600 hours of conversations with his contemporaries from both sides of politics that are currently stored in the National Library. Clyde Cameron once said, ‘I feel confident that the things that I write will be more important to history than anything that I said in the 31 years I was in parliament.’ Perhaps that is a lesson for us all.
I think history will show that Australian politics lost a rare character the day that Clyde Cameron retired from parliament—the sort of character we do not tend to see in Australian politics these days. He was from the old school of Labor politicians who had worked themselves up from the—in his case, shearing—floors. He became involved in politics at a time when there was a fierce and palpable class divide in this country. He had a very deep passion and empathy for working people. Throughout his work as a shearer, a unionist, a politician and, finally, as a federal minister, Clyde Cameron was always a committed fighter for workers’ rights. Australia’s working class has indeed lost one of its true champions.
Clyde Cameron passed away on 14 March 2008. Aged 95, he was Australia’s oldest former parliamentarian. On behalf of the government, I offer my sincerest condolences to his wife, Doris, his children, Warren, Tania and Noel, and all the grandchildren. Clyde Cameron had a remarkable life. He made an enormous contribution to Australian politics. He will be sorely missed by his family and friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-03-17,"—I rise on behalf of the coalition to support the motion moved by Senator Evans and to extend our sincere sympathies to the family of Clyde Cameron upon his very sad passing on 14 March, last Friday, at the great age of 95. It is particular poignant for me to be doing this, as a fellow South Australian and someone who knew Clyde and greatly admired him and all that he had done for his state, for Australia and for his party. I think it can properly be said that my state of South Australia has indeed lost one of its greatest sons. As Kim Beazley Sr might have said, there is no doubt that Clyde Cameron represented the cream of the working class and certainly not the dregs of the middle class. It was quite a remarkable political career: for someone like Clyde to spend nearly 31 years in parliament representing the one seat, of Hindmarsh, and to spend nearly 28 of those in opposition is extraordinary. To have only three years in government, and a very turbulent three years at that, showed an extraordinary tenacity and commitment to his cause.
I was here at the Australian National University doing economics and law when Clyde and Gough and the rest were in government and it was quite fascinating almost every day to follow the saga of the then Whitlam government in which Clyde Cameron featured so significantly. Many of us thought that many of the things that he was trying to do in the labour portfolio, which might have been good for workers, would end up destroying the economy. Having spent so long in opposition, the government was desperate to try to do everything it could as quickly as possible.
But, as a human being, it was very sad, frankly, that someone like Clyde Cameron could have only three years in government. As I said, he was the member for Hindmarsh for nearly 31 years and we in the Liberal Party in South Australia regarded Hindmarsh as a great Labor stronghold. I must say that one of my proudest achievements as state director of the Liberal Party was the day we won Hindmarsh from Labor in 1993. In an election that was otherwise a disaster for the Liberal Party, we actually managed to take from the Labor Party the seat of Hindmarsh, that great bastion of the Cameron Labor Party.
My connection to the Camerons was formed through not only knowing Clyde but also becoming a good friend of Terry Cameron, who was my counterpart when he was state secretary of the Labor Party while I was state director of the Liberal Party. Terry and I were of course combatants but we actually got on very well behind the scenes, and there are some stories to tell there. As is the way sometimes with the Labor Party, Terry, Clyde’s nephew, fell out with the Labor Party and then sat as an Independent, having been elected to the Legislative Council as a Labor member.
Clyde had the remarkable capacity to have strong friendships across the political divide, and as I say, there was his nephew Terry. One of my most vivid memories was being up at Alexander Downer’s home and seeing Lady Mary Downer, Alexander’s mother, sitting on the sofa with Clyde, having a whale of a time. There was quite an extraordinary bond between Clyde Cameron and Lady Mary Downer. They were the deepest of friends, yet they came from quite different political and other spectrums. It was a measure of the man that that sort of divide meant nothing to him and he formed very strong friendships right across the divide.
I look forward to representing the federal opposition at Clyde Cameron’s funeral on Thursday and also in my role as the senior South Australian Liberal federal member. It will be a time to celebrate a great life, albeit of someone on the opposite side of politics from me. He was someone who made an extraordinary contribution to public life. He had great dedication to his party and his cause and he was a person to be admired by everybody. To his wife, Doris, and to Clyde’s children, I place on record the opposition’s appreciation of Clyde’s long and meritorious public service and we tender our profound sympathy to the family in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. Clyde Robert Cameron AO</title>,Condolences,1,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-17,"—I would like to support this condolence motion on behalf of the Democrats and make some personal comments of my own. This condolence debate does indeed relate to what is literally the passing of an era. Clyde Cameron was the last surviving member of the parliament that was elected in 1949. He had the misfortune to enter the parliament at the very outset of 23 years of unbroken opposition. For those in the ALP who have felt it was fairly tiring being in opposition over the last 11 or so years, Clyde Cameron had it literally twice as bad over a 23-year period before he finally spent just a few years in government as a minister. He did play an important role as minister for labour from 1972 and it is apt in some respects that this week we will be having further significant debates around labour laws, now called workplace relations laws. He also took over the equally important role of minister for immigration. This was an era when the immigration ministry and law were still very much developing. He took over that role after the 1974 election.
In other ways also Clyde Cameron represents the passing of an era. He had many experiences that few of us in this parliament, or indeed few of us in the wider community, have had. Fewer and fewer people have had such direct and visceral experiences of the Great Depression. It is just a phrase that is mentioned with a wave of the hand almost these days and it is easy today not to fully appreciate just how extraordinary the Depression era was, just how incredibly destructive it was for many families and just how enormous the depths of poverty and difficulty were that many people went through. There is no doubt that that experience through the Depression era was a strongly formative experience for Clyde Cameron. I often wonder when I read a little bit about what the Depression era was like—the enormous queues for the unemployed, the more limited support that people received when they were unemployed, the meagre support that families received and the huge areas where unemployed men lived in quarters on their own, travelling from place to place looking for work—how our society would cope if we did experience such depths of economic difficulty again. Of course we all hope that that will never occur. But it was a formative experience for many people including of course Clyde Cameron, and it led, at least in part, to the very strong political feelings he had.
Another historic era in which Clyde Cameron was heavily involved was the split of the Labor Party in the mid-1950s. A couple of people have already mentioned his ability to have friendships across the political divide, despite the fact that he was known as and commented on as being a very strong ‘hater’. Of these friendships that developed over time, the most remarkable, perhaps even more so than the example of Lady Downer, was the one he ended up having with Bob Santamaria, who was very much a pivotal figure on the opposite side of the extremely bitter split in the Labor Party in the mid-1950s.
It is interesting to read some of the things that Clyde Cameron wrote in his eulogy on Bob Santamaria, particularly since he very strongly and stridently disagreed with the views of not just Santamaria but also others on the side of the Catholic Social Movement, or the Movement, as it was known, in the 1950s. Clyde Cameron stated that, whilst he strongly disagreed with Santamaria, he believed that he was ‘honestly wrong’ in the views he held, and that he preferred a person who honestly held their views, even if they were wrong, over somebody who held views that he agreed with but who held them ‘dishonestly’ because they felt it would favour their advancement. From what I have read in the past and over the last few days, the part of his character that sticks out most strongly is that commitment to intellectual honesty, to what he believed was right rather than just how the political winds were blowing.
It is an interesting exercise, obviously completely hypothetical, to ponder how things might have panned out if that huge split had not happened in the 1950s. It is a reminder that political and ideological fault lines can shift over time—so much so that, in the final decade or so of Clyde Cameron’s life, many of the concerns that he expressed were very similar to those expressed by those on the opposite side of the split in the 1950s. I particularly note a letter he wrote to the newsletter of the National Civic Council in 2001 praising them for publishing a special edition ‘against economic rationalists who favoured the globalisation of corporate capitalism’ and who were supportive of foreign multinationals shifting Australian industries to other areas with cheap labour costs. He also had strong concerns about the ‘globalisation of corporate power’, to use his words, which aligned with the views of Bob Santamaria, who voiced similar concerns for a long period of time. Indeed, he went so far as to describe Santamaria upon his death as an idol to those who held on to their belief in the traditional principles of the Labor Party.
As someone outside of the Labor Party I am not passing comment on all the different battles and perspectives going back over so many fascinating decades, although I do have some insight from the outside of that split in the fifties; I simply want to highlight the enormous spectrum of events that Clyde Cameron’s life encompassed and the strength of his views over such a long period of time. It is, I think, worth while noting these things, not just as a way of describing milestones in certain people’s lives or various things they said at various times but also as a way of learning from their lives. For me that is part and parcel of the importance of condolence motions. The benefit of looking back at a person’s life is seeing what lessons we can learn from it, what things we can apply to the modern era.
Whilst many things have changed dramatically since Clyde Cameron’s era, many of the lessons are still the same—such as the strong concern he had, as he wrote:
… over the way politics have deteriorated to a position that is now a contest between the rich and the poor; the privileged and the underprivileged; the exploiters and the exploited; the tax avoiders and the taxpayers; the greedy and the needy; the buyers of labour and the sellers of labour, with the odds always stacked up in favour of the first party …
It is fairly clear from his words that Clyde Cameron’s sympathies lay very much with the second party in each of those examples: the underprivileged, the exploited, the needy, those who are in most need of support. That was a constant strand throughout Clyde Cameron’s life, and I think is important to look at that consistency. Political currents shift over time, but maintaining that consistency of principle and intellectual honesty is an important lesson for all of us when we look back on what was an extraordinary life, including but not limited to a very significant period of 31 years in the federal parliament.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2008-03-17,"—I rise on behalf of the National Party to acknowledge the extraordinary contribution to public life made by Clyde Cameron. Mr Cameron, a cabinet minister in the Whitlam government and a member of parliament from 1949 to 1980, died at his Adelaide home at the age of 95. That was 31 years in parliament, 23 or so of which were in opposition—I do not think anyone would envy that. Obviously, this was a man of incredible capacity, passion and commitment. He was the son of a Scottish shearer and a shearer himself before entering the union movement, where he was the most influential South Australian Labor powerbroker. During his time in politics, he achieved the position of Minister for Labour and Immigration. Mr Cameron won the West Adelaide seat of Hindmarsh in 1949 and retained it through 13 consecutive elections before retiring. During his 31 years in parliament, Clyde Cameron, as I said, spent 23 years or so in opposition. To continue to make an impact on politics throughout that time is, I think, the envy of the people who find themselves on this side of the chamber.
Clyde Cameron was a legend amongst the true believers of Labor politics. He left school at the age of 14, on the eve of the Great Depression. He found work in the shearing sheds across south-east Australia and in New Zealand. Someone leaving school at the age of 14 and later becoming a federal minister is, I think, just an absolutely extraordinary achievement. He lived through two world wars and deployments in Korea, what was then Malaya and Vietnam. These were of course the subject of significant discussions in parliament and public life, and history records that he made an incredible contribution to those debates.
He worked as a shearer and in the shearing industry through the Great Depression. That time was obviously fundamental in cementing Clyde Cameron’s beliefs in the deficiencies of capitalism and his path towards a leading role within the Australian Workers Union. This prominence led to Clyde Cameron being acknowledged as the most influential figure in the South Australian Labor Party and ultimately being elected to the House of Representatives in 1949.
He achieved striking advances in the areas of wage justice and trade union reform during his 2½ years in charge of industrial relations in the Whitlam cabinet. He pushed through equal pay for women in 1973 followed by an increase in the female minimum wage a year later, and he won better pay and conditions for Commonwealth public servants, knowing their gains would flow on to the private sector.
Clyde Cameron was also known to be a hard man, and he fell out with many ALP figures, including Gough Whitlam. I read a description that said the softest part of Clyde Cameron was, in fact, his teeth. I can understand that a man who had come through so much, and because of his upbringing, would have some absolutely fundamental beliefs and that whether he was arguing with the Prime Minister of the time or anybody he would stick to those beliefs. That character of a man has to be admired by the wider Australian community.
He was also a very compassionate man and believed passionately in building the social fabric of Australia. Clearly Clyde Cameron was a man who brought to this place a series of priorities—as many of us like to do—and those priorities were for those in the most need. It was the most needy in the community that he spent his time focusing on.
Clyde Cameron was most likely not the best friend of many of the Nationals or Country Party members and voters, certainly at that time.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-03-17,"—I rise to speak very briefly on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008. My colleague Senator Coonan is going to make some comments—
—No, I’m on super.
—This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to provide the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, the discretion to consider late applications for renewals of community broadcasting licences up to the expiry date of the licence. Currently ACMA has no discretion to consider late applications for the renewal of community broadcasting licences, regardless of the circumstances that have given rise to the late application. This is a measured and valuable amendment. Having personally campaigned for the continued operation of Goldfields 99.1 FM community radio station in Maryborough I am fully aware of the importance of the community radio sector. Indeed, the former government greatly valued the community radio sector, overseeing its expansion around Australia. As this bill was originally produced by the previous Howard government, the opposition has no objection to it.
I will speak briefly in relation to community radio, which is one of those great successes Australia wide. They are invariably run by people who are doing it without any remuneration—working long hours and providing a fantastic service, particularly in country areas such as Maryborough where there can be a localised radio service that is talking the talk that the locals talk. The opposition does not oppose the bill.",SENATE,<title>COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MISCELLANEOUS MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-03-17,"—I thank members for their contributions to the debate on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2008, a valuable piece of legislation. It may even be referred to as the ‘Ronaldson memorial amendment’. I know that Senator Ronaldson has championed this case over a number of years. Previously, the coalition has been a good advocate of community broadcasting and opposition to this bill would have been a surprise. We welcome your contribution and support. I thank all my colleagues for their contributions.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-17,"—We are dealing with the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 and this is the second reading debate for that bill. The purpose of the bill is make amendments to a raft of legislation as a consequence of legislative changes introduced by the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Act 2006. These measures are largely technical, and updating changes are overdue. There are a number of schedules to the act. In brief, the changes consolidate the government’s arrangements for civilian public sector employees, including funds managed through the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and controlled by its board, funds managed through the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and controlled by its board and funds managed through the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme accumulation plan and controlled by the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme board. I note that the Bills Digest has said that these changes are long overdue. They replicate in large part the changes announced in a previous bill of this name but which did not get through parliament before the election. The 2006 act abolished the CSS board and incorporated the trusteeship of the CSS into the PSS board, which also governs the PSSap. Additionally, the act increased the number of directors on the PSS board from two to seven. The new single board was renamed the Australian Reward Investment Alliance.
Schedule 1 of this bill contains the main amendments, with proposed legislative changes for 30 acts. It ensures that ARIA—the Australian Reward Investment Alliance—is the appropriate body to issue an invalidity certificate for members of various Commonwealth bodies when employees are to be retired on grounds of mental or physical incapacity. Schedule 2 contains technical amendments relating to legislative instruments that apply to five acts. Schedule 3 repeals subsections 4(1) and 4(2) in schedule 3 of the Superannuation Act 1990 concerning the original trust deed. Schedule 4 proposes amendments governing the CSS and the payment of the productivity benefit to Commonwealth public servants to conform with the requirements to the Superannuation (Guarantee) Administration Act 1992. These amendments will commence upon royal assent.
The ComSuper action committee has highlighted the persisting inequity in preventing Public Service superannuants on defined benefit superannuation schemes from accessing superannuation death benefits. I have circulated an amendment to this bill which deals with that issue and I will continue to pursue the matter that has been of some concern in every superannuation bill for some years.
With the concept of streamlining and harmonisation in mind, I wonder how ARIA, as a new single board structure, is going to manage the legal discrepancies and inconsistencies that currently exist between each fund. One such inconsistency is the varied treatment of interdependency and de facto partnership rights for each fund. Are board members able to put their PSSap hats on and say, ‘That is discrimination,’ and then put their CSS or PSS hats on and say, ‘This fund member is homosexual; he must not receive the same superannuation rights as his heterosexual counterpart’? The fact is that, under the PSSap provisions, there is no or limited discrimination, whereas under the PSS and CSS funds there is blatant discrimination.
Discrepancies such as these do exist between each fund. By way of example, consider the ridiculous state of affairs that exists for public sector employees who are members of the PSSap, which is the new fund. According to correspondence received from then Minister Minchin last year, all new employees who commenced employment on or after 1 July 2005 who were members of the scheme and in a same-sex partnership would be entitled to death benefits. But no retrospective application exists for the PSSap, so those rules do not apply to CSS and PSS members. To withhold retrospective and comprehensive application of interdependency and de facto relationship rights to all public sector employees is by definition discriminatory. What is more, the very extensive Same-sex: same entitlements report from the national inquiry into discrimination against people in same-sex relationships regarding financial and work related entitlements and benefits issued by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission last year outlines in great detail where that discrimination applies. In effect, the then minister was asserting that the only legitimate interdependent relationships that exist in law at present are those of new members who began employment on or after 1 July 2005. For other individuals in same-sex interdependency relationship, under these three schemes their partnership arrangements are still illegitimate with respect to death benefits.
There is no ethical, legal or financial reason for one group of public sector employees to be treated differently to another on the basis of differing partnership arrangements under superannuation law. There is no policy reason and there is certainly no ethical or moral grounds for it, so what remains is for the political will to change the situation.
So this is the stimulus for my amendment to this bill—to yet again seek to rectify a gross inequality that the previous government and this government committed themselves to address. For many years now the Democrats have sought in vain to amend superannuation legislation to harmonise the treatment of the variety of partnerships that exist in Australia. On this point, then Prime Minister Howard apparently agreed with us when he stated on radio:
… I am strongly in favour – as my Government has demonstrated – strongly in favour of removing any property and other discrimination that exists against people who have same-sex relationships.
Unfortunately, those turned out to be hollow words. I will remind you of the coalition Attorney-General’s correspondence to the coalition Prime Minister which was released. These words reinforced this position. The coalition Attorney-General said:
The Australian Government is committed to the elimination of discrimination and condemns discrimination in all its forms … The Government’s commitment to the elimination of discrimination includes discrimination on the basis of an interdependent relationship. Such a relationship is considered to exist where there is a close personal relationship between two people who live together, where one or both provides for the financial, domestic and personal support of the other, and would include a same-sex relationship—
because, quite properly, he recognises that there are many relationships apart from same-sex relationships where interdependency justifies the removal of discrimination.
The coalition Prime Minister agreed with us, therefore, in terms of our broad thrust as Democrats, and so did the coalition Attorney-General. The Labor Prime Minister agrees with us. The Labor Prime Minister issued a letter, which I have a copy of, as federal Labor leader and member for Griffith, in which he said ‘The Labor Party is committed to equality for gay men, lesbians and same-sex couples and, if elected, will remove provisions which discriminate on the basis of sexuality.’ That is Labor Party policy, stated again and again in different forums in different circumstances. That is Labor Party policy. So it is coalition policy and they did nothing material about it, and it is Labor Party policy and they are doing nothing about it.
If historically the coalition employed varied excuses such as technical difficulty and cost to revenue in an attempt to sidestep what was supposed to be a coalition government priority, if the coalition historically argued that the expense of extending interdependent and same-sex relationship death benefits to defined benefit superannuation was the overriding issue—if they really did that, because there is a conflict within their own ranks on this matter—we then have to look at the issue of cost. I actually accept that the majority of coalition members want to see this situation ended. I accept that the majority of coalition members want to see unjust discrimination against same-sex couples done away with. I think that is accurate, and I accept the same applies to the Labor Party.
So why is it complex, or what are the reasons for there still being a delay? Government actuarial assessments estimated—and this was information we got from Senate estimates last year—the annual budget cash cost of extending death benefits to interdependent relationships and same-sex couples in defined benefit schemes to be $10 million. That is all—$10 million annually. So as a matter of removing unjustified discrimination it is obviously an affordable measure. The projected forward costing has been assessed at $2 billion. This represents a two per cent actuarially estimated increase in the total public sector unfunded superannuation liability stretching forward for decades. The costing assumes extending death benefits to interdependency relationships—those are not same-sex relationships—would cost $1 billion, with the residual $1 billion applying to same-sex couples. But the annual budget cash cost would be about $10 million, so extending superannuation death benefits to Commonwealth defined benefit superannuation schemes is affordable.
I assure the minister that we will continue to press this issue with this government, as we did with the previous government. The question to the minister is: is the Labor government going to adopt a go-slow on this matter, or is it going to give this Senate, this parliament and the people of Australia a deadline by which it will introduce the changes that it has forecast? Bear in mind the coalition have stated publicly and continually that they support ending the discrimination, so there is no argument on the policy. What is in question here is when and how. I think it is a reasonable proposition for this Senate to ask the Labor government to come clean. You will present your proposals by when—the May budget, next sitting? But so far the question has been dodged and I think what the government is going to do needs to be on the table: what it can afford to do, what it believes it can do and the time line over which that will happen.
Given their previous commitment, what the coalition must not do, of course, is continue to look as if they are an accomplice to a go-slow. The coalition I think needs to stand up and say to the Labor government, both in the Senate and in the House: ‘Come clean. When are you going to fix this problem?’ You now have this HREOC report and the question is not what you are going to do about it, because you have said you are going to fix it, but when you are going to fix it. I will put to the minister again for the record the main question he must answer if he rejects the very well crafted amendment that I have circulated, which is: when will you act to rectify this deplorable and highly inconsistent treatment of superannuation for de facto and interdependent partnerships?
Of course, it is perfectly reasonable for some senators to smile when I say it is a very well crafted amendment, but I actually took highly respected professional advice from people who would normally give advice in these matters, and the amendment is well crafted and is, in my view, very suitable for the purposes for which it has been designed. This is not something that I and a novice have knocked together; this is something that I and some very serious people have constructed.
—You’re not a novice, Senator Murray!
—I said, ‘I and a novice’! I take the interjection. But I am serious about this matter because it is a matter, I think, of shame that we continue with this discrimination. So, with those remarks, I will conclude that the Australian Democrats do support the bill but seek to have it amended.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TRUSTEE BOARD AND OTHER MEASURES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-03-17,"—I simply indicate that the opposition also supports the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008. This bill is, with the exception of some minor technical matters, identical with the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007, which had been passed by the House of Representatives and introduced into the Senate prior to the last federal election.
The bill makes amendments to a range of legislation as a consequence of the introduction on 1 July 2005 of the Public Sector Superannuation accumulation plan; the establishment on 1 July 2006 of a single superannuation board named the Australian Reward Investment Alliance to administer the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation accumulation plan; the introduction of the new regime for managing legislative instruments provided for under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003; and the requirement to use ordinary time earnings to calculate employer superannuation guarantee obligations from 1 July 2008.
Although I am sure Senator Sherry would not concede it, the former government was the great reform government in Australian history when it came to superannuation policy. This legislation is not one of the headline reform bills, but it is essentially a technical and consequential piece of legislation which complemented and helped to bring to completion the suite of superannuation reforms pioneered by the former government. For that reason the opposition regard this as uncontroversial and it will have our support.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TRUSTEE BOARD AND OTHER MEASURES) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2008-03-17,"—Thank you to the speakers who participated in the debate. The main purpose of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 is to update a range of legislation as a consequence of other legislative changes. From 1 July 2008, employers will be required to use what are known as ‘ordinary time earnings’ when calculating their superannuation guarantee obligations in respect of an employee in all cases.
The bill will amend the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 to enable minimum benefits paid under these acts to comply with this new requirement. The bill amends a number of Commonwealth acts as a consequence of the establishment of the Public Sector Superannuation accumulation plan, commonly known as the PSSap. It was established on 1 July 2005 and replaced the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, or the PSS, which was a defined benefit fund, as the main superannuation scheme for new Australian government employees. The PSSap is an accumulation fund.
In addition, the bill amends a number of Commonwealth acts to reflect the consolidation of governance arrangements for the three major superannuation schemes for Australian government employees: the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the PSS and the PSSap. Since 1 July 2006, the Australian Reward Investment Alliance, commonly known as ARIA, has been the trustee of these three schemes. The bill also includes a number of other consequential and technical amendments. We do not regard the bill as controversial. It was a bill from the previous government which I understand passed the House of Representatives but did not pass the Senate, and we had indicated our support at the time.
I will give a quick response to Senator Brandis’s claim about the Liberal Party being the great party of reform in superannuation—although he did acknowledge that I would not accept it, and obviously I will not. I will not use this opportunity to go into an extensive—
—Because you can’t.
—Well, Senator Abetz, if you want me to take up the challenge! I will not be, except to indicate this: in 1987 it was the far-sighted Hawke-Keating Labor government that moved to introduce compulsory superannuation for all of those Australian employees who did not have it, subject to a minimum of about $450 per month in earnings. At that time, that covered approximately the low mid-80s percentage of the workforce, which was up from the low mid-40s prior to the introduction of three per cent compulsory superannuation. It was a great landmark achievement of the former Labor government, and it was done essentially to confer fairness on those employees—overwhelmingly casual, part-time and female employees in industries such as construction, retail, transport and hospitality—who had no superannuation. That was vehemently opposed by the Liberal opposition at the time
Then, of course, the next great reform was the extension of the contribution from three per cent to nine per cent, phased in by 1 July 2002. Again, I note the previous Liberal government, when in opposition at that time, vehemently opposed the contribution extension of three per cent to nine per cent over time. So we are proud of our record in superannuation, and we would argue to be the party of great reform.
Coming to the amendments that will moved by Senator Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I am not sure whether Senator Murray has had any contact or communication with the various organisations who have been lobbying to make amendment to public sector superannuation funds in respect of same-sex couples recently. I had a meeting with one group approximately four or five weeks ago. What I can say about same-sex couple amendments to public sector superannuation is this, Senator Murray: yes, we gave a commitment in the election. We gave that commitment: I was the person who gave the commitment. We have given commitments for a number of years, and we have moved and supported amendments in this place on a number of occasions. An announcement as to the legislative process to deal with the issue will be made shortly. There will be no attempt to go slow on this issue. I understand the community groups involved in lobbying know that the issue is being progressed, so there will be an announcement shortly. As to when the legislation comes in here—because it will go to some other matters in terms of same-sex superannuation—it will depend on the timetabling of the announcement. The timetabling for it to be introduced to the parliament will have to fit into the schedule. I believe I can confidently say that—best efforts—it will be delivered. An announcement will be made shortly, Senator Murray. I cannot give you the exact date, for the reasons I have outlined. I do not do not know when the announcement of the formal details will be made and I do not know when that will fit in with the legislative time frame. I would be absolutely taken aback, Senator Murray, if this matter was not resolved legislatively by the end of this calendar year. I really would be taken aback.
With those few comments, I thank the speakers for their contribution and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2008-03-17,"—When the debate was interrupted, I was talking about the contributions the Howard government had made to various areas of services provided to Indigenous people. I had just finished talking about health. I did want to say that, in addition to the health programs, the Howard government made enormous contributions, for example, to housing for Indigenous people. The expansion of the Australian Remote Indigenous Accommodation Program, to replace the Community Housing and Infrastructure Program previously managed by ATSIC, was one of the great successes of the Howard government. It put in $293.6 million in additional expenditure for Indigenous housing in the budget of last year. I think that is a major point to make: that the Howard government had been concerned to improve the housing of Indigenous people in this country.
We also paid a lot of attention to creating circumstances in which Indigenous people could be economically independent, not only in terms of providing assistance with conventional education, but also in job skill education. For example, $234.2 million was included in last year’s budget for programs such as the Better Connections workshops, which were organised by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. Thirty of these workshops were held every year in places such as Darwin, Kununurra and Alice Springs, helping local Indigenous people look at innovative recruitment, employment and retention strategies to increase the workforce participation of unemployed people—particularly Indigenous people. We had the STEP—or Structured Training and Employment Projects—which covered a variety of specialised programs including the Tribal Warrior program, which received funding through a unique employment program in which 35 Indigenous job seekers sailed aboard a sailing ship called the Tribal Warrior and thereby gained a lot of confidence in handling situations, making them able to more effectively go out and seek jobs. There was an intensive training and work experience program for aged-care workers, where the training program was condensed from the usual three years to nine months. Twenty-nine Indigenous job seekers graduated from this course last year.
The Howard government also spent something like $104.8 million on supporting the preservation of Aboriginal culture, through programs such as the National Indigenous Television funding, which had funding of some $50 million and was launched in Sydney last year; the Indigenous Remote Radio Replacement project, which was provided over $3.3 million over three years to replace ageing and unreliable radio infrastructures; and the Digitisation of Indigenous Cultural Resources program, in which $10.2 million was provided to complete the task of protecting the most at-risk and fragile deteriorating parts of the collection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander work in the museums of Australia.
In conclusion, it is apparent from what I have said that the Howard government had many programs addressing Indigenous disadvantage at a micro level. There is still much to do, but a great deal has been achieved. The Howard government has a very proud record of contributing to and supporting Indigenous people of Australia in many areas, including health, education, housing and preservation of Indigenous culture.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,6,1,speech
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2008-03-17,"—In speaking in the debate on the address-in-reply, I would like to take the opportunity to place on the record the Howard government’s contribution to the Illawarra and contrast this with Labor’s neglect and contempt for the area. From 1996 to 2007, the Howard government delivered approximately $2.3 billion in grants and funding for the Illawarra seats of Throsby and Cunningham. This specific funding to the Illawarra area did not include benefits paid—for example, through Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, pensions, HECS or tax cuts. I considered those benefits to be basic and routine spending available to constituents, not targeted grants and funding specific for the Illawarra. Had I included them, the funding would have run into billions more.
As a result of the Howard government’s responsible economic management, Australia was placed in a much stronger economic position than when the coalition took over in 1996. At that time, the coalition faced a $96 billion debt, record unemployment and high interest rates, just to name a few of the key economic challenges they faced. In 1996, the unemployment level in Throsby was 12 per cent and in Cunningham it was 11 per cent. In 2007, the unemployment levels had fallen to 7.6 per cent in Throsby and 7.9 per cent in Cunningham. Whilst higher than the national level, it still represented a notable shift downwards and thousands more people in jobs. Because of the strong economic management over the 11 years of the Howard government, Throsby, Cunningham and many other electorates around Australia were able to share in funding allocations under many programs.
On 14 November 2007, I launched a website called www.illawarrabillions.com. On the website I listed all the organisations that had received grants or funding in Throsby and Cunningham. The information provided on this website demonstrated clearly how the Howard government had consistently, over its 11 years in power, helped the region in so many different ways, but, most importantly, how the Howard government directly assisted many Illawarra community organisations. In particular, the Howard government provided substantial funding to Wollongong and Shellharbour city councils to assist them to provide services to the Illawarra. For example, in 2007-08 these councils would receive close to $17 million in federal government general purpose and road grants. Indeed, our Labor opponents constantly sought to portray the coalition as only supporting coalition seats. The funding to the Illawarra seats demonstrates that this is plainly wrong. This website assisted in clarifying misconceptions within the community about funding sources peddled by our opponents.
Since establishing my electorate office in Wollongong in October 2005, I have been pleased to announce many Howard government programs and initiatives. In my maiden speech, I said that I would be establishing my electorate office in Wollongong to give the people of the Illawarra an alternative and effective voice in government. I am pleased to say that I was able to do this. The Howard government did deliver to the Illawarra in many ways. These included the $5 million Port Kembla Industry Facilitation Fund, through which support was given to local industries to foster economic and job growth in the region following closure of the tin plate mill; $9 million given to government schools and $1.6 million to non-government schools under the Investing in Our Schools Program; small community water grants or small equipment grants for local groups; $1.3 million in Regional Partnerships funding for the Southern Gateway Tourist Centre at Bulli Tops; $19.6 million for the Australian Technical College in the Illawarra; and over $1.1 million towards the Illawarra-Shoalhaven apprenticeship program since 2004. This is just to name a few.
The Howard government has also strongly supported the University of Wollongong, which has played, and will continue to play, a major role in the development of the Illawarra. I have very much enjoyed visiting some of the organisations and individuals that the Howard government was able to assist and to see firsthand the enormous contribution these organisations make to the life and social fabric of the great Illawarra region. Regrettably, many of these funding opportunities did not receive attention from the local media. Consequently, organisations had not been aware of funding opportunities and had not applied. In short, the $2.3 billion in grants and funding was nevertheless a very significant financial contribution delivered by the Howard government to the Illawarra.
They say imitation is the best form of flattery. One week after I launched www.illawarrabillions.com, the member for Cunningham announced that, under Labor’s regional development policy, the federal budget would identify how much is spent in each region on roads, industry, health, education, social security, regional development, environment and communications. What Labor are doing is including all the basic and routine spending that is and should be available to constituents, not just the targeted grants and funding specific for the Illawarra. Of course, this will overwhelmingly inflate the total. Why? Because Labor in the Illawarra will not want to compare apples with apples. They will go out there and ramble on about how much money the Illawarra will receive and say that this exceeds what the coalition gave. Of course, if you include all the basic and routine spending, you will get an inflated figure.
The real reason Labor will do this, I envisage, is to not deliver any targeted grants and specific funding to the Illawarra. Areas like the Illawarra are traditionally seen as Labor’s heartland. One only has to look at the recent scandals in Wollongong involving the Labor Party to see the contempt with which Labor has held the area. My challenge to state and federal Labor members in the Illawarra is do something worth while for the Illawarra. I invite Labor to look at what the Howard government has delivered in the Illawarra and yes—go ahead, by all means—better it. It is time that you stopped taking your so-called heartland for granted and did something very worth while for the area.
So let us look at some of the announcements made by Labor members in the Illawarra. A heading in the Illawarra Mercury of 27 November 2007 read ‘Promised funding on way, say MPs’ and there was a smaller heading ‘Members vow swift delivery on promises’. Let me just mention two promises. The member for Cunningham promised that a pre-feasibility study would get underway for the Maldon to Dombarton rail link and the key players would start work within a week. Has this happened? Not to my knowledge. Then there was the MRI machine for Wollongong Hospital. In September last year, I announced Medicare funding for a new MRI service at Wollongong Hospital. Local Labor MPs promised to deliver this crucial service and yet the people of Wollongong are still waiting.
If this is a swift pace, I would hate to see snail pace. What does this tell us? It tells us that Labor are full of rhetoric. Since my office opening in October 2005, all the Labor Party have done is taken cheap pot shots and focused on issues such as the telephone box outside Wollongong TAFE—and I trust, Senator Conroy, now you are the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, that you will look into this—and the removal of a payphone at Otford. There is another issue for you, Senator Conroy. There are also the embellished claims of a lack of Medicare services in Warrawong at a time when bulk-billing was at 95 per cent.
When Labor get into government, they cannot even deliver on a simple procedure of sorting out paperwork with their state Labor colleagues for an MRI machine that is already at the hospital but just needs to be made operational. It is a simple task. Their failure to deliver on this simple task, regrettably, does not augur well for the citizens of the Illawarra. The coalition delivered $2.3 billion; Labor are struggling with the basics.
One thing Labor have committed to is scrapping the highly successful Investing in Our Schools Program. This program was praised by school communities because it went directly to them and funded the small-scale infrastructure and equipment projects and upgrades which were otherwise neglected. These were projects such as, regrettably, toilet blocks, computer rooms, air conditioning and playground equipment. What this program did was to uncover the state Labor government’s neglect of our school system through highlighting their disregard for these crucial facilities. If those opposite are serious about education, they could start by ensuring basic standards are maintained in schools. For example, there is a small, 50-year-old school in the Illawarra where the toilets have not been upgraded at all since it was built. It is little wonder that Labor have decided to scrap this program—because it exposes state Labor’s appalling neglect.
Labor’s disregard extends to other crucial areas of government service delivery. Labor have shown utter contempt for the people of the Illawarra by using Warrawong as a test case in their plans to merge Centrelink and Medicare offices Australia wide. Labor cleverly painted this plan as a long-fought victory to deliver an additional Medicare office for Warrawong residents. However, Labor were never able to deliver a Medicare office, only a plan to merge a Medicare office with an already existing Centrelink office.
As I elicited recently in questioning in estimates hearings, it is Centrelink employees who will suffer under this plan, with some 2,000 employees set to lose their jobs Australia wide. This startling admission by Labor will no doubt result in reduced services and longer queues forced upon an already struggling demographic. This will happen not only in Warrawong but across Australia.
Labor talk about new leadership but all they have is old plans for government service delivery. We need look no further than Labor’s record at the state level as the taxpayers in my home state of New South Wales know all too well. The basic statistics highlight Labor’s ineptitude. New South Wales is on top of the recent GST windfall and yet is borrowing to the tune of $6 billion. Reckless financial management appears systemic to Labor governments Australia wide despite the states receiving almost $40 billion of GST revenue in 2006-07—expected to grow to $46.6 billion by 2009-10.
While the Howard government was able to produce an $11 billion fiscal surplus, the states are running a combined fiscal deficit of $6 billion. Last year, the New South Wales government ran a $2.4 billion fiscal deficit and a $3 billion cash deficit. While residents of New South Wales are forced to cut back spending when faced with recent interest rate rises, the New South Wales government cannot comprehend these simple economic realities, with spending outstripping revenue over the last five years.
Growth in the New South Wales economy at less than two per cent is the lowest of any state across Australia. New South Wales is lagging behind the other states and is far from being the engine room of the Australian economy that it once was. I highlight this case because the Australian people need to look beyond Labor’s recent attempts to advance their economic credentials. Recent history points to a party and style of management which is preventing New South Wales and Australia from realising its full potential.

You said that you will take any opportunity you can to reinforce the concerns. Can the minister indicate whether the Prime Minister will be specifically reinforcing those concerns when he visits and meets with President Hu Jintao in the next couple of weeks? Can the minister also advise the Senate whether, as reported, it is the case that protestors against the government in Tibet can be executed for that offence?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Tibet</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2008-03-17,"—I thank Senator Payne for the question and acknowledge her long interest in these issues. The Australian government, along with everyone in the Senate, greatly regrets the violence and the loss of life in Tibet and neighbouring areas. The Prime Minister has urged all parties to show restraint, and I notice that the US government has done similarly. We made our position very clear, and we will continue to take any opportunities that we can to reinforce those points, as Senator Payne intimated.
While Australia recognises China’s sovereignty over Tibet, we remain very concerned about the human rights situation there. Those concerns about human rights in Tibet have been raised with the Chinese government and the Australian charge d’affaires in Beijing raised our concerns directly with the Chinese government over the weekend. We also raise these concerns through the human rights dialogue. We urge China to take this opportunity to implement policies which allow greater freedoms of religion, expression and association in an endeavour to create an environment of greater respect and tolerance. In response to these issues, we have also recently updated Australia’s travel advice, which encourages Australians to reconsider their need to travel to Lhasa at this time and to exercise a high degree of caution in the areas affected by the unrest.
In terms of the specifics—through you, Mr President, to Senator Payne—I do not have a reliable update on the numbers who may have been killed or injured. The best that I have at the moment is what you would have heard in the media. I am happy to see if we have anything more reliable from official sources, but at this stage I cannot provide you with anything beyond what has been covered in the media, where there seems to be quite a variance, as always, in these things. But the bottom line is that the violence and loss of life are greatly regrettable. We would urge all parties to show restraint and hope that peace and order are restored as quickly as possible.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Tibet</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2008-03-17,"—I thank Senator Payne for the supplementary question. As I indicated, the Prime Minister made it clear this morning in his press conference that he will take all appropriate opportunities to reinforce our concern and urge China to show restraint. No doubt he will do that as the opportunities arise in his discussions with the Chinese government. I am not aware of the particular laws regarding execution for protester engagement. Clearly, there is serious concern about the violence that is occurring there currently.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-03-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Chris Evans) and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Senators Ronaldson and McGauran today relating to the Transport Workers Union.
In particular I would point out that Senator Conroy would have us believe that the withdrawal this morning of Mr Tony Sheldon from a position on the Transport Commission was some accident—it just happened to occur last night. It was totally unrelated to the Sunday program yesterday. It was a pure coincidence that he took his name off last night after the Sunday program aired yesterday morning. Senator Conroy, you must believe in the tooth fairy, I suspect, if you believe that story. It is simply not true.
I want to go through a number matters in relation to this. I want to start by saying that this government got here on the basis of openness and transparency. In 110 days we have seen none of that at all—not one piece of it. We have seen the Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, talk about openness and transparency and his desire to address the issue of political donations. He refused last week to accept a motion supported by everyone else in this chamber. Part of that was to address the appalling revelation we had yesterday morning about the activities of the Transport Workers Union. This was a slush fund for the ALP, taken by the ALP with no questions asked and knowing full well that it would never be disclosed to where it should have been disclosed. Have we heard a word from the Prime Minister in relation to this? Have we heard the Prime Minister say, ‘I will repay that money to the TWU’? No, we have not. What Mr Rudd has said is, ‘I’m prepared to accept slush funds from the TWU, but any other donations are going to be subject to some new rules.’ Let us see whether Mr Rudd is serious about this, and let us see him support the coalition, the Greens, Family First and the Democrats in having this matter addressed by the joint standing committee, which I hope it will do.
I want to refer to some comments from someone from the TWU—I think he is from the TWU; I know Mr Pat Murray, who is a whistleblower along with Mr Tony O’Donnell, is actually being sued by the TWU for $250,000 for allegedly giving the Sunday program documents relating to this rort, to this slush fund, to this illegal activity. An article in the Australian this morning stated:
Among serving and former union officials interviewed by the program—
that is, the Sunday program—
TWU organiser Tony O’Donnell claimed union members were not aware of the fund’s existence and he disputed that funds were used for training.
“There is evidence here of secret commissions, possibly corrupt commissions under the NSW Crimes Act,” Mr O’Donnell said.
Mr Sheldon strongly defended his union yesterday, describing the non-disclosure of political donations as an “administrative error” ...
An administrative error? A slush fund that was used to make donations directly to Labor candidates was an administrative error?

Senator Patterson interjecting—

—I do not think so and, as Senator Patterson said, nor will the Australian public.
The other issue I want to address—and I know that some of my colleagues will probably talk about it as well—is the extortion and bullying of companies that took place to fund the slush fund. If the Prime Minister is prepared to sit back and accept that it is appropriate for funds to be taken from companies via threats, then put into a slush fund and then paid to his candidates and state Labor candidates in New South Wales, he will be judged accordingly. I would like to go through some of the companies that have been in this position: Dairy Farmers, Linfox, Toll, Qantas, Australia Post, Action James, Allied Express, Star Track Express and Manpower. Dairy Farmers, I understand, were required to put—(Time expired)

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2008-03-17,"—Whilst we have heard Senator Ronaldson here feigning concern about supposed impropriety in electoral funding, let’s look at the history.
—What, you’re not concerned about it? Aren’t you concerned about it?
—I am concerned and I am going to come to my concerns in a moment, Senator Ronaldson. Let us look at the history. These allegations that were aired on the Sunday program yesterday actually were raised well over a year ago. At the time, Mr Hockey, the then minister, established some eight inquiries into these same allegations. There were inquiries through the Taxation Office, through ASIC and through the New South Wales police. There were inquiries in respect of possible breaches of New South Wales electoral laws, inquiries in respect of activities regarding safety and inquiries through the Industrial Registry and the Workplace Authority. A whole gamut of authorities were looking at these allegations. To date those inquiries have not found anything that would warrant any prosecution. There have been no findings of any illegal conduct. But those inquiries are ongoing.
What we have, however, today, following the Sunday program rerunning this same issue, is Senator Ronaldson getting up in question time and asking the minister the question: ‘Why won’t the government set up a judicial enquiry into illegal activities?’ Senator Ronaldson should know better. I understand that he has got legal qualifications. He is asking the government to set up a judicial inquiry, but at the same time he has already found the persons guilty. He said, ‘These are illegal activities’. Senator Ronaldson knows—as every senator on the opposite side and in this parliament knows—that if you have any specific allegations of criminal activity, you take them to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. As has been indicated by the ministers in responding to these questions today, the government’s approach is entirely appropriate. The Australian Electoral Commission has the capacity to look at whether or not there have been any breaches of electoral laws. I challenge Senator Ronaldson and Senator McGauran: if you have allegations, take them to the appropriate authorities. But of course you do not. You come in here and you raise them in here. That is what you do. You already find people guilty—in this parliament, where you are protected by parliamentary privilege—but you do not have the courage to go outside and approach the appropriate law enforcement authorities and raise the issues with them.
Let us look at the performance of the now opposition when they were in government, when it comes to electoral funding. This is the party that established the Millennium Forum in the home state of Senator McGauran and in the home state of Senator Ronaldson. The Millennium Forum was simply a ruse to hide millions of dollars of donations to the Liberal Party for electoral funding. You could not possibly disclose who those donors were. Not only that: when last in government—after the previous election, when you finally got the numbers in your own right in the Senate—you changed the electoral laws to raise the limit for nondisclosure of donors for electoral donations from $1,500 to $10,000. This meant that an individual or a company could donate up to or $90,000 by donating $10,000 to every state branch, every territory division and the national body of a political party. That is what you could do, without having to disclose who the donors were. It went from $1,500 to $10,000. That was your legacy for electoral donations. So do not come in here and lecture us about proprietary. Fair dinkum! You should be ashamed of yourselves for even having the hide to raise the issue.
I finish on this note. Do you remember the Australian Wheat Board? You stand up there with this pious, unctuous concern about supposed illegalities, bribes, under-the-table payments and so on. When you were in government, you were responsible for $300 million of donations to Saddam Hussein’s regime. You knew about it and you sat back. Under your administration, ministers and officials of the Wheat Board knew about these disgraceful payments and did nothing. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2008-03-17,"—I also want to take note of answers to questions to Senator Evans in relation to the Transport Workers Union and disclosure issues. When Prime Minister Rudd and his team were campaigning for office, they loudly declared that Labor would set and meet new and higher standards of probity and integrity. Mr Rudd declared a new ministerial code of conduct and a lobbyist register would be established by the first sitting day of this year. It did not happen.
Senator Faulkner promised new arrangements for transparency in appointments to government. This process has failed its first test. The test came in the form of a cabinet submission to appoint Tony Sheldon, New South Wales state secretary of the Transport Workers Union, to the National Transport Commission. This is troubling on two counts. Firstly, it is a sign that the government is returning to the old habit of giving the unions a seat at every table—in this case the National Transport Commission. It is pretty funny that the government wanted to appoint a representative of the Transport Workers Union to the NTC, because the NTC has, as its stated objective, to improve transport productivity, efficiency and safety. Imagine that: the head of the TWU having expertise in transport productivity and efficiencies! On the contrary, they are the enemy of transport productivity and efficiency.
It is also troubling because we see that Labor are going to be appointing their mates to every body. We have seen the reintroduction of the Australian Labour Advisory Council, and we should look very carefully at the Reserve Bank board. Once upon a time, we had Bill Kelty on the board of the Reserve Bank. We need to watch very carefully to see if Labor moves to put an ACTU representative back on that body.
Secondly, this is very concerning because Senator Faulkner’s board appointment vetting committee has failed, and is now seen for what it is: a fig leaf, a cover to pretend that Labor mates are appointed on the basis of merit rather than partisanship. Senator Conroy admitted as much today when he declared, in reference to Tony Sheldon, ‘He wouldn’t rat on a mate.’ That is what Tony Sheldon is—a Labor mate. That was the sole reason for consideration of him for appointment to the NTC board. Senator Faulkner made great play about the new integrity regime for senior government appointments, but there is a ‘get out of jail clause’ in this new appointments regime. Senator Faulkner listed all the bodies which would be subject to this appointment regime. It includes the National Transport Commission—the CEO, yes, but not the board members. So there is a ‘get out of jail’ card there for Labor mates who wish to be appointed to these bodies.
Over recent days we have seen emerge in the media further reasons why it would be inappropriate to have the head of the TWU appointed to the NTC. The media have made allegations in relation to the TWU that involve corruption, slush funds and extortion. Last year it emerged that the TWU required its members to pay a special fee that went into a fund for which there were no governance arrangements. That is worrying enough, but now it emerges in the media that there are new allegations that union funds from the slush fund were being used to bankroll the campaigns of Labor parliamentary candidates. This is very concerning. These funds have been appropriated from union members and channelled into parliamentary elections, with a failure to declare to the Electoral Commission.
We can have no confidence at all that the New South Wales branch of the ALP will take any steps to examine these matters. Why can we have no confidence that the New South Wales ALP will not examine its own house? The reason is that a Mr Tony Sheldon heads the party’s disciplinary body, the administrative and disputes committee. I do not think we can expect a fair and unbiased hearing in that body. The only solution is an independent judicial inquiry. We need to know what else the TWU have done. Who else have they donated to? Have they donated to federal candidates as well? The only way we can determine this is with an independent judicial inquiry. I hope Senator Faulkner will be a voice of reason on this issue in the government. He has great concern about electoral integrity and I hope that Senator Faulkner would be arguing for an independent commission.
In concluding, when looking at the Sheldon appointment, let us look at the values of the National Transport Commission. They state their values to be ‘integrity, excellence and discernment’. There is certainly excellence in establishing slush funds. Whether there is integrity and discernment only an independent judicial inquiry can determine.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Donations to Political Parties</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,8,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2008-03-17,"—It is typical of this opposition: when they do not have any arguments to mount they make a slur on an organisation that has been subjected to a repeat of allegations made many months ago, which their then minister, Mr Hockey, referred to eight inquiries—not to a judicial inquiry, as the opposition is now suggesting, but to eight separate inquiries: inquiries by the ATO, inquiries by ASIC, inquiries by the New South Wales police, inquiries through the New South Wales electoral laws, New South Wales occupational health and safety inquiries, inquiries by the Industrial Registrar and inquiries by the Workplace Authority. Those inquiries have not been shut down by this government; they are ongoing. But, as Senator Forshaw reminded the Senate, to date nothing has been discovered which would be illegal, as far as I am aware, or in any way require or justify the sort of inquiry which the opposition now proposes. Of course, they had to have something to raise in the debate to take note of answers today. They decided, ‘Here we go: it’s a union and we don’t like unions, and it’s someone who’s involved in a commission and they’ve withdrawn.’ As Mr Sheldon said:
I have reached this conclusion—
that is, to withdraw from the National Transport Commission—
so the community can focus on the real safety challenges in the heavy vehicle industry, free from the distractions caused by a political campaign being waged against the TWU’s efforts to clean up long-distance transport.
It is important to touch again upon the point Mr Sheldon refers to in his statement—that is, the question of safety. Senator Fifield talked about the aims of the National Transport Commission. At first he mentioned safety, but then he conveniently ceased every mention of it because Mr Sheldon’s role in trucking safety exceeds that of any other in this community. That is clearly his job. On his public statements, you must come to the conclusion that he regards it as the primary concern for his organisation. He has said: ‘In the financial year 2006-07, 228 people needlessly died in heavy vehicle incidents on Australian roads. This is an important reason, among fairness at work and client transport company accountability, to keep fighting.’ Good on Mr Sheldon for fighting for trucking safety.
There are a great many Australians who drive the rigs that keep our economy moving, that transport goods to and from market, that supply cities with the goods they need to continue to operate and to feed people. He is representing thousands of truck drivers in that very onerous task who are engaged in a dangerous occupation, evidenced by the number of fatalities that occur in that occupation. Why would he not have a concern about safety? Why would that not be a very valuable skill to put on the National Transport Commission? There has been no real reason to justify him not being there other than unproven allegations aired again over the weekend and aired in the past. I say again, these are allegations that were referred to eight inquiries by the previous coalition minister, Mr Hockey, and to date nothing has come of them.
It is easy to come into this place and make allegations. I note from the language of Senator Fifield that he does not consider them allegations; he considers them proven. Judge, jury and executioner—that is how we should view the statements of Senator Fifield. There was no presumption of innocence on the part of Senator Fifield or by the rest of the coalition in the contribution they made here. Frankly, everyone is entitled to that presumption.
What has Mr Sheldon done in relation to his appointment? He has, of his own accord, offered his resignation and that resignation has been accepted. If there is any substance to the allegation, if Senator Ronaldson, Senator Fifield, Senator McGauran or any other senator has any information in relation to electoral matters, they should take them to the Australian Electoral Commission. If they have any information in relation to matters of illegality they should take them to the New South Wales police or to the Federal Police and they should do that now. If they propose to make allegations which are not based on such fact, then I challenge them to make those allegations outside because they know they are not protected out there. (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2008-03-17,"—Listening to Senator O’Brien and to previous speakers from the government, you get the sense there is nothing more sensitive to Labor Party members than being questioned on their seedy relationship with the TWU. You always know, because the volume rises, the abuse rises. We heard that in question time today when I asked my question of Senator Conroy, a former member of the TWU. Up went the noise, up went the abuse. Even Senator Robert Ray over in the corner awoke and threw in his pathetic, outdated barbs—like the man himself, I should add. The truth of the matter is we are seeing the seedy side of the relationship between the union and the government because the Labor Party went in to bat holus-bolus in defence of the union during question time today and during this debate to take note of answers. You can duck, you can weave, you can slip and you can slide, but today you have defended the most serious allegations of misappropriation in regard to electoral funding.
In fact, Senator Conroy gave it away today in a moment of truth. He told the truth when he said, ‘I will not rat on a mate.’ Forget about the circumstances of ratting on the mate, he is not going to rat on his mate and that is the truth of the matter. That is the core of the issue here today. If you boast about and trumpet, as you do, your new government’s integrity and transparency, you would move to set up a judicial inquiry into this particular matter.
When put to the test, you fail miserably as you always have in the past. Why are we so surprised? You always defend the unions regardless of the serious allegations. You defended the maritime workers against allegations of corruption and extortion. You defended the building and construction union against the Cole royal commission’s own findings. Here you are again defending the TWU against the most serious allegations of corruption and misappropriation of electoral funds which you were beneficiaries of.
—Have you got any facts?
—Let us go through the allegations and the facts. Prima facie, they look like facts to me.
—Oh, do they?
—Senator O’Brien, you will cease interjecting. Senator McGauran is entitled to be heard in silence. Senator McGauran, your comments should be addressed to the chair.
—It is then worthy to look at the gravity of this issue as those on the other side are calling for. It warrants repeating that the union and the union’s national secretary have basically been caught red-handed. Firstly, there is strong prima facie evidence and serious allegations of breaching the law by nondisclosure of secret donations to the ALP candidates. It should not surprise you, Mr Deputy President, that those on the other side are standing up vigorously defending the actions of this union which are an offence against the New South Wales Crimes Act. Secondly, there is evidence for extortions of very large sums from companies that they deal with in return for industrial peace. Most likely that extorted money has gone to the ALP in regard to candidate funding, and we have Tony O’Donnell, a former official of the Transport Workers Union, saying:
There is evidence here of secret commissions, possibly corrupt commissions under the NSW Crimes Act.
What was the lame defence of Mr Sheldon? It was notoriously famous cover-up words, ‘It is all an administrative error.’ We will see about that because it is under serious investigation. We will see how far that cover-up line of Mr Sheldon goes. As previous speakers, Senator Ronaldson and Senator Mitch Fifield, from this side have said, this matter does go to the heart of the integrity of the government and their close relationship with the union.
Already, as we know, the wagons are circling around Mr Sheldon and the union itself. This union has form. This union has a record. A lack of transparency of millions of dollars has already been reported in an audit report by Deloitte. The union has past form and, on that ground alone, these allegations cannot be overlooked. Yet what is the government’s reaction? They, knowing the form of this particular union, were still willing to appoint Mr Sheldon to the transport advisory committee. He did not step down; he was pushed down under the pressure of the allegations. An inquiry is required or this government’s seedy relationship with respect to the debt they owe the union for the election to the tune of $50 million looks like it has been paid off.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-03-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Climate Change and Water (Senator Wong) to a question without notice asked by Senator Allison today relating to emissions trading.
The minister made a very welcome announcement this morning that emissions trading would proceed in 2010, unlike the previous commitment which was 2012, as I understand it. The problem is that, even though that has been brought forward by a couple of years, it is going to be about 2020 before we see even minor reductions in greenhouse emissions coming into effect. The conclusion of the National Emissions Trading Taskforce was that reductions in actual emissions are going to be very slow in getting off the ground.
The minister says that they are doing the modelling and that that will all feed into the trajectory, which is going to determine the rate at which emissions will be abated. But it seems to us that talking about determining what the trajectory means and then talking in the same terms about not knowing until the economic modelling is being done suggests that we have nothing leading this process. So the government are not saying that we must contain emissions to the point where, globally, parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere will be contained to 450 parts per million, 350 parts per million or some other figure. There is nothing in the government’s guiding, if you like, of this whole process that says that we want to keep temperature rises to within one degree, two degrees or six degrees—who knows. So we are not sure exactly what it is that is going to determine the process leading up to emissions trading, but I do know that nothing much is going to happen until a long way down the track—and this is a serious mistake.
We are getting very impatient. This government is not proving to be all that fast off the blocks on greenhouse than was the previous one. It could get going straight away with a mandated renewable energy target. It could increase that target, as Labor has long said it intended to do. We have the structure; we know what to do. We have an electricity generation system which is used to it. The retail section knows how to purchase renewable energy certificates. We know that there are some seven million certificates that have been banked, so even if you were to set that up tomorrow it would not cause any difficulty in the industry in terms of generating certificates to meet the new targets. We also know that Australians are great wasters of energy, so an energy efficiency trading scheme—and I draw the government’s attention to the bill which I tabled some weeks ago which would put in place such an energy efficiency trading system—could likewise shave two per cent a year off the consumption of energy in this country.
The great benefit of a trading system like this is that the cost of efficiency is offset by the lower cost of using electricity, so it is not quite revenue neutral but it is almost that. This is a quick, easy, effective and fair way of reducing emissions. Those two measures alone could start tomorrow. There is no reason why we should wait until the end of the year until we get this sorted out. We know what the emissions trading system is going to look like. We will then take another year to get it into legislation before it is actually implemented. We could start tomorrow by picking up on two systems which would not require huge consultation around the country and would not need us to appease large sectors of the community. Let me talk a bit about why it is critical to start today. There was 23 per cent growth in spring melt in the Arctic sea ice in 2006-07. We discovered this just last week. The scientists are telling us that glaciers and sheet ice are melting at a much greater rate than we ever thought was the case. Climate scientists are doubting—(Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-03-17,"—Of all the things I could say about Clyde Cameron—about what he did, about what he achieved—one thing is paramount, one thing from which all the rest stemmed: Clyde Cameron could count. He could count the number of members in a statewide union ballot. He could count the number of votes on the state or federal executive of his union and party. He could count exactly how many votes the AWU could control at ALP conferences. In 1955 he counted how many votes ‘Doc’ Evatt would need at the federal conference of the ALP to expel the groupers. In 1970 he counted how many votes Gough Whitlam needed on the federal executive to intervene in the unelectable Victorian branch. Both times, as history attests, he got his sums right.
Clyde made his mark on history as a minister in the Whitlam government, perhaps most famously through helping to establish equal pay for women. But it was not on the front bench but in the back room that he made his mark on the Australian Labor Party and the labour movement. As he said after his retirement:
I did not mind other people getting the glory while I was exercising the power.
Trained in the hard school of AWU union politics, Clyde had formidable toughness and considerable skill in manipulating the machinery that makes a political party run. He used those skills and that toughness in the interest, as he perceived it, of the party he served for so long and with such intensity.
Clyde was both an utterly ruthless realist and a passionate idealist. He sought to find a place for himself and for the labour movement within the two extremes of politics—as he himself described them: the extremes of either power without purpose, or purpose without power. His ability to balance these demands was best shown by the role he played as a power broker of the Left in delivering crucial left-wing votes to support Gough Whitlam’s abolition and reformation of the left-controlled Victorian branch of the ALP. It is true that the argument Whitlam used to convince him was to ask him to choose between being a footnote in a book by Alan Reid or Minister for Labour.
But Clyde Cameron did not crunch numbers for purely personal gain. He always worked in the interests of the party, as he saw them. He had his own personal code, and he was disciplined in sticking to it. He voted against, and thus blocked, the preselection of his own brother Larry because he believed the other candidate was the better objective choice. He broke with the ticket of his own union to vote for Don Dunstan’s preselection. Clyde put the party before any factional or state interests, and he put the party before any personal interests.
When Clyde Cameron died last Friday, the Australian Labor Party lost part of its history, not just because Clyde personally remembered many of the most dramatic events in ALP history—he was the last surviving member of the 1949-51 parliament—but because Clyde Cameron himself was the exemplar of the kind of man once common in the ALP but now very rare. Son of a founding member of the AWU, he travelled from shearer’s shed to cabinet room. His parents, both his shearer father and his Quaker mother, gave him an abiding belief in the power of human action to improve the world and the importance of social justice. His early experience of hardship in childhood—Clyde said in his memoirs that he remembered months of never being fully fed as a child—and as a young man during the Depression left him pretty bitter, his own words, towards people who did not understand the realities of life for the unemployed.
Like many Labor people of his generation, his experience during the Depression left him committed to full employment. He said:
I envy people who have had the chance to go through life without knowing what it is to be unemployed.
He barely tried to hide his contempt for those who treated the ill-paid or unemployed as the cannon fodder of economic policy. As a young man on the dole, Clyde experienced firsthand the hardship—and the humiliation—of unemployment. And as a young shearer, Clyde saw firsthand the difference that union action could make to the basic, everyday life of working people. As a union representative, the squatters nicknamed him ‘Shithouse’ Cameron, because he used to inspect the pit latrines to make sure they had flywire protection as required by the Shearers’ Accommodation Act—something that might seem petty and pedantic to anyone who has never seen how bad the flies can get in the West Darling.
But from those early days as a union organiser to the end of his life, no detail was too small for Clyde Cameron to notice, no task beneath him. After his death on Friday, a former staffer who had first met Clyde after his retirement from parliament in the 1980s described how Clyde spent election campaign after election campaign sitting in the back room of a campaign office, folding letters and stuffing envelopes for mail-outs. It is the kind of job that has to be done on every campaign but one that many retired MPs and former ministers would think a bit beneath them. Not Clyde. I will not say that he was afflicted with modesty—false or otherwise—when it came to his own gifts and his contribution to the Labor movement but nor was he subject to hubris. No job was too small, no task was too tough for Clyde Cameron. As a young union organiser, that attitude won him support from men whose pay and conditions he worked to improve. His constituency in the shearing sheds gave him a power base in the union and the numbers on the conference floor. That put him on the wrong side of the ruling clique. They were tough men. Clyde was tougher.
In 1939, as a young 26-year-old organiser, he walked into his first meeting of the South Australian AWU executive and discovered it was a ‘kindergarten for retarded children’. He said in his memoirs:
When I later went into the first Caucus meeting of the Parliamentary Labor Party after my election in 1949, I remember feeling what a tame outfit it was compared with the AWU conventions I had attended. AWU conventions brought together the toughest group of Labor people you could find anywhere in Australia ... Those men had absolutely no regard for fitness or decency. Nowhere else did I witness the same kind of ruthlessness and cruelty that I saw in the Annual Conventions of the AWU.
His feud with long-serving AWU general secretary Tom Dougherty started in the 1940s, when Cameron was state secretary for the South Australian branch of the AWU. Cameron’s fight to democratise the union and choke off the power of union officials to expel rivals elected by the rank and file was eventually successful. As Minister for Labour he was able to bring about changes to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that would stop Dougherty’s crooked practices. Eagerly awaiting Dougherty’s defeat at the next elections, Clyde was deeply disappointed when Dougherty died in office a few months later. As Mungo MacCallum reported this weekend, when Bob Hawke, as president of the ACTU, attended Dougherty’s funeral, Cameron blasted him. He said:
What you have done is to pay your last respects to the most evil man ever to hold office in any trade union. You presided over the funeral of a cruel, arrogant, deceitful, hypocritical, malevolent, treacherous and lecherous man. One of the worst criminals ever to escape the gallows, a gangster, a thief, a thug, a blackmailer, a ballot-rigger, a wife-starver, a traitor to his union, a standover man, a giver and taker of bribes, a tyrant and a coward.
Cameron was seldom afraid to say exactly what he thought. He was willing to speak ill of the dead, of the living, behind people’s backs and to their faces. He was what we call in the Australian Labor Party ‘a good hater’. Bob Santamaria, who ought to know, described Clyde as ‘both permanent and consistent’ in his opposition to the groupers. He was described by Alan Reid as ‘radical, implacable, tenacious’. Another journalist, listening to Clyde doing his best to cripple the career of an enemy, described him as burying his knife in a defenceless back with ‘impeccable, slow, twisting calculation’. The enemy in question was Bob Hawke. Clyde, fortunately, was not successful in that endeavour.
Clyde was one of the legendary hard men of the ALP. Eddie Ward was his mentor. Joe Chamberlain was his role model. But unlike either of them, Clyde knew that the party had to find policies broadly appealing in order to win, and he was persuaded by Whitlam’s argument that, in politics, ideological purity is not an end in itself. His support for federal intervention in Victoria was crucial to its success. He coaxed wavering votes, including Kim Edward Beazley’s, created opportunities for emergency meetings when the numbers failed to hold at the first Broken Hill meeting of the executive and split crucial votes away from the right.
When the federal executive found the Victorian branch guilty of the charges against them and abolished the branch, Clyde’s typical attention to detail when it came to machinery matters came to the fore, and he insisted the executive deal with every charge separately so, if court action should overturn any one of the charges, the others would not be tainted. When Clyde Cameron crunched someone, they stayed crunched. Gough phoned Clyde to thank him, saying, ‘No-one but you could have got the numbers’—or so Clyde recalled the conversation.
It is ironic that one of the people Clyde had to persuade to vote with him at those crucial 1970s meetings was Kim Beazley Senior. Fifteen years earlier, in 1955, Clyde realised that Doc Evatt was not going to have the numbers against the groupers on the floor of the conference. He plotted with Joe Chamberlain to have the federal executive choose its own delegates to represent the grouper dominated state of Victoria. As Clyde admitted:
It was highly irregular for the Federal Executive to be deciding a matter that properly belonged to the conference, but when you are in a war, fighting for survival, you cannot afford to be worried about technicalities.
It was Kim Beazley’s rejection of this ‘irregular’ strategy that saw him fall out with Joe Chamberlain, the powerful Western Australian state secretary. In 1970, both Clyde and Kim were on the wrong side of Joe. But they were on the right side of the electorate.
After 1972, Clyde had the chance to fulfil a life-long dream and he became Minister for Labour and Immigration. One of his first and most memorable actions was to re-open the case for equal pay for women. But Clyde knew that equal opportunity was as important as equal pay. He would not accept lists of candidates for appointments or promotion that did not include women. In the days before the words ‘affirmative action’ were part of the language, Clyde was practising a rough-and-ready version of the same. He did not put it in those terms, however; he simply said that he wanted to give women a chance. When a 1975 reshuffle saw him lose his beloved portfolio, he described it as:
... the event of my life that caused me the most distress. Ever since I was a child I had longed for the day when I might be lucky enough to be in a position to do something for organised labour ...
Gough told him he would find science an interesting portfolio, but Cameron refused to be placated. He later said:
Actually, after a while, as Gough predicted, I did begin to find science and consumer affairs quite interesting, but I kept that to myself.
His relationship with Gough Whitlam never recovered. I have talked about Clyde’s role in federal and union politics, but, of course, as a powerful influence in the South Australian branch, he exercised a great deal of sway in South Australian politics. In 1967, for example, he got Frank Walsh to stand down as Premier to make way for Don Dunstan by moving a motion at the party state council meeting congratulating Walsh for putting the party’s interests ahead of his own and standing down in favour of a younger man. This was the first Frank Walsh had ever heard of his selfless decision to step aside but, when the council erupted in a standing ovation, he saw the writing on the wall. This high-profile intervention was not Clyde’s typical way, though, of doing things. He later said:
Nobody likes to see any outfit run by one man, so it was important to be discreet ... A person who holds power is a madman to flaunt it.
Describing a few highlights and memorable moments in Clyde’s long career is a poor reflection of the full extent of his contribution. He worked the party’s machine continually, relentlessly, ruthlessly, with a nudge here and a phone call there, influencing preselections, policy and party operations. He could be persuaded but never intimidated.
For many years in the ALP, regardless of who was steering the ship, Clyde Cameron was one of the people down in the engine room, making sure that none of the pressure gauges hit dangerous levels and that the engines responded when the captain turned the wheel. His contribution was no less valuable for being often unseen. And, in the Labor Party and the labour movement, it was no less appreciated for being unseen. His courage and conviction, not to mention his cunning, made a crucial difference at some of the ALP’s most perilous moments. His was a life of both power and purpose. Our thoughts and sympathies are with his family and friends.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. Clyde Robert Cameron AO</title>,Condolences,11,1,speech
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-17,"—It was with great sadness that I heard on Friday of the passing of the former member for Hindmarsh, a great South Australian, Clyde Cameron, in the early hours of that day, in the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in my home town of Adelaide. I want to say a few things in this place about this man, who was a great South Australian and a great servant of the Australian working people. Clyde Cameron was many things: he was a shearer, a union organiser, an industrial advocate and a historian—or, as Mike Rann recently observed, a ‘prolific chronicler of Labor Party history’. He was the representative of the people of Hindmarsh for 31 years—a seat which is now held in this place by the member for Hindmarsh, Steve Georganas. He was a cabinet minister. But, above all, he was a staunch defender of working people and their welfare. Clive Cameron was a man who made a towering contribution to our movement and he was an iconic figure in the South Australian branch.
Clyde Cameron was born in Murray Bridge in 1913 and his first job was as a shearer at Ashmore Station in South Australia after leaving school at the age of 14. From a very young age he had a commitment to improving the lot of the people who he represented and from whence he came. After a period of unemployment during the Great Depression, Clyde Cameron was elected as an organiser for the Australian Workers Union in South Australia and became the state secretary of that union in 1941. He was elected to federal parliament in 1949 and spent 23 years in opposition—a record which I am sure very few here would like to hold—before becoming a minister in the first Whitlam government. Before Clyde Cameron’s death this past Friday, he was the last of the members of parliament elected in 1949. His record of winning 13 consecutive elections for the seat of Hindmarsh before retiring, after 31 years, in 1975 is one of considerable achievement.
As Senator Faulkner has pointed out, Clyde Cameron made history when he argued the case for the appointment of former High Court Justice Mary Gaudron to prosecute the case for equal pay for female workers in the arbitration commission. He was a leading advocate of pension increases, for the provision of child care to support working women and he greatly improved the pay and conditions of public service workers during his term as Minister for Labour and Immigration. Dame Roma Mitchell, yet another great South Australian, said at one of Clyde’s book launches that he made a lot of good friends and he kept them for a long time. He also made a lot of fierce enemies and kept them for a long time.
Clyde Cameron, along with Don Dunstan and others, helped pioneer multiculturalism in Australia and, as others in this place have talked about, his association with Gough Whitlam and his keen understanding of the machinery of our party brought about the necessary reform that was required for Labor to win office after so many years in opposition. Of course no reflection on Clyde Cameron’s life would be complete without acknowledging the famous falling out that Clyde Cameron and Gough Whitlam had. As John Bannon has observed, it was not so much the sacking of Cameron but the manner in which it was done. Cameron’s humiliating treatment was never forgiven. Certainly Clyde Cameron’s career was a controversial one, but his reputation as the hard man of the Labor Party was belied by the friendships he cultivated on the conservative side of politics. I note, also, notable names include James Killen, John Gorton and Mary Downer.
I have known Clyde Cameron at somewhat of a distance from when I joined the party as a much younger person, when I was a student at Adelaide university. Clyde would still attend the various party fora that I attended. He was kind enough to write to me after my first speech in this place; he wrote to me congratulating me on some of the issues that I had raised and expressing his views about them. I remember being incredibly touched and moved that somebody who was such a significant figure in our movement would take the time to read the first speech of a Senate backbencher. Last year, or perhaps the year before, I was fortunate enough to be at a dinner where Clyde Cameron was presented with lifetime membership of the South Australian Labor Party. He certainly remained active in the South Australian party and community, right up until he fell acutely ill last month. There were a great many fundraisers, Labor Party events and community events over the years that I have attended where Clyde Cameron has attended. In 1995 Clyde was made an Officer of the Order of Australia. He spent his retirement in Adelaide’s West Lakes and has never stopped being an integral part of the Labor Party in South Australia. He passed away on Friday aged 95. I understand that at the time he was Australia’s oldest former parliamentarian. He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Doris, and his two sons, Warren and Noel, and a daughter, Tanya. I extend my condolences to his family and place on record my gratitude and recognition for the enormous contribution of this great South Australian.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-03-17,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The bloodshed in Tibet and the need for strong, decisive action by the government to insist that international laws and norms, including those safeguarding human and political rights and media access, are observed by China.
While we enjoy the democracy of this great country of ours, seven million Tibetans live to our north stripped of their democratic rights, stripped of their right to freedom of speech, stripped of their right to freedom of religious observance and generally made noncitizens in their own country. The last week has seen an outbreak of violence in Tibet unparalleled for at least the last 20 years, when a crackdown in Lhasa under the now President of communist China, Hu Jintao, involving the shooting of many people in Lhasa led to the end of civil unrest at that time. Now we are seeing a huge outbreak of feeling by Tibetans in Tibet proper and in the other Tibetan provinces to the north and east of Lhasa.
One only has to reflect on the danger for the monks and nuns who began marching from Sera monastery and other monasteries into Lhasa last week to understand the strong feelings of the Tibetan people, who have such a record of devotion to freedom and nonviolence, which must be exhibiting itself in their own hearts. I have been to the monasteries from which many of the monks and nuns come. I have been in Tibet and have seen the suppression of the ability of people to speak up for their rights. And I can only imagine the horror and the fear and the terror in the hearts of those Tibetans who have decided to make a stand for the country they love and for the religion which they believe so wholeheartedly in.
The reports from Tibet vary. The official news agency Xinhua says that 10 people have been killed and that these were Chinese shop owners and hotel owners. The reports coming out of the exiled government of Tibet indicate 80 to 100 Tibetans have been shot or otherwise killed in the last few days. What is at stake here is the international community’s own standing in upholding the rights of people who are cruelly suppressed. Let me put this from the outset: we are dealing here with a repressive, dictatorial communist regime in Beijing. It is a police state. Since the events of last week, for example, internet communications to do with Tibet have been shut down by the 40,000 internet police who routinely on behalf of that police state intervene in the communications of people within Tibet. CNN, the one outside entity which has the right to broadcast in and from China, whenever it goes to the Tibet issue is blacked out currently in China. Internet service providers are shut down if they try to facilitate traffic on the matter. That is one half of it. On the other half, we can know from past performance that those good and true Tibetans who have, through the anguish of their hearts, taken the courage to stand up against this brutal regime in Tibet and elsewhere in China have been and are now in pretty horrendous circumstances.
I call on the government of this country to take some reasonable action against the repression by China and in support of the seven million Tibetans. So far we have had the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, say that he is disturbed by what is going on in Tibet—and who isn’t—and that he has had diplomatic communications go to and from China, whatever that means. And he has called for restraint, whatever that means. But we have seen nothing here from our own Prime Minister demanding that the Chinese government allow access for the free media, that it guarantee the rights of the Tibetans and indeed all Chinese under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed, and that Tibetans’ rights are guaranteed as they are written under the Chinese Constitution, a part of the Constitution which has been observed in the breach by this government.
The difference is non-existent between the Howard government’s failure, its acquiescence to the dictatorial government in Beijing, and the Rudd government’s now. I ask this, Mr Acting Deputy President Forshaw: why has Prime Minister Rudd not called in the Chinese ambassador, Zhang Junsai? Is this not so important that the Chinese ambassador should not hear what the Australian nation feels about the repression of Tibetans and about the need to uphold their rights right across the board? What are these diplomatic exchanges that Prime Minister Rudd tells us about but will not reveal? What we have here effectively is the Rudd government resorting to diplomatic niceties while blood is flowing in the streets of Lhasa. We have the Rudd government failing to take a stand for the rights which we as Australians not only take as central to our democracy but have had our own blood shed for.
Let me say this unequivocally: we are now a globalised society and when governments fail to stand up for the basic tenets of freedom of speech, freedom of religious observance and political rights anywhere in the world, they are failing to do it domestically as well. We are part of an international community, and the Australian people expect better. When it came to the monks and nuns protesting in Rangoon last year, under the Howard government, Mr Rudd said:
It’s important for the international community to unite in their condemnation of the Burmese regime.
Why is he not saying it is now important for the international community to unite in their condemnation of the Beijing regime? He said:
I noticed Mr Downer, the Foreign Minister, said the other day that these sorts of sanctions—
that is, targeted sanctions on the Burmese leaders—
were not effective. Labor’s view is that they are useful and they should be adopted ...
Where are you now, Prime Minister Rudd? Why will you not now consider targeted sanctions on the repressive, dictatorial regime in Beijing so that the leaders in Beijing will know that we are standing up for the rights we believe in? Mr Rudd said of Burma:
That policy of constructive engagement with the Burmese regime has conspicuously failed.
But that is a policy he has adopted himself now towards Beijing. He said:
When it comes to Burma and the abuse of human rights, the international community, including Australia, must speak with one strong, united voice.
I say to Prime Minister Rudd: how about calling on the international community, Australia included, to speak with one strong, united voice against the abuse of human rights in Tibet? You will have the Australian people with you, Prime Minister, if you get the backbone to stand up, look the Beijing communist regime straight in the eye and say, ‘We do not support the brutal military occupation of Tibet.’ The Dalai Lama, long ago—in the 1980s—took the middle road and said, ‘Give us genuine autonomy.’ The brutes in Beijing have turned their back on that, and the Dalai Lama has not got the support from the Australian governments that you would have expected to have come behind that, all the way down the six contacts with the Chinese authorities since 2002. What the Tibetans have found is that every time they go to ask Beijing to make some concession, they get trodden on. The Australian government and the Australian Prime Minister should do better.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2008-03-17,"—I rise on behalf of the opposition to support the motion put forward by Senator Brown relating to the current situation in Tibet. It is indeed very disturbing that events have degenerated to this point. There are reports of up to 80 deaths, of serious injuries and of numbers of arrests occurring. Some reports, unconfirmed—and that is an aspect of this upheaval which makes it difficult to know what is going on; the lack of information and the lack of communication, as Senator Brown has said—indicate a number of arrests are continuing to be carried out.
These are the largest protests to have occurred in Tibet since the pro-independence demonstrations of 1989, which of course resulted in the implementation of martial law over the area. We are very concerned by the images and the reports out of Lhasa over the weekend. The opposition leader, Dr Nelson, has made his views very clear on this matter and has said quite clearly—and it is an observation I support—that the Prime Minister must protest against this crackdown on activists in Tibet when he visits China next month. I have read the words of the Prime Minister at his press conference today. I asked a question myself of Senator Evans in the chamber here this afternoon about whether the Prime Minister would specifically raise these matters on his very imminent visit to China—it would seem to be propitiously timed in at least that regard. I am not reassured that we received a clear enough answer to those questions, and it is very important that the opportunity is taken at the time it becomes available. Given, of course, the Prime Minister’s much vaunted expertise in Sino matters, it would be indeed very important for him to exercise that expertise on this visit.
The protests themselves, we understand, began around 10 March when hundreds of Buddhist monks marched in Lhasa calling for an end to religious restrictions and the release of imprisoned colleagues. That date itself marked the anniversary of an earlier and failed uprising against Chinese rule in the late 1950s which marked the point at which the Dalai Lama left Tibet and went to India. At stake, as Senator Brown observed, is one of the rights which so many peoples of the world take for granted but which so many more are unable to even contemplate. That, expressed under the universal charter of human rights, in article 20, is that everyone has the right of peaceful assembly and association. It is no small right held as an enjoyment by many but in this case clearly not.
We support the comments made by Foreign Minister Smith in calling for the Chinese government and authorities to act with restraint and for those protesting to be allowed to demonstrate peacefully. We would also acknowledge that it is also about peaceful demonstrations both overseas and here in Australia. At the same time, I do understand the levels of frustration and anguish which may have led to some of these activities, particularly as communications fail and people are unable to determine the health and safety of members of their family and we are unable to be provided with perhaps accurate reports of events. So I reiterate my comment that I really do hope that the Prime Minister will raise these latest events specifically with President Hu Jintao during his upcoming visit to China and, as he noted in his remarks this morning, will raise Australia’s other human rights concerns.
It is worth noting that the eyes of the entire world are focused on China in 2008. The Chinese government, in hosting the Olympics, finds itself under the world’s spotlight—not just under the world’s sporting spotlight. I have gleaned from certain statements and observations that have been made in recent times that they are aware of that. In my most recent visit to China in 2007 as part of the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, it was quite obvious to me that the focus on China was a matter of no small moment, so approaches to these events will be closely observed—there is absolutely no doubting that. That has already been raised in public discussions.
It is also important to note for the record that, internationally, very serious concerns about the approach to these recent events in Tibet have been raised by both the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, and her counterpart in Britain, David Miliband, both of whom have made observations about how the protests should be dealt with. They strongly urged restraint and urged all sides to refrain from the exercise of violence. They are admonitions importantly made.
I want to take the opportunity to make a few comments about the previous government’s engagement on human rights issues with China, which were of course based around the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue, which was initiated over 10 years ago now. There have been 11 dialogues, if I recall correctly. They had become very important forums for exchanges on human rights and for identifying areas where Australia could help China to pursue the implementation of internationally regarded human rights standards.
I know that there are sceptics about the human rights dialogues—and probably more than one in the chamber right now. But what I had the opportunity to observe—and members of the opposition were also invited to participate on those dialogues and did on occasions—were the advances in the approach, the attitude and the relationship between our two countries in these discussions on issues that we regard as fundamental in relation to human rights, whether they be child labour, matters around the treatment of Falun Gong, the exercise of the death penalty or a whole range of other issues. It is no secret that those key aspects were discussed. We had also backed that previously with the Human Rights Technical Cooperation Program, which the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission takes very seriously. It makes very significant endeavours in a range of areas in China to address practical aspects of human rights training including helping Chinese organisations make reforms to their laws and practices, particularly in relation to women and children, and to ethnic and minority rights. That did include Tibet. One of the human rights dialogues of which I was not a member included a field visit to Tibet. I understand that there are also critics of those exercises, but I think the engagement side of that process was a very important part of the dialogues.
I say quite seriously that I did see change over five or six years. It had become a very valuable process. I am not sure whether there has been an indication from the current government that they intend to continue with the dialogues—not just those in China, because there are of course several others.
The dialogues did make progress. For example, in some provinces the Human Rights Technical Cooperation Program has led to the passing of anti domestic violence laws, which were previously unknown and not contemplated either. It also led to the distribution of ‘know your rights’ pamphlets that were distributed to prisons, and even to a series of model UN human rights councils that introduced students in universities across China to international human rights norms and UN processes.
I hope that, as we continue to watch events in Tibet, we can have in the back of our minds that we have made some progress in regard to that level of engagement with China, but that we can also urge the Chinese government to deal appropriately with these events and urge Prime Minister Rudd to most emphatically and specifically take these matters up during his visit.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-03-17,"—I say to the Senate that the government remains deeply concerned at the tragic developments in Tibet and neighbouring areas, and, as other senators have expressed, greatly regrets the violence and loss of life.
Precise details of the events remain unclear. We understand that protests began on 10 March, when Buddhist monks gathered in Ramoche Monastery in central Lhasa. Some 60 were arrested, prompting other monks to protest against the initial arrests. Sadly, events turned violent last Friday, 14 March. The international media has reported fires; the destruction of government buildings, Chinese owned businesses and vehicles by Tibetan protesters; and shooting and the use of tear gas by Chinese security forces.
The situation in Lhasa is quiet but tense, as protesters and authorities await China’s deadline for Tibetan protesters to cease activity and surrender by midnight, which is 3 am Australian eastern summer time on 17 March, or face ‘stern punishment’. Media reports suggest that protests have spread to the Tibetan areas of Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan provinces. There are conflicting reports regarding the number of fatalities, with estimates between 10, which are the official Chinese estimates, and 100 from the Tibetan government in exile. The actual number may well remain unknown.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has contacted all Australians currently registered in Tibet. Our embassy in Beijing and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s Consular Emergency Centre are in contact with, and monitoring the welfare of, 14 Australians in or near Lhasa as of 1330 Canberra time of today’s date. Since the start of significant unrest on 14 March, we have also been in contact with and assisted another four Australians, who have left Lhasa.
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s travel advice for China was updated on 17 March. It continues to advise Australians to reconsider their need to travel to Lhasa and now advises Australians to exercise a high degree of caution in the rest of Tibet and in the Tibetan areas of provinces bordering Tibet—Yunnan, Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai—following reports of demonstrations there. The travel advice notes:
Several days of protest activity by Tibetan monks in Lhasa turned violent on 14 March, with reports of rioting and property damage. The situation on the streets of Lhasa remains tense. In these circumstances, you should reconsider your need to travel to Lhasa.
There have been reports of demonstrations and violence in other areas of Tibet and in Tibetan areas of provinces bordering Tibet (Sichuan, Gansu, Qinghai and Yunnan) and of an increased military presence. You should exercise a high degree of caution if travelling to these areas.
The overall travel advice for the rest of China remains at ‘Be alert to your own security.’
The government calls for calm and constraint by all parties and for the violence to end quickly and without further casualties. We are at a crucial juncture as we approach the deadline China has set for protesters to turn themselves in to authorities, which is midnight Lhasa time on 18 March. We call for restraint by authorities and by protesters. We call on China to ensure media freedoms in Tibet and elsewhere, so that the Chinese people and the international community have an accurate understanding of developments. We call on China to implement policies that will foster an environment of respect and tolerance and safeguard basic human rights.
On 16 March, the US Secretary of State, Dr Condoleezza Rice, called on China to engage in substantive dialogue with the Dalai Lama and urged all sides to refrain from violence. On 14 March, the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said:
We asked for restraint on the part of the Chinese authorities. We asked for human rights to be respected.
The UK Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, added:
There are probably two important messages to go out. One is the need for restraint on all sides, but secondly that substantive dialogue is the only way forward.
Of course, fundamental respect for human rights is a key platform of this government. We believe that human rights are a legitimate subject of international concern. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, raised the government’s concerns, including those over Tibet, Falun Gong and fundamental freedoms, with China’s foreign minister, Mr Yang Jiechi, in February. We do not believe that in raising these issues we will damage our strong friendship with China. Indeed, we see such discussions as a vital component of continued bilateral engagement. Nor do we see raising human rights as inconsistent with our efforts to promote our bilateral and trade ties. On the contrary, strong economic and political relations with China can only increase Australia’s standing to conduct meaningful dialogue on human rights.
We believe that an open and transparent approach to human rights issues would greatly assist China to strengthen its standing in the international arena. We will continue to pursue our concerns about human rights in China through high-level visits and dialogue, through bilateral representations and through the annual Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue. Our human rights dialogue is underpinned by a practical program of human rights engagement managed by AusAID and the Human Rights Technical Cooperation Program. In collaboration with a range of Chinese agencies, the HRTC program promotes the protection of human rights in China through training, capacity building and other practical projects. To date, over 60 activities have been implemented.
Australia recognises the challenges China faces. In recent years, China has made remarkable achievements in improving the social and economic rights of its people in the face of tremendous challenges. The World Bank estimates China has lifted 400 million people out of extreme poverty since 1981. The United Nations Development Program estimates that the number of Chinese living in poverty decreased from 85 million in 1990 to 26.1 million in 2004 and that China’s infant mortality rate decreased from 32.2 per cent in the year 2000 to 19 per cent in 2005. Increasing communications access, particularly the internet and mobile phones, has bolstered China’s growing civil society. Some progress has also been made in labour laws and in legal reform, and Chinese people are increasingly aware of their rights and increasingly willing to exercise them.
But human rights abuses continue to occur in China, and China continues to fall short of international expectations, including with regard to the death penalty, torture, non-judicial detention and restrictions of freedoms of expression and information. Beyond the latest disturbing developments, we also remain concerned about persistent and serious inadequacies in the protection of human rights in Tibet, including in the protection of Tibetans’ religious, civil and political rights. We are of course also concerned about Tibetans’ cultural and environmental heritage.
Australia does not question China’s sovereignty over Tibet. Successive Australian governments have recognised China’s sovereignty over Tibet, as does every country that has diplomatic relations with China. We believe that it is in China’s best interests to implement policies which will foster an environment of greater respect and tolerance. At this time, we urge China to take the opportunity to enter a process of dialogue with Tibetan groups, including the Dalai Lama. China would do well to encourage the non-violent elements of the Tibetan minority that the Dalai Lama represents, as it would be a tragedy were Tibet to continue to go down a path where violence is the only means for the expression of grievances. The year 2008 could be a watershed for Chinese and Tibetan history. We of course hope for increased tolerance and understanding.
Some have suggested that Australia should boycott the Olympic Games as a political statement against the reaction to protests in Tibet. The Australian government does not support a boycott of the Olympics. A boycott of the Olympics would not assist the human rights of the Tibetan people. The greater international focus the Olympics will bring can serve only to give the international community a greater understanding of China, including its diversity and its complex challenges, and give China a deeper appreciation of international norms, ultimately assisting in a better human rights situation in China.
I should say that the government is troubled by the actions of some protesters at Chinese consulates in Sydney and Melbourne over the weekend. I take this opportunity to say that the government takes its responsibilities under the Vienna convention for the protection of diplomatic premises very seriously, as I am sure you would appreciate. I can say to the chamber that we are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in Tibet and we reiterate our call for restraint by all parties. We call on China to show leadership to overcome the challenges it faces in Tibet and to resolve this issue peacefully.
In relation to the urgency motion that is currently before the chamber—while, needless to say, any criticism of the government made in this debate is certainly not accepted, and I do not want this to be misinterpreted in any way—I will make absolutely clear that the government will support this urgency motion.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Tibet</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-03-17,"—I rise to make comment on this urgency motion and use the opportunity on behalf of the opposition to express concern over the events that have taken place in recent days in Tibet and note that the situation there appears to be extremely serious. It has resulted, apparently, in the deaths of dozens of people, the burning of shops and businesses, as well as the destruction of homes and public infrastructure there. I say ‘apparently’ because it is true that information about exactly what occurs in places such as Tibet is not easy to obtain and is not necessarily reliable, and we need to be very careful about what assumptions we make about the events that are unfolding there.
What is clear, I think, is that there is a very powerful undercurrent of dissent within the native-born Tibetan community and that, for whatever reason, this has surfaced in recent days in a violent way. The precise causes may be difficult to ascertain, but it is clear that the people who are citizens of Tibet, particularly those who are ancestrally related to the people of Tibet, feel great concern about the affairs in their country and, for whatever reason, that concern has been welling up in recent days. The 50-odd year history of Chinese control of Tibet obviously is closely related to that tension. Given the heightened focus on affairs in China and in Tibet, particularly given rise to by the lead-up to the Beijing Olympics, it is not surprising that more focus should occur on events all over China, particularly in a place like this. Nonetheless, whether this is the kind of event that relates to that additional international focus or whether it is simply a reflection of an ongoing and deep concern by people who live in Tibet about the conditions of Chinese sovereignty over Tibet, it is always disappointing to see these sorts of events—particularly bloody events—unfold.
I want to join with my colleagues today in this place to call on the Chinese government and its representatives in Tibet to act with sensitivity and restraint. I particularly hope that they will treat those people who have been apprehended as protesters in Tibet, and perhaps elsewhere in China, to be treated with great care. I would urge the Chinese government to allow those protests to take place without undue or violent intervention and to use only the minimum amount of force required to prevent the loss of life or damage to property. I appreciate that there are different rules operating in China with respect to demonstrations and expressions of opposition to the government, but I also urge the Chinese government to be aware that there are different values and different norms accepted outside of China and that, to a significant extent, the world will judge China by the extent to which it exercises restraint in the circumstances.
I understand that the Chinese government has offered leniency to protesters who hand themselves in to authorities by Monday night of this week. I particularly express the hope that those protesters who do hand themselves in are treated with due respect for their human rights, and I am sure that the Chinese authorities are aware that the world will be watching to ensure this is the case. I urge the Australian government in particular to keep a very close eye on this aspect of what is happening in Tibet and to make it known that it will not tolerate any form of human rights violation of those protesters.
It is unfortunate, I think, that in many respects these events are happening in the lead-up to the Beijing Olympics and, indeed, just a few weeks before the Olympic torch is due to arrive in Lhasa prior to being carried to the top of Mount Everest. The Olympics is, of course, about bringing the world together in celebrating, at least for a few weeks, those things which unite us as human beings rather than those things which divide us, through highlighting the sporting abilities, skills and achievements of individuals all over the world.
I hope that, when the Olympic torch does make its way to Tibet, both the Tibetan and the Chinese communities will take this opportunity to focus on what they have in common as a people and to use that torch’s arrival as a chance to restore some form of dialogue—which, I appreciate, is perhaps a focus that is not there at the present time. I would also encourage those communities not to turn on each other in the name of political expression. I appreciate that many shops, businesses and even homes have been burnt in Lhasa over the last weekend and that these have mainly belonged to people of Chinese descent. It is important to acknowledge that those people, for the most part, are not to be blamed for the policies, however viewed, of the Chinese government and that it is extremely dangerous when communities turn on innocent representatives of the policies of governments as a way of expressing some kind of dissatisfaction with the policies of those governments.
In Australia, we expect protesters to behave in a way which is tolerant of the rights of other people and, therefore, particularly to eschew the use of violence. I have to express, as I think Minister Faulkner expressed, some concern about the use of violence by some protesters in Australia in the last few days. I hope that this Senate can unite with the clear message to those people that, however justified the basis for their protest and however valid the reasons for them to be expressing strongly a point of view about what is occurring in Tibet, the use of violence in that context is not justified and should never be supported or tolerated by Australians.
I appreciate also that there will be views taken, particularly by the Chinese government, about the right of other nations or citizens of other nations to express points of view about what might be regarded as the internal affairs of China. I want to finish by saying that I think it is very well established here and internationally that the rights of citizens of any nation are the concern of democratic societies everywhere.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-17,"—In the five minutes available to me I would like to express the Democrats’ support for this motion. It is a matter of urgency that the Chinese Communist government observe international laws and norms and cease the bloodshed in Tibet. But, of course, another point does have to be made. I appreciate that governments and people in major parties do need to be diplomatic in their language. I think it is part of the role of those of us on the crossbenches to be more explicit about expressing the deep concern that many people feel.
The simple fact is that the Chinese government has flagrantly and repeatedly breached international laws and norms with regard to human rights in a wide range of ways for a long period of time, and this is just the latest example and one that happens to have got international attention. This is a totalitarian regime that practices serious repression and oppression on its own people and supports serious repression and oppression in many other countries around the world. It is not alone in that, but it is certainly up there as one of the most serious, and this point does need to be made.
The oppression in Tibet is serious, particularly at present, but oppression is not isolated to there. This Chinese communist regime executes more people each year, by far, than every other nation on earth combined. Some of those people—quite a large number—are convicted via very dubious legal processes, some of them for offences which should not be offences. The opportunity for basic freedom of belief, freedom of speech and freedom of religion is seriously curtailed. The persecution of groups such as the Falun Gong practitioners is extreme, and it is clearly established as being extreme. In addition to executions, there is widespread torture and forced labour on an enormous scale. These things continue. They were happening before the current unrest and violence in Tibet, and they will continue after the world’s attention inevitably—as it always does—shifts somewhere else.
As was pointed out here today, I think in question time, there is a real prospect that some of the people protesting in Tibet at the moment will face the death penalty if they are captured and convicted of offences against the state. These sorts of things cannot just be swept aside by saying, ‘We’ll continue on with the dialogue.’ Dialogue is important—I support dialogue—but we also need to make clear much more strongly, I think, what is not acceptable.
The point has been made about the Olympics. I appreciate that boycotting the Olympics is not going to instantly reverse all of the human rights abuses in China, but we also need to look at what the Olympics are meant to be about: the international celebration of our shared humanity. We also know that the Olympics can be, and have been in the past, used as major propaganda exercises by particular governments in the country in which they are held. If we asked ourselves today the question, ‘Would we, in hindsight—should we, in hindsight—have participated in the Olympics in Berlin in 1936?’ I think most people would say, ‘No.’
I appreciate that there is an argument that coming together in Beijing at the Olympics—I am paraphrasing Senator Faulkner here; I think this is broadly what he said—will give opportunities for greater understanding of China and its challenges and give China a deeper appreciation of international norms which should ultimately assist the situation. That is an argument that can be put, but I do not see much evidence of it. All of the evidence I have seen—human rights reports from around the place, including from the US congress, Human Rights Watch and other bodies—is that, in the oppression leading up to the Olympics, things are actually getting worse. I think the Chinese communist government is well aware, frankly, of what international norms and requirements are, and believes it is in a position to ignore them. The simple fact is that if the Olympics were being held in somewhere like Zimbabwe we would all be boycotting them in an instant. It is because of the political clout of China. We all need to look at that.
I do not think this is just an issue for government; it is an issue for all of us. It is an issue for the corporate sponsors of the Olympics as well, I might say—people like Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Visa and Kodak. The Olympics are not actually about governments; they are about people. I think this is an issue that all of us, as people, need to think about more strongly, and we need to look at ways we can make our horror and concern more strongly known to the Chinese government.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-03-17,"—I rise to support the deep concerns expressed by previous speakers about the current situation in Tibet and to express support for the motion moved by Senator Brown and the comments made on behalf of the opposition by Senator Payne and Senator Humphries. All senators would be concerned about reports and images of the unrest and the security crackdown in Lhasa, and reports of casualties and arrests. While we do not know the exact extent of what has occurred, all Australians would be concerned, along with people around the globe, about the current situation in Tibet. Of course we are all concerned that demonstrations in Melbourne and Sydney turned violent over the weekend. We support the comments of our foreign minister, expressed on behalf of all Australians, calling for the Chinese government and authorities to act with restraint and for those protesting to be allowed to protest peacefully. Finally, we support the government’s call for violence to end quickly and without further casualties.
The peaceful expression of dissent is a critical and fundamental human right. It is a critical human right, which we appropriately take for granted in Australia. We need to continue to press the importance of human rights in general, and the importance of the right to the peaceful expression of dissent in particular, with the Chinese government. Australia of course has a record of expressing its views directly to the Chinese government in a constructive approach based on regular dialogue rather than public confrontation. Australia has a record of encouraging dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Chinese authorities. In that context we support a continuation of the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue. Senator Payne outlined very eloquently the advances that have been achieved in the field of human rights through that vehicle.
The Rudd government will no doubt continue, and indeed ought to continue, down that path pursued by the previous government. Senator Payne very appropriately called on the Prime Minister to raise Australia’s concerns about these latest events directly with the Chinese government during his visit to China next month. In light of his particular affinity and relationship with China, he is likely to be in a better position than perhaps anyone else to press the point in a constructive and outcomes focused way. The reality is that something has to be done to achieve positive change in Tibet, and this should be a good time to do exactly that. The world currently approaches the Beijing Olympics with great excitement and anticipation. The eyes of the world are and will be on China like never before. Of course that necessarily includes a clear focus on China’s human rights record. While the government is right to refuse to call for a boycott of the Olympic Games in Beijing, it is right to say that, by the same token, this is a time when China ought to reflect on the image it wants to project to the world. Incidentally in that context I commend the Dalai Lama for his restraint in not calling for a boycott of the Olympic Games either. In line with all previous speakers, I express my support for the urgency motion and hope that those reported events in Tibet will come to a peaceful conclusion at the earliest opportunity.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Tibet</title>,Matters of Urgency,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-03-17,"—I thank the speakers in this debate for their support for this very important motion. I know it will be taken seriously by the government, and the contents will be conveyed to the Beijing authorities. I note that there are travel warnings, which Senator Faulkner informed us about. However, the reality is that all plane and rail access to Tibet has been shut down by the Chinese authorities and it is very unlikely that anybody can get access to the country. The control over the flow of information—including access for the world to see what is going on in Tibet—is one of the problems that indicate the authoritarian nature of the Beijing authorities. The authorities are still failing by a long way to meet the standards that we take for granted in this country.
The Beijing Olympics are coming up later in the year. This will put the spotlight on China, but that spotlight must also spread to the people of Tibet and elsewhere in China who are left out. There ought to be a Tibet team marching with the rest of the world in the great stadium in Beijing but there will not be. There will not be, because since the 1950s the world has failed to stand up for the Tibetan people and the Tibetan nation. We are now, again, seeing the consequences of that failure as well as the brutality of the regime in Beijing. Australians have consistently, as shown by the polls and through their own activities, been horrified by the repression in Tibet.
One proposal I hope the government will consider is a request to the Chinese authorities to allow a high-level independent government delegation from this country to go to Tibet as part of the dialogue to see what is happening in Tibet. The Chinese authorities have put a different spin on the events there to that coming from the government in exile. Let us see. I would propose to the government that the Prime Minister be requested to take, or that he consider formulating, a high-level government delegation to Tibet to see for themselves what is happening in this beautiful country, which culturally has given so much to the world—not least through the extraordinarily peaceful philosophy of the Dalai Lama—and which still suffers such brutality and repression.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-03-17,"—On behalf of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Mr Tanner, I table a statement on best practice regulation requirements. I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.

The statement read as follows—

Increasing Australia’s long term productive capacity is the key to maintaining downward pressure on inflation and therefore downward pressure on interest rates. As Labor announced prior to the election, a key element in the government’s plan to increase Australia’s productivity is our deregulation agenda.
For the first time, Australia has a cabinet minister for deregulation. This high-level oversight of the government’s deregulation agenda is essential for getting things done.
Myself and the minister assisting on deregulation, Dr Craig Emerson, are working in cooperation with the states and territories through the Council of Australian Governments’ Business Regulation and Competition Working Group to tackle areas of regulatory duplication or inconsistency between different levels of government, such as occupational health and safety laws.
At the federal level, we are already at work undertaking a stock take of existing regulation and taking action where we find unnecessarily burdensome or ineffective regulation.
In partnership with the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, I have set up the Financial Services Reform Working Group to cut back 50- to 80-page product disclosure statements down to the essential information that consumers actually need to know.
And in the coming months I’ll be working with other portfolio ministers to deliver better regulation and better outcomes for the Australian community.
The Rudd Labor government is working towards a culture of continuous regulatory improvement. Under our government, we want more productive relationships between regulators and those they regulate. We want to actively seek out and respond to ideas for improvement all the time.
An important part of this commitment to better quality regulation is ensuring that any proposed new regulations are thoroughly scrutinised so that they are introduced only where necessary and at minimum cost to business and consumers.
I am pleased to announce to the parliament today further details of Labor’s commitment to the best practice regulation requirements and the continuing role of the Office of Best Practice Regulation in their administration.
The Rudd Labor government fully endorses the six principles of good regulatory process identified by the 2006 Banks Taskforce on Reducing Regulatory Burden on Business.
These principles state that governments should not act to address problems until a case for action has been clearly established.  In acting, governments need to consider the benefits and costs of a range of feasible policy options, and then select the one which provides the greatest overall net benefit for the community. Effective guidance should be provided to regulators and regulated parties about the regulation’s policy intent and expected compliance requirements. Then there should also be mechanisms to ensure regulation remains relevant and effective over time as well as effective consultation with regulated parties at all stages of the regulatory cycle.
The Australian government’s Best Practice Regulation Handbook, released in August 2007, sets out best practice regulation requirements in line with these principles. The Rudd Labor government is committed to not just maintaining, but further strengthening these requirements.
Since Labor took office last year, the Office of Best Practice Regulation or OBPR has moved into the Department of Finance and Deregulation. This arrangement better reflects the central role of the OBPR in improving the quality of new regulation through administration of the best practice regulation requirements.
Despite this administrative change, the OBPR will retain its distinct identity. It will continue to be a one-stop-shop to assist departments and agencies to meet the government’s requirements and to assess and report on compliance.
Compliance with the procedures and processes outlined in the Best Practice Regulation Handbook remains mandatory for all Australian government departments, agencies, statutory authorities and boards that make, review or reform regulations. This includes not only ‘black-letter law’ but also quasi-regulation such as rulings, guidance note and standards.
The level of regulatory impact analysis required is greater the more significant the regulatory proposal is likely to be. A preliminary assessment must be undertaken for all regulatory proposals. Proposals likely to involve medium business compliance costs must also have a further full quantitative assessment of compliance cost implications using the Business Cost Calculator or approved equivalent. Proposals likely to have a significant impact require even greater analysis, including compliance cost quantification, to be undertaken and documented in a Regulation Impact Statement (RIS).
The OBPR has responsibility for certifying that compliance costs have been quantified and for assessing the adequacy of RISs. Proposals can generally not proceed to the decision making stage until OBPR certification has been received.
In performing this role, the OBPR is concerned only with the standard of analysis undertaken. It does not endorse or support particular regulatory options or outcomes. Such deregulation policy matters will be dealt with in a separate area of the department as part of the government’s broader agenda for reducing the regulatory burden on Australian businesses and consumers.
To perform its watchdog role effectively, the OBPR needs to exercise its decision making functions in an independent manner.
The government has put in place procedures to ensure neither ministers nor their staff can seek to intervene in or influence the OBPR’s deliberations.
Decisions on the adequacy of a regulatory impact analysis and compliance with the best practice regulation requirements will be made independently by the Executive Director of the OBPR.
As the OBPR is now part of the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the department’s secretary will be able to support the independence of OBPR’s decision making on best practice regulation requirements, helping shield the OBPR executive director from any undue influence, and appropriately advocating and defending the OBPR regulatory assessment process.
The OBPR will also continue to prepare the annual Best Practice Regulation Report. This report outlines compliance with the best practice regulation principles on an agency by agency basis and its public release is an important element in ensuring transparent and accountable regulation making. Publication of the report will be prepared and authorised by the Executive Director of the OBPR and presented to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation as a final report.
These existing arrangements are important to ensure any new regulation is effective and any compliance burden is as small as possible.
Keeping the regulatory burden down is vital to ensure we do not tie people up in unnecessary red tape and compliance regimes.
In a number of areas the Rudd Labor government is moving to further strengthen the transparency of the regulatory impact analysis process.
Rather than waiting until the end of each reporting year to publish adequacy data, the government will require that, in all but exceptional circumstances, a RIS and the OBPR’s assessment of its adequacy will be made public before regulations come into effect.
The best practice regulation requirements will also be amended to require that OBPR assess and make public its assessment of the adequacy of post-implementation review.
The government is truly committed to ongoing, continuous regulatory reform. That is why we have put deregulation front and centre of our agenda to improve Australia’s productivity, to keep inflation as low as possible and to remove unnecessary barriers to people finding well paying, secure jobs.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2008-03-17,"—It is St Patrick’s Day today, and I want to wish you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and everyone else here in the chamber a happy St Patrick’s Day. Isn’t it wonderful to have a day when the Irish can talk to themselves about themselves, no matter where they are?
It does not matter that St Patrick’s arrival in Ireland happened a long time ago, because, in fact, we are known for our long memories, so each year we revisit his story: how he was chased from port to port when he tried to land with his message of Christianity; how he banished the snakes and toads from Ireland; and how he explained the difficult concept of the Trinity to the simple country folk by drawing their attention to the shamrock beneath their feet. I can still remember Miss Kelly telling us all this when I was in first class. In fact, I remember her waxing eloquent as she described how such a talented person as Patrick, so highly educated and well bred, with so much going for him, was obliged to spend half his life on the side of a mountain in the middle of nowhere minding sheep. Poor old Miss Kelly was very Irish. She filled our heads with myths and legends interspersed with the catechism, and she never forgot an injury. Once she hit one of my older sisters so hard that she raised blisters, and my mother dared to visit the school and confront her about it. But back in Ireland in the sixties attitudes were not quite as democratic as they are now. Forever afterwards, all seven of us were known not simply as ‘the Clarke children’ but as ‘the Clarkes whose mother keeps trotting down to the school to complain’.
Yes, that famous Irish long memory has a lot to answer for, and today I want to talk about the business of remembering and forgetting and the importance of finding a balance between the two. I was very young when we moved to Australia, and some of the so-called memories I have are not exactly my own memories; they are part of a nostalgic picture of Ireland that is kept alive in legends and songs, often of loss and pain and the wrongs that had been done to us. They are also fed by hearing the grown-ups talk, often harking back generations to the experiences of relatives and neighbours, which was usually about what they had suffered.
I was entranced by all this while growing up. Of course, as a child—and even later—I did not question why I was so in love with this Irish heritage. I yearned for the time when I had Four Green Fields; I wished I was in Carrickfergus or the green glens of Antrim or the Wicklow Hills or at the Ring of Tara—anywhere over there among the mists of time. So I am very conscious of the power of the traditional image of Ireland and how deeply it is planted in so many hearts. This is the Ireland of St Patrick’s Day celebrations around the world—the ‘Erin’s green valley’ in Hail glorious St Patrick, the hymn of the day. And, if you have ever been to Ireland, can’t you see it in your mind’s eye—the land of tradition and poetry and straight-armed dancing; the country of fiddles and harps—and other brands of lager—that produced Yeats, Joyce, Patrick Kavanagh and Seamus Heaney, among countless others. And there is also the singing: The Dubliners, Christy Moore, John McCormack and Mary Black—songs that hang suspended in our minds.
Mr President, you and I both visited Ireland a year or so ago and found ourselves in a very different country, a new Ireland—much more worldly, outward-looking and economically successful. Although proud of its traditions, instead of being preoccupied with its past it is a nation looking to the future that has finally put an end to centuries-old rivalries with the north and with England and is confident enough to consider itself a partner of its European neighbours. We saw booming cities and young, well-educated professionals. The new affluence marks a country that has virtually reinvented itself as a more pluralistic and open society. It is a country that has self-consciously positioned itself and moulded its government’s policies to take advantage of globalisation and an internationalised political economy.
How did this change happen? Despite its fondness for the old ways, Ireland took a long, hard look at itself and its prospects and came up with a new model of growth, focusing on taxation, technology, talent and tolerance. Tax related incentives were part of the successful plan to actively recruit high-tech companies such as IBM, Dell, Intel and Microsoft. These incentives were enhanced by the pool of talent emerging from the country’s world-class universities and colleges. Since the sixties the Irish government has invested heavily in higher education, and in particular it has fostered the growth of technical skills in electronics and computer-related disciplines through a system of regional technical colleges. So today 60 per cent of Irish university graduates major in engineering, science or business, and with the growing job market they do not need to leave the country to find opportunities or future prospects any more.
These economic developments alone, of course, do not explain the changes in Ireland. Ireland also took a conscious decision to encourage and promote tolerance—to build on the legacy of culture, art and music to create an environment where the software geek and the sharp businesswoman were not excluded but could feel as much at home as the artist, the shop assistant, the office worker and, dare I say, even the politician! The best of the past, including the history and architecture, has been kept to enhance the best of the present. Now we find that 53 per cent of new immigrants to Ireland are Irish citizens returning there from Australia and other countries. And how Ireland values and cultivates its diaspora—something we could certainly learn from here.
This is an example of how change can happen if we are prepared to let things go—not the things of lasting value, but the habits and hurts that are kept alive by feeding on themselves. So here in Australia on St Patrick’s Day we should be remembering and celebrating all things Irish without being dragged back into unhealthy memories or sentimental versions of a life that was grim and hard for most people. Let us enjoy the prosperity at home and abroad—whichever country you call home—and enjoy the fact that we can move between one place and the other with an ease that our parents and grandparents could never have imagined.
What does it mean to be Irish? Certainly it includes the ability to hold on to a triumph or a grievance long past its use-by date. We are told that ‘to err is human and to forgive divine’ but that does not mean that we leave all the forgiveness to the divine—and that it is not necessary for us to do a bit of forgiving and forgetting ourselves. Surely the energy we expend on thinking, holding and remembering grievances is energy that we do not have to spend on other more important issues like making poverty history, strengthening community values or nurturing our young people. This is Ireland’s new agenda: a social inclusion agenda we can learn from, one that is based on foundation principles about caring and sharing, acting honourably, loving tenderly and saying sorry when we should.
Last week Minister Noel Dempsey, the Irish Minister for Transport, visited us here in Canberra. He talked about Ireland’s next stages: reinvesting in infrastructure and education, addressing skills shortages and having an active antipoverty agenda. He talked about tackling homelessness and binge drinking and the challenges that come from becoming such a wealthy country in such a short time. It made me proud to be Irish, and it all sounded so familiar—the Rudd government’s agenda for building the Australia we want to see.
I hope St Patrick showers his blessings down on you today, and that they help all of us here in the chamber let go of any grievances that we have been holding onto for too long. I want to take this opportunity to say to my colleagues and staff how grateful I was for the support and care shown to me by those on both sides of the Senate when Dad passed away in the last sitting week before the election. I was very touched by your concern for us all. He would have loved to be listening today—although, as the Irish would say, of course he is.

Is the Minister aware that the International Energy Agency (IEA) considers that coal‑fired power stations which are more than 10 years old may not be able to be retro‑fitted with clean coal technology without expensive upgrades.
How many coal‑fired power stations in Australia are: (a) between 10 and 20 years old; (b) between 20 and 30 years old; (c) between 30 and 40 years old; and (d) more than 40 years old.
Is the Minister aware that the Owen Inquiry into Electricity Supply in New South Wales (Owen inquiry): (a) suggested energy losses of up to 30 per cent if greenhouse gases are captured and stored; and (b) indicated that clean coal technology is unlikely to be ready before 2020.
Does the Government have any evidence that contradicts the IEA and the Owen inquiry advice; if so, what is that evidence.
Will criteria for the proposed $500 million National Clean Coal Fund take into account views of the IEA and the Owen inquiry; if so, in what way.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Coal</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,23,1,question
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2008-03-17,"—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:
Yes. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (2005), a number of factors will affect the deployment of retrofit carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies, including:
cost;
plant efficiencies;
availability of land for capture equipment; and
the remaining life of the plant.
While it is true that older plants tend to have lower efficiencies, it is economics rather than age that will most affect decision making. With carbon dioxide capture and compression needing 10-40 per cent more energy than an equivalent plant without capture, the net output of a low efficiency plant will be more greatly affected if fitted with a capture system, which will have a greater impact on the plant’s competitiveness in the market.
(2)   According to the Energy Supply Association of Australia’s report, Electricity Gas Australia 2007, coal-fired power stations in Australia are of the following age:
(a)   6 are between 10 to 20 years old.
(b)   9 are between 20 and 30 years old.
(c)   9 are between 30 and 40 years old.
(d)   4 are older than 40 years.
6 coal-fired power stations are less than 10 years old.
(3)   (a) and (b) Yes. I am aware that the Owen Inquiry reached these conclusions
(4)   There have been a range of views expressed on possible timeframes. The Government is committed to a National Clean Coal Fund (NCCF) to support the accelerated deployment of clean coal technologies. With approximately 80 percent of our electricity coming from coal, the deployment of these technologies will play a key role in meeting Australia’s emission reduction targets.
(5)   A whole range of environmental, economic and social factors, including energy consumption and power plant efficiency, will need to be considered before Commonwealth funding is approved for any clean coal project under the NCCF.
The NCCF will provide funding for development and demonstration of clean coal technologies to ensure Australia is commercially ready to roll out the technology by 2020, which corresponds to the time estimates of the Owen Inquiry.
Clean coal technologies incorporating CCS are still in pre-commercialisation stage, so funding from the NCCF will be aimed at scaled-up demonstration projects which have lower energy requirements and less disruption to a plant’s current operations than a full scale commercial retrofit.
The Minister for Resources and Energy, the Hon Martin Ferguson AM MP, has portfolio responsibility for the NCCF.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Coal</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,23,1,answer
