"Reith, Peter, MP",LP,1999-06-24,"—by leave—Mr Speaker:
Overview
A full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has reported on the feasibility of replacing junior rates with non-discriminatory alternatives. The tabling of the report in this parliament, and its subsequent distribution to interested parties and the wider community, should now be a catalyst for the resolution of the policy and political impasse which has dogged the future of junior wages in Australia for most of this decade.
The report is an extensive body of work commissioned by this legislature, conducted over six months in an inquisitorial manner rather than the more traditional adversarial approach of commission litigation. It follows an independent public inquiry by the commission that drew together oral and written submissions from all major stakeholders, including most of the historical participants in this debate. Being an inquisitorial process, the report makes no orders, decisions or recommendations but, in its own words, assists in resolving issues about the content of legislation and may serve to inform debate and future industrial policy (p. 8).
The challenge for this parliament
The report concludes that the commission could not find any feasible non-discriminatory alternatives to age based junior rates of pay. Such a finding is crucial to the central policy questions that now confront this parliament.
Will the parliament legislate to permanently retain the existing system of junior rates? Will it remove the statutory scheme first introduced by the Keating government in 1993 which prima facie declares junior rates to be discriminatory and not to be made or, where made, to be removed?
In the light of this report, these questions must now be unequivocally answered in the affirmative. Junior rates must stay, and where appropriate be extended throughout the work force.
The opportunist political cover behind which the Labor Party and its leadership chose to hide on this issue has been its calls for an AIRC inquiry.
That cover has now disappeared. The AIRC has reported. The Labor Party is exposed. Its political posturing has now been revealed as a sham. It has misread the debate and mislead the community, hoping beyond hope that an alternative would emerge behind which it could again cower in shallow opposition. Yet the commission has rightly repudiated each and every Labor sponsored alternative as being fundamentally flawed and in some cases even itself discriminatory.
As unpalatable as it may be, Labor now has to do what the public interest dictated many 
 months ago—make a real decision: a choice between protecting jobs for young Australians in urban, regional and rural areas or negative, opposition for opposition's sake posturing.
There is no doubt that this is a dilemma for Mr Beazley, who only this week outlined to his caucus that over the coming months Labor could be portrayed in a negative position on industrial relations.
If Labor repudiates this report from the independent umpire and again rejects the coalition's legislation to rectify Labor's flawed policy to abolish junior wages then it imposes not just a self-inflicted wound of negativity but, more importantly, jeopardises the jobs of tens of thousands of young Australians.
The AIRC conclusions
In reaching its conclusions on this central issue, the report supports the core propositions that the federal coalition government and the governments of Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have consistently advanced in this debate and before the commission. These conclusions are:
.	 That there is an undisputable relationship between junior rates, their potential abolition and the employment prospects of young people (pp. xiv; 157, 165);
.	 That a discounted pay rate for entry level work continues to be necessary in the areas in which employment under junior rate classifications is most concentrated, and that well-designed junior rate classifications may even create or protect employment opportunities, including in the building and construction industries (pp. xiii, xvi, 140-141, 189, 191, 201);
.	 That the system of junior rates has been used as a wage reference for young people for decades, is simple to understand and administer and has active employment under it (pp. x; xv, 65-66, 138);
.	 That none of the proposed alternatives to junior rates are feasible because they either are more complex, overvalue the work of employees, are themselves discriminatory or have considerable adverse cost effects (p. ix, 168-172, 206-212);
.	 That the removal of junior rates or the introduction of adult rates at 18 years would significantly disemploy young Australians—that is, lead to large scale job losses (pp. xiv, 165, 207);
.	 That the current legislative scheme, unless amended by the parliament, amounts to a rebuttable presumption that junior rates be removed from June 2000 (pp. xi; 88);
.	 That, for a range of reasons, the labour force participation of young people is already relatively parlous and relatively scarce, and that changes that might have the effect of significantly increasing the relative cost of teenage labour beyond its real value to an employer may make teenage employment even more precarious, especially in regional and country Australia (pp. xiii, xiv; 151, 154, 199);
.	 That if young people are to secure entry level employment and progress to economic self-sufficiency through paid employment they more than ever need to be competitive in the labour market (pp. x, 15);
.	 That junior rates are often a useful bridge to full-time employment, especially for the educationally better qualified (p. xv); and
.	 That the government submissions on the youth labour market and on the adverse consequences for young people on the abolition of junior rates have been broadly adopted, and that similar conclusions by bodies such as the Productivity Commission are supported (pp. xiii; 154, 163-165).
The junior wage debate
Before turning to the details of the report, it is necessary to put the AIRC's inquiry into the context of the wider debate over junior rates.
Junior rates have been a feature of the wages system in Australia since early this century. Age based junior rates of pay are set as a percentage of the adult rate, and usually increase annually until adult rates are payable. Over 400,000 young people under 21 are paid junior wages—this represents over half of all employed young people in Australia.
Junior rates have been under direct legislative threat since the Labor government of 
 1993. Under the existing provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, the continuation of junior rates in awards cannot be guaranteed after 22 June 2000.
Because of the importance of junior rates for getting young people into jobs, the coalition government's preferred position has always been that junior rates should be allowed to continue indefinitely. In 1996 the government agreed as a temporary measure to extend the then exemption for a further three years, and to put in place a mechanism for the AIRC to review the feasibility of abolishing junior rates of pay. This reflected a compromise position only agreed to by the government as a way of avoiding Labor's legislated removal of junior wages. The coalition agreed to the review on the clear understanding that our policy would continue to be for the retention of junior rates and that we would seek a mandate for this legislation at the next election, which we did—and obtained.
The AIRC report
The AIRC report was prepared by a full bench of the commission to fulfil the requirements of section 120B of the WRA which requires a full bench to prepare a report assessing one primary question and three secondary questions.
No feasible non-discriminatory alternatives exist
The primary question answered by the inquiry was whether there are any feasible non-discriminatory alternatives to junior rates. The AIRC could not find any feasible non-discriminatory alternatives (paragraph [2] of the summary). Those who want junior rates abolished had every opportunity to put alternatives to the inquiry. Many tried to do so. The Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association and the CFMEU all took up the challenge and put alternatives to the inquiry. Not one of these proposals were found by the full bench to qualify as non-discriminatory and feasible.
The first of the secondary questions considered by the inquiry was whether it is desirable to replace junior rates with non- 
discriminatory alternatives. The full bench concludes that an assessment of the desirability of replacing junior rates would require a balance to be struck between the pros and cons of junior rates. It considered that no useful purpose would be served by the bench making that kind of assessment in the abstract (paragraph 4.4.3).
Significant disemploying effects if junior rates abolished
The next secondary question considered by the report was an assessment of the consequences for youth employment of abolishing junior rates. The inquiry found that the removal and non-replacement of the existing wage discounts embodied in junior rates would have significant disemploying effects for young people (paragraph 5.6.12). The report notes that this finding was not seriously challenged by the participants in the inquiry. The report indicates that, when given the opportunity to respond to this finding, the ACTU did not seek to address directly the finding or the substantial weight of economic opinion on which it is based.
Significantly, the inquiry then used its finding about the disemploying effects of removing junior rates to assess the consequences for youth employment of alternatives that would apply adult rates at 18. The inquiry found that for most 18 year olds and above the application of full adult rates would cause an overvaluation of the work performed and would be expected to reduce the employment prospects of the 18- to 20-years-old age group (paragraph 5.8.7).
Junior rates have high utility value
The third of the secondary questions addressed by the report was the utility of junior rates for different types of employment, for different industries, and in the school to work transition. The inquiry found that well-designed junior rate classifications, framed to reduce capacity to exploit the use of them, may justifiably be used for creating or protecting employment opportunities for young people (paragraph [9](v) of the summary). The report also concluded that the role and usefulness of junior rates is best demonstrated in the school to work transition, and in school and work interfaces (paragraph 6.4.11).
The inquiry found that junior rates had high utility for the retail industry and the hospitality and accommodation industries (paragraph 6.3.1). Significantly, the report also concludes that an expanded application of junior rates in the building and construction industry could, with some qualifications, result in expanded opportunities for youth employment (paragraph 6.3.14).
Additional independent support for junior rates
The AIRC also noted the existence of strong economic evidence in support of its conclusions. The AIRC report made use of a major study by the Productivity Commission entitled Youth wages and employment. That found that a one per cent increase in youth wages would lead to a decrease in youth employment of two per cent in the retail industry, five per cent in the accommodation industry, and 2.5 per cent in the cultural and recreational services industry.
This is consistent with the overwhelming body of international and Australian evidence, ranging from one of the world's leading authorities on labour demand Professor Daniel Hamermesh, to the Australian Retailers Association which estimated that 170,000 to 180,000 junior jobs would be lost from the retail industry alone if junior rates were abolished.
Recently both the UK Low Pay Commission established by the Blair Labour government and the Irish National Minimum Wage Commission recognised the need to discount minimum wages for young people to ensure they are not disadvantaged in the labour market.
In fact, the Blair Labour government not only received the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission recommending a minimum junior rate but then proceeded of its own motion to further discount that recommended minimum out of concern for the youth labour market.
Every state and territory government in Australia has the power to legislate to end the use of junior rates. None have done so. Other OECD countries that have minimum wages that provide significant protection for the low 
 paid also typically have lower minimum wages for young people.
The government's youth employment bill
The AIRC report is overwhelming evidence in the case for retaining our system of junior rates and making junior rates more widely available. The continued existence of junior rates is essential to protect the employment prospects of young people. They help young people get that first foothold in the labour market that is critically important for their future career. With teenage unemployment above 24 per cent, everything possible must be done to assist young people into work.
Of course, the preservation and expansion of junior rates is not the whole answer to reducing youth unemployment. Rather, it is an integral element of the government's strategy that includes a well-managed growing economy, initiatives to increase school retention rates and raise literacy and numeracy standards, the expansion of the apprenticeship system and the assistance provided to unemployed youth through the Job Network and mutual obligation.
Our response to the need to protect junior rates is the  Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Youth Employment) Bill 1998 , which the government introduced last November. The bill, when passed, would preserve and enhance the job prospects of young people by protecting the existing system of junior rates and, where appropriate, by extending junior rates to awards that do not currently contain them. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 10 February 1999 but was rejected by the Senate on 8 March 1999.
In light of the AIRC report and because of the important role junior rates play in getting young people into jobs, the government will be reintroducing the youth employment bill. A number of members who previously spoke against the bill did so on the ground that it should not have been brought forward until after the tabling of the commission's report on junior rates. Their initial opposition to the bill appears to have been determined by timing and process issues, rather than by the merits of the bill itself. This difficulty that some members had with the initial bill has now 
 been removed. And, as I said earlier, the Labor Party must now come clean with a position for or against junior wages and youth employment.
On behalf of the government and all of the members, I thank the full bench of the AIRC for its important work on this matter of public importance, as well as the participants to the inquiry. I commend the report to this parliament and urge honourable members to use its conclusions as the basis for setting aside past policy differences and securing the passage of the government's youth employment bill when I reintroduce it into this place. I advise the House I intend to reintroduce it this afternoon, with the overwhelming support of the conclusions of the commission's report, which supports the propositions which this government has been advancing in the public debate for some time now. I commend the commission's report to the House.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Report of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission Junior Rates Inquiry Conducted Under Section 120B of the Workplace Relations Act 1996</title>,Ministerial Statements,7,1
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—by leave—Members of this House will know that it is customary for reports and ministerial statements of this kind to be dealt with after question time—indeed, the Notice Paper  includes such a provision. The rather extraordinary process of dealing with this matter in the morning has obviously been done to facilitate the minister's intention, just announced, to introduce laws on this matter this afternoon into the parliament. The simple fact is that, when this government wants to legislate quickly, it can do it within hours and, when it comes to stripping away from people in the work force some of their entitlements, it seems to be able to do that with rapidity. Today's events are reminiscent of the Patrick fiasco, which saw this minister introduce laws into parliament within hours of the Patrick employees being dismissed. Again, we see today a report tabled in the morning with laws introduced in the afternoon. When the government wants to reduce workers' rights, it can do it straight away. When it is asked to defend workers' rights, like the entitlements of the Oakdale workers, it drags the chain for a couple of years and then says that it needs more time to talk. The comparison could not be more stark.
There is in fact no urgency confronting the parliament in dealing with the important matters that are contained in the AIRC's report. The existing laws provide for a continuation of junior rates until June of next year. The industrial commission has spent the best part of the last six to eight months reviewing evidence and considering this matter, and the parties to it have been involved in submissions and preparation of work for more than a year. That work which has gone on over the past year is now to be considered by the parliament within hours of a 350-page report being presented to the parliament. There is no urgency, as the government and the minister claim, for the parliament to deal with this matter. The current laws will continue the operation of junior rates of pay at least until June 2000.
It is important to also put on the record again the fact that the existing laws do not abolish junior rates of pay in June of next year. They provide for case by case extension in any award where any employer—or any union, for that matter—wishes to see junior rates continue. It is not a blanket exclusion of junior rates, but I do accept—and I will make comment later—that there is some need to review that position. But it is important to place on the record, to correct the impression this government continually presents, that there is no urgency for the June 2000 deadline, or beyond that in fact, because junior rates can, under the existing laws, continue beyond it.
The Australian Labor Party welcomes the Industrial Relations Commission report that has been presented to the parliament today, and I will take this opportunity to thank the commission for their efforts in dealing comprehensively with a very complex and difficult situation and trying to balance a range of competing interests. It is also worth recording that the document before us provided by the commission does not actually contain any recommendations. It does not contain any decisions, and it does not contain any orders. But it is a very valuable contribution to the debate—some 350-odd pages, which the opposition has now had something approaching two hours to look at, from a government 
 that intends to introduce legislation this afternoon on that matter. I make the point that, in the process of dealing with this important issue, the government should not seek to use their numbers to guillotine debate on this matter as they have done on other industrial relations issues since the last election. They should not seek to guillotine it through this House when we resume—I assume that will be in August—but they should facilitate a full and proper debate in the parliament on the matter so that members can digest the 350-page report in a little more time than we have had this morning.
The crux of the issue that the commission was asked to look at is whether there is an identifiable replacement system for junior rates in those awards in which junior rates apply. It will come as no surprise to those in this parliament or listening to the broadcast to learn that the minister has been very selective in the way in which he has gone about quoting from the report. He has been selective today in quoting from the report, and he was certainly selective in the leaks that were provided to the Financial Review over the last week.
Mr Brough interjecting—
—The interjection is that the leaks were provided by the union. For the benefit of members of the government, the simple fact is that this was a report which was not held by the unions. There were copies—
—Yes, it was.
—That was the exposure draft, not the final document. They are, in fact, different documents, and they say different things. The simple fact is that those things that were in the press in the last week were only known to the commission and to the minister. The simple fact of life is that it was released not by the commission but by the minister in a selective way to try to precondition the debate, to put out there in the public mind the Peter Reith window through which we are all supposed to look at this document.
I want to go to some of the things in the document, in the very short time we have available to us, to demonstrate just how selective the minister has been. At paragraph 
 2 the AIRC makes this comment in relation to the core question of finding an identifiable replacement for junior rates of pay:
We do not close off the possibility that there are feasible alternatives . . . We were already persuaded that in the design of replacement of junior rate classifications no one size fits all. The fit of an alternative is a matter of attention to detail and the merits in particular circumstances.
That is a view with which we agree. The question of how this matter should now be progressed clearly is one of case-by-case analysis, and the commission report makes that plain. The commission does not come to a conclusion that it is not possible to replace junior rates—quite the contrary. Nor does it come to the conclusion that it is not desirable to replace junior rates—quite the contrary. The commission's report says that this is a matter that requires further consideration and it requires analysis case by case, award by award, industry by industry, and only then can you make meaningful determinations on this matter.
We support that view. There is no need for the political impasse that the minister referred to and will no doubt try to make great play of during the debate on this matter. There is no need for that political impasse, because if the minister and this government are willing to accept the commission's view that this is a matter that requires consideration case by case, they will have our support on that. But to date the government have given no indication that that is the approach they will adopt. In fact, the government have already announced their intention to reintroduce into the parliament this very day laws that prevent that happening.
So, far from endorsing the commission's report, we have a government again intending to flout the very wishes of the commission. But that should not come as a surprise. Throughout this entire process the government and this minister have done everything they can to intimidate and stand over the commission to try to force it to a view of its liking, including through endeavouring to legislate over the top of the commission inquiry in the very month in which the commission was commencing its work. So it is important at the outset to record that the impasse the 
 minister argues is of concern to him is, in fact, an impasse he wants. There need be no political impasse in this matter if the government is willing to accept the core findings of the report and allow this to be dealt with case by case.
One size does not fit all when it comes to looking at the question of youth wages across Australian industry. There are varying circumstances from industry to industry, even from enterprise to enterprise in some circumstances. The proper way in which that should be dealt with is to go through that process and ensure that equity prevails in a commonsense way. There is no comfort for the government out of this report. Their plan to indefinitely keep junior rates flies in the face of those points contained in the report to which I just referred. Their plan to go beyond that and actually force the commission to apply junior rates of pay into areas that do not currently have junior rates of pay is clearly in breach of the approach adopted by the commission in the report the minister has tabled today. Yet, in spite of that, the government will seek to introduce legislation this afternoon that would have that effect.
It is worth actually pointing out that, when we look at the government's proposal in relation to junior rates and the extension of them, the government and the minister regularly refer to the extension of junior rates where that is `appropriate'. Most people who hear that actually take the word `appropriate' in its commonsense usage. In fact, that is not what the government intends. The explanatory memorandum to the legislation explains what the government means by the words `appropriate extension of junior wages' in this context. It defines `appropriate' as any situation in which an award exists where someone under 21 years of age could be employed. It does not matter whether they are employed, but if they could be employed there then the government requires the commission to introduce a junior rates clause. The memorandum gives the exclusions:
For example, under some awards the employment of people under a certain age is effectively precluded for reasons such as legally imposed age barriers (for example, in relation to legal driving ages) . . .  

In other words, the government's own memorandum says that, unless the law prevents someone under 21 working in the area, then the commission has to put the junior rates scale in. That is totally in contravention of the approach adopted by the Industrial Relations Commission on this matter.
The Labor Party takes the view that we should be pursuing a training wage approach to those people who are juniors and who are under 18 years of age. The question of how you deal with this issue is important. The school to work transition is complex, but it is vitally important to the future of young Australians and the future of our nation. Education, training and experience determine a person's employability. We should be structuring laws that give young people opportunity across all of those areas. Our wages system needs to be structured to take that into account. But it is part of a broader process. Regrettably, the Liberal Party have a one-dimensional approach when it comes to youth employment: it is to reduce youth wages and to ignore the educational and social aspects of development of young people and the importance that holds for their future and for the nation's future.
I note also that the commission made some comment in relation to the operation of junior rates in the building industry. In looking at the operation of those junior rates, it made the observation that it thought there were some alternatives to simply revising a junior rates provision in that area. The commission has actually suggested that junior rates in the construction and building industry—that industry which is so important to this minister and which has been the target of his frustrations; this minister has been exhorting employers in the construction industry to pull on a Patrick style dispute and is somewhat frustrated that they do not want to enter into industrial Armageddon as part of his political campaign—should not necessarily be revived in that industry. It noted that a better outcome could be achieved by revisiting the training contract options for young people. We are very prepared to look at that because we see the importance of the training connection—not just as a question of wages but as an issue 
 of skilling and experience for our young people as they move into adulthood and greater responsibility in the work force.
The current system is discriminatory. That is a fact that should be acknowledged. Indeed, Mr Reith's own department in its submission to the Industrial Relations Commission acknowledged that it is discriminatory. So we should not be here debating whether or not we have a discriminatory system; we should be here debating how best we can go about removing the discrimination in a way that is responsible for all involved.
The next step in the process along that track is to have the matters dealt with specifically: for there to be a specific application dealing with a particular award and a particular industry—that is, the case-by-case consideration that the commission itself acknowledged was the appropriate course to follow. We take the view that the onus of proof in that rests with the party seeking to alter the status quo. That is, for example, if a union were seeking to remove a junior rates clause and replace it, let us say, with a competency based clause, the onus of proof would rest with the union to demonstrate its case for that change. Equally, if this government or an employer were to argue for an extension of junior rates into areas that presently do not have them, we would say that the onus of proof would rest with them to justify that extension.
Clearly, that is not the government's view as, within minutes of releasing the report, the government had announced that it intended to press ahead with its bill—and I would be interested to know what consideration the report had in government ranks because the government simply pressed ahead with what was its position months ago. The government has decided to ignore the evidence contained in the report and to ignore the role of the umpire to deal with these matters case by case and to tie the umpire's hands by requiring it to make a certain decision that fits with the government's political dogma.
We take the opposite view: the umpire should be allowed to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis with the onus of proof resting on those who seek the change. This government wants to tie the AIRC's hands, 
 and we will not support that. The umpire should be allowed to do its job. Necessarily, for case-by-case decisions to be taken in which the onus of proof rests with the party wishing to make the change, such a situation would require an alteration to the existing laws. We acknowledge that and, if the government is willing to look at a process whereby the umpire is allowed to do its work on a case-by-case basis, we will work with the government towards some adjustments in that area.
I conclude by reminding the parliament that there need be no political impasse out of this. I think the Industrial Relations Commission has done a fine job; it has presented us with a report that sets out the arguments and the complexity of the issue before us. We have an opportunity now to move ahead together; to allow the umpire to do its work, without hindrance from this government or this minister, and look at cases on their merits and place the onus of proof on those seeking change. If the government is willing to take that view, then the parliament can move ahead in a united fashion.
But, if the government intends to persist with its divisive and biased approach to this issue with its intention to restrict the powers of the commission and tie its hands in relation to junior rates, we will continue to have a major dispute in this parliament and in this community on an issue which we now have the opportunity to pursue on a more common footing. So I urge the minister to step back from his legislation. Rather than for him to rush in this afternoon, trying to push that legislation through, he should step back, look at the report and consider the options that we have put before the parliament today.
Motion (by Ms Worth) proposed:
That the House take note of the papers.
Debate (on motion by Mr McMullan) adjourned.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Report of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission Junior Rates Inquiry Conducted Under Section 120B of the Workplace Relations Act 1996</title>,Ministerial Statements,7,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—The opposition will not be opposing this motion, but I just want to say one or two things about it. It is not a particularly attractive or convenient way of dealing with the matters before us just because they all have the word `Telstra' in them. The various amendments to the bills run across a wide range of issues, deal with radically different matters and require quite different debate. It is going to force the debate into a bit of an artificial straitjacket. Therefore, it is not the best way to deal with it. It is not the way we would have desired to deal with it and it is not going to facilitate the easiest management of the issue from here on.
Given that we received the usual amount of consultation about this, which is we found out about it when the government had decided to do it, we did not have any chance to come to an agreement about a better way of dealing with it which we might have been able to suggest. Next time, if anybody wants to try to find a better way, they are welcome to come and talk to us about it. I indicate our marked lack of enthusiasm for this approach. But we want to talk about the substance, not the process, so we will not oppose the motion.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",REPS,<title>TELSTRA (TRANSITION TO FULL PRIVATE OWNERSHIP) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders</title>,Bills,9,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—The ACIS Administration Bill 1999 , the ACIS (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 1999  and the Customs Tariff Amendment (ACIS Implementation) Bill 1999  are very important pieces of legislation to the future of the car industry and component manufacturing in Australia. They are very important also to the Corio electorate, which encompasses the great city of Geelong, because we have located there a major car manufacturing plant as well as a significant car component manufacturing capacity. 
The  Customs Tariff Amendment (ACIS Implementation) Bill 1999  implements the tariff pause. The  ACIS Administration Bill 1999  and the  ACIS (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 1999  implement the transitional assistance arrangements for the car industry. These will be very important if the industry is to prepare itself for the program of tariff reductions that have been signalled by the government in this legislation.
The car industry is extremely important to my electorate. As I have mentioned, we have a major car manufacturer in Geelong in Ford, and we have several important component producers who employ a lot of people. Also, to give you an idea of the size of this industry and its importance to the national economy, around 55,000 people are employed in car and component manufacturing in Australia. It is an industry that has a turnover in excess of $14 billion and, in gross turnover terms, that represents about seven per cent of total manufacturing turnover. It is an industry that exports now over $2 billion.
We do not have to go back very far—indeed, only into the early eighties, when the major restructuring of this great Australian industry began—to see the enormous gains that have been made in the car and component industry's export performance. Back in the early eighties, we had a car and component industry that was only exporting several hundred million dollars worth of product, and companies engaged in export were quite few and far between. However, we now have a very dynamic car and component manufacturing sector. It has an appropriate focus to export in that we see it now exporting in the region of $2 billion, with projected growth very favourable indeed.
The significance of this particular industry is the fact that it is one of the core manufacturing industries in Australia off which many others feed. The car and component industry is a major purchaser of steel products; it is a major purchaser of paint; and it is a major purchaser of glass, rubber and textile products, and other ancillary industries that supply the car and component industry in this country. Therefore, that industry's importance to Australia's overall manufacturing perform 
 ance cannot be underestimated. It is a very significant industry nationally. It is a major employer, a major exporter, a major generator of research and development within the manufacturing sector, and it has linkages not only to other important manufacturing industries but also to service industries throughout the economy.
As far as my electorate is concerned, the car and component industry is the largest single employer of skilled labour in the Geelong area. The Ford Motor Co. employs around 2,500 people and, when you take into consideration component manufacturers like Henderson Springs and Pilkington, we have the further employment of around 1,200. So, in the totality of the Geelong region, it is of huge significance as an employer. Of course, flowing from that company is the important demand for goods and services that it generates for many smaller businesses within the local community and regional economy of Geelong.
I might mention that, if you took a wider circle which encompassed the great regional city of Ballarat, that city also has significant manufacturing employment, with around 1,300 people employed in automobile component manufacturing there. Looking at regional Victoria, if you drew a radius showing an hour's drive time around Geelong, you would have some 5,000 highly skilled people employed in motor vehicle and component manufacturing.
I cannot understate the economic importance of car and component manufacturing to my electorate. But there are other dimensions to the car industry's involvement in Geelong. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, being a great fan of Australian football and a hot Demons supporter, you would know as well as I do that these days it takes a lot of money to put an AFL side on the field. In Geelong we are very proud of our football side, despite its losses. We won five on the trot, we have lost seven on the trot, but we will come home with a strong breeze. I have great confidence in the coach, the players and the committee of our football club. I also have great confidence in the football club's major sponsor, which is the Ford Motor Co.
Geelong is able to profile itself in two ways, not only to the rest of Australia but also to the world: (1) through the quality cars that are produced in the Geelong manufacturing facility, and (2) through the football side that we put on the field in the national competition. We cannot underestimate the economic importance of the latter because when the footy side wins that has spin-offs for local businesses. The Ford Motor Co. is a major and important sponsor. It is also a good corporate citizen in Geelong. It has been a strong supporter of the football club that gives us a national sporting profile as one of the only regional based AFL clubs in the competition.
The Ford Motor Co. is also a contributor to what I guess you could call the cultural dimension in our fair city. It has recently opened a museum which will become a very important part of the tourist infrastructure of the Geelong region. We rely not only on the capacity of the car and component industry to provide employment for skilled Geelong people but also on what comes with the car and component manufacturing—and that is the sporting and cultural linkages. It is an extremely important industry that the total community takes a very strong interest in.
The Geelong community has been involved in several campaigns to ensure that, if protection levels were reduced in this particular industry, appropriate transitional arrangements were put in place by the government of the day. That certainly applied when the Labor Party in government embarked on a fairly significant program of structural adjustment in the industry. At that time there were very strong community campaigns. My predecessor the Hon. Gordon Scholes, who was a great member for Corio, was heavily involved in those campaigns, as was the Geelong Trades Hall Council, ably led by John Kranz, and the vehicle builders union with Russell Gardner and Harry Bartz. They were all very strong campaigners for car workers to ensure that, if adjustments were going to be made to the industry, there would be minimal disruption to our local manufacturing capacity and to the flow-on effects in the electorate.
 I am sad to say that the support that had been shown by the local councils of the day, the local business communities, the union movement of the day and by the general community to the car industry was not given by the member for Corangamite who, on the other side of the Barwon River, around the Hewson era strongly articulated the zero tariff proposal by the year 2000. That was the policy of the Liberal Party which, if implemented today, would have seen the decimation of car manufacturing and car component manufacturing in Geelong.
No adjustment, no careful planning for this industry, no real refocusing of its efforts to the export area, and no extractive guarantees from the car companies that if transitional arrangements were put in place they would reciprocate with higher employment levels—none of those were looked at. The member for Corangamite argued the low tariff position early at a time when the industry was not prepared for those sorts of changes. Many people questioned the member for Corangamite's bona fides in this regard. Did he really have the interests of car workers, many of whom lived on the other side of the Barwon River in Corangamite but travelled into Corio to earn their daily living? We were disappointed that the honourable member for Corangamite did not take a proactive role, along with the rest of the community, in ensuring that the adjustment process in this industry took place over a long period of time so that the companies could maintain their levels of employment. 
 In 1997 we had what you would call the notorious Productivity Commission report into this industry. The recommendations in that were not acceptable to the Geelong community. They were not acceptable to the trade union movement or to the unions that have coverage in this great regional industry in Geelong. We as a community rallied once again against those proposals. We rallied around the flag and the plan that had been put forward by the then shadow industry minister, the member for Hotham. It was a very strong industry plan and one that eventually the government of the day adopted in most of its aspects. We did not complain at the time. The 
 only person who was complaining was the member for Corangamite because he was a supporter of the majority position. If he had stayed true to form and that majority position had been implemented, we would have seen the decimation of Geelong's car and component manufacturing capacity. But the community rallied, we made very strong submissions to the federal government and they announced the plan. It is that plan which is the subject of this legislation today.
I will not go into the fine detail of the arrangements that are outlined in this bill because they have been adequately canvassed by the shadow minister for industry, my good colleague the member for Canberra. But I have two very strong reservations about the legislation we are debating here today. They are the subject of the second reading amendment we have moved. We understand that the industry really wants this legislation to go through, and we are going to support it. But the first thing is this. This is an inordinate delay for an essential piece of legislation which gives effect to the transitional arrangements that are going to be required by the car and component industry if it is going to stay in the ring, retain its manufacturing capacity, increase its employment and increase its exports.
We had the genesis, the framework, the outline of this plan in 1997. It has taken 1½ to two years for the government to put this legislation on the deck and give effect to the announcements they made. The one thing this industry, along with others, requires is certainty. It needs a certain economic environment in which to invest, to reskill, to retool, to redirect its activities. Those things cannot be done in short periods of time. This industry wants as much certainty as we can give it about its production and economic environment. Sadly, we did not get it from the government.
This legislation kept being put back. We had the announcement I think in 1997, and what month are we in? We are in the month of June 1999. It has taken the government until June 1999 to get a bit of legislation on the deck to give effect to the legislative arrangements we need to make for this very 
 important industry for Geelong and for Australia.
The second thing I am very concerned about is the fact that the government has not made provision in this legislation for a review of how the industry is progressing before the tariff drops in 2005. This is a very dangerous situation for this industry and for communities that depend very much on it for their survival. We have argued consistently with the government that the review ought to take place around 2003, not in 2005 after the government has dropped the tariff by five percentage points. It makes no logical sense to do it then because we will not be in command of the full facts insofar as how this industry is making the transition to the lower tariff regime. We will not have in place the sort of information about how our trading partners are responding to the imperatives that we have all signed up to in the Bogor declaration and other trade related agreements. These are very serious omissions in this bill.
But the uncertainty does not stop there. If uncertainty was created by the length of time that it has taken to bring the legislation here, and if further uncertainty is going to be created by the fact that the government has not put the review mechanism in, we now have a new uncertainty, and that is the impact of the GST—that infamous GST—on the car industry. Recently the head of Ford has rung the bell on a real potential drop in demand that may occur from now until the introduction of the GST. This may well affect the production schedules of the company and could at the end of the day lead to corrective actions being taken which will impact on car workers in my electorate. It is a sad situation that the government has not seen fit to address this problem. (Time expired)
—Before I call the honourable member for Hindmarsh, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this bill, the ACIS Administration Bill 1999, and the ACIS (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 1999 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (ASIS Implementation) Bill 1999. ",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,1999-06-24,"—There is nothing like a local member trying to win favour with his constituents by rewriting history and calling black white and white black, as did the member for Corio. As indicated by the previous speakers, this package of ACIS bills is an indication of the government's long-term commitment to the automotive industry and Australia's international obligation. It follows a commitment that the Howard government made in June 1997 that tariffs would be frozen from 2000 to 2004 at 15 per cent before being reduced to 10 per cent in 2005.
At the same time, this package brings into reality the government's commitment to introduce a new assistance scheme to replace in 2000 the Export Facilitation Scheme which, in providing duty credits solely for exports, is regarded as a subsidy on exports, contrary to WTO rules.
Comprising five per cent of GDP, the automotive industry is a key Australian industry. It has a $15 billion turnover, a $7 billion value of production by motor vehicle manufacturers and $3.8 billion worth of production by component manufacturers. Almost 300,000 Australians are employed directly or indirectly by the automotive industry, comprising 3.4 per cent of the total work force. It adds $1.7 billion to the balance of trade and $4.5 billion to tax revenue.
The automotive industry is also a leading influence in the development and production of new products and processes, with the transport equipment sector leading the manufacturing sector in the use of technologies. Forty-one per cent of all robots installed in Australian industry in 1995 were in the automotive industry. The automotive industry is also a nursery of labour for skills in the manufacturing and technology sector. The transport equipment sector has relatively high expenditure in training, with expenditure per employee significantly greater than the industry as a whole. The number of establishments using advanced manufacturing techniques such as total quality control, just in time, manufacturing resource planning and lean manufacturing is higher in the transport sector than in all other areas of manufacturing.
The automotive industry is a significant user of design skills. It supports a number of design service capabilities, including concept development, model building and testing, tooling and equipment provision and process planning, which are then used by other Australian industries. The industry is one of Australia's leaders in the use of advanced technology and management techniques, R&D and training activity, creating valuable spillover effects to a wide range of industries.
The Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, ACIS, will assist the automotive industry to move ahead over the next five years. Motor vehicle manufacturers, automotive component producers, automotive machine tools and tooling producers and automotive service providers will all benefit from ACIS. Benefits in the form of duty credits based on production will encourage further investment as well as research and development.
In the area of research, eligible companies will receive duty credits to the value of 45 per cent of their investment in eligible research and development. For example, if a motor vehicle producer spends $1 million on research and development, they will receive $450,000 in duty credit which can, if they so desire, be traded. ACIS incentives for research and development will encourage motor vehicle and component manufacturers to develop Australian innovations.
The automotive industry and motor vehicle component manufacturers are key industries in South Australia and Victoria. Passenger motor vehicle production in South Australia includes the production of the Holden Commodore and Mitsubishi Magna and their derivatives such as the Calais and the Verada. The principal automotive component manufacturers in South Australia include Bliss Automotive, Castalloy, Irons Engineering, Milford Industries, Numetric Tooling, Bridgestone Australia, Monroe Australia and Henderson Auto Trim which are in or near my electorate of Hindmarsh.
The South Australian manufacturing sector was built up around the automotive industry. Traditionally, South Australia has been relatively more dependent on manufacturing as an 
 economic activity than other states, and its direct dependence on automotive manufacturing is significant. Directly or indirectly, it employs 10.9 per cent of the total Australian work force. It represents 15.7 per cent of South Australia's gross state product.
Because the automotive industry purchases a range of goods and services from other industries, the performance of the automotive industry has a significant influence on the overall performance of South Australia's economy. It is a significant purchaser of chemicals, iron and steel, other metal products, rubber, plastic, gas, electricity, water, road transport, communication and financial services. The automotive work force also generates additional demand for other Australian industry, particularly wholesale and retail trade, community and personnel services.
Acknowledging the importance of the automotive industry to South Australia, the Premier, John Olsen, opposed the Productivity Commission's 1996 majority report which recommended that tariff levels on motor vehicles continue to decline after 2000 at 2.5 per cent per annum, a rate that was a simple extension of the regime that had been put in place by the Labor government.
Reducing tariffs is a key strategy for Australia's trade performance. Australia is the most efficient primary producer in the world. As such, it is in our interest to encourage countries to reduce their high tariffs on primary products which they use to protect their agricultural sectors. To do this, to a certain extent we must lead by example. It is also in the interest of our own industries to reduce tariffs as industries protected by tariffs are invariably inefficient and uncompetitive. Such was the Australian car industry when it was protected by tariffs as high as 57.5 per cent in the 1980s. Bringing down those tariffs has created a much more dynamic Australian automotive industry, with Australian manufactured cars being exported overseas.
However, as with all things, there has to be a reality check. Just because mechanisms have been successful, this should not be a prescription to pursue them irrespective of other impacts. In recommending a continuing 2.5 per cent per annum decrease in tariffs, the 
 Productivity Commission revealed its obsession with the process rather than the outcome. There have been huge leaps forward in the car industry over the last decade, but the industry has also paid the costs.
There is a limit to the speed at which companies can become lean and mean, and there is often a point where the long-term strategy dictates a pause rather than a continuation of the same policy. This was the situation in 1996 when the Productivity Commission made its recommendations. The automotive industry, the South Australian government, the then member for Kingston, Ms Jeanes, and I argued that the commission's recommendations would have a negative impact on South Australia.
Australia unfortunately does not have any locally owned vehicle manufacturers, and we are dependent on investors offshore to maintain support for the industry in Australia. Consequently, in making policy, it is important to determine the effect those policy decisions would have on overseas investors. South Australian Premier John Olsen was concerned that a decrease in tariffs of 2.5 per cent per annum from the year 2000 would put unacceptable stresses on the South Australian automotive industry, which had already achieved remarkable efficiencies. As I have indicated before, there is a diminishing return that can be expected in regard to efficiencies at a point where trying to force efficiencies is counterproductive.
To its credit, the Howard government accepted submissions from the automotive industry, the South Australian government, me, Ms Jeanes and other members of the coalition and decided to hold tariffs at 15 per cent from 2000 to 2005. The automotive industry accepted, as part of this agreement, that tariffs would then be reduced to 10 per cent in 2005.
One of the incredible aspects of the debate on the Productivity Commission's report was the role taken by the Labor Party in opposition. It was the Labor Party that reduced tariffs in the car industry from 57.5 per cent in 1987 to 15 per cent in 2000. But in opposition, the Labor Party put on a different mask 
 and pretended to be a different animal to the Labor Party in government.
In this place, the Labor Party walked away from the policies they had in 13 years of government and they walked away from their own record in the car industry. As if the Australian public had no memory, they declared tariff reduction to be anathema to their principles. With no consistency, with no policy, with no leadership and with no vision for Australia, they denied their own record, their own values in 13 years in government, and had the gall to accuse the Howard government of being driven by economic rationalism.
The facts are different from the rhetoric. It was the Howard government that declared a pause in tariff reduction to allow the industry to consolidate and take a breather. It was the Howard government that listened to the industry, to the state governments of Victoria and South Australia and to its own members whose constituents worked in the industry, and it is the Howard government that is introducing the ACIS legislation to support the industry while maintaining our obligation to WTO.
Compare this to Labor's record. Under Labor, between 1983 when they came to government, and 1996 when they left, Australian manufacturers' share of the domestic passenger car market fell from 78 per cent to 45 per cent. Unremitting tariff reductions combined with other elements of the Button plan resulted in the loss of Nissan and the cancellation of models whose production run did not reach the critical number to qualify for government assistance. While there needed to be a rationalisation in the industry, the forced cancellation of small models has left Australia producing only medium to large cars. This is one of the reasons we have seen a decline in Australian-produced vehicles' share of the market from over three-quarters to less than half in a little more than a decade. The majority of growth in domestic sales is coming from the small car sector and, hence, from imports.
Currently, Australia imports more than $10 billion worth of cars and automotive parts per year compared with $2.5 billion we export. 
 While the percentage of exports is increasing at a faster rate than the percentage of imports, the former is coming off a low base and, in monetary terms, the cost of imports is far outpacing the revenue from imports.
Because of the flow-on effect of the automotive industry on other domestic industries, on technology, skilling and employment, countries seek to manufacture motor vehicles within their own national boundaries. Similarly important is the impact of imported motor vehicles on the balance of trade. Any country that is totally reliant on imports in the automotive sector will necessarily have an extremely high trade deficit in that sector which has to be offset by exports in other categories. Because of the high individual cost of motor vehicles and the high consumer demand for them, achieving sufficient export credit to offset a total debit in the automotive category is a difficult challenge for any country. With countries recognising the importance of having their own automotive industries for both trade balance and domestic economy reasons, it is not surprising that currently the world has a 50 per cent production over-capacity in motor vehicles.
There has to be rationalisation in the industry, with marriages and a few deaths. We have already seen the start of marriages, with Renault teaming up with Nissan, Daimler merging with Chrysler, Volkswagen buying out Rolls Royce, and Ford acquiring Volvo Cars. It is too early yet to predict the deaths but, when I was in Cardiff in 1996 talking to the Centre of Automotive Research, there was a suggestion that some of the old smaller European companies were the most vulnerable.
In Australia there have been recent suggestions in the newspapers that Mitsubishi may be a casualty of the world overproduction capacity. Mitsubishi has strenuously denied this and, in reply, has pointed out that Mitsubishi Australia has progressively increased its imports so that approximately 10 per cent of annual production is exported, that it would record a profit in 1999, and that the Mitsubishi group of companies has a gross revenue of $50 billion a year. Mitsubishi Corporation has launched a worldwide pro 
 gram, RM2001, which will reduce manufacturing costs and improve Mitsubishi's global competitiveness.
Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd is a key part of the South Australian economy, as I have indicated previously. It currently employs around 5,000 Australians, mainly in Adelaide's suburban areas. Its annual turnover in Australia last year was $2.4 billion and the net profit of the Australian venture was $3.6 million. The South Australian Centre for Manufacturing is a notable contribution Mitsubishi has made locally to research and development.
Growth in the automotive industry cannot be reliant on federal government intervention. The drive must come from the automotive companies themselves and from the states who benefit. In South Australia, the Olsen government has set new directions for the South Australian automotive industry with the formation of `Automotive 21: Road to the future', which will ensure South Australia remains a player in the global automotive industry.
In the legislation today, the opposition have pursued their usual task of not agreeing with the government. Although they silently do agree with the government, they have decided that there have to be things in the legislation that they object to and, in a desperate attempt to find something, they have settled on the review of the industry in 2005. They claim that, as the tariffs come down in 2005 from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, this is too late to review the programs.
But it has already been set in legislation that the tariffs will come down in 2005, so there is no point reviewing that earlier. It is in legislation. The opposition has agreed to it and so has the industry. The effects of that will not be known until considerably after 2005. So it is appropriate that in 2005 we have a look at the situation that exists in the industry at that time to see whether, post-2005, there needs to be more types of schemes, such as the ACIS scheme, to assist that industry to thrive. To undertake a review earlier than 2005 is simply nonsense. In conclusion, in this legislation the federal government recognises the importance of the 
 Australian automotive industry and the essential role it plays in the economy. I commend these bills to the House.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—This is an important debate about an important industry to Australia—the automotive industry. According to the latest available figures, it is an industry which provides 55,000 Australians with work and generates a gross turnover of $14.5 billion, a full 7.4 per cent share of the total manufacturing turnover. Our automotive industry is the second largest consumer of basic iron and steel products and is the third largest consumer of paints. It is also an industry of vital importance to my electorate, which is home to the industry leader, Toyota.
Toyota manufactures at a $420 million plant in Altona in my electorate. Toyota's manufacturing operation was consolidated there in 1994 and 1995. However, Toyota is a long-term player in the Australian motor vehicle industry. Its origin goes back to 1959 when the Thiess brothers began importing the first Toyota land cruiser models for work on the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. Car assembly began in Melbourne in 1963. Within a decade, Australians were familiar with the Toyota Corona and Toyota Corolla brands. I have to say that a very ancient Toyota Corolla was my first car. I am happy and indeed greatly relieved to drive a much more modern Toyota today. The commercial vehicle business became Thiess Toyota in 1971 and eight years later achieved commercial market leadership. In the same period, Toyota began investing in engine and stamping plant to consolidate its position as a high local content motor vehicle manufacturer. As I have said, all manufacturing operations were consolidated in Altona in 1994-95.
The facility at Altona is one of world rank in terms of lean manufacturing technology and processes. It is a facility with which I am very familiar, having been given the opportunity to visit it. It is also en route to my home when returning from commitments within the city, so I am frequently driving past and seeing the activity there. At the facility, Toyota employs the latest environmental controls including the water borne 
 paint system which reduces emissions to the atmosphere. Earlier this year the company commissioned a water borne paint system for emissions reduction. That is now performing at optimum global standards in the vehicle emissions area.
Toyota is a major employer in my electorate and in Australia generally. The livelihood of some 4,300 Australians depend on Toyota, and 2,600 of those work in Altona. Of course, many of them live locally. Toyota is currently Australia's No. 1 in market ranking with a market share of 19.6 per cent. Last year it produced a record number of vehicles, an impressive 100,404 of them. Its exports last year were also at an all-time high and valued at $612 million, making Toyota not only Australia's market leader but also Australia's largest exporter of cars.
This great export performance has been built from a base of export revenue of $47 million in 1990. From $47 million in 1990 to $612 million last year is an unbelievably long way to come in a decade, but, as we all know, the quest for global competitiveness is a race without a finishing line. Toyota is continuing to invest to further improve its performance. Its current investment program includes a 20 per cent lift in its production capacity—that was achieved in 1998 and the aim is to achieve it on an ongoing basis; a new parts and accessories warehouse and distribution centre at Altona which is due for completion later this year; and the introduction of a large, locally built car in the year 2000.
Given the importance of the automotive industry to Australia overall and its critical importance to regions within Australia, such as the region in which my electorate is located, it would be nice to be able to stand here today and say that the Australian government has a clear vision for the automotive industry—indeed for Australian manufacturing industry in general—and is focused on the job of developing and implementing the best possible industry policy. It would be nice to be able to make that statement but, unfortunately, we cannot. When you review the process which led to this legislation being before the House today, the picture is one of 
 getting here more by accident than by clever design, by default rather than by planning.
As has been raised earlier in this debate, this legislation follows an Industry Commission inquiry and report on the automotive industry. The final report was given to the Treasurer on 26 May 1997. Prior to the publication of the final report, a draft report was issued for public comment and debate. The report was divided into a majority report and a minority report. The majority report by Presiding Commissioner Scales and Commissioner Rae recommended that tariffs be reduced on passenger motor vehicles and components from 1 January 2001 at the rate of 2.5 percentage points per annum until 2004 when the tariff would reach five per cent. The minority report by Associate Commissioner Webber recommended the maintenance of tariffs on passenger motor vehicles, original equipment and replacement components at 15 per cent until 2005 with a review to be held in, say, 2003 to consider post-2005 assistance arrangements for the industry.
The publication of the Industry Commission's draft report in late 1996 caused a huge reaction from the industry, the relevant trade union and communities like my own which depend on the industry for jobs. In a speech earlier in this debate, the member for Corio referred to the major community campaign which was held in his electorate as a result of that Industry Commission report. Some of the reaction—and I have brought a sample of it with me—to that Industry Commission report reads as follows. The Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufacturers, Mr Alan Hanberg, said:
Unless the government rejects these recommendations very decisively, you can kiss future investment in the automotive industry in this country goodbye.
He continues:
There are huge international corporations which have no loyalty or allegiance to this country, and they can afford to close.
He went on to say that he believed the industry could be devastated if the Industry Commission recommendations were picked up. He was in good company in making these remarks. Certainly, the Australian Manufactur 
 ing Workers Union predicted that the report's recommendations could lead to job losses of more than 100,000. Mr Ian Jones, the union official responsible for the vehicle building section of that union, described the industry as `on the precipice'. They were not alone—although perhaps I would not describe it as good company—but they were accompanied in making these remarks by the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, who described the draft report as `short-sighted', and the Premier of South Australia, Mr Olsen, who said that he would join with Mr Kennett in fighting the report to ensure that we retained a `vibrant, healthy and growing industry'.
Faced with these views, with the community campaigning, with the employer and trade union reaction and with a majority and minority report from the Industry Commission, the government should have assessed all of the relevant information and articulated a clear vision for the industry. This government did anything but. Rather, it squabbled internally and was paralysed for a period, not knowing how to react. Press reports at the time named the government Senate leader, Robert Hill, and the then industry minister, John Moore, as not seeing themselves as bound to or wedded to the majority Industry Commission report. However, there were those who were known to support tariff cuts, including both the contenders for leadership, the federal Treasurer and the then industrial relations minister. The one-time leader, the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, was also recorded on this issue as being in the tariff reducing camp. Out of such division, one could hardly expect leadership—and we did not get leadership.
The government announced its post-2000 arrangements for the industry on 5 June 1997. Significantly, the government accepted the minority report recommendation for a tariff pause at 15 per cent from 2000-04, but it did not provide for any review of the industry before a further reduction to 10 per cent on 1 January 2005. Given that the announcement was in June 1997, it seems extraordinary that it took until 22 April 1998 for the government to announce that the current scheme in this legislation, the ACIS scheme, would be the 
 centrepiece of its post-2000 transitional arrangements for the automotive industry.
The legislation that is before the House today has—in a somewhat different form—been here before, as a bill was introduced into parliament on 2 July 1998 to deal with this matter, but the legislation lapsed as a result of the federal election being called. We therefore find ourselves, slightly more than two years after the government's announcement about its position on this matter in June 1997, finally dealing with this piece of legislation. We would have to say that, given the time period that has passed and the clear divisions in the government about this matter, we are not dealing with a piece of legislation that has got here through a positive and proactive process in pursuit of a vision for the automotive industry. Rather, it is a solution which has been slowly stitched together by a divided government. Whilst we have arrived here more by accident than design, the opposition is prepared to support this legislation, but we believe it can be improved.
As I have said, the bill provides for the establishment of the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme. This scheme aims to encourage the continuing pursuit and development of international competitiveness in the automotive industry through the following measures. Firstly, those qualifying as motor vehicle producers will be able to claim duty credit to the value of 25 per cent of the value of production of motor vehicles, engines and engine components, multiplied by the tariff rate; and duty credit to the value of 10 per cent of their investment in eligible plant and equipment. Secondly, those qualifying as automotive component producers, automotive machine tools and tooling producers or automotive service providers will be able to claim duty credit to the value of 25 per cent of their investment in eligible plant and equipment and duty credit to the value of 45 per cent of their investment in eligible research and development.
To comply with our World Trade Organisation obligations, benefits under ACIS for each participant will not be permitted to exceed five per cent of its eligible sales for the preceding year. Benefits under ACIS will also 
 be capped for the industry as a whole at $2 billion over the years 2001 to 2005. The production credit which directly replaces the duty-free allowance—that is, 15 per cent of the value of production of passenger motor vehicles sold in Australia and New Zealand—is not included within the fiscal cap, and the revenue forgone is expected to be about $825 million over five years.
Our improvement to this bill, encapsulated in our amendment, is to provide clearly for a review of the industry in a timely fashion. Even the government believes in having a review and has committed itself to doing so. The government has announced that such a review will encompass reviewing the position with Australia's APEC commitments and the general progress on market access internationally for Australian made motor vehicles. But, inexplicably, the government has said that it will conduct this review in 2005. This means the scheme we are dealing with today and the tariff adjustments would be fully implemented, and then you would have a review. Only an industry policy free government would be crazy enough to set up a timetable which has you move into a legislative and policy vacuum and, having then got there, work out what to do.
Proper management obviously requires that you have the review in a timely fashion so that you move seamlessly from one known and certain policy regime to another and not have a lapse for a period of time into a disturbing nothingness. Given the difficulties that the government has faced in establishing its position in order to present these pieces of legislation to the House, and given the time that that has taken—as I have said, more than two years from the original announcement—one can only be concerned about how long we could be in that disturbing nothingness if this government is still in office in that time period. Hopefully, we will not ever face that sort of problem.
The question of reviewing our market access is one that needs to be done closer to the time than we are today but done in a timely fashion so that we can work out in a constructive and rational way what regime should apply to the industry after 2005. It 
 should be noted that our manufacturers continue to struggle in relation to access to world markets. Given this, it seems odd indeed that the government should resist a timely review to see whether or not world trade conditions have changed before implementing a tariff reduction and moving into a policy vacuum. The only speaker on the government side who has addressed the question of the timeliness of the review is the last speaker in this debate. It would seem to me extraordinary that one would put the position that you would move from a known policy to a nothing policy for a period and then assess what to do. Clearly, we will have further information about world trade conditions and the questions of market access closer to 2005. But in a timely and appropriate fashion in the few years before 2005 we should assess the position.
Toyota, in my electorate, confronts the following market barriers in export markets that are of importance to it: in Brunei, tariffs in the range of 40 to 200 per cent; Malaysia, 140 to 300 per cent; Saudi Arabia, 25 per cent; South Africa, 61 per cent; Taiwan, 30 to 42 per cent and a quota of 2000; and Thailand, 80 per cent. There may or may not be substantial changes in these trade barriers by 2005. The point is that we just do not know. So, given that here in June 1999 we cannot have that information at our disposal, is it not sensible to say and to commit in this legislation to having a review prior to 2005 when we will have more information on these questions?
I would have thought that that argument about the need for a review and a further policy regime to be developed in a timely fashion would be one which would strike the government as a very important argument, given the importance of the industry to Australia overall and, in particular, to various regional areas within Australia. And, given that almost each and every speaker in this debate has spoken about the importance of the industry and that many representatives of regions in which the car industry is located have spoken in this debate and have spoken about their local car industry, I would have thought that that was an argument the govern 
 ment would understand and that it would not oppose the amendment the opposition has proposed to this legislation.
However, given that only one speaker has addressed—and she only briefly—the question of the amendment that the opposition is proposing to this legislation, we really have to assume that they are bereft of argument because there is no good argument against the proposition we are putting. In those circumstances, I would urge government members to think about this proposition, and if they have an argument against the proposition we are putting to put it in this House and put it clearly. If they have no opposition to the proposition we are putting, presumably they will vote for it at the appropriate time.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,1999-06-24,"—I am delighted to join this debate on the ACIS bills to refute some of the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Lalor. At the outset, I commend the speech by the member for Hindmarsh. As members on this side would know, the member for Hindmarsh and I have had considerable debate about this matter in relation to the car tariffs. I thought that she gave a very thoughtful exposition as it represented her electorate and the view of South Australia on this very important question.
Of those members opposite who do know something about the car tariff issue, the previous speaker, the member for Lalor, demonstrates the problem those opposite have. The Labor government—the member for Lalor was not a member of that government and, therefore, she is somewhat excluded from this debate whereas the member for Corio was very much a part of the government—advocated a lower tariff position. The member for Lalor comes in here and advocates a middle road position. That there are some export markets that Toyota—the factory in her electorate—are unable to access clearly demonstrates the point that high tariff barriers are difficult, that they do not encourage trade and that, in the longer run, they need to be reduced.
I do acknowledge that the Toyota factory in her electorate is of modern construction. The 
 industrial relations changes encouraged by this government—discouraged by the previous Labor government—have brought about dramatic changes in that factory in quality control and productivity. I commend the innovation and approach of the company with the particular paint shop she refers to. Some of us on this side of the House have visited that factory and share her support for the newer processes that Toyota has invoked in producing a quality vehicle. But, of course, she does not defend the position of lowering tariff barriers and she goes back to some of the old rhetoric.
In relation to the member for Corio, who joined a strong debate in saying that he had been a supporter of lower tariffs, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the member for Corio was part of a government which quite rightly reduced the tariff barriers from 57 per cent down to 20 or 23 per cent, or wherever it was at the time of the change of government. The member for Corio supported the member for Hotham. The member for Hotham is on the public record in 1992 saying that the reduction of tariff barriers was good for the industry and good for Australia. But, of course, as they got into opposition, they immediately changed their stance. Like the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, they are against things. They are against tax change, which they advocated in 1985. And in the debate on car tariffs they advocated a change of their position to no change—they were not quite game to put the tariffs up but they were advocating a status quo position.
In terms of his good friend from the Labor Trades Hall in Geelong, can I just put on the public record that Russell Gardner and John Kranz were encouraged by me to put a point of view on behalf of those workers of Geelong to the Prime Minister. They actually spoke to the Prime Minister and put their arguments, as did the delegation from the City of Geelong led by the then mayor, Councillor Gerry Smith. So whilst I disagreed with their views, because in my assessment it was important to have lower tariffs to ensure the long-term survival of the car industry in Broadmeadows and Geelong, they did put their point of view strongly and they put it at 
 the local community. My view was that I wanted to encourage the survival and long-term commitment of the Ford Motor Co. to Geelong, ensuring that, not in the short term with tariff support, it would survive because of its productivity efficiency. Quite clearly, the Labor Party changed their position once they reached the opposition benches, compared to their position in government. That is regrettable.
I put on the record my support for the Button plan. Minister Button was very active in the automobile industry. He saw the merit of reducing the number of manufacturers in Australia and ensuring that there was a lowering tariff regime to encourage innovation, technical changes and changes in the industrial relations regime that historically had existed in that industry. Senator Button, over time, with the support of the Hawke-Keating governments, had reduced the tariff from extraordinary levels down to the more commendable level that it is now at.
This legislation puts in place getting the tariff level from 15 per cent down to 10 per cent in the year 2005. So I totally reject the argument that has been put by members opposite that there was not time for change. When this decision was made, everyone in the industry—the South Australian car industry, the Victorian car industry—was very aware and alert to the problems that the industry faced. They were given time to make the adjustments and by the year 2005 there will be a 10 per cent tariff barrier. I make the point that fundamentally and philosophically the tariff barriers had been reduced in a gradual sense and that when they reach the 10 per cent barrier that, in many ways, is a non-tariff position because the fluctuation in exchange rates can have a much bigger impact than the tariff barriers.
The Industry Commission report, which other members have brought into this debate, was a landmark report. The two commissioners in the majority report had put their material together in a very painstaking way. I pay particular tribute to Bill Scales, who was the chairman of the Productivity Commission and who had a lifetime involvement with the car industry. He had started on the shop floor and 
 he knew exactly the inefficiency of that car industry over 20 years, so here was a person who had applied some practical skills and understanding of the industry and, in my assessment, had provided a first-class report.
The minority report has been referred to and, of course, that did cause some controversy. I think at the time the government wanted to allow somebody from the car industry to put a point of view. I was disappointed by that minority report and the way in which it was handled. That particular commissioner had a long association with the car industry and I think the bias of his particular assessment showed through in providing that minority report. That was unfortunate for the public debate because those who were in favour of maintaining a high tariff barrier rather clung on to some of what I consider to be questionable points of view in that minority report in order to support their case. There were arguments about modelling to support the impact of tariff reductions. We know over time that is very difficult. That clouded the issues that that very good report brought to this parliament and to the car industry.
We now have a position in Geelong where the Ford Motor Co. is internationally competitive. The number of employees unfortunately are less—I concede that point—but that is happening around the world. Those people who have been following the industry and the activities of Australian Jac Nasser, the CEO of Ford World, would know that that is happening in plants in Detroit, in the UK and in Europe. The number of workers in these plants are being reduced inevitably by the introduction of automation, quality controls and the sheer movement of technology in the car industry. That was an inevitable development. The car industry in Geelong and in Ford in particular have been reducing their numbers since 1989—under the previous Labor government. That is happening in certain industries where numbers are being reduced not because of tariffs but because of technical change.
I have been a great supporter of the Ford Motor Co. Whilst I have had an argument with the management about the rate of tariff 
 change, I have always advocated that the Ford company could compete with the world because of their technical excellence and their ability to bring about change. Their new model involved an investment of about $1 billion in research and development, in tooling up and getting that particular vehicle back into the production line. They took that risk. The bean counters of Detroit were making a fundamental decision about whether the car industry could be profitable here in Australia, and it was fundamentally because the changes in the industry resulting from the tariff reductions that had taken place that this major investment was made in Geelong and in Broadmeadows to maintain the Ford company in Australia.
For all the rhetoric, all the discussion and all the local concern in the city of Geelong, in Broadmeadows and in the state of Victoria—where the Premier got into the argument and in my view was not correct in his assessment of the impact of tariffs—we have found that with the gradual reduction of tariffs the car industries have improved. They have become more competitive and, in the final analysis, they will survive in the globalised, international industry of automotive construction. So in this last citadel of high tariff debate, where Australia is now demonstrating its commitment to the World Trade Organisation by ensuring that tariffs have been reduced in the automobile industry and in the TCF industries, we find that we are in a better position to argue the case of freer trade in the world forums. We have the case of Australian lamb, about which our trade minister and the Prime Minister have been talking to the President of the USA in recent times. We can go there with clean hands to argue the case of freer trade, whereas only five or six years ago we had the monkey on our back, so to speak, of high tariffs in TCF and in the car industry.
Not only have the reductions in the tariff numbers and rates been of benefit to the car industry, in my assessment, but they have been introduced gradually and the industry has known what they were and what they were going to be. I refute the argument that members opposite have put, that it has taken some time to bring the changes into the 
 parliament. The industry has been working on the assumptions that were announced after the big tariff debate.
The final point I would put to the parliament is that the government adopted a fundamental position of lowering the tariffs. I agreed with that. Tariffs may not have been lowered as much as I might have advocated, but the legislation here implements that earlier decision. However, the members opposite have a position of being against the lowering of tariffs. The member for Corio has advocated that position on a number of occasions. I totally reject the argument that he has put on the public record that I was in favour of zero tariffs. I never was. I always argued for a gradual reduction with time for readjustment, and that the five or 10 per cent tariff barrier was a fair and reasonable thing, given the international pressures and the unfair trading practices of some of our trading partners. The member for Corio is great at putting up public statements that I was a zero tariff man because our former leader, John Hewson, on some occasions had been quoted in this context. I always argued the case for lowering the tariffs and doing it in a gradual manner.
We have the opposition again being against tariffs which it had advocated in government and against tax changes which it had advocated, quite strongly, in government. So we find it in a policy free zone yet again. Opposition members come into this parliament suggesting that we have an amendment to do it a bit more slowly and do it a bit differently, just to be against the government position.
I commend this package of bills, which implement the historical decision that tariffs in the automobile industry be reduced in a gradual manner to the year 2005. The automobile industry has gone from strength to strength from that decision, and we can see that reflected in the profits of the three major automobile companies operating in Australia.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—I am always pleased in these debates to follow the Liberal Party's rightful heir to Bert Kelly, the honourable member for Corangamite. I might just correct him on a few points regarding trade policy. If he wants to have a look at the Labor Party's commitment to tariff reduc 
 tion, he should turn to the excellent speech given by the Leader of the Opposition just last Friday at the APEC forum. Unfortunately, the contents of the speech were somewhat overshadowed by its ending. The Leader of the Opposition stated:
The one guaranteed route to global wealth destruction lies in the downward spiral of retaliative protectionism . . . protectionism climbs, steadily choking off international trade, reducing economic growth with it in country after country; workers lose their jobs and spending power, and before you know it, a recession becomes a depression.
The problem with beggar-thy-neighbour protectionism is that everyone has neighbours.
Labor will not stand for it.
That is the Labor Party's commitment on these matters, reinforced earlier this year by the announcement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, `Labor rejects tariffs as a policy tool in the future. We have consigned the tariff debate to the dustbin of history.'
Mr Anthony interjecting—
—Of course you will still get a few members in this parliament rummaging around in the dustbin. The member for Richmond is one of them.
Mr Anthony interjecting—
—The member for Richmond has a huge problem, because his side of the parliament is currently condemning those politicians who might be described as second-generation. What low opinion must they have of the member for Richmond—not second generation but third generation in this parliament, along with his colleague the member for Mayo. So if it is a problem to be a second-generation politician, we must take a very limited view of the career horizons of the member for Richmond—not first or second generation, but a lowly third-generation politician in this parliament. There could not be anything worse, according to the definitions we are getting from the Treasurer in recent times.
Mr Anthony interjecting—
—He does not like that. The old, snarly hooknoses go all right when they are dishing it out, but when a bit of reality 
 comes back at them, oh, they're most upset: `I'd better go consult daddy or granddaddy on that one.' Let's get real. To return to this bill: the ALP supports the package, not only for the present time but beyond the next election. I understand that is the government's commitment in this legislation; the difference of opinion is on the timing of the review. Labor sensibly believes that there should be a review before the program is completed. The government holds out the possibility of finishing the program and then having a review, and if it decided to continue the program there would be a gap. That, in public policy, is not a very flash way to do things. Labor has proposed, by way of amendment, that you would have a review before the program finished.
A review is nothing more than what it suggests: a reassessment, an analysis of how this program might be proceeding. A review by no means provides any commitment to continuing the program. You would have to look at the program's strengths and weaknesses in the year 2004 and make an objective assessment of how it was going. A review is nothing more than a reassessment before the program ends. It by no means commits Labor or any future group of MPs here to continuing the program.
The other thing the member for Corangamite would be disappointed in—and this is where he needs to keep an eye on his protectionist colleagues like the member for Richmond, the parliamentary secretary for trade—concerns cars as well as TCF. He should share my concern that this government has written into our APEC individual action plan the nonsense about unilateral disarmament. This is a defining difference between the government and the opposition.
The opposition, in the words of the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy, have committed Labor to a multilateral trade approach. They have committed Labor to the goodwill agreements such as APEC, which are unconditional. Labor's commitment here is unconditional tariff reduction, recognising the destructive influence of retaliative protectionism—the sort of conditional protectionism advocated by 
 the third generation politician, the member for Richmond.
The member for Corangamite on cars and TCF will have to take it up with his third generation colleague, the member for Richmond, because what he and his minister have done is to write into—
—I am fourth generation.
—You are fourth generation! Well, I do not know the history of the Anthony family that well, but if you are fourth generation, that is even worse. He is not first, or second, but third generation. How lowly in the assessment of the coalition. He has got some problems down there.
His other problem on the substance of this bill is that the government, courtesy of the parliamentary secretary and the trade minister, has written into our APEC commitments conditional protectionism. That is, what we are saying is that Australia will only reduce its tariffs on cars and TCF after the year 2004 if other nations do the same.
What sort of madness is that in multilateral trade agreements, because if every single nation said, `Hang on, we will look over our shoulder and see what other countries are doing,' we all know what would happen—nothing would happen. Every nation would spend all its time looking at each other instead of committing itself and getting on with the business of trade liberalisation.
The member for Corangamite, as the heir to Bert Kelly should, nods his head in agreement. He knows the folly of conditional protectionism. This is the disappointing aspect on this government's performance on cars and TCF. They have written into our APEC individual action plan the folly of conditional protectionism.
Labor, of course, stands against that. I would expect that a future Labor government would make our commitments to APEC unconditional, as they were in the first place, as they were when Prime Minister Keating signed the Bogor Declaration.
So that is a defining difference between this side of the parliament and the protectionists opposite. They believe in a conditional approach in multilateral agreements which rips 
 the guts out of those agreements. Conditional protectionism is no way in which to proceed on a multilateral basis, it is a recipe for everyone watching everyone else and no-one doing anything. It is a recipe for countries spending all their time looking over their shoulders instead of looking at the commonsense of trade liberalisation.
The member for Corangamite might take note of those observations and counsel some of his more protectionist colleagues about the need to once more return unconditional obligations into Australia's APEC individual action plans.
I want to turn to some of the myths  surrounding this question of trade and protectionism. The first myth which needs to be rebutted is the one that Australia has gone far enough in opening its economy to free trade. In fact, the growth in imported goods into Australia over the past 30 years has been relatively small. Taken as a proportion of goods production, imports to Australia rose by 44 per cent between 1965 and 1995. This compares to 79 per cent in East Asia, 74 per cent in North America, and 85 per cent across the world economy.
We had the embarrassing sight of the parliamentary secretary for trade up in the Main Committee yesterday saying that Australia had gone faster than comparable nations in trade liberalisation. The figures I have quoted came from Ross Garnaut in his excellent article in the Australian Economic Review in December 1997, `Australian cars in a global economy'. He points out that in trade liberalisation, Australia has moved slower than just about every other part of the world when you take our imports as a proportion of goods production.
The second myth surrounding this debate is that Australia's free trade commitments far exceed those of our competitor nations. Again, the third generation member for Richmond was up to this sort of argument in the Main Committee yesterday. This is what some have described, where Australia thinks it has gone far enough and faster than other nations, as unilateral disarmament—a belief that Australia should only lower its trade 
 barriers once other nations have done the same.
Unfortunately, the Howard government, as I pointed out earlier on, has written this approach into Australia's individual action plan for APEC. This is contrary to the whole purpose and rationale of this trade group—that is, adherence to an open regional agreement unrelated to reciprocity.
APEC is built on the principle of voluntary unilateral liberalisation. Its only sanction is a practical one. Protectionist policies will destroy the potential of the Bogor Declaration to create gains for all nations. If every nation waited for other nations to liberalise then, quite plainly, nothing would happen and nothing could be achieved.
So for anyone who thinks that this bill, or any other piece of legislation, is an alibi for maintaining high tariffs in the car industry 2005, think again. Australia must meet its Bogor commitments of a five per cent tariff rate in this industry, and also the TCF industries, by the year 2010. That will not be achieved by conditional liberalisation. Only an unconditional Australian commitment to trade liberalisation can get us to that target. If every other nation listened to people like the third generation member for Richmond, they would slow down their trade liberalisation. We would do nothing but look at each other and end up achieving absolutely zero.
In any case, most of our APEC partners have committed themselves to a faster rate of trade liberalisation than Australia. Measured by unweighted average tariff rates, eight countries have gone further and faster with their World Trade Organisation and APEC commitments. Let me name them—Hong Kong, Brunei, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, Singapore and the United States. Two others, Chile and the Philippines, have produced individual action plans which exceed their Bogor commitments.
So let us not have any of this nonsense that Australia is a trendsetter, that Australia is leading the pack and that no-one else is liberalising on trade. I have just given the names of 10 nations which are either moving faster than Australia or intend to do so under their Bogor commitments. Again, the parlia 
 ment would want the appropriate reference for this information to counter some of the nonsense that gets put around in the public arena. Fred Bergsten from the Institute for International Economics in Washington, part of the APEC apparatus, in 1997 wrote an article, Whither APEC? The progress to date and agenda for the future, in which he gives all those comparative trade liberalisation performances. I know the member for Corangamite will look this up because he will need some of that information to counteract the rubbish that gets around that Australia is the only country going down this path. Well, everyone else has got their commitments and, in many cases, they are moving faster than Australia.
The third myth in this debate is that free trade forces the withdrawal of government from other areas of economic regulation such as decent labour and consumer and environmental standards. In fact, the logic of free trade points to a very different argument. In recent decades, companies have won the right to trade and invest extensively in the global economy. As with all rights in our society, they need to be matched by certain social responsibilities, often described as a mutual obligation or mutual responsibility approach. Governments need to firmly protect the social standards. This role is best discharged through international economic governance. The European Union is a fine example of this process. At an intergovernmental level, the work of the WTO and ILO needs to be more effectively linked. It is absurd, for instance, that the WTO bans imports made by prison labour but does not ban imports produced by slave or child labour.
There is an argument for a third approach in trade policy. The old Left, while always keen to embrace decent labour, consumer and environmental standards, has been a bit sceptical about the benefits of trade liberalisation. The New Right, while embracing a free trade agenda, has had little concern for social standards. You could bring those two approaches together under the banner of free trade with social standards. Free trade does not involve a winding back of basic government responsibilities. Free trade—the right of 
 companies to trade freely—should be accompanied by a responsibility to have in place decent industrial, labour law, consumer and environmental standards. If you follow that approach—free trade with social standards—you cut through a lot of the nonsense you hear in the debate: the Left arguing for protection; the New Right saying that there must be free trade but nothing more than free trade. This cuts through a lot of the nonsense we have heard in this parliament in recent years: a very narrow debate about Australia's economic interests. Instead, the sensible approach is to recognise that all countries benefit from a free trade environment, improving their prosperity and economic growth.
However, the right of companies to trade freely needs to be matched by their responsibility to have decent social, environmental, consumer, tax and labour law standards in place. If they took their responsibilities seriously, there would be no need for government regulation. But one recognises, of course, that regulation is often necessary to force responsibilities upon not only corporations but some citizens. If companies do not take their responsibilities seriously, then those social responsibilities should be written into multilateral trade agreements. That is the broadening of the free trade agenda—not just free trade for its economic benefits, but free trade for the social responsibilities that arise in the global trading environment.
Another good part in the Leader of the Opposition's speech last Friday—and again, it bears on this legislation—was his reference to consumer costs. There is no doubt that anyone who opposes regressive indirect taxation would also oppose tariffs. That is the point that the Leader of the Opposition, the strongest possible opponent of the GST, put last Friday when he said:
. . . tariff reductions provided perhaps the biggest indirect tax cut in Australian history. When Labor left office, cars imported into Australia were around 25% cheaper than if the tariffs of a decade before still applied. Clothing and footwear were around 14 per cent cheaper.
Labor's tariff cuts gave the average Australian family an extra $1,000 per year.
Those tariff cuts represent a policy—
—What happened to Simon Crean? Where did Simon go? Poor old Simon.
—consistent with Labor's opposition of the GST. The member for Corangamite asked about the member for Hotham. Well, the member for Hotham is the strongest possible opponent of the GST.
—Where's the member for Hotham?
—In his address to the Sydney Institute earlier this year, he pointed out that he was consigning the tariff debate to the dustbin of history. Again, it is a perfectly consistent piece of public policy: opposition to tariffs—because they represent a regressive indirect levy on Australian consumers, particularly low income consumers—and opposition to the GST because it does the same. That is a perfectly consistent piece of public policy, and I am sure that, while the member for Corangamite is doing a juggling act over there—something familiar to the member for Hunter, juggling public policy imperatives—he would recognise the consistency of the member for Hotham and of the Leader of the Opposition, of course. It is all here in black and white—well constructed, consistent speeches, which are logical and rational in every single respect.
The argument is clear: it is only this side of the parliament that is committed to unconditional trade liberalisation; it is only this side of the parliament that has written those conditional obligations into our individual action plan for APEC; it is only Labor that opposes regressive indirect levies—GST and tariffs—on the Australian working people; it is only Labor that recognises the economic benefits of internationalisation; it is only Labor that recognises that in most of these industries—cars and TCF—it is technology that is the destroyer of jobs, not free trade. In an environment where Australia has a floating exchange rate, there is absolutely no sense in keeping these regressive and destructive tariffs in place for the longer term. In fact, if we take seriously the notion of a global trading environment and global capital, we will recognise that a nation maximises its economic benefits by improving the skills of its 
 people. Only a highly skilled population and work force can attract international investment to Australia.
The problem with industry handouts and tariffs is that companies can soak them up for the medium term in Australia and then, with their new found mobility, move offshore when it suits, especially when some other nation gives them a better offer. Sometimes it is said Australia needs to match the subsidies other countries are putting around. I also noted in the Leader of the Opposition's speech a very good rebuttal of that argument.
—It is a good policy.
—It is a great trade policy and I hope the member for Corangamite has a close look at it. Let me again quote from the Leader of the Opposition:
A recent OECD study showed that Australia's producer subsidies as a percentage of farm income were 7% in 1998. That compares to the US at 22%, the EU at 45% and Japan at a stunning 63%. We have strong credentials to be pushing this case.
We do have strong credentials for putting the case for free trade. Australia should also recognise that, if other countries are silly enough to waste their money on those sorts of subsidies, it frees up the opportunity, comparatively, for our country to put money into a highly-skilled, well-educated population. Let's train our people and attract international investment instead of putting money into the deadweight costs of industry subsidies and tariff protection.
Mr McArthur interjecting—
—The member for Corangamite has a lot of work to do on his side of the parliament on these issues. I started my speech by pointing out he is the rightful heir to Bert Kelly. He needs to advance those agendas on the Liberal side of politics but he can rest assured that all these points about free trade—its economic and social benefits, political responsibility and commonsense—are well and truly in safe hands on the Labor side.",REPS,<title>ACIS ADMINISTRATION BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,1999-06-24,"—The government recognises the significant pro 
 gress the automotive industry has made over a period of more than a decade and the industry's objectives to integrate interglobal markets. The labour productivity of our car manufactures has improved 40 per cent since 1991 and significant improvements in the quality of our locally produced cars have been recorded.
Australian cars are comparable in quality with cars built in Japan. The core of the Australian automotive industry is represented by four motor vehicle manufacturers and over 200 component, tooling and service providers. The industry is largely concentrated in South Australia and Victoria and employed approximately 55,000 people in 1996-1997—mostly in those two states. It is a significant manufacturing industry with important linkages to other resources and manufacturing industries, with a turnover of approximately $15 billion in 1996-1997 and exports of about $2.5 billion in 1998. In recent years, the Australian automotive industry has established itself as a low cost, high quality source of design and engineering and has expertise in flexible, small volume manufacturing.
Government assistance has helped the industry to position itself as a high-tech, globally focused, sustainable manufacturing industry. Continued government assistance will help the industry to secure its place in the global market in the context of increasing trade liberalisation. The  ACIS Administration Bill 1999 , the  ACIS (Unearned Credit Liability) Bill 1999  and the  Customs Tariff Amendment (ACIS Implementation) Bill 1999  will implement two key elements of the government's post-2000 arrangements for the automotive industry. The legislation will establish the Automotive Competitiveness and Investment Scheme, the ACIS. Legislation will also reduce the automotive tariff from 15 per cent to 10 per cent on 1 January 2005. The stable tariff regime between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2004 will offer the industry vital breathing space to adjust and to integrate their operations into global markets.
There is to be no doubt, however, on the government's commitment to reduce tariffs and to continue the downward trend in the automotive tariff which we have seen over the 
 last decade. The tariff reduction in 2005 is in line with the government's commitment to trade liberalisation. It is a tangible step towards Australia meeting its APEC goal by the year 2010 and it will bring lower prices to consumers. It is appropriate to lock into this tariff setting now to give the industry the certainty that it needs to plan for its future in the context of a more liberalised market. The prospect of tariff cuts in the future will also be an important driver for future competitiveness.
The industry requires certainty, not further reviews. This principle applies both to the tariff settings and to the ACIS. ACIS can be evaluated like any other government program to assess its performance against its stated objectives, say, in the year 2002-03, without the uncertainty generated by a full-scale review. ACIS will make $2 billion available to the industry over five years of its operation, from the year 2001 to the year 2005, making it one of the largest industry development schemes supported by the government. Funding for the scheme has been capped to maintain the government's commitment to fiscal responsibility—$2 billion over five years is extremely generous by any standards for an industry program. The level of support compares favourably with current support arrangements. Firms will be able to plan their futures with confidence, which will help secure employment in the industry.
The ACIS legislation is a major plank in the government's commitment to the Australian automotive industry to provide transitional support in an era of trade liberalisation. ACIS represents the result of extensive policy design work, close consultation with industry and careful consideration of our trade obligations. The legislation is fully consistent with Australia's international obligations. The package has the support of major industry stakeholders who have contributed significantly to improve the ACIS package since the legislation was first introduced.
The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industry stated on 3 May 1999:
We fully support the ACIS legislation being tabled in the federal parliament and hope that such legislation is passed in the current term. 

The Federation of Automotive Products Manufacturers stated on 26 March 1999:
It is good legislation, it is equitable and it will greatly support the government's objectives for the development of Australia's automotive industry.
The ACIS is targeted towards the central parts of the motor vehicle manufacturing supply chain. It will improve the competitiveness of the vehicle manufacturing industry. ACIS will encourage the development of internationally competitive firms in the automotive industry through rewarding eligible production, strategic investment, and research and development.
The incentive structure for the ACIS in relation to motor vehicle manufacturers is broadly consistent with the incentive structure currently applying to the duty-free allowance, namely, it depends on production levels. The long lead times and cyclical nature of investments by car manufacturers in relation to new models meant that an incentive structure, which relied on investment and R&D levels alone, could have led to serious inequities in the distribution of benefits between car manufacturers, depending on where each vehicle manufacturer was in its investment cycle. A scheme based entirely on investment and research and development could have seriously disturbed the competitive balance in the industry.
Vehicle manufacturers can, however, still access R&D and higher investment incentives when they undertake component, tooling or automotive service production for third parties. Eligible motor vehicle producers, automotive component producers, automotive machine tool and tooling producers, and automotive service providers will be able to claim ACIS duty credits for relevant activities. The government recognises the importance of design and research and development activities to the future of the industry.
The bill sets out the broad parameters for the automotive services which will be covered by the ACIS, including design, development, engineering or production services. Details of these will be further articulated in regulation. The scope of the R&D definition will also be elaborated through regulation. The government has created the right environment for 
 growth and for a car industry which is dynamic, productive, optimistic and outward looking. These policy settings give the industry the certainty that it needs to plan for its future. It supports employment in this very important sector, and it goes forward with the full support of the industry.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—On the adjournment tonight it is appropriate, with the Minister for Employment Services at the table, to speak on some of the policies that the government claim they have in the area of employment services. The minister comes in here and parrots in question time and in every debate that is going the Work for the Dole scheme. But what the minister has not done is come into this place and had a full debate on the evaluation done by the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, which he released at the end of last month. One of the important suggestions that was in the evaluation by his own department was that the program's name should be changed from Work for the Dole to such things as `Work for the Future' or a scheme called `Volunteers for Australia'. It is understandable that the government, with their 
 penchant for penalising the victims of certain things in Australian society, continue to champion the name Work for the Dole. In an article in the West Australian , it is stated that a spokesperson for the Minister for Employment Services said that the Prime Minister is keen on the name Work for the Dole. Shame on you, Prime Minister. The only reason that anybody would suggest that the name Work for the Dole was appropriate is that it indicates in some way a malevolence on the part of those proposers that this scheme should be seen as being some form of punishment.
As I have said all along, we on this side of the House could agree with an employment program that has some basis of mutual obligation if it were in fact fair dinkum and if it had an element of training way beyond what is proposed by the Work for the Dole scheme. If we compare the type of Work for the Dole scheme that the government has with the programs that were produced under Labor governments, the element that is missing from Work for the Dole is not the work experience—and everybody understands the value of that. It is not the work experience that there is any argument about; it is the fact that there is no add-on. There is no value adding in the scheme; there is no adding that gives proper training to the participants. There is no training that then gives skills that can be transferred to other employment. The real problem with the way that the debate about this program has gone is that it is seen to be one of those subjects where it is us and them, that the government has some sort of virtue on the basis of the program that they have in place and that any programs that we proposed previously were wrong.
If we look at the evaluation produced by the department and we look at the outcomes of the Work for the Dole scheme, it is not any better than the programs that Labor had in place; in fact, in the cases of most other programs Labor governments had better levels of positive outcomes. If we are going to have debates about giving opportunities to young Australians to get employment and we are going to have the sorts of discussions that we are having now on youth wages, we have to be fair dinkum. We have to look at the 
 alternatives, and we have to not go into debates that are just based on ideology. Just as we have seen in the discussion that we had this afternoon—when there was a proper discussion of what the commission has actually said in its report—we should be looking at ways in which to encourage young people into employment, and youth wages should not be seen as the problem.
I have said, and the minister knows, that I would be willing to give support for an employment program based on the notions they have in place with their so-called Work for the Dole if it were improved. I dispute the notion that the minister put—I think it was in the last sitting week—when he criticised the Brisbane City Council's attitude to this program. He did not recognise that the Brisbane City Council would support an employment program where there was mutual obligation and where government was offering more than just work experience. And that is the case. The notion of mutual obligation being something that only the government has championed is nonsense. We need to have a proper debate on what is required for governments to offer young people to give them a chance to have positive outcomes from any employment programs offered by the government. That is what the young people of Australia are looking for; young people of Australia are looking for opportunities. They produce positive work, and they should be given opportunities. (Time expired)

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—Page 1 of yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald , under the banner headline `The ""great Australian dream"" Mark 2 up for grabs', championed the Howard government's announcement that the $16 billion sell-off of Telstra `would see a new generation fulfilling the new ""great Australian dream"" of owning shares'. Further, the Sydney Morning Herald  reported:
Telstra shares may be on the shopping list of most leading stockbrokers, but they say there are many other shares worth considering before spending $5,000 or $10,000 on the phone giant.
I ask: how many battlers have a spare $5,000 or $10,000? When I last spoke in the Main Committee about the first one-third sale of Telstra, on 26 November 1998, I highlighted the fact that the float price was undervalued by 50 per cent. In other words, we, the taxpayers and the owners of Telstra, were the victims of daylight robbery by the Howard government's first float.
Most galling of all, the taxpayers and the owners of Telstra are going to be robbed again with the latest 16 per cent sell-off. Day after day I have had to suffer the Prime Minister and the Treasurer seducing the Australian people with the line about how wonderful it will be that more and more mums and dads can own shares in this great, profitable national asset. But I ask: at what cost? The people of Australia already own two-thirds of Telstra—and it should be 100 per cent. But worse, 35 per cent of Telstra can be foreign owned.
What we have here is a typical coalition government bribe which appeals to the rich and the greedy. Once again the Howard government is robbing the poor to reward those in our society who are already better off, so that they can feel warm and cosy as the value of their Telstra share portfolio blossoms. Those who already own Telstra shares can also look forward to a better deal if they buy more shares. This is disgraceful.
With the first one-third sell-off, we witnessed massive job losses and a marked reduction in services. It is obvious that this scenario will continue with the latest sell-off. Once again, the public interest has been massively kicked in the guts. If the public think that out of this they will be able to get their telephones installed or serviced quicker, they had better think again. After all, we know that the shareholders will demand profits, and Telstra management will make sure that the value of the shares increases at the expense of services to the Australian people.
It is outrageous to read in the Sydney Morning Herald that the brokers and merchant bankers will be the biggest winners in this latest float. The Sydney Morning Herald estimates that they stand to reap an estimated $240 million in fees. This is appalling. The tragedy in all of this is that the Howard government does not intend to stop here. The government has made it quite clear that it wants to fully privatise Telstra. Sadly, once this great asset is sold it can never be bought back by the legitimate owners—the Australian public.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Sale</title>,Statements by Members,22,1
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—The Damage by Aircraft Bill 1999  seeks to improve compensation arrangements for third parties on the ground who suffer death, personal injury or property damage as a consequence of an air accident. As the shadow minister and previous opposition members who have spoken on this bill have already indicated, the Labor Party supports the government in these efforts. This bill makes a pleasant change from the usual air transport legislation which this government develops and puts forward, and which is usually unclear, inept, surrounded by secrecy and generally mismanaged.
The current compensation arrangements for third parties affected by air accidents are entirely inadequate and need revision. Compensation for third parties on the ground in the case of an air crash in Australia is currently determined by our being a signatory to the Rome convention of 1952, the details of which are given force of law by the Civil Aviation (Damage by Aircraft) Act 1958.
The Rome convention was developed to harmonise compensation payments between countries when international aircraft cause damage to parties on the ground. However, a number of holes exist in the convention, and subsequently in the act as it currently stands. While attempting to bring harmony to international compensation arrangements, the Rome convention actually falls far from it. Only 38 countries are party to it and only seven of the signatory countries are licensed to operate in Australia at any one time. Countries that are not signatories to the convention include the United States, Japan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the United Kingdom. Indeed, the majority of international carriers that operate in Australia are not covered by the convention.
This lack of consistency means that different and sometimes inadequate levels of compensation can be available to parties on the ground suffering the results of aircraft accident. 
 This depends on the aircraft involved and whether a carrier is covered by the convention or not. For example, if an international aircraft registered in a country that is not a signatory to the Rome convention were to have an accident and cause damage to people and property in Australia, the third parties would not have to prove that the aircraft—the defendant—was at fault, nor would they be limited in the amount of compensation they could seek. However, if the aircraft were from a country that was a signatory to the convention, while the plaintiff would not have to prove the defendant was at fault, their compensation would be limited.
The Rome convention limits liability because, when it was drawn up in the 1950s, the air transport industry was in a fledgling state and compensation claims without limit could have spelt its ruin. The industry is no longer in need of such protection, and it is unfair to limit compensation claims on these grounds.
In the case of the compensation available involving signatories to the Rome convention, there is a real concern regarding the adequacy of such payments in the current climate. The Rome convention sets the level of compensation available by relying on a formula based on current gold prices. As we all would know, gold prices the world over are at record lows. Under the convention's gold based formula, third parties conceivably face the possibility of receiving as little as $4 million in compensation following an air accident. Even the most generous conversions of the formula would result in a payment of no more than $40 million, a figure that would prove entirely inadequate should an accident occur approaching the scale of the El Al disaster which occurred in Amsterdam in 1989, destroying two apartment blocks and killing 43 people.
Confusion with the current act also exists due to anomalies between the states and the territories and their arrangements in regard to aircraft accidents. If an accident occurs in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia or Tasmania, an airline is subject to strict liability, meaning that the plaintiff need not prove that the defendant was at fault, and unlimited liability, meaning that there is no prescribed limit to the amount of compensation available. However, should an accident occur in either of the territories or in South Australia or Queensland, the airline is subject to common law liability, meaning that a plaintiff or third party on the ground needs to prove negligence or fault in order to receive compensation. Also, there is currently no legal requirement in Australia for aircraft owners or operators to carry insurance cover for their liability to third parties on the ground in the case of an accident.
Obviously, Australia needs to extract itself from the Rome convention and set up a legislative framework that allows for blanket, strict and unlimited liability which applies in all states and territories and to all foreign owned aircraft operating over Australian territory, all Australian aircraft operating internationally, all domestic aircraft or air carriers and all private aircraft owner-operators. That is what this bill, I am pleased to say, endeavours to do. The bill also covers damage to third parties on the ground, not only in the unfortunate event of an aircraft crash but in the event of part of an aircraft, or something from inside an aircraft, breaking free and dropping to the earth.
As for Australia withdrawing from its membership of the Rome convention, there is precedent for this. Canada renounced its membership of the convention in 1976 when it encountered the same problems as we in Australia now face. Australia's participation in the convention will be formally renounced before the new act comes into practice.
Importantly, along with the opposition's support this bill has the support of the Australian aviation industry. The aviation insurance sector and both Ansett and Qantas agree that there 
 will be little or no financial impact on them from the repealing of the current act and the passage of this bill.
It is well known that the vast majority of aircraft carriers and owner-operators already carry enough insurance to cover third party liability. The major advantage of the bill is, therefore, that it will bring some certainty and consistency to an area where there has been confusion for some time. It is also timely of the government to make these changes, considering that the cabinet has recently accepted a more liberal air services policy which allows foreign air carriers greater access to our regional international airports.
For the people of my electorate and for the 1.4 million people living in Western Sydney the thought of aircraft accidents and the extensive damage that could occur in the event of such a mishap has been at the forefront of their minds as the government has continually delayed coming to a decision over the proposed Badgerys Creek airport development. While all of the evidence would suggest that going ahead with the building of a 24-hour international airport, big enough to handle 360,000 movements per year, on the doorstep of Australia's most densely populated area, is complete and utter madness, the government seems intent on pursuing just such an option, only it does not have the courage to make the announcement and face the wrath of the people. As long as this madness goes on, as long as the government obfuscates and puts the decision off month after month, the people of Western Sydney will continue to view with concern the prospect of jumbo jets screeching over their heads 24 hours a day, with all the safety questions that such a prospect raises—questions which this bill surely reflects.
We were told that a decision would be made by December of last year. When that did not eventuate, we presumed then that the government was merely being tardy and that we would hopefully get a result early in the new year. Then we found out in early February that Western Sydney residents, and particularly the voters in the New South Wales state election which was held on 27 March, would not know the result of the EIS until May this year at the earliest. Then, a few weeks ago, the news came that a final decision would more likely be made some time around July or August.
In one of my local papers this week a spokesperson for the minister for transport said the final supplement for the environmental impact study was expected `any day now', but then there is another two months wait before cabinet will review the document. And who knows whether the government will decide to make a decision then, or whether it will put it off for just another few months, or maybe several months? Who knows? We certainly do not.
Members who have been following debates relating to air transport and airports in this country, particularly in the Sydney region, would know that time and time again I have made it my business to represent my constituents whenever legislation related to this subject makes its way into this parliament. Indeed, when bills such as today's present themselves, it is the strong desire of my constituents that I spend part of my time focusing on the planned development of Sydney's second international airport at Badgerys Creek, an airport related matter that worries them greatly, believe me.
We are seeing at the moment a government proceeding towards the development of an airport that carries real safety questions for the 1.4 million Sydneysiders who would reside under the flight paths of any airport being built, or being considered to be built, at Badgerys Creek. Despite this, the EIS has made no attempt to quantify the risks associated with the development, nor the economic and societal losses that any air accident in the vicinity of an airport at Badgerys Creek might cause.
Therefore we are debating a bill that gives accident victims on the ground certainty in regard to compensation but refuses to consider the accident risk associated with building an international airport in the first place. That the government has continued to champion the Badgerys Creek EIS process, despite the fact that it is riddled with weaknesses and inefficiencies, has been well documented. It has chosen to plough ahead rather than take on board the criticisms of a number of organisations as diverse as the New South Wales state government, the Western Sydney Alliance of Councils, the NRMA, Integral Energy, the University of Western Sydney, the Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Trust and the National Trust, all of which condemn the EIS process and the proposed development of Badgerys Creek.
Even the independent auditor's report on the EIS said that the document was deficient, limited and ambiguous. The report further stated:
As a result of  . . . time and cost restraints imposed by the Department of Transport and Regional Development, the draft EIS generally does not go into the degree of detail that could reasonably be expected for such a major proposal.
Since Badgerys Creek was originally chosen as the site for Sydney's second airport, the area of Western Sydney that surrounds it has grown dramatically. Both the population numbers and the amount of housing and industry in the area have exploded. With the unfortunate lessons we have already learnt at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport in relation to air and noise pollution, in regard to safety concerns and the blight on people's standards of living, do we really want to revisit those same problems again if Badgerys Creek were to be built? The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in his second reading speech on this bill said:
Recent air accidents in Australia have seen six houses damaged in one accident and five members of the public killed in another. Recent accidents overseas have demonstrated the potential for considerably more loss of life and property damage—
Those are the minister's own words in the second reading speech of this bill.
Accidents, however rare and unfortunate, do occur. Do we really want to increase the chances of such an accident causing more loss of life, causing more property damage, by building Badgerys Creek airport on Western Sydney's doorstep? Do we really want to increase the chances of an Amsterdam El Al type disaster occurring somewhere in Western Sydney? Isn't it better that an airport be built away from built-up residential areas, away from important industries, away from essential services so that the chances of air accidents devastating all of the above are reduced? Isn't it better, with this in mind, that we look at sites for Sydney's second airport outside the city's basin—whether they be places already considered such as Wilton or Goulburn or new sites that might have been overlooked 15 years ago?
The EIS's failure to consider accident risks and the economic and societal losses that would result from an air crash associated with an airport at Badgerys Creek is a major flaw of the document. In this regard, let me turn to the submission of the Western Sydney Alliance in regard to the draft EIS. It makes it quite clear that there are a number of facilities in Sydney's west, which, if lost through an air accident, would lead to individual losses approaching or exceeding over $50 billion—and yet there is no assessment of this risk in the EIS.
In particular, air crashes into the following facilities were not addressed in the EIS: firstly, the Warragamba and Prospect dams. Some attempt is made in the EIS to calculate crash frequencies in regard to Warragamba Dam, but the impact of the loss of either of these facilities is not discussed, nor is the impact of dumping massive loads of fuel—and jumbo jets 
 carry 155 tonnes of fuel—within Sydney's water catchment area in case of an air emergency. This was not covered, nor discussed.
Secondly, the chlorine treatment plants at Prospect and Orchard Hills are of particular concern because they hold a considerable quantity of chlorine gas which, if released into the atmosphere, would have a devastating impact on the Fairfield, Greystanes, Pendle Hill and Blacktown areas. Thirdly, the Transgrid main distribution substations at Kemps Creek and Eastern Creek are the two main electricity distribution points for the Sydney Basin. Can you imagine the billions of dollars that would be lost to businesses in Sydney if either of these stations were to be destroyed by a crippled jumbo jet?
Fourthly, of course, there are the hundreds of factory sites in the Fairfield, Penrith, Blacktown, Liverpool, Holroyd and Campbelltown areas stored with significant quantities of dangerous goods—large deposits of insecticides being just one of the stored dangerous substances that come to mind. Fifthly, there is the defence communications network centred at Glenbrook. Finally, there are our hospitals, our schools, our universities and other designated sensitive sites within this area.
In addition, the Badgerys Creek EIS does not consider the risk other airports in Sydney may present in contributing to an air accident around Badgerys Creek, nor the impact of bushfires and burn-offs in the Blue Mountains area on aircraft engine failure, nor the consequences of adverse weather, nor bird strikes—a major contributor to air accidents.
The time for building international airports on the boundary of heavily populated areas has passed. There are other options; there are other choices. It is simply up to the government to have the gumption to show the courage and the leadership to address them. The opposition is supporting this bill, but we do not support the way in which the government handles the majority of its airport policy. Quite frankly, as I said earlier, on the whole its airport transport policy has been inept. It has been secretive and it has been arrogant. Its handling of Badgerys Creek is certainly a case in point.
What is the use of taking the admirable step of improving the compensation arrangements for third parties in the event of air accidents when at the same time this government is considering ruining—or perhaps have already decided to ruin—the lives of thousands of Western Sydneysiders by building Badgerys Creek airport and exposing them to the risk of air disaster, fall-out and unnecessary levels of air and noise pollution?
Of course, a second airport needs to be built. The risks of air accidents affecting the people of Marrickville and Sydenham from operations at Kingsford Smith Airport are already above the Department of Environment and Planning guidelines for residential areas. By 2010, this risk will be quite intolerable. But do we want to repeat those dangers in Western Sydney? As commendable as this bill is before us, I am still not convinced this government knows how to put together an effective air transport policy, certainly not one that delivers an equitable solution in regard to a second Sydney airport.
The `world's best practice' that we have been promised by the minister on previous occasions has not been delivered. We are still waiting to see the government rise to that level. I think we will be waiting for a long time to come.",REPS,<title>DAMAGE BY AIRCRAFT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—It is quite an honour to follow the honourable member for Prospect, who wastes no opportunity to speak up on transport matters and particularly as they may affect her electorate and the people of her electorate and Western Sydney. I find 
 myself almost 100 per cent in agreement with the contribution of the member for Prospect. That is probably no surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker.
It is also, I suppose, a pleasure to support a bill introduced by the government concerning damage by aircraft, the Damage by Aircraft Bill 1999 . The first thing I would like to say is that the concept that we need to adequately compensate people, third parties in an aircraft accident who may suffer damage, is a proposition we all should agree with. It is ironic that we have a convention that we need to revoke or denunciate, or whatever the correct word is—the Rome convention, which set out to provide adequate compensation for people so affected—because it limits the damage. Tragically, we now have the history of that accident in Amsterdam where two apartment blocks were taken out, and clearly the compensation would not be adequate.
What it really means is that in the light of a tragedy not in Australia, notwithstanding our very good aviation record in this country, if there were such an accident here those countries that are covered by the convention whose liability would be limited would now be unlimited. It came as a surprise to me to realise that quite a number of countries are not signatories of the Rome convention—the United States, Japan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the United Kingdom, all of which, I think you would say, have very frequent flight operations in and out of this country.
Like the member for Prospect, I make no apology for saying that I do not want any third-party compensation measures in Western Sydney because I do not want an airport there. You might say, `That is a very selfish attitude you are adopting. We all need to share the pain.' But, as I like to point out, by the year 2017 more than half of Sydney's population will live in Western Sydney. I am sure this is a fact that the officials of the department are very cognisant of, probably foremost in their minds. Let me make a qualification: the Statistician takes into account Gosford and Wyong in the population of Sydney; I have excluded that. If you do want to continue with the Statistician's definition, that Gosford and Wyong are part of the Sydney conurbation, then it will be a little bit later. But one thing I can guarantee honourable members in this House is that Western Sydney will be more than half the population of Sydney. Indeed, there is speculation that in the current redistribution in New South Wales an additional seat will be made in Western Sydney, raising the number of seats from 11 to 12. May I say with great respect that probably in any state other than Victoria and Queensland that would constitute a state. So we are talking about a huge population.
As I have said, I do not want any accidents in Western Sydney and I do not want any compensation paid, because I think it is entirely inappropriate for us to consider, in 1999, building an airport in the middle of Western Sydney, in the middle of more than half of Sydney's population. This is absolute madness. The people of Western Sydney might feel very secure because of what they were promised in the 1996 election about airport matters affecting them directly, that there would be a very open, transparent and accountable process. I regret to say that those undertakings, which a lot of people took a lot of heart from, have not been delivered.
The honourable member for Prospect drew my attention again to this issue of the EIS for Badgerys Creek. We have now been promised the final EIS on three separate occasions. I just say to the officials that it will be a difficult decision for the government but why not live up to the original commitment of open, transparent and accountable processes and release the EIS now? It will be a difficult decision, I do not deny that, but it was also a difficult decision for 
 the previous government so I am not trying to score some political points here. I just ask the officials: given the changes that are occurring in the Senate in terms of the environmental laws of Australia, to what extent do you feel constrained, having seen now that the parliament is likely to set newer and higher standards, to undertake to meet the more rigorous requirements that the Senate, as I understand it, is proposing?
I think they would win some Brownie points if they made that recommendation to their minister, and I think the minister would be seen to be consistent if he were to accept that constraint. I accept that it is a constraint. It would be highly ironic if they were to make a decision this year to impose an airport on half of Sydney's population while at the same time saying to the Australian people, `We are accepting higher standards and requirements for Commonwealth EISs but we will not meet it with Badgerys Creek because it is not sufficiently important to warrant the higher standards.' I do believe sincerely that the department and the minister have a responsibility to minimise the potential for accidents. You might say: why would you make a statement that is so patently obvious? I apologise for making such a statement, but one of the real worries people have about these proposals for Sydney, clearly Australia's busiest airport, is that there has not been a study on the inter-operability of the two airports, a study of just how they are going to operate.
There is some suggestion, for example, that it is going to concentrate air traffic into what I understand is called the Bennelong Funnel, but that is mere speculation on my part. The department has allegedly done some preliminary work—and perhaps the officials or the parliamentary secretary may be able to confirm whether such a preliminary report has been prepared—into the inter-operability of these two airports. It would be a great tragedy if cabinet made a decision to go ahead at a time when we had not studied and fully understood the impact of the two airports operating together. It would be a great tragedy if they made the decision and then left that matter for further study.
I want to compliment the Minister for Finance and Administration for taking a growing interest in airport matters. When you have someone who is responsible for the finance portfolio taking an interest in airport matters, that can be only for the good. Recently, there was a newspaper report that Mr Fahey was going to take to cabinet a submission that would look at the Sydney airport issue. The newspaper report referred to the fact that Mr Fahey had opened the whole issue again. The potential for capacity utilisation out of Kingsford Smith airport has never been studied. The newspaper reported that his proposal was to shift rural and regional airlines out of Kingsford Smith to Bankstown, and shift the flying and training clubs out of Bankstown to a new general airport in Western Sydney. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not for airports in Western Sydney. I hope I have made that abundantly clear. But if we must have an airport, I think I would prefer a small general airport than the full monty that is being proposed.
Why do I say that it has opened the capacity question of KSA? It is ironic that, in this EIS proposal, notwithstanding many submissions to the contrary by the good officials of the department who are seated in the chamber today, we call for an examination of whether it is possible, within the strict safety guidelines, to get more capacity out of Kingsford Smith.
Let me put something to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is quite possible that you may wish to quarantine the costs of a new airport and subsidise planes from rural and regional New South Wales landing at Bankstown. By way of compensation for that inconvenience, people would get significantly cheaper flights. I am not sure whether this is in the submission that 
 Mr Fahey is taking to cabinet. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could enlighten us in that regard. I think that is a very worthwhile matter to consider. The whole proposition about the capacity of Kingsford Smith is worthy of examination.
I, for one, would be grateful if the minister for finance could release his submission. Let us look at it. I am happy to try to offer constructive suggestions. I know that the alliance of 10 mayors in Western Sydney would be more than happy to work with Mr Fahey on his submission. We might not agree in the end, but I am sure that the process would be valuable.
Mr Deputy Speaker, do you remember what I said of what the coalition had promised the people of Western Sydney in 1996? An open, transparent and accountable process. Here we have a very senior minister in the Howard government, a former Premier of New South Wales, no less, making a submission to cabinet but not allowing the people of Sydney to examine it and say whether they like it or do not like it, whether they want to support it or whether it is a proposition that is worthy of even more detailed investigation. I urge the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson—this government's third transport minister—and his parliamentary secretary to honour that commitment given in 1996 to have an open, transparent and accountable process.
In winding up, I say that it is a pleasure to support this piece of legislation. Ironically, I have been more on the side of arguing about Australia signing conventions rather than revoking them. In this case, however, I think the revocation is well placed. The idea that there should be unlimited liability in relation to third party ground accidents is well founded. As I said in my earlier contribution, I hope that the issue of compensation will not arise in this century or the next century as far as the people of Western Sydney are concerned, because, as I have said, Western Sydney, in the year 2017, will constitute more than 50 per cent of the population of Sydney.",REPS,<title>DAMAGE BY AIRCRAFT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,1999-06-24,"—I would like to thank members for their contribution today: the member for Chifley, who always gives a very clear view—whether it is on the Damage by Aircraft Bill 1999 , the people of Western Sydney or even areas of child support—and the member for Prospect, who has on more than one occasion been quite vocal, particularly when it comes to aircraft noise.
This bill, the  Damage by Aircraft Bill 1999 , repeals and replaces the current Civil Aviation (Damage by Aircraft) Act 1958 and in particular has implications for the Rome Convention on Damage Caused by Foreign Aircraft to Third Parties on the Surface 1952. This bill will attempt to overcome many anomalies. I also thank other honourable members who have contributed to this debate.
I would like to respond briefly to a number of issues raised by the member for Blair. The honourable member discussed a crash between two gliders that occurred in January 1997 and asked why the bill covered damage to property on the ground but not damage to other aircraft. The government's view is that the benefits of strict and unlimited liability are only appropriate for those parties who can reasonably be predicted to be without fault in an air accident, that is, the non-flying public and their property.
As far as aircraft owners and operators are concerned, it is essential that they carry adequate insurance. In the situation outlined by the member for Blair, hull insurance would cover the damage to the operator's own aircraft and his or her third party liability insurance would cover damage to other parties' aircraft or its non fare paying passengers. Most operators take out cover for those various liabilities as part of a comprehensive all risks single limit cover.
The member for Blair also gave an example of an accident between a taxiing aircraft and an aircraft that was landing. The landing aircraft would be held strictly responsible under the act for any damage to third parties even if it was not entirely at fault. In practice, the owners and insurers of the landing aircraft would pay damages under the bill and then settle the matter with the insurers of the taxiing aircraft on the basis of the hull and third party cover of the aircraft involved. In a case like this, it would be likely that both aircraft would be found to have some degree of fault.
Again, it is essential that the owners and operators of aircraft carry adequate insurance cover to protect themselves in situations like this. This bill will have an impact on all operators at all airports across Australia. I know that it is certainly endorsed by the people in my electorate. We have the sixth busiest airport in Australia, which is the Coolangatta-Gold Coast airport.	I commend the bill to the committee.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—The Labor opposition supports the Statute Stocktake Bill 1999 . It is essentially a tidying up exercise and arises substantially from recommendations of the small business deregulation task force. The bill is divided into two schedules. Part 1 of schedule 1 repeals some 96 acts that no longer have any practical effect. Part 2 of schedule 1 also provides savings provisions that protect the position of the Commonwealth in respect of the repeal of a number of acts: the Environment (Financial Assistance) Act 1977, States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act 1974, States Grants (School Assistance) Acts of 1978 to 1988, and also the Temple Society Trust Fund Act 1949.
Schedule 2 amends various acts consequential on the repeal of the acts referred to in schedule 1. The government has undertaken that the transitional and savings provisions do not have any adverse effect on existing rights. Indeed, the purpose of those transitional provisions, where they have been applied, is to ensure that does not occur. The opposition agrees that is appropriate. The government has also given the opposition notice that it proposes to move additional amendments—namely, savings provisions flowing from the repeal of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Act 1977—so that any moneys payable under those acts remain payable. Again, the Labor Party supports that proposition.
The role of tidying up the statute book is an important but often overlooked feature of the legislature. Too often the public sees only the opposition and the government in a stage of combat over various more controversial emotional issues, but it has been recorded that some 80 per cent of the business of the House is dealt with in a cooperative manner, such as in this 
 case. While the opposition in any parliament is often portrayed as a set of negative and thrill seeking opportunists, that is not the case by and large.
The role of opposition, as the Labor Party sees it, is to be constructive in achieving good government and, where we see fault, to bring that to the attention of the government to argue as vigorously as we can in the parliament for the defeat of those particular measures. But where there is a need for reform, we will genuinely participate in discussions with the government, and also lend our support to those measures.
The tidying up of legislation is a very important area. I think that the cost of justice is not simply the cost of paying for lawyers to stand up and appear in court but also the cost of being able to find the law. Having redundant or ineffective acts of parliament still on the record book can significantly impede the ability of small business or any member of the public to work out for themselves, as far as they can, the current state of the law. It is a means of achieving good and practical government if businesses or private citizens are able to readily look up and work out just what the current law is. Then, if need be, they know which law to seek advice on. The tidying up of the acts of parliament is an important issue. The opposition indicates its support for the procedure that has been undertaken in respect of this bill.",REPS,<title>STATUTE STOCKTAKE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-06-24,"—I rise to support the Statute Stocktake Bill 1999 , which is an important piece of administrative machinery. This is not high profile legislation but simply a matter of housekeeping. It is appropriate that we undertake such a process. It is about making sure that redundant legislation, no longer part of the needs of government, is removed from the statute books. Although there has been a process of ad hoc amendments to remedy deficiencies of existing legislation, there has not been an attempt to remove the legislation itself if it is seen to be no longer required.
The government is seeking, by this bill, simply to clear the statute books of acts that have outlived their purpose, for example the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Act 1982 and the Australian Land Transport (Financial Assistance) Act 1985, acts in which I took particular interest when I was transport minister in New South Wales. The fact is that they have reached their use-by date; they are no longer required on the statute books. It is important that we save taxpayer funding in terms of the issuance of the Commonwealth's statutes. It is a requirement that every lawyer, or floor in a legal firm, has a complete, up-to-date copy of Commonwealth statutes—and in my city of Sydney there are 2,000 barristers. The requirement to have Butterworths, for example, supplying cross-reference stickers to update legislation involves a considerable amount of time and would be lessened if statutes were removed when they lost their relevance.
I am informed that this is the first bill introduced in this parliament which legislates for removing a great number of redundant laws, although in the 1980s the Labor government's many statute law revision acts removed a great number of miscellaneous provisions. That was an important first step. The coalition announced its intention to introduce this legislation in its law and justice policy for the 1996 election as it was considered that Labor's process for repairing our laws was too much a piecemeal approach, and that a more comprehensive, cross-portfolio approach was required. The fact that the coalition has taken on this somewhat unglamorous task of statute law reform indicates that we are a government of reform. This is just one small piece of evidence to indicate that.
I commend the government for this initiative. I am sure that there are many barristers and others in the legal fraternity who also think that it is appropriate. I am grateful to my colleague 
 the honourable member for Hughes for continuing the debate to make sure that everything has been taken into consideration.",REPS,<title>STATUTE STOCKTAKE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Vale, Danna, MP",LP,1999-06-24,"—The Statute Stocktake Bill 1999  provides for the repeal of redundant legislation and is part of a continuing process by the coalition government to implement sound housekeeping practices in relation to the vast collection of legislation that makes up the Commonwealth's statute law. I am grateful to the Parliamentary Library for its research and the information in the Bills Digest . I notice that this bill continues to deliver the coalition government's law and justice policy commitment to undertake a `statute stocktake', a long overdue project of repair of existing Commonwealth legislation.
In 1996, the government's Small Business Deregulation Task Force recommended `that all Commonwealth agencies identify and repeal redundant regulations'. While there has always been concern in government and business circles about the burden placed on small business by compliance requirements, the task force was also concerned with the removal of redundant regulations within the context of maintaining a process of review to `ensure that the regulations that are in place are still meeting their objectives and that those objectives are still valid'.
In June 1996, the government began to implement its law and justice policy with the introduction of the Statute Law Revision Act 1996. This bill repealed a number of acts whose operation had expired, corrected minor clerical and drafting errors in current legislation and updated references to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. It also amended gender specific language in other acts. In 1997, the Attorney-General, the Hon. Daryl Williams, requested that portfolio ministers identify redundant legislation still on the statute books and also identify legislation in need of repair within their areas of responsibility.
Since Federation, the number of laws added each year to the statute book has increased with the growing complexities of the nature of modern society in which we live. In 1901 there were 17 acts passed and in 1902 this number increased to 19. The Chifley government, from September 1946 to December 1949, introduced a total of 354 new acts. In the first seven years of the Menzies government, from 1950 to 1956, some 634 new acts were introduced. The Fraser government passed 1,289 acts between 1976 and 1983 and the Hawke government introduced 1,427 during its term of office between 1984 and 1991. In the four years of the Keating government, from 1992 to 1995, there were 745 new acts added to the statute book.
Although it does not necessarily occur after every election, many new governments introduce new legislation to implement policy initiatives and to fulfil election promises. This is exactly the source of this particular bill, moving the coalition government to fulfil a pre-election commitment to undertake a statute stocktake and the repair of Commonwealth laws. The Liberal and National parties law and justice policy, which is dated February 1996, states:
The Parliament, as the primary law-maker, must bear a direct responsibility for maintenance and repair of the justice system. Commonwealth Statute Law is neither accessible or comprehensible. It is convoluted, complex and often very long.
The Australian Parliament under Labor legislates quickly and voluminously. While numbers alone do not tell the whole story, it is instructive to note that the Australian Federal Parliament passes about three times as many Acts as its Canadian and English counterparts and, in most years, more than the US Congress.
Complex and convoluted laws require lawyers to interpret them. The more complex the law, the longer the lawyer will take and the greater the cost. The average citizen has little hope of understanding the laws.
Existing statute laws—whether in the area of tax, corporations law or social security—are strangling both the ordinary citizen and the business community. 

Our laws are an integral part of our intellectual infrastructure. Like any other infrastructure, it requires repair as well as reform. Under Labor the repair process has been ad hoc and piecemeal. The Corporations Law  is being tackled, but it was proving a slow process.
We believe a more comprehensive, cross portfolio, approach is required. We will undertake a `statute stocktake': a long overdue project of repair of existing Commonwealth legislation.
This is not a commitment made lightly. Wholesale repair of existing legislation will be hard work. It will require commitment and dedication. Politically, it is a low profile task. Labor has marketed itself as the party of reform, yet it has been willing to let existing structures decay and crumble. On gaining office we will:
.	 require each Minister to prioritise legislation within his or her portfolio for repair;
.	 to require repair programs to be developed in each portfolio with tight schedules;
.	 establish a timetable which results in the repair process being in sight of completion across all portfolios by the year 2001; and
.	 require Ministers to report annually to Parliament detailing progress of the repair process.
As we have noted, during the past 25 years the number of acts passed by parliament has dramatically increased. This has a lot to do with the increased reach of Commonwealth regulations and also reflects how such laws increasingly have an impact on all aspects of modern daily life. Today, federal legislation can have a significant effect upon communities at a family, social and business level through family law, business regulation, social welfare, environmental legislation or taxation. There is even an expectation at the very grassroots level of our communities that, in a new area identified as one of concern to the general public, the government should pass a law.
There are thousands of Commonwealth acts on the statute book and, increasingly, these laws are being expanded. We simply cannot just keep adding without exercising proper management of those acts which are no longer necessary or which have exhausted their initial purpose. The government passed the Statute Law Revision Act in 1996 to begin this long process of repair and to reform the statute book as an election commitment. The Statute Stocktake Bill is a further step in that important process, as the stocktake revealed many redundant acts. This bill will repeal 96 redundant acts which are listed in schedule 1 of part 1 and will make amendments to other acts consequential upon the repeal of that legislation and make savings and transitional provisions.
Some of the main provisions in this bill include clause 4, which repeals the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, an imperial act, so far as it forms part of the law of the Commonwealth or an external territory. This bill provides that section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which sets out the effects of repealing an act, applies to the repeal as if the Merchant Shipping Act has been an act of the Australian parliament.
Clause 3 provides that each act referred to in a schedule to the bill is amended or repealed as set out in the schedule. The repeal of an act does not affect the operation of any amendment of another act which was made by the act being repealed.
Clause 2 provides that the act commences when it receives royal assent, except for the amendments of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, contained in part 6 of schedule 2, which will not commence until a section 8AAB is inserted in the Tax Administration Act. The latter amendments will commence on royal assent if a section 8AAB has been inserted by that time.
Some of the interesting old statutes to be repealed by this bill present a history of Australian society and industrial development. These include the Estate Duty Act and the Estate Duty 
 Assessment Act 1914, the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945 and the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947.
The maintenance, repair and reform of the statute book is not exactly one of the glamour areas of politics and requires determined application, hard work and commitment. However, it is a necessary task and one which will ensure that all members of the wider Australian community will be able to enjoy greater access to an uncluttered legislative base. A clear access to a nation's laws is an important indicium of democracy, and this bill demonstrates the health of the Australian democratic process. It further reflects the determination of the Howard government to deliver on its commitments to the Australian people. I commend this legislation to the Main Committee.",REPS,<title>STATUTE STOCKTAKE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,1999-06-24,"—I will be very brief. I would like to thank the member for Barton, the member for Cook and the member for Hughes for their interest in what is not politically glamorous but is, nevertheless, very useful and very productive. I particularly congratulate the member for Hughes on her research on the subject and her interest in the cleaning up of the statute book. In this context, I commend the bill to the Main Committee.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—The opposition supports the second reading of the bill, which is essentially non-controversial and, as the Attorney-General said in his second reading speech, by and large contains amendments of a minor policy nature, makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation and repeals spent provisions. The bill, as with the previous bill, is in the nature of omnibus legislation in the sense that there are 14 separate acts which are being amended by this one act and the term `omnibus' is used because those acts are riding as passengers on this one bill.
Schedule 1 proposes amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act of 1975. The opposition supports the amendments, which are substantially based on recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report, relating to the Administrative Review Council, which was handed down on 18 September 1996. That council was established in 1976 by the Fraser government under part V of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 as an expert body to provide advice on administrative law and administrative decision making. It is fair to say that Australia has developed perhaps the most sophisticated administrative appeals and review structure of any Western nation, and that is to be cherished. It is desirable that the recommendations of the Senate committee's report be implemented, and the Labor Party supports the amendments.
Interestingly, the 11th recommendation from the Senate committee report cannot be the subject of legislation. That recommendation stated:
The Committee recommends that the Government give an undertaking to respond to all Administrative Review Council project reports within 12 months of their delivery.
It is fair to say that the Australian community and members of parliament would expect the government to abide by that recommendation in practice. However, in its response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's report, the government indicated that it was not prepared to accept the recommendation. We would ask the government to revisit the matter because we think that the community generally would expect that a 12 months response time is reasonable and that the government should be expected to respond to project reports within that time.
Schedule 2 makes amendments to the Australian Law Reform Commission (Repeal, Transitional and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1996 which are of a technical nature and are supported by the opposition. Schedule 3 makes an amendment to the Australian Protective Services Act 1987 which provides that the director of the Protective Service may charge non-Commonwealth persons and bodies for services rendered. As members would be aware, the Australian Protective Service provides protective and custodial services primarily for Commonwealth purposes, as directed by the minister. Again, the opposition does not oppose the amendment. However, it notes that there is a potential constitutional issue as to whether there is any constitutional head of power contained in section 51 of the Constitution, or otherwise, to enable the Commonwealth to charge for such services.
For instance, in respect of recent legislation to corporatise the Australian Government Solicitor, the AGS was restricted in providing services for government bodies, being the Commonwealth, state and local government bodies, because the Attorney-General—correctly, we consider, at that time—determined that there was a constitutional impediment to the Australian Government Solicitor undertaking work on behalf of private corporations or citizens. By analogy, we say that reasoning is probably applicable in respect of schedule 3 of the bill.
Schedule 4 of the bill proposes an amendment to the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Act 1996, and it is designed to amend that act to correct what has been described as a minor drafting error contained in subsection 20J(2) which relates to the reasons for the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy holding money. I should say that the opposition is indebted to the researchers of the Parliamentary Library who undertook an extensive review of this bill and detected an error in the initial draft proposed by the government; hence the government has given the opposition notice that it will rectify the deficiency drawn to our attention and, in turn, to the government's attention.
Schedule 5 proposes an amendment to the Copyright Amendment Act 1989, but that proposal, as contained in the bill presently, before further amendment, fails to have regard to previous amendments made to the act in 1993 and 1998. But, again, as a result of useful Parliamentary Library research that error has been pointed out to the opposition and drawn to the government's attention. That fact has now been appreciated by the government, and schedule 5, I understand, will no longer proceed, with the government to move a further amendment to delete that schedule.
Schedule 6 corrects a minor drafting error in the Corporate Law Reform Act 1992, and is supported. Schedule 8 and schedule 9 amend the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and the High Court of Australia Act 1979 respectively to allow regulations to be made to increase the limit up to which courts can enter into contracts without obtaining the approval of the Attorney-General. Again, we say that that amendment is sensible and appropriate.
I would point out, however, that the explanatory memorandum may convey a mistaken impression. It suggests that the purpose of an amendment is to increase the number of Australian Capital Territory resident judges available to sit on the full court of the Federal Court of Australia when hearing appeals from the ACT Supreme Court. In fact, a reading of the bill tends to suggest that the contrary appears to be the case and that the actual purpose of item 1 of schedule 8 is to remove the requirements that an ACT resident judge should be included on a full court of the Federal Court of Australia when considering an appeal from the ACT Supreme Court. We appreciate there are administrative reasons for that amendment to ensure that justice is not delayed; however, it seems that it would be appropriate to correct 
 the record and that apparently mistaken impression given in that respect by the explanatory memorandum.
Schedule 10 amends the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 to recognise prior judicial service as a judge of the Supreme Court of the ACT. Schedule 11 amends the Judiciary Act 1903 to exclude the conferral of criminal jurisdiction on the Federal Court and to clarify the power of state and territory judges to exercise summary jurisdiction for Commonwealth offences.
We do have some reservations about removing private prosecutions from the scope of the Federal Court—in particular, the court's ability to deal with those matters under its accrued jurisdiction. It has been pointed out, for example, that a civil action relating to the removal of Aboriginal children may also involve issues that could result in a private prosecution alleging genocide. That is one example. There are perhaps others. Indeed, there may be other areas in the industrial field where some federal action in an industrial dispute situation has an element of some state offence. There may be other areas in the Family Court area in respect of allegations of violence.
We think that these things have to be looked at more carefully. The recent decision of the High Court re Wakim: ex parte McNally, which casts doubt on the cross-vesting arrangements, suggests that section 32 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 could be a very important section in overcoming the fragmentation of state and federal issues. We would urge the government to hasten slowly in this area. On the one hand, there are arguments that a judge receiving an application under section 32 of the Federal Court of Australia Act, and being asked to exercise his discretion to join a private criminal prosecution, would consider as a matter of discretion that it would be difficult to differentiate between the civil onus of proof applying in the civil matter and the criminal onus of proof applying in the criminal proceedings. Hence there would be a strong argument, I would anticipate, that joinder of such proceedings would not be appropriate.
Equally, a defendant in those proceedings may well say, `The defendant opposes any joinder of criminal proceedings to civil proceedings on the basis that it could compel the defendant to incriminate themselves in respect of criminal proceedings.' Indeed, it is frequently the case that a defendant to a civil action also facing criminal consequences will invariably request that the civil proceedings be deferred until after the criminal action takes its course, for those reasons of self-incrimination.
There may be sound reasons why criminal proceedings should not be joined to civil proceedings, but these are issues that we need to think through more carefully, particularly in light of the Wakim case. I should say that the Labor Party will be examining those issues more carefully between our consenting to the second reading motion and the matters being considered in the Senate. It may well be that, having regard to those more complex considerations we would like to go through, the government, in order to expedite the balance of the bill through the Senate, would consider at the present time removing that aspect from item 11 of the bill. We would point out to the government that that is something we would appreciate, and, from the government's point of view, it would expedite the passage of the balance of the bill. Of course, any removal of that aspect of item 9 would be entirely without prejudice to the government's ability to reintroduce that for further consideration and debate at a subsequent time.
Schedule 12 amends the Jury Exemption Act 1965 to update certain references. Schedules 13 and 14 amend the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1997 and the Marriage Act 
 1961 to correct minor drafting and technical errors. I also note that schedule 15 will now be deleted. It had been considered that an error existed in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, but again, substantially as a result of library research, it has now been realised that the error may already have been corrected by item 16 of schedule 1 to the Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Act 1977, which commenced operation on 11 November 1997. I should say that I think that the professional and skilled work done by the library in this instance demonstrates the service that it provides to members of parliament generally. It is certainly a very important aspect of the opposition's task in reviewing legislation when we do not have the resources of government departments. I think that in this instance it showed that the resources spent on the library are well served and the respect that it has gained from both sides of the House is justified.
It is proposed in schedule 16 to amend the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 to correct a previous misdescription of amendments and to correct a technical anomaly. While I could spend a considerable amount of time discussing each of the amendments proposed in the bill, there are only a few concluding comments I propose to make.
I note that the government is proposing amendments to rectify, in particular, deficiencies in drafting. These amendments are substantially non-controversial and are supported by the Labor Party in so far as, as we have said, the government needs to reconsider that part of schedule 11 with respect to the amendment to section 39B(1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903, because that could be a controversial issue in the Senate, and also to correct the record in respect of item 1 of schedule 8. Again, we would like to see those matters addressed before the bill is debated in the Senate.
There is only one other substantive issue that I wish to comment on and that is reforms of the Administrative Review Council. Firstly, on behalf of the Labor Party, I want to thank the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee for its role in reviewing the legislation which governs the operation of the ARC. I am pleased to see that the government has accepted its recommendations in full with the exception of recommendation 11. Secondly, I wish to thank the ARC for more than 20 years of work it has done in reviewing and reforming Australia's world-leading system of administrative law. As I noted earlier, it was a body established under the Fraser Liberal government, but it has served well for that period of 20 years.
Finally, I note that the government is proposing to introduce reforms to the administrative law system in, I anticipate, the spring sitting of parliament. I have to say that there is much apprehension not only on our side of politics but also, I sense, in the community about these reforms because, unlike the recommendations of the ARC in its Better decisions report, it is feared that the government means to wind back the opportunities for ordinary Australians to obtain administrative review. As the government puts the finishing touches to that bill, I would urge it not to go down that path of winding back the tremendous system that we have developed. If it does, it will meet with heavy resistance from the Labor Party, the community and, it is to be expected, the legal profession generally.
I make these comments not as a threat but in the hope that the government will realise the errors of its ways and will accept an administrative law system in large part established, as I have indicated, by its predecessor Liberal government, the Fraser government. That system should not be dismantled in the name of so-called efficiency. These are important rights that 
 ordinary Australians have, and the parliament should be enhancing and improving these rights rather than winding them back.
Constructively, I note that the use of this omnibus legislation to correct a myriad minor deficiencies that inevitably arise in legislation and to implement non-controversial reforms was a practice commenced by the previous Labor government. It not only is a sensible and practical method of legislating but also places an even tougher burden on those crosschecking that the proposed amendments have their intended effect.
It is a pity that the public do not get to see this aspect of parliament's role in cooperatively going through legislation to make sure that it properly serves its purpose. It is a sure sign that, despite our combative moments, the parliament is committed to getting on with the job of making Australia's laws modern and more effective. Subject to the comments that I have already made, the bulk of the amendments proposed in this bill are welcomed by the Labor Party and, accordingly, we support the second reading motion.",REPS,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Schultz, Alby, MP",LP,1999-06-24,"—The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  was introduced in the House of Representatives on 3 December 1998. The bill makes amendments of a minor policy nature to a number of acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio, including the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 and the Judiciary Act 1903.
The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 will implement the government's decisions on the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in its report on the role and function of the Administrative Review Council of June 1997. The government accepted 10 of the 11 recommendations made by the committee. Legislation is required to implement six of these recommendations. The government did not accept the last of the committee's recommendations, recommendation 11, namely, that the government gives an undertaking to respond to all Administrative Review Council project reports within 12 months of delivery.
The arguments in support of the recommendation for a government response to all ARC project reports within 12 months of presentation are: it is wasteful of resources for the ARC to produce reports which are not dealt with promptly; the currency of reports may diminish over time; and the government has adopted a policy responding within three months to parliamentary committee reports. These arguments have some force and should not be disregarded. However, there are arguments against the adoption of a fixed term for responding to ARC project reports. The ARC should ensure that its work program closely reflects the government's priorities and its reports are produced in a timely manner. Although the council may receive references from the minister, the council may also determine projects and its own work priorities. There is no requirement that the council first have a reference from the minister before commencing work on a matter, nor is the council required to obtain the minister's approval for particular projects. Accordingly, it is inappropriate for the government to give an undertaking to respond to project reports that do not reflect the government's priorities.
The resources that may be made available to deal with ARC recommendations are a matter for the government, having regard to its overall policy and legislative agenda. Having said that, the issue of resource allocation must be of continuous concern to all parties: the responsible minister, the department, and the ARC. The requirement to respond to ARC reports within a set period of time will impact on the department's ability to meet other priorities. 
 There is no comparable requirement of undertaking to respond to reports by the Australian Law Reform Commission or the Family Law Council.
The ARC does not have status or authority comparable to that of parliamentary committees and the council should not be regarded as being equivalent to a committee of the parliament. Whereas a government response to recommendations by a parliamentary committee is quite properly considered to be a response to the parliament as a whole, a response to recommendations by the council would be no more than a response to the council itself. Nevertheless, it is appropriate for the parliament to be informed about the work which the council is undertaking, and for that reason the new section 51C will require the minister to table those reports in the parliament within 15 sitting days after receiving the report.
The government notes that the Senate committee found that objective assessment of the ARC's effectiveness was not easy, due to the wide range of the ARC's activities and the inherent difficulties in objectively assessing such things as the quality of its advice, the value of its policy recommendations, and the success of its efforts to promote administrative law values. Nevertheless, the Senate committee concluded that the evidence received by the committee supports the view that the Administrative Review Council has been an effective body providing useful and timely advice on administrative review matters. The government has welcomed that finding.
The amendments now proposed will enhance the council's role and functions by permitting the appointment of additional members to assist it to undertake particular projects; enable the appointment of persons with the direct knowledge and experience of the needs of people or groups of people significantly affected by government decisions; make certain that the council is able to keep the Commonwealth administrative law system under review, to monitor developments and to make recommendations; enable the council to inquire into the adequacy of procedures used to exercise administrative discretions as well as the procedures used to make administrative decisions; enable the council to inquire into the qualifications required of persons undertaking administrative review, the extent of the jurisdiction conferred on review bodies and the procedures used by those review bodies; and enable the council to facilitate training for decision makers, promote knowledge about the Commonwealth administrative law system and to consider and report on matters referred to it by the minister.
Parliament will be better informed about the work of the council with the new requirement to table in both houses of parliament, within 15 sitting days, all council reports submitted to the minister. This will be additional to the requirement that the council prepare an annual report as soon as possible after 30 June in each year.
The proposed amendment to the Australian Protective Service Act 1997 will enable the Australian Protective Service, APS, to charge non-Commonwealth clients. The Australian Protective Service Act 1987 does not contain any provisions authorising the APS to charge clients for services. The Office of General Counsel has advised that a charging provision is necessary to allow the APS to charge non-Commonwealth clients. Allowing the APS to charge for services ensures that it will be able to effectively compete with private security firms.
The proposed amendments to the Evidence Act 1995 will give full effect to regulations made or amended since the commencement of the act on 18 April 1995 which provide for a certificate or other document to have evidentiary effect; accommodate the Family Court's practice of taking evidence in chief by affidavit; extend the operation of some sections of the Evidence Act to proceedings in all Australian courts in relation to certain forms, applications, 
 claims, returns and other similar documents received by Commonwealth departments and agencies; and make minor drafting corrections to the act. The amendments do not validate regulations. There is no element of retrospectivity in the amendments. They commence on the day the amending act receives royal assent. Some regulations made since April 1995 have been of no effect in proceedings in federal courts and ACT courts, because of inconsistency with the Evidence Act, but have full force and effect in proceedings in other courts. Regulations which fall within the amendments will have effect in federal courts and ACT courts only from the date the amending act becomes law.
The principle of `orality' is not compromised by the amendments. The amendments simply bring the act into line with the practice of giving evidence in affidavit form or by way of a written statement where that practice applies. In the Family Court, evidence in chief is generally given by affidavit. Written statements are permitted in the Federal Court's commercial causes list. As a consequence, amendments are proposed to several provisions of the act referring to oral evidence so that they will apply to evidence given in oral or written form. It is still necessary for the evidence given in either of these ways to satisfy the same conditions of admissibility as oral evidence. For example, evidence given under the hearsay exceptions in sections 63(2)(a), 64(2)(a) or 65(8)(a) will still need to be given `by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived' the out-of-court statements being made.
New section 155A will enable evidence of a Commonwealth document to be given in proceedings in all Australian courts without having to call a witness. It is, in its terms, to the same effect as section 155, which applies to evidence of a Commonwealth record or a state or territory public record. It enables evidence of a Commonwealth document to be adduced by production of a certified true copy or extract and provides a presumption to assist in the authentication of evidence adduced in this way. For technical reasons, section 155 could not be extended to apply, in respect of Commonwealth documents, to all proceedings before all Australian courts by proposed new subsection 182(4B). However, the effect of such extended application is achieved by new section 155A.
New subsection 182(4B) extends the operation of the sections and divisions of the act mentioned in its opening lines to proceedings in all Australian courts in respect of Commonwealth documents. Together with new subsection 182(4A), it will be the second and third extension of the operation of particular provisions of the act beyond federal and ACT courts to proceedings before all Australian courts. Subsection 182(1) already extends the operation of several provisions of the act relevant to documentary evidence to proceedings in all Australian courts in respect of `Commonwealth records'. New subsection 182(4A) will extend the operation of just one provision—section 160—in respect of a postal article sent  by a Commonwealth agency. New subsection 182(4B) will extend the operation of the provisions set out in its opening lines to proceedings in all Australian courts in respect of `Commonwealth documents'.
The term `Commonwealth agency' is defined in section 163 for the purpose of that section. The term is also used in new subsection 182(4A). Therefore, it is appropriate to transfer the definition to part 1 of the dictionary in the act.
Section 50, whose heading reads `Proof of voluminous or complex documents', enables a court to direct that evidence of the contents of two or more documents be adduced in the form of a summary if, among other things, it would not be possible to conveniently examine the evidence because of the volume and complexity of the documents. The inclusion of `and' is 
 an error. The original drafting instructions for the Evidence Act sought the provision in the alternative form. However, in the draft of the bill, `volume or complexity' became `volume and complexity' and the provision remained in those terms. As a result, section 50 cannot be used where a large number of non-complex documents such as Medicare assignment forms or cheques are involved. Item 8 proposes replacing `volume and complexity' with `volume or complexity.'
When the Evidence Act was passed in 1995, it contained an error in including section 160 in the list of provisions set out in the table in section 182 that, in respect of `Commonwealth records', were to have an extended operation in proceedings before all Australian courts. Section 160 provides a presumption about the fact and date of receipt of postal articles. However, since a postal article is not a `record', section 160 cannot be extended to operate in proceedings before all Australians courts in respect of `Commonwealth records'.
The proposed amendments, items 25 and 26, will make the corrections to the table in section 182, and the proposed amendment, item 24, proposed new subsection 182(4A), will extend the operation of the presumption in section 160 to proceedings before all Australian courts in relation to postal articles sent by Commonwealth agencies.
The amendments will not harm uniformity. The original Commonwealth and New South Wales evidence acts were largely, but not completely, uniform. Most of the differences resulted from one act being a Commonwealth statute and the other a New South Wales statute. Subsequently, there have been some amendments agreed between the Commonwealth and New South Wales, and New South Wales has included some additional provisions.
Most of the Evidence Act amendments made by this bill concern purely Commonwealth matters. The only exceptions are the correction of section 50 and the amendments relating to oral evidence. New South Wales has been consulted about these amendments and has raised no concerns.
The proposed amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 will allow additional judges of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory to be included on the full court of the Federal Court; provide that a registrar of the court may authorise officers or employees of the court to administer oaths and witness affidavits; and insert a standard regulation making power. The purpose of the amendments is to increase the number of judges available to sit on appeals to the full court of the Federal Court when hearing appeals from the ACT Supreme Court.
Subsection 25(3) of the act currently provides that, except where the chief justice considers it impractical, the full court hearing and appeal from the ACT Supreme Court should include at least one resident judge of the ACT Supreme Court who is also a judge of the Federal Court. There is a convention that the chief justice of the Federal Court assigns one of the resident ACT judges to sit on appeals from the Supreme Court. There are only three resident judges who are also judges of the Federal Court. The proposed amendment will allow additional judges of the Supreme Court of the ACT, as well as resident judges, to be included in the full court.
A resident judge of the ACT Supreme Court is a judge whose primary commission is on the ACT Supreme Court. An additional judge is a judge of another superior court who has been appointed to the ACT Supreme Court as an additional judge. A number of Federal Court judges have been appointed as additional judges of the ACT Supreme Court. Additional judges are also available to assist the court in times of peak workload or when other judges are 
 unavailable. The ACT Supreme Court does not have appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Supreme Court and, accordingly, does not have a Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court. It is a matter for the ACT government to consider whether it is appropriate for it to establish a Court of Appeal. The government believes that it is not consistent with the transfer of responsibility for the Supreme Court to the ACT government for new appointees to be given dual commissions on the Federal Court.
This amendment will ensure that there are sufficient counter staff available at Federal Court registries who are authorised to administer oaths or witness affidavits. This will enhance the capacity of the registries to deliver an effective service to clients of the Federal Court. The number of persons available to administer affidavits for use in court proceedings has diminished since amendments to the Statutory Declarations Act abolished the position of commissioner for declarations. Prior to this amendment, counter staff were appointed as commissioners for declarations and accordingly had authority to administer affidavits. The proposed amendments allow the registrar to authorise court staff to administer oaths and affirmations and to witness affidavits for the purposes of court proceedings.
Proposed new section 44(2) is similar in terms to subsection 77F(3) of the Judiciary Act which was recently repealed. Subsection 77F(3) of the Judiciary Act provided that the Chief Justice of the High Court could issue commissions authorising persons to administer oaths for the purposes of proceedings. The High Court requested that the provision be repealed, as it had not been used since 1972. The fact that this section has been repealed does not impact on the proposed amendment to the Federal Court Act, as the court has identified a need for the proposed amendment.
The regulation making power in the Federal Court Act is restricted to the making of fees regulations. There are a number of provisions in the act which indicate that certain matters can be provided for by regulations. However, there is no regulation making power to provide for the making of such regulations. In particular, the Chief Justice's power to enter contracts is subject to the Attorney-General approving any contract exceeding $250,000 or a prescribed higher amount. The proposed regulation making power will allow a higher amount to be prescribed. The costs of administering courts and agencies has increased significantly since the $250,000 limit was set in 1989. Regulations were made last year to increase this limit to $1 million for the Family Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
There is no regulation making power in the High Court of Australia Act. There are a number of provisions in the act which indicate that certain matters can be provided for by regulations. However, there is no regulation making power to provide for the making of such regulations. In particular, the court's power to enter contracts is subject to the Attorney-General approving any contract exceeding $250,000 or a prescribed higher amount. The proposed regulation making power will allow a higher amount to be prescribed.
The proposed amendment to the Judges' Pensions Act will provide that service as a judge of the ACT Supreme Court will be counted as judicial service for the purposes of determining when a judge becomes entitled to a pension under the Judges' Pensions Act. This amendment will remove an anomaly from the Judges' Pensions Act. The definition of `prior judicial service' does not include service as a judge of the ACT Supreme Court. This means that if an ACT judge were subsequently given a primary commission on a federal court, service as a judge of the ACT Supreme Court would not be counted as service for the purposes of the 
 Judge's Pensions Act. This amendment will put ACT judges in the same position as Northern Territory and state Supreme Court judges in relation to `prior judicial service'.
The proposed amendments to the Judiciary Act 1903 will expressly exclude conferral of a general criminal jurisdiction on the Federal Court. The question needs to be asked, `Why does criminal jurisdiction need to be excluded?' The comment that I make on that is that it is not appropriate for the Federal Court to be given general criminal jurisdiction. The Federal Court is primarily a civil court having jurisdiction in almost all civil matters arising under federal law. It has a very limited criminal jurisdiction in some summary criminal matters and also exercises some criminal jurisdiction in its appellate jurisdiction from the ACT Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island. The Federal Court does not have the expertise necessary to take on a broad criminal jurisdiction nor the facilities for jury trials which are necessary in many criminal matters.
Subsection 39B(1A) was intended to give the Federal Court jurisdiction only in civil matters, this jurisdiction being concurrent with the federal jurisdiction of state and territory courts in civil matters. This amendment ensures that the provision cannot be interpreted to give the court a general criminal jurisdiction under federal laws.	I thank the House for the indulgence and the opportunity to talk on this bill and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—I hope the Attorney-General will not be disappointed in me if I do not traverse each section of the changes encompassed in this omnibus bill. The previous two speakers have done that in great detail.
An omnibus bill, of course, provides for a portfolio area to make a number of significant changes to different bits of legislation. For example, I note that one of the changes proposed in this bill, as far as the Evidence Act is concerned, affects the Family Court. I wondered if I could make a few observations in the family law area.
Firstly, I want to say that I attended the launch of the government's response to the committee report To have and to hold. I would like to thank the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General for acknowledging the outstanding contribution of Kevin Andrews, the honourable member for Menzies, in this area of pre-marriage education and counselling. For a short period I was privileged to serve under Kevin on that committee. His contribution was quite significant. I would like to think I am an interventionist chairman, but I have to say I have never written a couple of chapters of a report, which is what Kevin did.
The point I would like to link up with is that I feel there are three pillars in the family law area where we need to move forward on a broad front. The first one is Kevin's area. The government is increasing money there but, as it was pointed out, breakdowns are costing us at least $3 billion. I think the more governments put in, the greater the potential of reward. The second is child support—and I do not want to get into that—and the third is reforming the Family Court.
Not so long ago I had a constituent and friend, Barbara Dutton, come into my office. She is an advocacy worker for children and is involved in some of the more difficult cases. She asked me when I was going to do something to get some changes in. I was really taken aback because I had not thought that I had been quiet on that front. That led to a conference we had on 15 June on the topic, `Children, the forgotten players—rethinking family law proceedings'. It was based around a reference the Attorney-General has given to the Australian Law Reform Commission. I want to acknowledge that the Attorney-General has been active in reform in 
 the family law area. I feel that we need to go much further than that, but I would not want to deprecate the changes that he has already initiated.
I am pleased to say that the conference was opened by Senator Vicki Bourne, a Democrat senator, and we had Commissioner Dr Kathryn Cronin from the Australian Law Reform Commission, who is the commissioner responsible for the reference, as the keynote speaker. I was tremendously impressed by her contribution. I only wish that we had recorded it or that it had been a written contribution. We invited her to give a scoop on the final report. I was somewhat disappointed that she declined to give one but I would not want to minimise her contribution. I think the Attorney-General is going to be well pleased. It will be beyond doubt that we need to make significant changes to the way the Family Court operates. I would like to say that it is a Rolls Royce court with a `one size fits all' approach.
We also then had a contribution from a woman whose speech was read out for her because she wanted to be anonymous. The two made a really powerful beginning to the conference. Other speakers included Michael Green QC, the author of Fathers after divorce, a book that I was pleased to launch; Sara Blazey from the Women's Legal Resource Centre, and Denise Reid, a barrister. Kevin Andrews contributed quite significantly in his area of expertise. I also presented a paper on family law tribunals.
It was really interesting to have three members of parliament, each from a different political party, able to contribute in a very non-partisan way to the proceedings. It was a conference not confined to the club—the judges, barristers and solicitors who are tied up with this. It was much broader. In fact, the conference was brought about through a partnership between the Mount Druitt and Area Community Legal Centre. I would like to acknowledge the contributions of Ahmed Zraika and Ros Gibson. I acknowledge also that the Attorney funded the legal centre, for which I am eternally grateful, and that the Nirimba TAFE advocacy students—Pat Johnson was the lecturer there—were instrumental in it.
When we talk about family law we nearly always get locked into gender warfare—that the women get everything, the men are not paying enough and what have you—but I was surprised at the commonality of the themes that were coming out of the conference. Just as that personal experience of the woman had such a powerful impact, it is an impact that of course men also experience. You could have substituted that as a story for men. It might have been thought that Sara Blazey, from the Women's Legal Resource Centre, was going to take a particular narrow point of view, but that was not the case. I think some of the men who asked loaded questions after her contribution were surprised at the answer. My point is that this affects people and that the most adversely affected are the children, which was the theme of our conference.
The Attorney has introduced legislation to establish a federal magistracy. I do not want to pre-empt any discussion of that, and I cannot speak for the Labor Party. We see that there will be improvements in it, but the point I would like to make is that, in the Attorney's own state, we have a magistracy in the Family Court. I think that as you go around Western Australia you do not get a greater feeling that people are satisfied with the processes of family law than you do in any other state. Hence the paper that I delivered about tribunals.
The High Court's Brandy decision has dramatically limited the government's options in micro-economic reform in the legal area. That has occurred under the states, which have established a number of tribunals that operate quite successfully, without the intervention of the legal profession, to provide rough justice for ordinary people. My proposition is that we 
 ought to look at setting up state family law tribunals under state constitutions. We can do that as a pilot, again in Western Australia because the Family Court there already operates under the state constitution, if we do not want to go the whole way and introduce it in one fell swoop right across the country. The recent High Court decision in re Wakim: ex parte McNally may add a further spur to such thinking.
The challenge for the Labor Party is that if we are desirous of really moving back to what was originally considered in family law under Lionel Murphy—that is, a less formal, less adversarial system—we have to come to grips with whether or not there is a place for cooperative federalism, even though that has been normally a term used by the coalition. It may not always be the case that to deliver the best service it must be done under the Commonwealth umbrella with Commonwealth money. Perhaps we ought to utilise the states and their constitutions to look at state family tribunals. There would be, of course, a right of appeal from a tribunal to a District Court, and you could have some of the judges in the District Court given a family law warrant. Then again, maybe you would wish to keep the appellate structure of the federal Family Court for appeals.
One of the great advantages in this era of arguing about whether there is sufficient legal aid money or sufficient money in the system is that we could actually redirect some of that legal aid money. If you had a tribunal that operated on a process of conciliation first, then arbitration, so that you are arbitrating only those things that you cannot conciliate the parties to, under the state jurisdiction you would not have to have a de novo hearing at the District Court, should there be an appeal. The appeal would be on some point of law. Of course, the tribunals at the state level have demonstrated that they have processes that the parties accept as being fair and reasonable. They deliver outcomes that, by and large, are not challenged, but they operate on a shoestring.
There are some cases that you are always going to need to fast-track into the court, and you can do that in the District Court. This could be for anything of a criminal nature in my view. I might say, though, that Sara Blazey made the argument that, where criminal matters such as assault and battery and sexual assault are involved, court proceedings actually exacerbate the problems of the woman involved. That really came as a bit of a shock but, by and large, there is a principle that you should fast-track such matters into courts and allow the tribunal to deal with the vast bulk of the issues. The other point is that you are actually giving people a choice. If someone wants to argue a case in the District Court, as I propose, let them, but give people a choice. Overwhelmingly, constituents in my electorate would opt to take the choice.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I suppose I could go on and on. I do not want to earn your wrath but I just want to say in conclusion that this latest decision of the High Court—which, like the Brandy case, I find desperately disappointing because of the way it constricts the Attorney-General and the government in terms of establishing tribunals—we may very well be able to work our way through. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, I have to say that I do not think it is appropriate, when a government introduces changes, for an opposition to always give a reactive commentary about whether they go far enough or not far enough. That seems to have been the process in the last parliament. I think the opposition does have to grasp the nettle and develop approaches to family law reform.
It is disappointing to me that there are not processes in the parliament that draw on the bulk of members of parliament that do want to see major changes here but not necessarily in a 
 partisan way. We are interested in getting the changes and reforms in and giving support and comfort for those that do, but it is very difficult while we face this with an adversarial approach. Perhaps it is an opportunity to develop a cross-party group in the parliament that may be interested in acquainting itself with opportunities for further reform and, indeed, advocating it then within their respective parties. I am pleased to say that, like other speakers, I do support the bills. I apologise to the Attorney-General that I did not go into much detail on every item. I hope this has not soured our relationship. I will conclude my remarks on that note.",REPS,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,1999-06-24,"—I commence by thanking the members for Barton, Hume and Chifley for their interest in the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  and for their contributions. In respect of the member for Chifley, who is still here, I recall him being the Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues in the 1993 to 1996 parliament. Some of what he had to say, while having something of a remoteness from the subject matter of the bill, I have heard before and I respect his views and congratulate him on his interest. I think the member for Chifley would see something of what he desires in respect of the resolution of family law disputes in the Federal Magistrates Bill 1999  and the Federal Magistrates (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999 , which I introduced in the House this morning. Elements of what he proposes in respect of tribunals are proposed in respect of a federal magistrates service. I will resist the invitation he offers to comment on the High Court's decision in re Wakim: ex parte McNally, which struck down part of the cross-vesting scheme, and leave that for another occasion.
The bill amends the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 to strengthen the role and functions of the Administrative Review Council. As previous speakers have noted, it implements 10 of the 11 recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee 1997 report. That report was on a reference which I gave to the committee in the light of the celebration of the 20 years work of the Administrative Review Council.
The one recommendation that was not accepted I think has been dealt with by the member for Hume. The member for Barton seemed to suggest reconsideration of it. While the government recognises the desirability of responding to ARC reports in a timely manner, it would not be appropriate, we believe, for the government to give an undertaking to respond to all ARC reports within a specified time frame. We do not give such an undertaking in respect of other bodies, including parliamentary committees and the Australian Law Reform Commission, although we do endeavour to respond promptly. Any limit like that could impose unnecessary fetters on the implementation of the government's legal policy and legislative priorities.
The member for Barton referred in the context of the proposed amendment to the Judiciary Act to section 32 of the Federal Court of Australia Act. I have to say, with respect, that I have difficulty in understanding what his problem with section 32 is. Section 32 is a provision which in its first subsection provides that, to the extent that the Constitution permits, jurisdiction is conferred on the court—that is the Federal Court—in respect of matters not otherwise within its jurisdiction that are associated with matters in which the jurisdiction of the court is invoked. What that means, in the words of Justice Mason, as Sir Anthony Mason then was in 1983, in Stack v. Coast Securities (No. 9) Pty Ltd, is as follows:
A matter was an `associated matter' under section 32(1) where `the attached . . . claim and the federal claim so depend on common transactions and facts that they arise out of a common substratum of facts. 

The point I failed to understand in the member for Barton's commentary was how anybody could contemplate that criminal proceedings would be joined with civil proceedings under that provision. I may have misunderstood his remarks. If that is what he said, I respectfully disagree with him.
The member for Barton also mentioned a slight inconsistency between the provisions of the bill and the explanatory memorandum. That will be fixed up for the purposes of the Senate debate. The member for Barton also referred to the government proposals to implement the ARC's report Better decisions—that is, to combine the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal into one body to be called the Administrative Review Tribunal. I fail to see what there is for the Labor Party to be concerned about in the government proposals. There has been some media suggestion that the government is intending to limit the independence of the tribunal. That is not the case at all.
The principal purpose of the combining of the tribunals is to introduce efficiencies and cost saving. The proposed amendments in relation to procedures are designed to make it a less formal and expensive body. There is no intention in any way to impinge on the independence of the decision making that the new body would undertake. It would be done basically in exactly the same way as for the existing tribunals, and nobody seems to have any criticism as to their independence.
The government will, at the appropriate time, move some amendments. Subject to that, I thank the members for their support of the bill.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",REPS,<title>LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,1999-06-24,"—I rise in the Main Committee today to discuss an issue which has been raised with me by many of my constituents in recent months. It may seem to some a minor matter, but in the area of practical convenience for many it is a major matter. I am talking about Telstra's 013 service. The level of frustration which the decline in Telstra's 013 service—its directory assistance service—is generating in my part of Queensland is simply on the rise. People are becoming frustrated to their boots. It is not so much just the delay that you encounter when you dial 013. In fact, a survey done at the end of last year by the Sun-Herald  says that the average time for an 013 call to be answered is something like 19 seconds. All I can say is that things are much better in Sydney than they are in Brisbane, because in my experience it is considerably longer than that.
Of course, that assumes that you get an answer. On a number of occasions in recent months I personally had the experience of having had an 013 number simply ring out before the call was answered. Then we have this new ruse by Telstra, the 12456 service. When you dial 013 they remind you with an irritating and lengthy prerecorded message, `Hang on, you can use 12456 for 75c plus call charges. You can be put through in a flash.' Well, that is not the reason why I rang 013 in the first place; I rang simply to get a piece of free information about the person whom I wished to call and their telephone number.
We have now a range of additional prerecorded messages through the Telstra 013 service, one of which helpfully informs me that rather than sit on a telephone I can jump on to the Internet and access the telephone number by that means. That is a problem, I think most of us would concede, when you are driving along in your government owned car. The thought of actually having access to some sort of digitally connected Internet service in the back seat of the car which you could flick on and find the telephone number without violating the traffic rules of the state defies imagination. That leaves to one side the services which 013 have traditionally delivered to older citizens whose access to and familiarity with a range of computer technologies is highly limited. But the one that takes the cake is the new one that I heard most recently when I dialled 013. Rather than get the prerecorded message urging me to dial 12456, or the message which says to go and flick on to the Internet, it now says that if I use a particular new service, `Hold the phone, you could win yourself a new car.'
All these are appropriate Pavlovian initiatives designed to induce a Pavlovian response on the part of the poor consumer with a single objective in mind, to stop people using 013 because Telstra think it is so fundamentally unprofitable that we, the users out there in the community of Australia, should not be using it at all. That, I fear, is what their first objective is. If they have a second objective it is that if this 013 service is to be retained then they would like to charge for it as soon as possible.
In flicking through some of the findings of the inquiry into Telstra and its full privatisation conducted by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts 
 Legislation Committee, I saw testimony from a Mr Ward of Telstra. When asked by Senator Allison of the Democrats whether Telstra was considering charging for its 013 services he helpfully and encouragingly replied, `We have no immediate plans in terms of charging but, obviously, it continues to be under review.' Sir Humphrey could well have crafted that one. We know the direction in which that is likely to go. I have a very simple ask as a very simple and humble consumer of Telstra's services and its 013 services. I ask that when you dial 013 that someone actually picks up the telephone and gives you the answer that you would like.
There is even a newer twist on all this. Recently, in fact last week when I rang, I discovered that the new procedure adopted by Telstra operators is that once you have placed your request and they cannot immediately find it on the basis of the information that you have given them, you are then cut off. The opportunity now to have any dialogue with a Telstra operator beyond the first foray is now eliminated. All this has occurred at a time when Telstra generates record profits and when Telstra is downsizing its staff levels at its call centres across the country.
That is not simply my request as a somewhat irritated member of the public. I have received in my electorate office a mounting bank of complaints from citizens right across the city of Brisbane about this decline in service. My criticism is not of Telstra's staff—they handle it well under the circumstances—it is of the policy constraints under which they have been placed by Telstra management.
