"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-03-12,"—My question is directed to Senator Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing. Can the minister confirm when she first became aware of the deal done by former Minister Michael Wooldridge to pull money out of health programs to fund GP House? Was it not until the Senate estimates hearing on 20 February this year when her department outlined the deal in detail? What action did she take when she first became aware of this misuse of health funds? Did she request a brief from the department? Did she try to reverse the grant? What action did she take to inform the Prime Minister? Why did she sit on her hands until the Prime Minister, under pressure yesterday, was forced to announce an inquiry?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2002-03-12,"—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer. It occurs to me to ask why the minister was quoted in the press as saying on the weekend that she waited until Sunday to get advice on this matter when she admits that she had known for at least three or four weeks. Why didn't the minister seek advice from her department earlier? As she was well aware of the concern about this issue and the debate at estimates, what has the minister been doing for the last three weeks, given that those matters have been before her for that period? Why did she claim on the weekend that she did not get any advice all weekend?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,question
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-03-12,"—Despite the fact that I have a reasonable memory, I do not remember the exact date. I have been briefed on a lot of issues since I became health minister. I was aware of the long discussion that took place in estimates and I believed, from the answers in estimates, that that procedure had been undertaken in a way that was on the public record. It had been in the Charter of Budget Honesty that appeared in the papers before the election, despite some of the claims by the Labor Party. The Prime Minister has responded, asking for details, because some of the scurrilous information that was perpetrated by the Labor Party about this was less than helpful, less than useful and less than truthful. Given the information that he has, the Prime Minister has asked for further information and has made a commitment that not one single cent will be redirected away from the programs to which they were first allocated.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,answer
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-03-12,"—Unlike people on the other side, I have been working very hard and constructively, not destructively like many on the other side. I thought the answers at the time explained the arrangements which were done in full consultation with the Minister for Finance and Administration. The information that was given during estimates was available and open. It was when the issue was raised—I thought it was breathtakingly wrong in the particular paper on Sunday—that I believed I needed more information and I sought that information.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health: Program Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,1,1,answer
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2002-03-12,"—I have some more information for Senator Mackay. I am advised by the department that no money has been diverted away from New South Wales, or any other state, with regard to the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program. There has been no deliberate slowing down of action under the program by the department or by the organisations developing the proposals. In New South Wales, progress has been steady. The New South Wales Rural Doctors Network is responsible for arranging private specialist outreach services. They are working to an agreed timetable and are well on track. Specialist services in public hospitals are being funded via the state health departments. We have a consultative process to work out where the gaps are and how best to fill them. 
Following community consultation, the New South Wales Rural Doctors Network or the state government department submits proposals to the Commonwealth. These are then considered by the state based advisory committee, which advises on the appropriateness of the submission and the extent to which it meets the needs. This is an important process but, as you can well understand, it takes time. At times the proposals fall short of fitting the program guidelines, and these have been returned to the responsible body for further development. The goal is to support a series of services that benefit the community.
I remind honourable senators that a specialist outreach assistance program did not exist under the former government. I am aware of the reported statements by Minister Craig Knowles regarding deliberate Commonwealth delays, and I refute these completely. This program aims to achieve the best outcomes for rural communities. It is my view that this activity should respond to community priorities, which may not necessarily be those of the state government. New South Wales have sought to use the recent and generous injections of Commonwealth funding for rural services to allow them to take money out of rural areas. Indeed, we are having a protracted battle with them to accept that new Commonwealth funds must result in new services. We cannot have a situation where Commonwealth funds come in the front door only to have state funds disappear out the back door. 
Some project proposals, including those from New South Wales Health, require clarification and amendment to make sure there is no duplication or overlap of existing services. We cannot fund project plans that are unfinished or underdeveloped. The groundwork has now been set for continued expansion of the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program across Australia. At this point, new services are operating in South Australia, Tasmania, New South Wales and the Northern Territory, with service plans in other states approved or in the final stages of development. This means that rural Australians are now receiving a specialist medical service that they were not receiving previously and were not receiving under the Labor government.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2002-03-12,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to a question without notice asked by Senator Conroy today relating to debt management and currency swaps.
Over the last five years, it has come out that the government has lost almost $5 billion through speculating on US dollars versus Australian dollars. The original rationale for this strategy that was introduced by Treasury and the Labor government in 1987 was that there was a favourable interest rate differential between Australia and the US, which meant cost savings could be achieved. If you look at the chart released by Senator Coonan, it shows that in the years 1987 to 1996 the Labor government presided over $2½ billion in profit in this scheme. Then, when you look at what happened to interest rates on the international markets, you see that by 1997 the interest differential between Australia and the United States had fallen to virtually zero. In other words, the entire rationale for borrowing in US dollars was gone.
What did the Treasurer do? Nothing. What are the consequences of the Treasurer's inaction? Five billion dollars' worth of losses. That is what we have seen. When Labor managed the policy, there was $2.5 billion of profit; when Peter Costello managed the policy, there was $5 billion worth of losses. How does the Treasurer try to weasel out of it today? He keeps trying to say, `I knew nothing about it.' He did nothing in 1997-98 when Treasury lost $2.1 billion. He did nothing in 1999-2000 when they lost another $1.1 billion. He did nothing in 2000-01 when they lost another couple of billion dollars. That is what has been happening.
—Did you say it was a dud policy? You introduced it.
—It is a dud policy if you ignore what has happened. It is a dud policy if you ignore the change in economic circumstances.
 (Senator Knowles)—Senator Conroy, please address your comments to the chair.
—If Senator Hill knew anything about this area, he would understand that what has happened is that, as Simon Crean has said, Peter Costello fell asleep at the roulette wheel. Interest rates closed down six or seven points Australia-US. What does the government do? What does Peter Costello do? He endorses the policy in 1997, he endorses the policy in 1998 and he endorses the policy in 1999. How did he endorse the policy without anyone mentioning they had lost $2 billion in 1997 and $1 billion in 1999? Yet he still kept giving it the big tick. This is a bloke who was not just asleep at the wheel, he was asleep at the roulette wheel. What he is trying to say is that during all of this, despite providing ministerial endorsements of the annual strategy, despite the disappearance of the interest rate differential, despite the collapse in the currency in 1997 and despite the fact that there had been eight policy reviews between 1996 and 1999—that is two reviews a year—he did nothing.
By mid-2000 even the Reserve Bank had noticed that the Treasury and the Treasurer's policy were causing a problem. The Reserve Bank governor was so aghast at what the Treasury was up to that he was compelled to intervene in the management of government debt. As Terry McCrann said this morning, this is quite extraordinary. The Treasurer's defence is that he relied on the Treasury who gave him advice from external advisers. But did he follow the advice? In 1998, UBS recommended a fundamental change to the strategy for managing the government debt and, if followed, it would have cut the exposure to foreign currencies and substantially reduced the losses. Treasurer, if you were aware of the mounting cost of this policy, why didn't you act? Treasurer, if you were not aware, why weren't you? As the supposed guardian of taxpayers' money, what else were—and are—you not aware of?

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2002-03-12,"—This is an issue about debt management. 
—There are two approaches to debt management in this country: one of them is the Labor Party's approach to debt management, Senator Sherry; and the other one is the Liberal Party's approach to debt management. Senator Conroy is quite right that the Labor Party instigated the notion of currency buybacks. It is true that the Treasurer adopted that approach for quite some time. He has now rejected that approach and the policy has been changed. There was foreign currency exposure in this nation, and other Western nations adopted a similar approach—Canada did, I think the Italians did and the Danish did. The issue today in this country—
—Is the four years it took him!
—Senator Ludwig, the issue today is the capacity of this government, as compared to the former government, to control debt. On that issue, you do not have any credibility at all. The $80 billion debt that you rolled up over the last five years that you were in government was some of the most pathetic economic management that this country has ever seen. Do you know how much it cost? Just the interest on the money the Labor government borrowed to pay back their debt was about $8 billion a year. That is right: the interest it cost was about $8 billion a year. Because the Howard government has paid back so much debt, we now save $4 billion a year on that alone.
—And you have lost five.
—Senator Sherry, you may want to compare the Labor government's approach with this government's approach to debt management, but there is no comparison. More generally, let me put it this way: the economic news in this country today in 2002 is that our economy is growing at about 4.1 per cent per annum. That is 10 times the average growth of other developed countries throughout the world.
—Thanks to the Labor Party's reform. You are living off the back of what we did.
—Senator Cook interrupts. This is the best economic news that this nation has ever had. We had to survive, for the first time ever, a recession in the United States of America, and we have prospered. Let me say that again: the United States went into recession, Japan went into recession, East Asia went into recession— and this country recorded the highest growth rates in the Western world.
Those opposite cannot compare their appalling economic management in the last five or six years of the Keating and the Hawke governments with the performance of this government. And that is the problem. There is silence all of a sudden over the other side because, in any objective comparison between the Howard government and the governments of Hawke and Keating, there is no comparison. This government has produced an economy that has effectively fireproofed it from the rest of the world, irrespective of economic downturns in Asia, the United States and Western Europe, making these the most fantastic economic figures in a generation. That is what the Labor Party hates: 4.1 per cent growth; 10 times the growth of all the other countries in the developed world. That lot opposite cannot compete with that.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2002-03-12,"—Senator Mason was right in his central contention when he said that the issue is the Labor Party's management of debt versus the Liberal Party's management of debt. He was right when he said that there was no comparison. From the time this policy began in 1987 under a Labor government until the Labor government was defeated in 1996, the Labor Party and the treasurers during that period of time presided over a profit of just over $2 billion. Since 1997, under the current Treasurer—and there has been only one: Mr Costello—there has been a loss of almost $5 billion. So under Labor there was a profit of just over $2 billion in 10 years and under the current Treasurer, Mr Costello—and no-one would doubt that the Treasurer of this country has been anyone but Mr Costello since March 1996—there has been a loss of almost $5 billion. 
What is Mr Costello's excuse for this appalling management of Australia's currency and debt? He basically has two excuses. The first is that he did not know. That has been a very common defence from this government in recent times—that it does not know anything that has been going on in terms of the public sector. Mr Costello says that he did not know, that he was first advised of these losses on 9 November 2000. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, claims that he first came to know about these huge losses of billions of dollars on 9 November 2000. I do not know whether the Treasurer bothers to read the reports from his own department, but the Treasury department started to refer to losses in its various reports back in 1997-98. That is when Treasury first started reporting the losses. Yet the Treasurer claims that he did not know about it until 9 November 2000— over two years later. It defies belief that the current Treasurer does not read the reports from his own department. He must have known as far back as 1997-98 that these losses were occurring. 
The second excuse that is advanced by the current Treasurer is that it is all the Labor Party's fault. He says that it began the policy, therefore the losses he has presided over as Treasurer since 1996 have to be the Labor Party's fault. This is an interesting argument. Let us assume that, under the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, a profit—a profit, not a loss—of $5 billion had been made on this debt management. Does anyone seriously believe that the current Treasurer, Mr Costello, would dash out a press release and say, `I'd like to acknowledge and pay tribute to the Labor Party policy which it commenced back in 1987'? Of course not! The current Treasurer is not noted for his modesty, and he is certainly not noted for acknowledging any credit whatsoever to the Labor Party when it was in government until 1996. 
The Treasurer will not accept that he has been the Treasurer since 1996 and that he is the one who has presided over this mess, this loss of $5 billion—he and his department, but he is the political head. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, is the one who is accountable. He has presided over the transactions that occurred in respect of these losses of $5 billion. He cannot have it both ways. He cannot take all the credit for everything that has happened since 1996 and then when it is convenient—when something goes wrong on his watch, when he has been Treasurer—say, `It was all the Labor Party's fault prior to 1996.' He cannot have it both ways. He has fundamentally been asleep at the wheel. I do not believe anyone seriously believes that he did not read his own department's reports, commencing in 1997-98, which reported that these losses were occurring. He has been at fault. He has adopted the wrong policy. And unfortunately the taxpayers will suffer to the tune of $5 billion over the next eight years. We will be paying for this massive mismanagement of $5 billion for the next eight years.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2002-03-12,"—For those listening to the debate, I think it might be useful to explain what we are talking about. We are talking about what is known as a `swaps program' which is undertaken by Treasury. That program involves the swapping of one set of liabilities for another. Unfortunately, in this debate this afternoon, there have been a number of errors perpetuated by speakers from the Australian Labor Party. During questioning at estimates, this system of adding losses year by year was refuted by representatives from the Australian Treasury. Despite that tap on the knuckles, the speakers this afternoon have continued to perpetuate that error. The losses from year to year are unrealised losses reported. We do not add those losses because they recognise the value of the exchange rate and interest rates prevailing at a point in time.  
Back in 1992 I queried this program at the estimates and raised this issue with none other than Senator McMullan. Unfortunately, Senator McMullan was unable to answer my question and he flicked it off to a Treasury representative. I was concerned about a government entering into a swaps type program which was really not the province of government at the time. As other commentators are now saying, it is best left to the private sector. What was done in 1992 was not the sort of swaps or derivative type programs that we see operating nowadays.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Unfortunately Senator Watson has misled the chamber and I ask him to withdraw. The Senate estimates record was corrected by Dr Parkinson, who admits that the figures are not cumulative and are in fact able to be added. That is a very serious misleading of the Senate.
 (Senator Knowles)—That is a debating point, not an issue of a point of order.
—I refuse to withdraw, because the losses in relation to a swaps program are in a sense not losses until they are realised in a budgetary sense. You cannot go from year to year and say that the losses in years 1, 2 and 3 are essentially, say, $1 billion plus $2.5 billion plus $3 billion. They might be $4 billion compared with year 1 when it commenced to year 2 when it is going to be realised. What we also have to realise is that when these swaps programs are finally discharged that will be the time to look at the losses.
The point I was making was about the inappropriateness of the Labor Party entering into these particular programs at that time. The Labor Party set the seal, because during that time they swapped from the European and Japanese type currencies into the hard American currency. There was a gyration in the value of our dollar under Labor's administration and at the same time we had a great build-up in the amount of debt. For example, at the time of the Labor Party's taking government the debt was something like $16 billion since Federation, but it increased by something like $80 billion to $96 billion by the time Labor left government. So there is nothing for the Labor Party to be proud of. It locked us into a high, hard currency, the US currency, from which there was no retreat because the dollar had already, under its mismanagement, deteriorated to something of the order of 50c in the dollar. So what we are looking at now is that under our better management there is likely to be an improvement in the exchange rate between the Australian dollar and the American dollar. The final outcome, if this hardening of the Australian dollar continues, is that we are likely to get a better result than has been forecast by the doomsayers on the other side.
—Are you saying that the Australian dollar will appreciate against the US dollar?
—Everybody knows that at the present time the Australian dollar is undervalued relative to most other currencies in the world, and even you are nodding to that, Senator Cook. So, other things being equal, with the continuation of the strong economic management of Peter Costello and the Howard government, if you ask anybody interested in exchange rate movements they will say that the Australian dollar is undervalued— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy: Debt Management</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,speech
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-03-12,"—Before I start on the body of my remarks, I need to refute two things that have been said by the previous speaker. The first relates to the $5 billion worth of unrealised losses that are being quoted here. What needs to be said about this is that the accounting system under which the Commonwealth now operates is the accrual accounting method. It was touted as a major reform by this government when we moved to accrual accounting. Under accrual accounting there is no such thing as unrealised losses. So to hear from the government that these are not real losses but are unrealised losses, when it has changed the accounting system which defines that out of existence, is a total red herring, if not a mislead.
Secondly, the previous speaker talked about the inappropriateness of entering into currency swaps. There was nothing inappropriate about this policy when it was introduced. The problem was that the circumstances changed later. What is inappropriate is to maintain a policy that was appropriate to the circumstances at the time and not change it when those circumstances alter. The circumstances that altered here were on the watch of Mr Costello. The circumstances altered when interest rates, which classically between Australia and the US always were higher in Australia because we are a net borrower on the international market, reversed and US interest rates went above Australian interest rates. That is when the warning signals should have gone off and that is when the practice should have altered. That was a significant, fundamental change to the whole financial structure which this policy was built on. To pretend that this is a Labor policy—4½ years after this government took office and it was still administering a Labor policy—and therefore it is a responsibility of the former Labor government is gross dishonesty in these circumstances. It is just laughed out of court by anyone who knows anything at all about this issue. 
The word `cover-up' occurs here. Let me offer a bit of advice. Governments should remember that there is a law of politics which says that, whatever the problems with the original sin, it is better to admit that sin up-front and promptly because the damage done by covering up is always worse. Did the government come forward and reveal that it lost $5 billion? No, of course it did not. It hid it on page 80 of this document, which was only found by forensic work by Senator Conroy's office and then dealt with in estimates. It hid it here. It is a criticism of the Australian Office of Financial Management that I now make, that nowhere in this report by this office is it said up-front and honestly that this has occurred.
—Which page? Where do they tell you?
—On pages 80 and 81 of the reference pages that should be gone to. The Treasurer knew. Senator Sherry is right: if the Treasurer had made $5 billion profit, would he have hid that from the Australian people? When he made a $5 billion loss, he did. The cover-up which now goes on will bring this government down eventually. Certainly, it has ruined its reputation for financial management in the eyes of the market because the practice that this government has entered into would not be accepted if this government were a listed company on the stock exchange reporting to its shareholders. At a shareholders' meeting, if the Treasurer is regarded as the director and did not report to shareholders a $5 billion trading loss, shareholders would want to know why and would dismiss him. If it were a statutory corporation and did report up-front and honestly a $5 billion trading loss, the directors of that statutory corporation would rightfully be dismissed, but the Treasurer does not report it. 
This is taxpayers' money. This is $5 billion worth of health and education expenditure that we do not have that could have made life better for millions of Australians, which now will not. This is taxpayers' money he has speculated on. To not reveal the advice he got from Treasury condemns him because Treasury provided him with advice at critical junctures when he could have reviewed this policy. We have asked for that advice to be tabled so that it is open and transparent, but the cover-up continues. That advice will not be tabled; the Treasurer has made that clear. Do not cover up, is my advice to the government, because you get caught every time. (Time expired)

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-03-12,"—by leave—I wish to make a number of comments in relation to the hours of business. I thank Senator Campbell for allowing me to make some statements in relation to this point. The intention of the opposition is to cooperate with the government's legislative program so far as is possible and practical. However, it needs to be highlighted that the Prime Minister is responsible for the sitting pattern and the sitting pattern is, as far as we can ascertain, quite short for the first half—both the autumn and winter sittings— of this year, which leaves very little time to consult and to deal with the legislative program in a practical way.  
We have agreed to the sitting pattern being altered to allow the address-in-reply to continue this evening. We have done that on the basis that it is a worthwhile process. However, we do wish to at least highlight the practical difficulties that confront us in dealing with the legislation over both the autumn and winter sittings given the short legislative program that is currently before us. We are also concerned that further additional time may be sought where our corporation may not be so readily given because of the lack of sitting days that are available between now and both the autumn and winter sittings. The legislative program is tight, as I have highlighted, and the shortage of days will create some difficulties for everyone in dealing with the legislation in a practical and cooperative manner. I hope that the seeking of additional days and hours of business to deal with such things as address-in-reply are not as readily formulated on the government's side, with the assumption that we will cooperate at all times. That is all I really want to say at this point in time. ",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,7,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-12,"—Firstly, I think the Manager of Opposition Business has hit the nail on the head. It is a restricted time. Yes, the government does have to set the schedule and there are some unusual issues and some that recur whenever you have the establishment of a new parliament. We have got a relatively early Easter this year— which I think is a good thing, particularly if you live in Perth, because the weather will be nice when you have your Easter holiday. The meeting of CHOGM was delayed after the events of 11 September and was shifted into this period, and then we had the commencement of a new parliament. There was a bit of scuttlebutt around in the media when we set the starting date for this year, which I think was the week beginning 11 February—I do not have the date in front of me. Some people said that that was a late start. 
I asked Scott Faragher, who is my assistant in this position, to do some research on the starting dates going back some years. The date of 11 February is quite an average sort of a date. You will know if you look back through history that starting dates are often much later than 11 February. Give or take a week, that is a pretty normal starting time. People can argue that we could have come back a week earlier, but I did not see any enthusiasm for that from any side of the chamber, from talking to people. We do have stress on the program as normal. The sittings for the rest of the year form into an almost symmetrical, normal pattern of two weeks on, two weeks off. The sitting schedules are heavily weighted towards the end of the year, but that does not, unfortunately, eliminate the need for the government to get some essential legislation through prior to Easter.
The stress on the program to date has been caused by what I would regard as an unusually long debate, already, in relation to the regional forest agreements legislation. I have noticed that the legislation has been debated a couple of times here before, but I note that the committee stage has already become quite elongated and that the regular calling of quorums has become a feature of the debate. I implore all senators to have a look at the time that is available, have a look at the program and try to evaluate the priorities for the Senate. It would be very undesirable, for example, to spend a couple of weeks discussing one bill and then to have to concertina, potentially, another dozen bills into a day, which has quite often been the case for the Senate in the time that I have been here. You can see one bill take an extraordinary length of time where we have repetitive debate, undoubtedly on important issues, and then on the last day we come in here and say, `We have to get these bills passed' and an enormous amount of important legislation gets put through in a short time. It is not a particularly good way to manage a legislative agenda.
The government tries very hard—we often fail, but we try very hard—to get the legislation in and I think that is another issue that the manager on the other side would also recognise and one that people who have been here for a while would recognise. I think it is good for the public to recognise that, when we have a new parliament, we have to reintroduce a lot of bills that might have been on the Notice Paper from the previous parliament. We cannot just pick up a piece of legislation and start it off from where it was prior to the the ending of the previous parliament, we have to reintroduce it. I think in the case of this government we have had to reintroduce dozens of pieces of legislation that were left over from the previous parliament. 
There are some special problems that occur here in the Senate. Apart from bills that we can introduce here, such as the Regional Forest Agreements Bill, there is a raft of bills that have to work their way through the processes in the other place and wander their way across the hall and get into this place before we can deal with them. So the start of the legislative workload for the Senate is quite often delayed a bit because of the House of Representatives having to deal with those bills. The government have a list of bills that we are working on that we regard as essential to get passed before Easter, and I had hoped to distribute that to leaders, whips and the Manager of Opposition Business in the next few hours.
I take this opportunity to say I appreciate the agreement of all senators to sit tonight to handle the address-in-reply, which will take some pressure off time otherwise available for government business. I implore all senators who are involved in the regional forest agreements debate to—certainly give it consideration, give it the sort of review that it needs; it is an important issue—try to balance the need for the Senate to handle a whole range of legislation. I do not think it is good management to spend an enormous amount of time on one bill and then truncate the time on all the other bills.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-03-12,"—by leave—I would like to put some statistics on the record. As the Manager of Opposition Business has indicated, we somewhat reluctantly come to the table in relation to this matter. I also indicate that here we are now on the fourth Senate sitting day and the government has already asked for additional time. The reason for this is fairly obvious—and I appreciate this is probably not the fault of the Manager of Government Business—in that the program is extraordinarily light on for the first half of the year. Every one of us who saw that was immediately struck by the fact that, with the large amount of legislation that has inevitably come through, as Senator Campbell has indicated, there are clearly insufficient sitting days. If you look at the calendar, there are only another five days of sitting this fortnight and there is then a seven-week break until the Senate resumes in budget week. The government has allocated just 10 days in the autumn sittings to deal with 37 bills. Obviously, this is not going to work, and I suspect we will be back for an extra week, at least.
This is obviously a totally unrealistic time in relation to legislation. There is a total of 21 Senate sitting days in both the autumn and winter sittings before parliament resumes in late August for the spring sittings, which we as an opposition regard as inadequate. Just briefly—and I thank the chamber for its indulgence—if you look at previous years, post-election, there are some fairly unfavourable contrasts. For example, in 1997 the Senate sat for 82 days, and in 1999 the Senate sat for 79 days. We, by contrast, have only allocated 61 days for 2002. So I would like to put on record that a bit more forward planning would have been appreciated in relation to it, and indicate again that we are on the fourth day of sitting and we are being asked for additional hours.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-12,"—by leave—I am very happy to give support to the extra sitting hours tonight for the address-in-reply, to help the government out, and indeed the Senate. But I want to respond to the government's call for the expedition of the regional forest agreements legislation. I can help the government out there. If the government cares to answer the questions that are being brought forward in the committee on such matters as why 500 jobs have been shed out of the industry after $80 million of taxpayers' money has been put into the woodchip industry in Tasmania since Prime Minister Howard signed the regional forest agreement—and it repeatedly refuses to do so—we could move on. If the government were able to say why it has failed to make environmental protection a matter for Commonwealth overview, and why it refuses to agree to keep the legislative powers in the federal minister's hands to protect Australia's wild forests and their wildlife, when that is a national responsibility, we would be able to move on. These are important questions. 
These are important questions. I do not agree with the government about the priority of this matter. I wanted it through in an hour and a half. I have an enormous constituency in Tasmania and I also represent constituencies in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales which think very differently. But if the minister, who is now giggling opposite, could answer questions instead of acting like that, we could move on with that legislation. So there is the challenge: answer the questions, come forward with the factual information that is required and engage in a constructive debate. I might also say to the government: if you do not want to see quorums called, have enough people in here to maintain a quorum on an important issue like this, because it is your responsibility, and the debate will move on very swiftly indeed.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,7,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-03-12,"—by leave—I simply wish to state on behalf of the Democrats that we share some of the concerns that have been raised in this debate in relation to the Senate schedule—as, indeed, our whip and others put on record at the time of the distribution of this year's sitting schedule. We did find it extraordinary to think that this was one of the lightest sitting schedules—if not the lightest—in a non-election period. I suggest to Senator Ian Campbell that, if the government wants to avoid that kind of concertina effect to which he referred in relation to legislation and bills building up, maybe there should be a more judicious assessment of the time required—
—You will help us through with the RFA Bill, will you?
—I take Senator Ian Macdonald's point in relation to recent legislation, and I would like to put on record that my party has viewed that legislation in a very constructive way. I do not believe that you can argue we have done anything but debate that with a judicious use of time. I also acknowledge the Democrats have supported the government with the additional sitting hours tonight. If there are such plans in the near future, we would like to be consulted. I am sure the residents of Canberra will have a tough choice tonight as to whether to go to the Nick Cave concert or stay home and listen to the address-in-reply. Certainly on this occasion we are happy to support the government, but we think there are some issues in relation to the light schedule that is before us for the rest of this year.

"McKiernan, Sen Jim",ALP,2002-03-12,"—I present the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing for Property Offences) Bill 2000, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted. 
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
In presenting this report I make note of the fact that it follows an earlier report tabled by the Legal and Constitutional References Committee in March 2000 on matters arising from the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999. Both of these bills—that is, the bill the subject of the previous inquiry and the one from this inquiry—were directed at overriding state and territory laws which required courts to sentence persons who were convicted of committing property offences to particular terms of incarceration. Both bills were essentially directed at legislation in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. 
Following the tabling of the committee's report on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing of Juvenile Offenders) Bill 1999, the bill was debated and passed by the Senate. It was then introduced into the House of Representatives. However, it was not debated in that chamber and the bill lapsed with the dissolution of the last parliament. That is not, however, the end of the story regarding the bill or, indeed, the report. The Commonwealth government and the Northern Territory government agreed in July 2000 on the introduction of, and funding for, a pre-court juvenile diversionary program and an improved interpreter service for the Northern Territory. It was suggested in one submission to the second inquiry: 
Following the implementation of the changes announced in July 2000, there are now few cases of young offenders in the Northern Territory being sentenced to periods of detention, who would not have been so sentenced were the mandatory sentencing provisions not in existence.
The Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing for Property Offences) Bill 2000 was introduced into the Senate on 6 September 2000 and was referred to the committee on 24 May 2001. The public inquiry process was delayed by circumstances beyond the committee's control. Two general elections— firstly, for the Northern Territory and, then, for the Commonwealth—intervened. However, that delay was fortuitous in that the new government in the Northern Territory repealed the Territory legislation against which the bill was directed and the Western Australian Department of Justice produced a report on the operation of the relevant legislation in that state. 
This report was very important insofar as it gave the committee more detailed and precise information on the people actually affected by mandatory sentencing than was previously available. That information, however, was not complete, but it did enable the committee to judge how the legislation was operating. The inquiry created wide interest. The committee received 107 submissions and recorded 300 pages of evidence over four hearings. Although the public hearings in Canberra and Sydney were conducted before the Northern Territory elections and the publication of the review of the Western Australian legislation, this did not detract from their value.
No witnesses at the Darwin public hearing expressed regret for the repeal of the Territory legislation. There is only one sentencing regime for juveniles, whether they have committed property or other offences. On the other hand, some witnesses were critical of the replacement sentencing regime for adults who have committed property offences in the Territory. The committee regarded consideration of this regime as beyond its terms of reference. The committee considers, and all witnesses agree, that the bill would now have no impact in the Northern Territory due to the present legislative regime in the Territory.
The Western Australian mandatory sentencing legislation applies only to home burglars. The Department of Justice report found that the legislation has had no impact on adults because their sentences, handed down by the courts, are almost always more severe than is required by the legislation. So far as adults are concerned in Western Australia, mandatory sentencing is only an illusion. The most horrifying point about the Western Australian mandatory sentencing legislation is that the people who are most often locked up under it are young Aboriginal boys from the country. Aboriginal children, particularly those in the country, are less likely than others to access diversionary programs. Moreover, the only detention facilities for children in Western Australia are in the Perth metropolitan area. A child will be detained further away from his or her family than will an adult convicted and sentenced for a similar type of offence.
The legislation operates anomalously in that the minimum period of incarceration for third-strike home burglaries is the same for both adults and children. Children serve half their sentence before becoming eligible for parole whereas adults have only to serve one-third of their sentence before becoming eligible. The government's own report said:
While it is likely that for the most part juveniles sentenced to detention under section 401 would have gone into detention anyway, a few would not and for others shorter terms may have been considered more appropriate.
The home burglary rate and the police clean-up rate have not been improved by the legislation. Western Australia has the highest rate of home burglary in the Commonwealth. Clearly, the legislation in that state has not worked and is now not working.
The committee is satisfied that the mandatory sentencing legislation does not achieve its purpose and that it is operating unevenly, effectively catching mostly those who, because of their culture and locality, do not have access to diversionary programs. In all justice, the Western Australian government should not continue with the mandatory sentencing legislation while the diversionary programs available for country Aboriginal children are so inadequate. 
The committee calls on the Western Australian parliament to repeal the requirement that third-strike home burglars be imprisoned or detained for at least 12 months. In the event that the Western Australian parliament does not act, it would be appropriate for members of the legal profession and others with a conscience to take steps to test whether the legislation is constitutional or compatible with Australia's obligations under international human rights instruments. The committee does not recommend that this bill be passed until all other remedies for the situation have been exhausted.
With the assistance and cooperation of all those who lodged submissions or gave evidence to the committee, the committee has produced a concise and very balanced report. I express my gratitude to my committee colleagues: firstly, my deputy, Senator Payne; Senators Cooney, Ludwig and Greig; and Senator Brown, who was a participating member of the committee. I would also like to record the committee's appreciation of the work of the committee secretariat in connection with the inquiry and the report: in particular, Dr Pauline Moore, Mr Noel Gregory, Ms Saxon Patience, Ms Carol Evans and Ms Sonia Hailes. I again thank all of the witnesses who made submissions to the committee and who gave their time to appear before the committee at our public hearings. I commend the report to the Senate and to the citizens and the parliament of Western Australia.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS (MANDATORY SENTENCING FOR PROPERTY OFFENCES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Report of Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-12,"—I am very pleased to see this report on the mandatory sentencing legislation which I brought before the Senate last year. I think the committee has done an excellent job of analysing the situation in both the Northern Territory and Western Australia. In the Northern Territory, with the change to the Labor administration of Chief Minister Martin, there has essentially been an abolition of mandatory sentencing laws, which were capturing young people—particularly young Aboriginal people—at a disproportionate rate and delivering them back into society, not any the better for it but much the worse for it. 
The action taken by the Senate two years ago led to the government giving financial assistance to the then Territory government to increase diversionary options and also to increase the number of interpreters for Aboriginal people whose first language is not English. This enabled them to understand what was going on in the court system, which is a basic tenet of justice. However, the situation has now greatly improved because of the change of administration in the Northern Territory. I congratulate the Martin administration for having moved on to a much more thoughtful and mature way of dealing with an undoubtedly difficult problem of crime, particularly petty theft.
In Western Australia, the blight of mandatory sentencing remains, as we have just heard, and it also applies to home burglaries. The statute is an affront to international law as well as to good domestic law, and it does disproportionately capture, and therefore injure, indigenous people in Western Australia. There are better ways of dealing with it, including, as Senator McKiernan has said, the diversionary programs which are notably lacking, particularly in rural Western Australia. What an affront it is to the sensitivities of good-natured Australians that young Aboriginal people can be arrested in the Kimberley and taken into detention in the south, thousands of miles away from their kin, their cultural milieu and their environment. The punishment is not primarily the detention, it is the separation. It is very difficult for many people to understand what that means, but it does not result in a good outcome either for those young people or for society. As Senator McKiernan has said, the laws have failed to result in either revenge or a better outcome in terms of the crime statistics. It just has not happened.
I disagree with the majority finding of the committee that we should rely on some other agent—the legal profession or somebody else—to rectify the matter. The legislation was brought in by the Australian Greens because we believed that the Commonwealth should overrule the mandatory sentencing laws in those two jurisdictions. It now comes down to Western Australia. I am not one who says, `The Western Australians will take this to the High Court, therefore we should back off.' We have an obligation which is domestic, and we have a power which comes through our external affairs power. As Commonwealth legislators I believe we have not just a right but an impulsion to correct this matter. Just leaving the laws on the statute books and hoping something will turn up is not going to rectify it.  
The Western Australian government could have taken the opportunity to say, `Yes, the laws have failed; they have not done the wider community any good and they have certainly—according to our own statistics— done young indigenous Western Australians a lot of harm, so we will fix them. We will move on to better diversionary programs and make sure those programs are in the homelands of the people most affected.' If the Western Australian government had done that, there would have been a good result. But I disagree with the committee that somebody else had better fix this. The legislation was brought in recognising that the former administration in the Northern Territory could regain office, and the present administration in Western Australia is not of a mind to change the legislation. I believe this parliament should be. However, the report is full of compulsive reading before you get to the conclusions, and I would recommend it to all senators as well as to all citizens.
The matter has not finished here. In my term in this Senate, I will continue to move as best I can to rectify what is a manifest wrong: these mandatory sentencing laws in Western Australia as they now exist. I thank the committee. I am sorry that I was not able to attend some of the hearings, and I am grateful to Ben Oquist from my office for being there and reporting fully to me on those hearings. I thank the committee and I thank the staff of the committee, who provided excellent services. I think this document is very valuable for the Senate. Above all it says, `Don't leave it at this. Getting the information is nothing if we do not act upon it.' I do not believe we should rely on somebody else to take that action.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2002-03-12,"—I would like to note the generous words of Senator Brown; besides being generous, they are very accurate words. This is a good report—the sort of report we have come to expect from the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, with Senator McKiernan as its head. He is, like yourself, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, a Western Australian. I take this opportunity of noting the outstanding work that Senator McKiernan has done in this area, because I am not sure how many more opportunities there will be to note the outstanding work that he has done not only in this area but in parliament generally over the 17 years that he has adorned this place. This is an opportunity for me to acknowledge the contribution he has made to this parliament, to his party, to his state and to the country and, may I say, to the world.
—The world!
—Yes, he has; he is on the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Senator Carr, and he has done very extensive work at an international level. That ought to be acknowledged. Whilst talking about this, I note the way he has worked with his wife, Jackie. They have made a splendid team and have served this country most honourably.
There are problems with mandatory sentencing, and perhaps the major one is that it does not look at what should be looked at when crime is being assessed. There are three questions that should be asked when a crime is before the court. The first is: what has been done? If it is a theft, is it a theft of a used envelope—which is a charge I know was brought against somebody who a particular organisation wanted to embarrass—or is it somebody charged with stealing millions of dollars? Is it somebody who is charged with illegally using a car that belongs to someone who it is not going to affect terribly much or is it somebody who steals from a widow who is left bereft by the deed? 
You should ask about the nature of the crime, and then you should ask who is doing it. Is this someone who has an education, who has the ability to make his or her way in the world and who has had every chance but has, nevertheless, committed a very nasty crime, or is it somebody who has had disadvantages from his or her youth and who is now in a terrible situation because he or she has perhaps been compelled to steal to get food? These are the questions that should be asked. If you have mandatory sentencing, these are questions that you cannot ask.  
The other thing I do not like about mandatory sentencing is that it looks at people as being of the same kind. The distinction that should be made is not made in terms of both the crime and the person committing it. Mandatory sentencing also denies the concept of redemption. I am a person who, rightly or wrongly, believes that there should be a chance for people to recover the ground that they have lost through their own criminal activity. Is it wrong to believe that there is such a thing as redemption and such a thing as a good side to people as well as a bad side? It is these sorts of things that mandatory sentencing does not take into account. This is pointed out by this report which the committee, so ably led by Senator McKiernan, has brought forward.
I cannot sit down without mentioning how this parliament itself, in September of last year, introduced mandatory sentencing for people-smuggling. People-smuggling was defined as bringing to Australia five or six people who did not have permission to come. You did not have to be paid for it, so it covers more people than does the general concept of people-smuggling. We have come to think of people-smuggling as meaning smugglers who bring asylum seekers to Australia for money and leech off the system but, as it is defined in the act, it means anybody who brings people to Australia without authority, whether they are paid or not. 
If you and I happen to be in Bali, meet some people of excellent character from England or America, bring a load of them— six of them—over here, and are caught as they land, we get five years jail with a nonparole period of three years. According to the legislation we passed in September, this is absolutely necessary. In other words, there is mandatory sentencing for people who may, as a lark, bring very decent people, you might otherwise have thought, to Australia across the straits and land them in Australia without permission. Bang! There is no discretion for the judge to look at it and see whether it was a lark, high spirits or a matter of carelessness or not. We have to go off to jail for five years and a minimum of three— just a nonsense. I must confess that we rushed that proposition through in a great hurry last September.
There are some real problems in this whole area, but this is an excellent report. This will lead, I hope, to the rethinking of this demand for grinding everybody down with mandatory sentencing no matter what. I finish as I started, by acknowledging you, Senator McKiernan, and Jackie as well.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS (MANDATORY SENTENCING FOR PROPERTY OFFENCES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Report of Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-03-12,"—I too would like to speak to the motion moved by Senator McKiernan on the tabling of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report on the Human Rights (Mandatory Sentencing for Property Offences) Bill 2000. As previous speakers have said, this was a good committee and an interesting report. It is a privilege to serve on the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee because it deals with some of the more interesting, if not controversial, topics which come before us or which we bring before the committee. I always find it intellectually challenging when in these hearings to hear both sides of the argument. The report is as outlined by Senator McKiernan. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I was pleased to consent to that report and, to a degree, to the majority finding. There is only one aspect of that with which I disagree, and I have outlined that in my additional comments—not in a dissenting fashion but more as an additional comment. That is the question of whether the federal parliament should override the Western Australian legislation or whether it should be left to the state government of Western Australia. I have argued in my additional comments that that may be well meaning but that it is totally unrealistic. 
You may be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, being a Western Australian yourself, that the mandatory sentencing law—the three strikes law—in Western Australia has popular support. That is recognised by both the existing state Labor government and the coalition opposition. I recall clearly during the election campaign, which saw the election of the now Gallop government, that both sides of the political fence for the major parties were very keen on mandatory sentencing and, whenever questioned on that issue, made it very clear that they would maintain it if in government. That is clearly the case, and I can see no change philosophically, politically or in policy terms from either camp of the major players in my home state.  
We should not forget that the three strikes law evolved from legislation that was first introduced by then Premier Carmen Lawrence on behalf of the Labor government in the early 1990s. So I cannot agree to the proposition that the chair has outlined in the majority report, that we should wait and see what the Western Australian government is going to do, because I think we can very reasonably say that it is going to do nothing. Therefore, I have no qualms in being supportive of the notion that the bill should proceed forthwith.
In terms of what that may mean in a constitutional sense, it was argued by some people who came before the committee and who wrote to it that there may be constitutional difficulties for the federal parliament in passing this legislation and stepping over the Western Australian legislation. I put that question to one of the people who came before the committee in Perth, Mr Mark Cuomo, then representing the Aboriginal Legal Service. I asked him, a barrister, what his constitutional views were on whether or not this legislation would be valid if it were to be passed. He was cautious in his response. I do not mean to misquote him, but he said words to the effect of, `Well, we can't be entirely certain, but I think it is worth a go because the legislation is so abhorrent.' I would agree. Ultimately, I think every amendment, every bill, every piece of legislation that this chamber and the other house deals with is open to constitutional challenge. That is always the last port of call, as it were, and I do not think we should ever second-guess what the High Court may or may not determine in terms of a challenge.
As a Western Australian I am very conscious of the very real on-the-ground impact that the existence of these laws has and continues to have in my home state. I note an article in the West Australian of only 10 days ago, Friday, 1 March 2002, written by Julie Butler, which said:
A 17-YEAR-OLD who at the age of 12 was among the first and youngest offenders jailed under WA's three-strikes home burglary law is back behind bars.
The youth, who has racked up 94 charges since the age of 10—mainly burglary and stealing— wept yesterday when Children's Court president Kate O'Brien sentenced him to 18 months detention. Outside the court, his lawyer John Hawkins said the youth's record showed mandatory sentencing did not work and was not a deterrent. 
Under the three-strikes law, judges must sentence offenders to at least 12 months in jail once they are convicted of three home burglaries.
Last month, Judge O'Brien said the law had forced her to detain some juveniles she otherwise would not have. She said judges should have the discretion in all cases so justice could be done in all cases.
The article goes on to explain that the offences concerned were quite serious. It seems that the teenager was on an intensive supervision order for other offences, including stealing jewellery worth $5,000, when he committed the new offences last October, including causing some $600,000 worth of damage caused by fire to a Tom Price hardware store. But, more importantly, I think we should acknowledge that we are dealing with a kid who, from the age of 10, has been in serious trouble, and mandatory sentencing does not and cannot help him. We are dealing with far more serious systemic and structural problems in relation to children, particularly indigenous children. I join with the majority call, as it were, in the report for the continued condemnation of these laws, and advocate the repeal of them. I think the Commonwealth ought to step in and do so quickly.
In closing, I would like to express my thanks to the chair of the references committee, Senator McKiernan, and also to the tremendous staff who work for the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, particularly Dr Pauline Moore who, as it happens, is finishing up in her role as the head of the secretariat which oversees this committee. She will be leaving Canberra for Sydney to take up a new job with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I wish her all the best in that new career.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-12,"—Last night we were debating the regional forest agreement legislation which is before the chamber for the third or fourth time. It now appears it has the support of the Labor Party and the coalition and it will be passed, much to the favour of the woodchipping industry in Australia. The matter that came to the fore was whether the agreements are binding on the people who have signed up to them—namely, the Prime Minister and the government on the one hand and the state governments on the other. 
During the course of his response to Senator Murphy about whether the agreements were binding, the minister said that yes, they are. I had put it to the committee that these agreements are binding when it comes to financial advantage for the woodchip corporations. The Commonwealth in the future would have to intervene to protect Australia's wild forests and their wildlife, because most Australians want that to happen. The companies could then say, `That forest as a pile of woodchips would have been worth $10 million to us,' and the Commonwealth would be bound to pay out compensation from taxpayers' money, even though the companies had done nothing to earn it. 
I will very shortly be moving amendments which are going to test the Labor Party, because the amendments say, `If you're going to have this compensation clause which binds the Commonwealth in paying out to the woodchip corporations, let's have a clause which binds the woodchip corporations to compensate workers who are sacked or to reskill workers who are sacked by those very same companies.' We will get to that in a while. 
—We will shortly. 
—The Labor Party says we sure will—
—I said `shortly'.
—We will see how much they defend the workers' interests when it gets to that. I think we will find that it is only the Greens doing that, because I note that the Democrats are not represented in the chamber again. They were not represented last night. This is a very important piece of legislation as far as the forest estate is concerned; in fact, there has never been a more critical piece of legislation in terms of the future of forests in Australia because this gives a lay-down misere to the woodchip industries in the undefended and unprotected forests of Australia. Yet the Democrats are totally absent from this debate. Let that be noted. 
The minister indicated that not only was the Commonwealth bound to pay out to the corporations from taxpayers' money if any forests are protected but the other side of the coin, the environmental side—that is, the establishment of comprehensive and adequate reserves and the protection of forests where that is required under regional forest agreements of state governments, who are then charged with that responsibility—is also binding. Last night, the minister said to Senator Murphy:
You inquired as to the legally binding nature of the agreements that have been entered into. I suppose all I need do is to refer you to part 3 of the agreements. I am assured that they all contain these same provisions, but the one I have in front of me is the one for the south-west forest region of Western Australia. In this agreement it is clause 94 in part 3. It may be a different clause in the other agreements, but I am advised that they are all there. They do say that it is the intention of the parties that this part creates legally enforceable rights and obligations. That part then deals with the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve systems and ecological sustainability. So the amendment—
that is, the Green amendment, which would make these agreements binding—
is really not necessary and this is provided for as things stand.
That is on page 337 of Hansard. The fact is the East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement contains no binding obligations at all, including not one for compensation. The Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement includes a legally enforceable part 3, clause 92, which includes neither implementation of the CAR reserves—comprehensive and adequate reserves—nor ecologically sustainable forest management—the minister was wrong there again. It covers ISO 14,000 certification, which is a form of certifying the quality of logging, and publication of reports and reviews but not whether they take place when required. The West Australian RFA also includes a legally enforceable part, which the minister referred to—this does not include ecologically sustainable forest management. It does include implementation of a CAR reserve and certification and competition reviews. So the minister misled—I have no doubt that it was inadvertent; he is new to the portfolio and will not yet be right across it— the committee by saying that there were binding clauses in the RFAs, which bound the states to implement the reserves and then to engage in ecologically sustainable forest management. That is not so. I want to make sure that the committee knows that, because what the Green amendment is doing here is making the environmental aspects of the regional forest agreements binding on state governments as well as on the Commonwealth. Let me put this in short again: if it is good enough for this legislation to bind the Commonwealth to pay out taxpayers' money to woodchip corporations when forests are protected, is it surely not good enough to bind the state governments to protect those forests which are to be in reserves and to engage in ecologically sustainable management in the forests?
Madam Temporary Chairman, you would know that ecologically sustainable management is a nonsense because what it refers to is so-called harvesting—a euphemism for total destruction of forest by corporations like Gunns, the biggest woodchippers in the Southern Hemisphere—under the direction of a malfunctioning and derelict Forestry Tasmania. As Senator Murphy said yesterday, one of these days Forestry Tasmania ought to be and will be subject to a thorough inquiry to ascertain why it does not meet its statutory obligations, why it does not return an overall profit when you take into account subsidies from the Tasmanian people and why it fails in sustainable management. The definition of sustainable management being used by the Liberal and Labor parties is one where the woodchippers move in under the direction of the state forestry authorities, chain saw these ancient forests and fire bomb them, killing all wildlife, all bird life and all reptiles. As I said last night, all you see remnant in these totally destroyed and fire bombed forests is the occasional white snail shell which has been burnt in the holocaust but the calcium has survived the intense heat. Nothing else does. 
The aim in Tasmania is to destroy totally the rainforest component so that it will not compete when, after the fire, Forestry Tasmania—not the woodchip corporations because they have this done at taxpayers' expense—moves in and reseeds the area with attenuated, fast growing and very often foreign eucalypts to that area. The process after that in this ecologically sustainable management, which the minister talks about quite erroneously, is the placement of 1080 poison to kill any marsupials coming from adjacent forests onto the destroyed part of the forest to graze on the new seedlings. So it is an environmental holocaust, it is a total destruction of the ecosystems and the forests are never meant to grow again. By design, they will be cut down before they get to the size where they become habitat for larger marsupials, birds and bats. The euphemism of `harvesting' goes on to the worst use of public relations design in this term `ecologically sustainable management', which means total blitzing of the forest at the profit of the woodchip corporations, who in turn donate to the Labor Party and the Liberal Party.
I would like the minister to confirm what I have been saying about the definition of legal and binding components of the regional forest agreements, because a committee cannot function if it is being misinformed by the minister in the chair. In an important matter like this, an amendment was brought forward and a person other than the mover of the amendment—in this case, Senator Murphy— asked whether the other components and compensation to the corporations were binding. He was told that, yes, that was the case, and we have found that it was not the case. It is very important that the minister rectify that mistake. I give him the opportunity to do so now. 
 (Senator Crowley)—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Brown be agreed to.
—Temporary Chairman, I was on my feet. 
—I am sorry, Senator, I thought you had sat down. You may continue.
—I do not have to point out to you, Temporary Chairman, that what just happened was that no other member of the Senate rose to insist that the minister rectify a very dangerous process of misinforming the Senate last night. This is the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Senator Macdonald. The senator should have got to his feet and responded, because I am making a very serious charge here. If we do not have correct information in a committee hearing like this, we cannot have the public faith that we are going to come to the right conclusion. When a minister for the Crown misleads a committee on an important matter like this—that the government is bound to do something when in fact it is not—then that is a mistake that should be notified to the Senate and it should not be left to a Green senator to challenge him on that. Then when he does not rise to defend himself or to alter the record, the Labor Party should at least get up and ask him to do so. But of course we are in this situation where they are arm in arm with the Howard government on this process of legally enforcing the destruction of Australia's wild forests and wildlife. I do not have the Democrats' backing in the Senate to do anything other than challenge the minister again. When I sit down this time the vote will be taken and there will be no further debate on this particular clause. 
It appears that the minister is not going to contribute to this debate in any meaningful way, but last night he referred to the Western Australian Regional Forest Agreement and I ask him what the status of that is. We know that there were massive protests about it in Western Australia and that it was the Labor Party's response to that public opposition to the destruction of forests in Western Australia that led to their election and indeed to five Greens being elected to the upper house in Western Australia at the start of last year. When the Western Australian Gallop government came in, it did say that it was going to defend the forests. I would like to know from the minister if it is doing that.  
It has come to my ears that some logging is again going to be allowed in the Sharpe block, which was a very pivotal block in that debate in Western Australia. Has the Gallop government reneged on its commitment to the people that won it the election? If not, what is the situation? As far as the regional forest agreement, which was effectively torpedoed by the strength of feeling of West Australians against it, is concerned, does it still exist and, if not, when and how was it withdrawn? If this bill passes, will that regional forest agreement in Western Australia be binding on that state? The minister has said that these agreements are binding. Is the agreement binding on Western Australia, because it seems that there is nothing much there to be bound? What are the processes that have been or will be used to amend the RFA to take into account that dramatic change that occurred when the Gallop government was elected and the Court government was rejected because of the regional forest agreement and other issues in Western Australia? 
I ask the minister whether he supports the ALP policy of ending old-growth logging in Western Australia and, if he does not, what action is he taking to defend the regional forest agreement that was signed between Prime Minister Howard and then Premier Court in Western Australia? These are important questions that ought to be answered in a debate and, while the minister is having the opportunity to acquaint himself with the detail that he will need to give the Senate, I note that there are now just six senators in the chamber, Temporary Chairman Crowley, and I draw your attention to the state of the House, because 19 senators are needed to form a quorum. (Quorum formed)
The minister has misled the Senate and failed under challenge to account for that on a pivotal clause, a pivotal amendment, in this legislation. There are measures to deal with that but the correct form would be for the minister, who is not even listening to the debate at this time and is not even in his seat, to respond in a way which clears the air. The government is cavalier about this legislation. The opposition is cavalier about it. The Democrats are not present at all. I take it extremely seriously, and so do most Australians.
I have been to blockades, peacefully run by young Australians, in all the states that are involved. I have seen all the opinion polls since the 1980s which show a great majority of Australians want these wild forests protected. We know that there is no need to be cutting them down because we have a two million hectare plantation establishment to meet all of Australia's wood needs, for paper, for house building and for all other purposes. Yet we have this unseemly business, whereby in the chamber right now the minister is ignoring the debate. There is no support to insist that he rectify the record when it has been manifestly pointed out by me that he misled the Senate on the matter last night. I am a lone senator for the Greens. It points out how much I look forward to the New South Wales Greens senator elect, Kerry Nettle, coming into this place, so that on occasions like this I can make the appropriate move, which would be to suspend this sitting and to report progress until the Senate gets a proper answer from the minister, who is treating this debate in such a cavalier fashion.
There have been few occasions in my career as a parliamentarian when an important, far-reaching amendment, like the one I have put before the committee, can be dismissed with such disdain by both the government and the Labor opposition—and dismissed by a minister misleading the Senate. There is nothing further I can do about that. I know the government is determined to shove this legislation through without the debate that it deserves. I said to the leader of the House earlier today that if the minister answers the questions then the debate will move on. There have been claims that this is a filibuster from me. It is not true. It is not a filibuster; it is a heartfelt effort to get answers from the government to justify this draconian legislation which institutes the destruction of Australia's forests for the next 20 years and removes the minister's powers, the government's powers, the federal parliament's powers—time honoured powers—to protect areas. Last night the minister, quite wrongly, implied that I had been wrong in saying that the Weld, the Picton and the Huon valleys, which will be subject to logging in the wake of this legislation, were not of World Heritage value. 
—They have been for 150 years.
—Senator O'Brien, for the Labor Party in Tasmania, says that they have been for 150 years. I would ask him to go to the Weld Valley and point out the areas of the Weld that were being logged 150 years ago. He is quite wrong, and by interjection he reveals the lack of information he has about the history of this industry. The Weld Valley has been a pristine valley until the invasion of the woodchip industry in recent decades. In the last week, we have seen a dozen or so young people peacefully protesting about a new bridge to be built across the Weld River at taxpayers' expense to increase the area of the lower valley that is to be destroyed by woodchip operations. Instead of supporting this future Australian outlook which says, `Let's keep our natural heritage and our wildlife,' the Labor Party says, `No, we hand across to the job shedding woodchip industry the short-term profits that will be exported out of Tasmania.' Ninety per cent of those forests will go to the woodchippers, to the paper mills of Japan and China and not to the downstream processing which has been the so-called direction in which the regional forest agreements would take us.
The minister said that these areas are not of World Heritage value. Again, he is wrong. The World Heritage advisers—the chief advisers, the experts in Geneva, the World Conservation Union—have called for these areas to be included in the World Heritage area designated in Tasmania and nominated for World Heritage value because they are of World Heritage significance. But the reason they are not—they are going to be logged instead—is that the regional forest agreements give the woodchip corporations entry into these wild forests against public feeling and against the interests of the industries in Tasmania, which would treat these forests much better, and in which the number of jobs is increasing—the hospitality industry, the tourism industry. This industry attracts people to Tasmania because it has the cleanest air in the world; it has some of the purest waters anywhere in the world; it has some of the most intact wildlife systems in the world; it has the tallest hardwood forests, the tallest flowering plants on earth—and that latter entity is now subject to destruction because of this legislation.
That is why I stand here opposing it today—alone in this chamber at the moment, totally alone in this chamber, which is back to six members only taking part in this debate. I object to that and I draw attention to the state of the House. (Quorum formed) While the senators en masse leave the chamber again, so they will not take part in this debate, I will nevertheless continue. 
I have just been acquainted with the news that in Goolengook in Victoria there has been another arrest today of a protester. I want to record, for those Victorians concerned about Goolengook, my heartfelt concern for what is happening there. You will know from listening to me before that this was an area of heritage reserve under the regional forest agreements and it was protected by state law. But the Kennett government reversed that law after they had arrested a number of people, including me, in 1998. The agreement had been signed with Prime Minister Howard that this area would be protected. But, without any statement or investigation or any concern at all, the Victorian government unilaterally removed half of the reserve—a thousand hectares—of prime heritage river forest including rainforest and a huge range of wildlife and wildlife habitat including that of the endangered quoll. But the federal government did nothing. The minister said last night that the federal requirements for sustainable logging and adequate reserves are binding but there we have a clear case where it was not binding and nothing was done by the Commonwealth.
This legislation is there for the interests of the corporations. It is not there for the workers and it is certainly not there for the Australian people's primary interest, which is to keep these environments intact. Again, I should explain it so that it will be on the Hansard record. We are down to six members in the Senate again. The obvious direction there by Labor and the Liberals is to prevent this debate continuing, because I cannot get to my feet again. There will be a vote after this and then we will move on to the next amendment. It is an appalling situation, an undemocratic situation, where the minister has not answered basic questions and has not even moved to correct his misleading of the chamber on his submission that this amendment is not required because these matters are binding, when in fact they are not in the regional forest agreements. So be it. 
 (Senator Crowley)—The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Brown be agreed to.
Question negatived.
—I ask that my vote for the ayes be recorded.
— Senator Brown, your positive vote will be recorded.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-12,"—I move Australian Greens amendment (5), sheet 2432, revised:
(5)	Clause 5, page 5 (after line 4), at the end of the clause, add:
	(2)	Provisions of an RFA expressed to be non-binding are binding in so far as they relate to protection of threatened species and communities, World Heritage, ecologically sustainable forest management, CAR reserves, monitoring and review.
The last amendment was to change the definition so that we did make the regional forest agreement provisions to protect the environment, weak as they might be, binding on the state governments effectively—but that has been negatived. What I am doing with this amendment is to put into the bill the teeth that would make binding the provisions, weak as they are, in the regional forest agreements that protect threatened and endangered species of plants and animals and birds so that they would actually be protected; that would enforce the protection of world heritage values; that would insist on ecologically sustainable management, which we are told is the cornerstone of the regional forest agreement system; that would insist that comprehensive and adequate reserves are in fact protected into the future and not logged—as we have seen on several occasions in Tasmania and which, as I just pointed out, is happening today under the force of the many police being brought out to defend the forest industry's monetary interest in Goolengook against the public's environmental interest; and that would insist on a monitoring system and a review system which reported back to this parliament that meant something. But instead of this the government and the opposition, and in their absence I must assume the Democrats—I will not assume anything for them except that they do not care much about this debate—are not going to make those matters binding which the woodchip corporations do not want to be bound by and which state governments who are into destroying these forests do not want to be bound by.
My amendment would insert also a provision to insist on the binding nature of an RFA in these words:
Sections of an RFA expressed to be non-binding—
and that is what happens in these RFAs; it actually says the environmental components are non-binding, notwithstanding what the minister said last night, it is there in black and white—
are binding in so far as they relate to protection of threatened species and communities, World Heritage, ecologically sustainable forest management, CAR reserves, monitoring and review.
Let me give you an example of why this should be so. There is in the Tarkine Wilderness in north-western Tasmania the biggest temperate rainforest in our nation. It is equal in size to any of the great tropical rainforests in the Daintree or further north in Queensland. It has a large heart of wilderness. It is named after the Tarkine people who were living on the west coast of Tasmania between the Arthur and the Pieman rivers before they were savagely dispossessed, brutally dispossessed, by the European invasion early in the 19th century. Inland from that were the Tommeginne people. There were tracks through these great rainforests further into the interior of Tasmania. The indigenous people referred to the rainforest as the land of the dancing snakes. When you go into those rainforests you know you are in a primordial region of Australia, areas of which there is very little left on earth. 
We in Western communities are aghast at the rate of loss of the Amazon and the destruction of Borneo rainforests and those of the Indonesian archipelago and the Cameroons in Africa. As you know, there has been worldwide alarm about that loss of rainforests and the wildlife within them. It is one of those things that sears the heart of youngsters in particular and is the reason for this generation's lack of feeling that there is hope in the future, something that those of us who are older have never had to experience in our own time. It is a worldwide phenomenon. We all feel appalled by what is happening in the Amazon, but what is not generally known is that the rate, pro rata, of destruction of rainforest in Tasmania is greater. The rate of destruction of the great forests of Tasmania, hectare by hectare, is proportionately greater even than the destruction of native woodlands in Queensland. This legislation is a legal instrument to enforce that destruction so that it cannot be interfered with. It effectively reverses national park protection and says these will be logging domains—and the Tarkine will be amongst them.
During the summer break I sat at the Cann River near Burnie with the Pullinger family and a wide range of people from around Tasmania. There was a heartache in the air about what is about to happen to the Tarkine Wilderness, as they with their young hearts thought about how to get tracks into this region to show people the magnificent rainforest, the ferns and the clear pristine brooks running into the bigger rivers, the Arthur, the Franklin and the Pieman, and the cliffs, the geological formations and the caves—small as they might be, the most extensive magnesite cave systems on earth—and the fossil systems in there which turn up huge ancient insects. That is without going to the Aboriginal heritage right along that coast and through those forests. In this legislation we have a prescription for wholesale destruction of that rainforest, which has not been seen by the minister sitting there, Senator Ian Macdonald, who refuses to say anything at all. It has not been seen by the only other member of the government parties that is here listening to this debate. I dare say maybe Senator O'Brien from Tasmania has been out there; I do not know. He can contribute to the debate if he has. But the two Labor members have not been there either. I know that Senator Murphy, who is at a committee meeting at the moment and so is not here, has been and would be contributing to this debate about the appalling mismanagement in the Tarkine. Who else has been there? This Senate chamber and no doubt the House of Representatives is not about going to see these forests and determining on the ground what the impact is going to be. It is about legislating sight unseen to rip these forests down through the massive destruction power of modern machinery to line the pockets of Gunns Pty Ltd and Britton Brothers, maybe with, as I said earlier, over 90 per cent of these forests going to the woodchip mills and then through them to the paper mills of Japan and now China.
 `It is a good money spinner,' said the minister last night. Is it? We now get $10 at most—it is down around $7 in many cases— per tonne for these forests, which have been growing for centuries in Tasmania. The woodchip corporations get about $100 a tonne for putting them through a woodchip mill and onto a ship. They get about a tenfold increase. The Japanese and Chinese paper mills put them through a mill and get over $1,000 a tonne—another tenfold increase. This is a hundredfold increase on what we get as a royalty in Tasmania. When you look at the statistics, you find that the woodchip companies are doing very well; they are getting a huge return for their small investment of putting in a woodchip mill here or there. But Forestry Tasmania, mismanaged grossly under the Bacon Labor government, is effectively running at a loss. If you take into account the subsidies, including the $80 million in these regional forest agreements being put into the industry, we are actually paying to have these great forests, including the rainforest of the Tarkine, cut down and shipped out. 
At that meeting at Cann River, the discussion was about getting a track so that Australians could get in there to see these great forests; experience a few nights out in the forest; listen to the owls at night; watch the storms coming through from the wild west coast; hear the scamper of the doomed marsupials on the floor; and see the bats, which are also doomed, as they fly at sunset, in the start of the night's foraging. They are particularly worried about the pipeline track. That is a track running alongside the pipeline which takes the iron ore pellets from Savage River on the Pieman system to the south through the rainforest on the eastern edge to Port Latta in the north. Britton Brothers, Forestry Tasmania and Gunns are all in favour of going down that corridor and logging this pristine rainforest for 200 metres on either side and for the full length of it, length to length. This is ostensibly to get rainforest timbers out for them to sell. If you go to the Burnie wharf, there is a pile of rainforest woodchips there bigger than this Senate chamber. A bulldozer working around on the top looks like a toy car. That is rainforest already smashed down by these same entities and carted off to be sold as woodchips to Japan. It is not for value added; it is value lost to Tasmania. And that is what they will primarily do with this corridor.
I was speaking to Stephanie Cahalan in my office in Hobart. She has been down to other rainforests in Tasmania which have been cut in the last few months, and she told me about the prodigious waste of myrtle, celery-top, sassafras—these valuable timbers which are left in their tonnes on the forest floor by this wasteful and marauding woodchip industry and which very likely are going to be firebombed in the coming week. Forestry Tasmania wanted to firebomb this area a month ago, but it was not dry enough. There is a spell of warmer, drier weather in Tasmania at the moment, so it will be in to firebomb those remnant rainforests. What happens there is that a helicopter appears over the destroyed forest with these vast amounts of still malleable, valuable timbers on the floor and drops hundreds or thousands of ping-pong balls—that is literally ping-pong balls—filled with an explosive, napalm like material which then bursts into a firestorm. This destroys everything that is left— every green leaf that is left in those coupes and those valuable rainforest timbers—and then along come the same companies and the same Forestry Tasmania who perpetrated this crime against nature, this economic malfeasance, this total rorting and mismanagement of a valuable resource and say, `We want more rainforest, so we want to cut the pipeline track.'
The minister himself, if he had the gumption to get up and speak after me, will say, `What can I do about it? I do not have powers.' This legislation that he wants rushed through here, which I am determined is going to be debated adequately, divests the Commonwealth of powers to intervene. It has had them in the past. The Commonwealth, you will remember, protected the Daintree against a ferocious Bjelke-Petersen government in Queensland. It protected some of the south-west forests in Tasmania, including the Lemonthyme Forest near Cradle Mountain in 1989, with the Greens then holding the balance of power and a Labor government that wanted government so was prepared to go along with it. But Commonwealth intervention was necessary there, and World Heritage nomination followed. Those powers to protect World Heritage value forests and protect the extraordinarily diverse and ancient forests, like those along the pipeline track, which have never seen a chainsaw before, are going to be divested from the Commonwealth under this legislation.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-03-12,"—The opposition will not be supporting this amendment. The provision that Senator Brown seeks to amend reads:
This Act binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth.
The provision which Senator Brown seeks to have the Senate include seeks to vary agreements between the Commonwealth and the states by virtue of a provision in the legislation which would purport to have an effect which, in our view, is unnecessary. The RFAs, to be RFAs under this legislation, as I said before, must be agreements that satisfy certain conditions, including that they provide for comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve systems; they provide for ecologically sustainable management and use of forested areas in the region or regions; they have regard to assessments of environmental values, including old-growth, wilderness, endangered species, national estate values and World Heritage values; they have regard to indigenous heritage values; they have regard to economic values of forested areas and forest industries; they have regard to social values, including community needs; and they have regard to the principles of ecologically sustainable management. It is the opposition's view that it is not appropriate to amend the legislation to purport to alter the terms of an agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the state in this regard if it meets the tests that have been laid down in determining just what is an agreement which is covered by this legislation. So we will not be supporting this amendment. 
It is interesting that, so far in the debate of this legislation, we have established that when Senator Brown talked about protecting the Weld Valley in Tasmania he chose not to tell the Senate that, in fact, about 80 per cent of it was already protected and will never be logged and that most of the old-growth forest that remains in the Weld Valley is in that 80 per cent of the area that is protected and will never be logged. But Senator Brown chose not to say that. He suggested that there is something pristine about a catchment the remnant of which is available to be logged substantially having already been subject to timber harvesting. He neglected to say that part of the area that is available to be logged will be managed on the basis of special timber management, with a very long-term harvesting regime—that is, selective harvesting over the long term for specialty timbers. We have become accustomed to needing to put all the facts on the record so that the public do hear what is the whole truth in relation to any particular matter.
He referred to the Weld Valley, the Picton Valley and the Huon Valley. I have the map of that region. A huge amount of the region—I am not going to try and estimate how much—is in formal reserves, be it state park or World Heritage areas, and the overwhelming majority of old-growth forest in those catchments lies in reserves. There are reserves which are in formal reserves in addition to those that I have just described which would form streamside reserves or special forest category reserves that lie outside of the formal reserves areas that will also not be logged, in accordance with the regional forest agreements. Most of the areas that remain available for harvesting are not old-growth forests but regrowth forests. Most of the areas in that catchment are regrowth forests. Senators may have heard about some terrible vandalism that was practised upon a logging coupe in the area. I am, I think, reliably informed that that operation was being carried out in a regrowth area, not an old-growth area, but millions of dollars of damage was done to equipment in that area.
I know that Senator Brown and Ms Putt, who is the Greens representative in the Tasmanian parliament, have protested that environmentalists were not responsible for that vandalism. I certainly hope it is true. It has been suggested to me that there was a link on the Wilderness Society's site in Tasmania to an English web site which operates under the name Ozymandias. It is a 12-page site and it says:
Cafe Underground presents:
Ozymandias' Sabotage Handbook
And it starts:
This guide is not really about `noble' sabotage— for example people clamping themselves to diggers on road projects. It's about taking action against the everyday destruction of the environment ... Specifically, it's about sabotaging machinery, and getting away with it.
It then has a number of suggestions as to how best one might sabotage vehicles and heavy machinery designed to be used in a logging coupe. If it is true that this was connected with the Wilderness Society's web site in Tasmania, then someone ought to explain to the Australian public why the Wilderness Society would, by virtue of establishing that link, encourage people to practise sabotage on forestry machinery in Tasmanian forests. It seems to me that, if that is the case, it makes it very difficult for people to argue that there is not a case, on the face of it, that environmentalists—perhaps not mainstream environmentalists but someone connected with the environment movement—were responsible for that damage. I am interested in that debate and I am sure we will hear more about it over time. 
What we have also established in this debate is that well over 60 per cent of old-growth forests in the state of Tasmania, in fact nationally, are protected under regional forest agreements. In fact, in Tasmania the public forest area which will not be logged, which is protected, contains 85 per cent of the old-growth forest that is available in public forest areas. In other words, only 15 per cent of the state's old-growth forest available for logging is in public forests. We have also heard in this debate that tens of thousands of hectares of private land is being included in a reserve system and much of that includes old-growth forest. Those tens of thousands of hectares will also never be logged. So the facts contrast somewhat with the rhetoric that Senator Brown puts on the record today.
The other matter which is of concern is that Senator Brown claimed in the debate yesterday that World Heritage forest had been logged. Although challenged, he has chosen not to substantiate his claim. So I look forward to Senator Brown telling us in the debate which old-growth forest in a World Heritage area was the subject of logging. I am not aware of it, but I am sure, if he has got some facts, he can acquaint us with which particular forest he claims lies in a World Heritage area and has been logged. I would like to hear that, I know the minister would like to hear that and I am sure the Australian people would like to hear that. When we know which particular forest is alleged to have been logged, we can make our inquiries, and if there is something to be addressed in that regard then the opposition, and I hope the government, would wish to attend to what would be an improper practice. That is not a practice which would be supported in any way by this legislation. This bill does not entitle any operator to conduct a forestry operation in a World Heritage area. Indeed, an amendment to the 2001 bill that now appears in this legislation—which follows an amendment the opposition had been proposing to the bill we were discussing last year—makes it very clear that World Heritage areas and Ramsar wetlands are protected in terms of forestry operations. So I am glad to say that the opposition have had an influence in improving the legislation. Obviously, that aspect of the legislation we would support. We were proposing to move our own amendment but have been advised that it would simply duplicate the provision already in the legislation.
I think this debate allows us to talk about what this legislation will do and to talk in terms of fact. I am happy for the debate to proceed on that basis. I do not think that we are being assisted by the suggestion that areas such as the Weld Valley have never been logged before. I know that there have been operations in the Weld Valley over a period of time. They certainly would not have been, 100-odd years ago, as extensive as they would be now with modern access, but I do not believe that it is true to say that there were no forestry operations ever in the Weld Valley, as Senator Brown suggests. We can banter to and fro about who was right and who was wrong about that; the fact of the matter is that the Weld Valley is substantially protected. It is protected under this bill and, we think appropriately so, an RFA would allow harvesting in a very limited area of that valley, mostly in areas that are regrowth forest that have been subject to forestry operations before. We think that that meets all of the tests set down under this legislation.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-12,"—The government will not be supporting this amendment for a number of reasons, several of which have already been mentioned by Senator O'Brien in speaking for the opposition. Certainly, those reasons are relevant from the government's point of view as well, and I will not reiterate those in the hope that we can save some time in this debate. Apart from that, the amendment is nonsensical as it relates to a technical reading of this bill. This bill, when it becomes an act, will bind the Crown and the right of the Commonwealth; that is all it can do, of course, as Commonwealth legislation.  
I also share the view previously put by Senator O'Brien that it is important to debate these issues of national importance such as regional forest agreements and the management of our forestry generally. But the basis of debate on this bill, as in any debate on any bill in this chamber, must be factual, not on a basis which is deliberately misleading with some senators—I should say only one—deliberately putting up false information and facts in a very emotive way to try to pursue a political objective that that particular senator has. It is the sort of thing that anarchists or Marxists of the old school would do to try to inhibit and thwart the will of the parliament of the people of Australia. That sort of action is exemplified by the continual calling of quorums: when a senator is trying to speak a quorum will be called simply to interfere with the debate.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. I object to the minister's comments. The minister has quite clearly allied me to anarchists and Marxists. I have a Presbyterian background and I want that put on the record as well.
 (Senator Crowley)—I am not at all sure under what piece of parliamentary procedure that was. I think it is not a point of order, but you have made your point.
—He also identifies himself, I would suggest; I did not. It is the type of activity and behaviour that we have from certain people in this chamber who simply thwart the will of parliament and thwart the will of the people. We must work on facts. On a couple of occasions last night, Senator Brown said directly, and implied in other areas, that we were logging in World Heritage listed forests. I have challenged him to name those forests, because, if there is logging in World Heritage listed forests, I want to know straightaway—and I know the environment minister wants to know straightaway too, because action will be taken. To my understanding, there has been no logging in World Heritage listed forests since they have been listed. If you have that information, Senator Brown, please give it to us. But you do not have the information. You just say these things in the hope that someone might hear you and be enthused, by your misrepresentation of the facts, to your view on these issues. (Quorum formed) In the way of anarchists, Marxists—and I can even add fascists to that—what you do is to stop free speech. You do not allow people to have a point of view.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, did you make a count of that quorum?
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Yes.
—It is an old trick of fascists, anarchists and Marxists to make sure that the other voice is not heard. (Quorum formed) You stop any opportunity for others to raise their voices and to have a view. You see that sort of attitude being exhibited in this debate. If one senator does not like what you are saying, they will try to prevent you from saying it. That is what Hitler used to do; that is what Lenin used to do; and that is what fascists, anarchists and Marxists all around the world used to do.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. I think even you, Chair, should stop that sort of invective against a member of this chamber. I act honourably in this place. I am concerned about this matter. I will not sit and allow that sort of accusation to be made against me in this place. I ask you to have the minister withdraw.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, on the point of order: there was an implied aspersion on the chair. Senator Brown said `even you', and I would ask him to withdraw that aspersion on the chair.
—I did not hear comments made by Senator Macdonald being directed to any particular person in the chamber, Senator Brown. Therefore, I dismiss your point of order.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. I notify you that I will ask for a ruling from the President on this matter, because I object.
—I will draw it to the Deputy President's attention. 
—So that there can be no misunderstanding, I say again that it was the fascists, the anarchists and the Marxists who did everything possible to prevent a different opinion being held. When someone would get up to give a different opinion and put facts on the table—not just misinformation, not just deliberate or unintentional wrongly produced statements; you get up to correct those—in totalitarian regimes, those regimes would do everything possible to make sure that the truth was not known and not heard, and to make sure that the real facts were not heard.
I feel like that in this particular instance where I am attempting to tell those who are interested in this debate and those who might be listening on the radio what the real facts are. Every time I get onto the real facts of the issue, and when I point out the inconsistencies and wrong factual information displayed and spoken by Senator Brown, a quorum is called. For those who do not understand this place, you call a quorum when there are not enough senators in the chamber. That happens because most senators are doing substantial work in other parts of Parliament House. They are seeing constituents, they are seeing groups, they are working on committees and they are working on the very important work that they have to do as senators.
—People pay thousands of dollars to come here to see us from Western Australia.
—Indeed, Senator Campbell makes a very good point: there are groups that come from all over Australia to see senators, and those senators are in their offices doing that work—but watching and listening to the debate on TV so that they are well aware of what is happening and they will know how to make an informed vote when they have to vote.
In this debate, we have had Senator Brown simply saying things that are not true, such as: we are logging in World Heritage listed forests. I have asked him to tell me which forests they are, but I have no answer, because it does not suit Senator Brown to tell the truth. He knows there is no logging in World Heritage listed forests, but he keeps saying it in the hope that someone will listen to it, someone will hear it and someone might come to his point of view on the environment generally. He has also said that, through this legislation, the government and the parliament divest themselves of any power in the forest debate. This is simply untrue. This legislation is all about making sure that the agreements that the Commonwealth and others have made are, in fact, given legislative sanction.
Senator O'Brien has already pointed out, on several occasions, the misinformation Senator Brown gives about the Weld Valley. I join Senator O'Brien in despairing that the livelihoods of families, workers and small businessmen are being destroyed in the forests by criminals who are out there destroying machinery. I do not accuse Senator Brown of being involved in that or of having any association with that, but I see him speaking in the paper denying that it is him. One might think that his denials can be read a certain way. 
Senator Brown talks about a lot of the old-growth forests and a lot of very special trees being logged, but he knows as well as we all do that each RFA provides for the establishment of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system based on nationally agreed criteria. The CAR reserve system is a precautionary approach to forest management, and it ensures that state and Commonwealth governments can be satisfied that they have adequately preserved forest ecosystems in their natural state, free from human impact. 
The nationally agreed criteria are 15 per cent of pre-1750 distribution of each forest type, 60 per cent of existing old-growth forests—100 per cent if rare or depleted—and 90 per cent or more of high-quality wilderness forest. This level of protection is at the forefront of international standards. The level of forest preservation in Australia greatly exceeds—on all accounts—the levels set out by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the IUCN, which Senator Brown is always quoting. 
Our standards in Australia are higher than the IUCN standards. They are higher than the World Wide Fund for Nature requirements of 10 per cent of existing distribution of forest. While the IUCN reserve criteria are based on the existing distribution of forests, the CAR nationally agreed criteria are based on the distribution of forest pre-1750. Australia's forest reserve system is, as a result of the RFA process, well in excess of IUCN and WWF standards. To hear Senator Brown speak, you would never believe that, but these are the facts; this is the truth. These are the sort of truths and facts that Senator Brown tries to prevent me from repeating in this chamber by continually calling quorums and trying to thwart the will of the people.  
My time in this session of the debate is almost finished. Unfortunately, I have to leave the debate at this time. My position will be taken by Senator Alston, who has a long and very involved interest in the forest debate. I should explain to the Senate that I have to leave to go to the very first cabinet sustainable environment committee meeting, which is being held at this time—a first for any government in Australia. The Howard government has set up a special cabinet sustainable environment subcommittee. I have to go to that because it is very important. It is very important that issues like those we are debating here are dealt with by the sustainable environment committee. That is why I will not be here for the next quarter of an hour of this debate. But Senator Alston, who as I said has a very acute understanding of these issues, will more than adequately fill in for me and be able to assist the committee in its deliberations.
The work that has been done—the jobs that have been created by the RFA and the sensible and sustainable management of the forests that has occurred as a result of the management by the Howard government and, I have to say, perhaps with some hesitation, the previous Commonwealth government and even the state Labor government in Tasmania—is a credit to all concerned. The forests are managed sustainably and well. Jobs are created and certainty is created for people. Forests are very important—that is why we have this legislation—but equally important are people and their livelihoods. Jobs have been created for people so that they are able to sustain their families, there is security for investment and there is certainty for conservation reserves to ensure that our forests are conserved in a way that is adequate, comprehensive and representative. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-12,"—When I hear that sort of contribution to the debate, which followed an equal one from Senator O'Brien, I am proud to be here as an Australian Green defending the long-term interests of the environment in this great nation of ours and, on this occasion, defending what is by far the popular view in this country that these forests should be protected. The minister may be going to what is labelled—in the greenwash way this government has—the `ecologically sustainable management of the country' committee, but I think the citizenry of Australia is very quickly realising that this government is very capable of misleading it in grand order. The citizenry of Australia, particularly young Australians, are not going to accept that a government which is orchestrating the greatest destruction of forests in history, supported by the Crean opposition, is into sustainable management.
Senator O'Brien said in his contribution that the Wilderness Society was linked to a group that was putting forward sabotage literature. That was tried last week in Tasmania by the logging industry—which seems to inform Senator O'Brien in his debate all the way down the line. In fact, I understand that the Examiner newspaper, which takes a very strong pro-woodchip line in Launceston, was going to run that story last week. The Examiner withdrew it when it was pointed out that the link—which is a series of links from the Wilderness Society, which the person I asked to try to emulate it could not—to this group was no closer than the link from the Examiner newspaper to this group. I have no doubt that, if Senator O'Brien has a web site, the link would be no closer than the link from him to this group, from the Labor Party to this group and from the Liberal Party to this group.
What a tawdry, mean and despicable contribution from those who do not want to engage in the debate but who want to vilify the Wilderness Society, with its 25 years of honourable contribution to this nation's wellbeing, including the protection of the Daintree forests and the Franklin River wilderness— which now creates an enormous number of jobs in Tasmania—as well as ensuring the beauty of that wild place. What a despicable way to try to vilify those good people who work patch-in-pants for the defence of this nation's environmental amenity. Senator O'Brien should apologise for that but he will not because he is not up to it. I put on the record that that is the level that the debate gets to on the forest industry. It comes from the Wise Use Movement in America and it is copycatted here—that is, when you are not doing well in the debate and you do not have the public with you, vilify your opponents. That is what is being done there. But I think Senator O'Brien can live with that. 
I will now acquaint the Senate with another Tasmanian citizen's entreaty to Senator O'Brien who, on behalf of the Crean government, is in here tonight defending this legislation to give the woodchip corporations an open go on the unprotected forests of Tasmania, including the World Heritage value forests, the Picton and the Huon valleys. John Haywood, of Weegena in Tasmania, wrote to Senator O'Brien, who is a senator from Tasmania, earlier this month, saying:
Dear Shadow Minister
Below is a description of Tasmanian forestry in the fifth year after the signing of the Tasmanian RFA in 1997. I have sent you and a number of front-bench Labor colleagues earlier versions of this information, all but invariably without any response of acknowledgment. 
The failure of you and other logging industry supporters to respond is understandable. The situation described here is indefensible on both economic and environmental grounds. The facts cited are not easily disputable, as they are drawn mainly from the forest industry statistics. The Tasmanian forestry PR representatives who are compelled to defend it invariably do so in a similar manner to the one employed by the sole Labor Party respondent, Mr Crean, which is to ignore the manifestation and recite the platitudinous objectives of the RFA. Invariably, they refuse to address the cardinal characteristics of Tasmanian logging: the grotesque and skyrocketing volume of the harvest, the staggering percentage consigned to `waste', i.e. woodchips (now over 95%), the still rising percentage of the harvest coming from native forest (nearly 90%), the plummeting employment in forestry since the RFA (down 47% by June 2001), and the net financial loss to the public owners of the forests.
Your refusal—
he is addressing this to Senator O'Brien— 
to address any of the realities of Tasmanian logging, and your vocal opposition to any Senate or judicial inquiries into this industry, inevitably give rise to the perception that you are seeking to obfuscate and mislead for motives that are illegitimate.
The RFA bill coming up before Parliament—
here we are debating it tonight—
will indemnify the logging industry against retrieval of any part of the nearly one-quarter of Tasmania they have been handed by the RFA (there are no restrictions on their acquisition and clearing of private land). The conduct of the industry in Tasmania, and the manner of your defence of it leads inexorably to the conclusion that this is a massive, politically sanctioned looting of a public resource under the guise of “resource security”.
I am asking you for the first direct defence I will have ever seen to the sort of realities described below. Please do not follow the usual pattern of attaching your name to the evasive spin supplied by Forestry Tasmania. Since I realise that you do not have time to respond in detail to all the correspondence you receive, I undertake to forward your reply to the co-addressees, who collectively have the capacity to carry your message (or lack of it) to the entire country and beyond. There can be few more opportune times to define the Labor Party as a real alternative to the Liberals in terms of integrity.
Mr Haywood goes on to say:
Since the signing of the Regional Forest Agreement in 1997, Tasmania has undergone the most intensive logging in the developed world.
In 1999-2000 logging alone accounted for 35,100 hectares of forest in the state, a rate of native bush clearing which in percentage terms is twice that of the 425,000 hectares of bush cleared for all purposes in Queensland, and also exceeds the clearing rate of Brazil. In 2000-01 that figure increased yet again, this time by 20%, to over 42,000 hectares, with the amount logged on public land increasing by 34%. Tasmania has no legislation controlling such clearing. UN statistics released in 2001 reveal that Australia has the second worst level of land clearing in the Commonwealth, trailing only Zambia. 
In this letter to Senator O'Brien, the Labor spokesperson for Opposition Leader Crean, Mr Haywood, goes on to say:
Records were set for volumes of logs removed every quarter last year.
That is in Tasmania. He continues:
In 1999-2000, with less than 0.9% of Australia's land area, Tasmania contributed 5.5 million tonnes, or over 80%, of Australia's 7 million tonnes of export woodchips (volume of logs milled that year declined more than 6%).
So woodchips up; sawlogging, which is where the jobs are, down. He continues:
This constituted 95% of Australia's hardwood (native forest) chips, but we still trail Queensland in the production of the vastly more valuable hardwood sawn timber.
Queensland has got no export woodchips but is producing more sawlogs than Tasmania, which is contributing the massive majority of woodchips being exported. Mr Haywood's letter continues:
Gunns Ltd, the dominant woodchipper, boasted in its prospectus that Tasmania has overtaken the entire Southern US to become the largest regional producer of hardwood chips in the world. The figure for 2000-01 could be extrapolated from the increase in area logged at about 6.6 million tonnes, but the actual tonnages are no longer available. Due to its control of at least 85% of the export woodchip market, Gunns Ltd—
which is centred in Launceston but exports its profits to the mainland—
has exercised its right to suppress the figures from Australian Bureau of Statistics publications on business confidentiality grounds.
Can you believe that! Mr Haywood continues:
Forestry Tasmania's 2000-01 annual report showed a 34% increase in the area of public native forest cleared along with a virtually identical 34% decrease in the public dividend from Forestry Tasmania's operations—about $2 per tonne before any deductions for environmental, infrastructural and other collateral damage.
In this letter to Senator O'Brien, who will no doubt respond to the chamber, though he has not had the wherewithal to respond to this very literate and informed Tasmanian supplicant, Mr Haywood goes on to say:
A stupendously wasteful 94% of all logs felled were chipped in 1999-2000, with a 7.5% drop in sawmill volumes for 2000-01 suggesting the woodchip or “waste” figure is now above 95%. When one considers that 50-60% or more of trees could be milled in any reasonable attempt to maximise efficiency and that sawn timber is worth from 5-20 times as much as chips, the multibillion dollar scale of the waste begins to be appreciated. The woodchip price has fallen about 25% in value, to about $72 per tonne, since the RFA was signed; prime sawn timber can fetch $1500 for the same weight. Numerous cases have been observed of valuable rainforest hardwoods such as myrtle, sassafras, musk and celery-top pine being simply heaped and burned on the forest floor to make way for pulpwood plantations.
What a devastating indictment of this industry Mr Haywood's letter is. What a remarkable thing that Senator O'Brien, who stands here defending this indefensible industry, will not answer a letter like this. How much it feeds into the view, widely held in Tasmania, that the Labor and Liberal parties are held captive by the big woodchip corporations and have lost contact with the public sentiment, which is aghast at the rapidly increasing destruction of Tasmania's forest. 
Mr Haywood goes on to make many more compelling points to Senator O'Brien. I will leave it there but I will return to this letter when we resume this debate, because I think it must be on the record. The opportunity for Senator O'Brien and opposition leader Crean through Senator O'Brien to respond to this extraordinarily informed letter must be afforded.
Progress reported.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2002-03-12,"—I would like to speak on a medical condition that is little known but is one that we should recognise, particularly as tomorrow is the start of Coeliac Week. As medical research progresses, we find there is a greater awareness of a greater number of diseases, the symptoms of those diseases and the treatment of those diseases. One of the lesser-known diseases is coeliac disease, a condition that renders the sufferer intolerant to dietary gluten. Without becoming too technical in medical terms—something I am not capable of doing—it is a disease that affects the cells of the small bowel. The cells are damaged and the capacity of the body to absorb nutrients and minerals from food is seriously depleted. Sufferers of the disease are intolerant to some major food sources such as wheat, rye, barley, triticale and oats—somewhat distressful for the person who likes a beer after work or a fine malt whisky after dinner. I guess that is the reason why men are less rigid with the dietary restrictions of the disease than women once they have been diagnosed.
The disease was first recognised by a Dutch doctor in 1888 through his examination of children, but it was not until 1949 that it was diagnosed when a doctor was operating on a patient for another reason. It had also been noticed during the war years that people who were thin and suffering intestinal pains and cramps began to put on weight and have a reduced incidence of the cramps and pains because of their changed diets brought about by their circumstances. Medical research and observations by medical practitioners have led to the recognition that coeliac disease is more common than previously thought. There are no firm statistics, but it is believed thousands of Australians suffer from it, many undiagnosed. The prevalence of it could be as high as one in 500 and some commentators suggest it could be much more than this. Indeed, I understand that in New Zealand researchers believe it could be as high as one in 200. 
Coeliacs, even with the changing of their diets, are never cured—the disease remains with them. With removal of gluten from the diet, children and most adults return to being perfectly normal and will remain normal as long as they adhere to the diet. Despite greater awareness of the disease, it is still often slow to be detected because it has such a wide ranging effect on the body. It can be the cause of diarrhoea and constipation, fatigue, weakness and lethargy. It can lead to miscarriages or infertility, low blood calcium levels with muscle spasms, altered mental alertness, bone and joint pains, bowel tumours and type 1 diabetes. In children it can lead to lack of proper development and behavioural problems.
Currently in Australia very little research is being conducted in this area. There are small groups within hospitals that have done some research, but most of it gets done overseas. The Coeliac Society in Australia has had very few resources to fund research. They find it hard enough raising funds to keep the association going so that they can provide information and support to sufferers. In Western Australia, the society received a grant of $50,000 and in New South Wales the Department of Health gave the society $3,000. Other states have received no funding at all. This funding does not go very far. At the moment the staff of the society are spending a lot of their time trying to get funding—time taken away from providing the support that they are giving. They are raising some funding through subscriptions to their newsletter. Their subscriptions have increased considerably over the years to 11,500 nationally, which is indicative of the increase of coeliac cases in Australia. In New South Wales alone there are over 4,000 subscribers.
Five to six years ago, the Coeliac Society used to run out of the back room of someone's house. Today they are experiencing problems with the transition from providing support to what used to be a small group to what has now become quite a large group and continues to grow. One of the first things that needs to be researched with this condition is the incidence of it—how many people suffer from it, taking into consideration that many people will remain undiagnosed. It is said that coeliac disease is a genetically acquired disease and in some cases an environmental one. Some research has been done to locate a gene for this disease. There have been some successful findings but they have not been definitive and have been done overseas. Once this research provides a definitive result, then screening can be done at an early age.
This early screening would prevent many of the associated outcomes of this disease, such as the early onset of osteoporosis, anaemia, type 1 diabetes and those others I referred to earlier. There is an absolute need at this time for money to be made available for proper research into this disease and the treatment of it. This week, from tomorrow, 13 March through to 20 March, is National Coeliac Week. It is an appropriate time for the government to give due consideration to providing funding for research into this debilitating disease.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Health: Coeliac Disease</title>,Adjournment,18,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-03-12," asked the Minister representing the Treasurer—With reference to import tariffs on 4-wheel drive (4WD) vehicles, upon notice, on 12 February 2002:
(1)	How many 4WD vehicles are currently being imported into Australia.
(2)	What percentage of 4WD vehicles are used in primary production or primarily for business purposes.
(3)	How many 4WD vehicles have been imported into Australia in each of the past 5 years.
(4)	How many second-hand 4WD vehicles have been imported into Australia during each of the past 5 years.
(5)	How many of those used imported vehicles ran on: (a) diesel; (b) gas; and (c) petrol.
(6)	How many 4WD vehicles imported into Australia in the past 5 years have not attracted the luxury vehicle tariff/tax.
(7)	What was the total import tariff/tax revenue derived during the 2000-01 financial year from 4WD vehicles.
(8)	How much of that revenue is derived from the luxury vehicle tariff/tax.
(9)	What is the total import tariff/tax revenue forgone as a result of imposing only a 5 per cent instead of the 15 per cent tariff/tax which other passenger vehicles attract.
(10)	What is the projected revenue loss for the 2001-02 and 2002-03 financial years because of that discrepancy.
(11)	What is the policy justification for the differential tariff/tax rates between 4WD and passenger vehicles.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Imports: Motor Vehicles</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,20,1,question
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2002-03-12,"—The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	Vehicle import figures for the 2001 calendar year are not yet available. International merchandise trade statistics collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) show that in the year 2000 there were 83,254 new motor vehicles entered as four wheel drives or off road vehicles.
(2)	The Commonwealth does not hold figures on the primary use of four wheel drive and off road vehicles.
(3)	ABS statistics show the following numbers of new four wheel drive and off road vehicles were imported into Australia during the past five years:

*These figures do not include personal imports.
(5)	Figures are not available on the types of fuel used by second hand 4WD vehicles that have been imported into Australia.
(6)	There is no luxury vehicle tariff. However, all vehicles (including 4WD vehicles) priced over the luxury car tax threshold attract luxury car tax (LCT) in respect of the value of the vehicle in excess of the LCT threshold. The LCT threshold is the car depreciation limit that applies under Subdivision 42-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (currently $55,134). The Government does not publish figures on the numbers of four wheel drive and off road vehicles not subject to LCT. 
(7)	The Government does not publish disaggregated revenue figures from the GST or LCT. It is therefore not possible to calculate the total tax/tariff revenue derived during the 2000-01 financial year from sales of four wheel drive and off road vehicles. Estimates of tariff revenue can be derived from ABS international merchandise trade statistics, which show that the 83,254 new four wheel drive and off road vehicles entered in the year 2000 had a combined customs value of $2,194.6 million. Within this group, 70,228 vehicles were entered as goods-carrying vehicles, at a 5 per cent rate of duty, generating an estimated $95.1 million in duty revenue, based on a customs value of $1,900.9 million. The remaining 13,026 vehicles were entered as passenger motor vehicles, at a 15 per cent rate of duty, generating an estimated $44.1 million in tariff revenue, based on a customs value of $293.7 million. 
(8)	See (7).
(9)	Assuming purchase decisions and pricing were not affected, applying a rate of 15 per cent to all four wheel drive and off road vehicles entered in the year 2000 would have generated a further $190.1 million tariff revenue.
(10)	The Government does not publish forecasts of four wheel drive and off road vehicle imports. Consequently, revenue estimates for these goods for the 2001-02 and 2002-03 financial years can not be calculated.
(11)	Different import duty rates exist for motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of people and motor vehicles designed for the transport of goods. In general, vehicles designed to carry people have a tariff rate of 15 per cent, while vehicles for the carriage of goods have a 5 per cent rate of duty. Four wheel drive vehicles fit into one or the other of these categories depending on their construction. 
The tariff setting for passenger vehicles has for some time been at a different rate to that applying to goods carrying or commercial vehicles. The lower duty rate on commercial vehicles reflects the relatively high business usage of this class of vehicle and the fact that only a small percentage of Australian made vehicles fall into this category.
