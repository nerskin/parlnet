"PRESIDENT,The",N/A,2001-05-10,"â€”It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death, on 24 April 2001, of Peter Edward Nugent, a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Aston, Victoria, since 1990. I advise senators that remarks relating to Mr Nugent may be made at an appropriate opportunity when the Senate next meets in Canberra, on 22 May 2001. But at this time I ask honourable senators to stand in silence in memory of Peter.
Honourable senators thereupon stood in their places.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,"<title>Nugent, Mr Peter Edward</title>",Condolences,1,1,speech
